201412	0	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	5	5
201412	1	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we are ready to begin.	5	5
201412	2	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The first item we are going to consider is in a joint Board and FOMC meeting, so I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201412	3	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201412	4	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection, thank you.	5	5
201412	5	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to start off by calling on Simon to give us his report on market developments.	61	6
201412	6	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201412	7	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will be splitting the Desk briefing into two parts.	61	6
201412	8	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	I will discuss financial market developments and some issues related to open market operations.	61	6
201412	9	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	After questions and answers on this section, Lorie will discuss testing and some related issues with supplementary normalization tools.	61	6
201412	10	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, US economic data were generally viewed as positive and changes in financial conditions were mixed.	61	6
201412	11	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	International developments were in focus with more-accommodative policy adopted or communicated by major central banks, driven by concerns over low inflation and weak growth.	61	6
201412	12	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Low inflation concerns were amplified by sharp declines in oil prices.	61	6
201412	13	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These declines weighed on prices of risk assets linked to energy amid a broad reassessment of the possibility for structurally lower oil prices due to supply-side developments as well as ongoing global growth concerns.	61	6
201412	14	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These factors also contributed to an increase in realized and implied volatility across markets late in the intermeeting period.	61	6
201412	15	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	I thought it would be helpful to look back over the year, as price moves across some major asset classes have been meaningfully different from market expectations at the end of last year.	61	6
201412	16	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	While large errors in forecasting asset prices should be expected, the constellation of forecast errors for 2014, shown in the top-left panel, is consistent with easier monetary policy abroad than previously anticipated, a positive oil supply shock, and a relative outperformance of the US economy.	61	6
201412	17	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The size of the unexpected decline in Treasury yields is particularly striking, given that most believe the Federal Reserve is nearing the start of policy normalization around mid-2015.	61	6
201412	18	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the remainder of this exhibit, I will focus on two aspects of domestic markets:  the market-implied path of the target federal funds rate and declines in measures of longer-dated inflation compensation.	61	6
201412	19	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows the market-implied federal funds rate path.	61	6
201412	20	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Despite better-than-expected US economic data and some Federal Reserve communications that were perceived as less accommodative than anticipated, market-implied rates changed little on net over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201412	21	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Looking back further, the curve has shifted down and flattened substantially since the end of 2013 despite ongoing improvements in domestic labor market conditions and notable upward revisions in Committee participants’ SEP federal funds rate paths.	61	6
201412	22	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This has resulted in a sizable divergence between the market-implied and SEP-projected rate paths.	61	6
201412	23	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This divergence can be seen in the middle-left panel, which shows the spreads between median SEP rate projections as of the September meeting and corresponding market-implied rates.	61	6
201412	24	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These spreads widened over the course of the year, especially after the September meeting, and are around their widest levels since rate projections were added to the SEP.	61	6
201412	25	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s most recent surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the difference between the SEP median dots and the market-implied path.	61	6
201412	26	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Dealers and buy-side survey respondents generally assigned the highest importance to different outlooks for the US economy, the view that the SEP median does not represent the Committee’s forecast, and the possibility of remaining at the zero lower bound.	61	6
201412	27	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Negative term premiums and technical factors were assigned a lower importance.	61	6
201412	28	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel uses responses to a range of survey questions, along with the SEP numbers and market-implied rates, to help further identify the importance of these factors.	61	6
201412	29	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The dark blue bars represent the difference between the median SEP dot and the median of the fourth- to seventh-lowest SEP dots, which many market participants believe most closely align with the likely path of the policy rate.	61	6
201412	30	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These dark blue bars are relatively large, which suggests that a key fact in understanding the spread between the median SEP dot and the market-implied path might be that market participants do not view the median dot as representing the future path of the policy rate.	61	6
201412	31	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The light blue bars represent the difference between the median of the fourth to seventh dots and the median of Desk survey respondents’ modal path for the target rate.	61	6
201412	32	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These differences are quite small, which may indicate that market participants close to the Desk survey median have a similar view as to the outlook for the economy and its implications for the target rate as the FOMC participants underlying the median of the fourth to seventh dots.	61	6
201412	33	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The dark red bars represent the difference between the mean expectation and the modal expectation for the target rate from the Desk’s surveys, which incorporates the perceived possibility of remaining at or returning to the zero lower bound along with other downside risks.	61	6
201412	34	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In 2016 and 2017, this accounts for around 30 to 35 basis points of the difference between the median SEP dot and the market-implied rate.	61	6
201412	35	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Finally, the light red bars represent the difference between the mean of respondents’ federal funds rate probability distributions and the market-implied rate, a measure of risk premiums in futures rates.	61	6
201412	36	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	These differences are very small at earlier horizons but increase substantially in 2017 to a negative term premium of around 55 basis points.	61	6
201412	37	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In sum, this panel indicates that the spread between the median SEP forecast and the market-implied rate in 2015 and 2016 may be largely due to differences in the perception of the mapping between the SEP dots and the likely path of policy, along with downside risks to modal federal funds rate forecasts.	61	6
201412	38	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	While the more substantial divergence in 2017 might be of less concern because of the uncertainty around three- year-ahead forecasts, it does line up with the continued decline in medium- and long- dated forward rates.	61	6
201412	39	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	One explanation for this decline is an increase in the market price associated with certain types of adverse economic shocks, as described in a memo from the staff at the Minneapolis Fed.	61	6
201412	40	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The fall in forward rates has been more pronounced in nominal than real rates, producing large declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation.	61	6
201412	41	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Board staff’s measures of 5- and 10-year inflation compensation have declined roughly 25 to 30 basis points over the period.	61	6
201412	42	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Both the 5- and 10-year breakeven rates, at roughly 1.33 percent and 1.62 percent, respectively, are now at their lowest levels since the height of the euro-area crisis in mid-2010.	61	6
201412	43	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, the Board staff’s measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation, shown in the bottom-left panel, is at its lowest level since late 2008, when TIPS market liquidity was highly strained.	61	6
201412	44	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	As we noted at the previous meeting, the sharp declines in these market-based inflation measures contrasts with the relative stability of primary dealers’ longer-term inflation expectations, also shown in this panel, and with other survey-based measures.	61	6
201412	45	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	While not all market measures of forward inflation compensation are as low as the one estimated by Board staff, many of them suggest longer-dated inflation risk premiums are negative under the assumption that long forward inflation expectations remain well anchored near the FOMC’s longer-run inflation objective.	61	6
201412	46	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Amid the relative stability of survey-based inflation measures, the Desk surveys again asked respondents to decompose the decline in the market-based five-year, five- year-forward breakeven inflation rate since early September, in an attempt to capture views about sentiments underlying market pricing.	61	6
201412	47	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows that dealer and buy-side respondents, on average, attributed roughly half of the decline to lower expected CPI inflation, while the other half was attributed to changes in the inflation risk premium and other risk premiums.	61	6
201412	48	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This decomposition is similar to that for the October surveys.	61	6
201412	49	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Factors cited in the surveys as contributing to lower market inflation expectations include declines in energy prices, appreciation of the US dollar, and concerns about global growth and inflation.	61	6
201412	50	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	More marginally, some market participants have cited concerns that the Federal Reserve may tighten policy before the economy is sufficiently resilient to withstand higher interest rates.	61	6
201412	51	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Some have also suggested that the deteriorating TIPS market liquidity may be a factor behind the narrowing in breakeven inflation rates.	61	6
201412	52	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	However, Desk analysis suggests there was relatively little change in market functioning over most of the intermeeting period, though poor liquidity may have exacerbated the particularly pronounced drop in breakeven inflation rates late last week.	61	6
201412	53	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that measures of forward inflation compensation declined in other developed economies over the course of this year, though Japanese measures are little changed.	61	6
201412	54	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Forward inflation compensation declines in the United States are larger than in the euro area over the past year, which may reflect greater sensitivity of domestic inflation to declines in oil prices among other factors.	61	6
201412	55	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Low inflation, along with declining inflation expectations and weak economic growth abroad, has motivated a variety of more-accommodative monetary policy actions or communications outside of the United States.	61	6
201412	56	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This has furthered the divergence in the expected policy rate paths between the Federal Reserve and other central banks in developed countries.	61	6
201412	57	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	To encourage inflation and stimulate the economy in Japan, the BOJ unexpectedly announced an expansion of its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing, or QQE, program to limit deflationary risks, and Prime Minister Abe took steps to postpone the second planned consumption tax increase.	61	6
201412	58	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Both the size and timing of the BOJ announcement surprised market participants, leading to a sharp depreciation of the yen, increase in Japanese equity prices, and decline in 30-year Japanese government bond yields, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201412	59	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The BOJ decision coincided with an announcement from the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) indicating that it would reduce its portfolio allocation to domestic bonds and increase its allocation to equities and international fixed-income assets by more than expected.	61	6
201412	60	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Most market participants expect other Japanese pensions to follow the GPIF strategy, which could result in roughly $90 billion and $175 billion being reallocated toward US Treasury securities and US equities, respectively, over the next year.	61	6
201412	61	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Concerns over low inflation in the euro area also motivated more-accommodative communications from the ECB Governing Council.	61	6
201412	62	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	At its November meeting, the Governing Council explicitly stated its intention to increase the size of the ECB balance sheet toward early 2012 levels, which will require a roughly 1 trillion euro expansion, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201412	63	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	A subsequent speech from President Draghi bolstered expectations that the ECB will purchase sovereign bonds.	61	6
201412	64	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants continue to believe that the current suite of ECB measures is insufficient to increase the balance sheet toward early 2012 levels or sufficiently raise inflation expectations.	61	6
201412	65	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, take-up in the ECB’s recently announced targeted longer-term refinancing operations has been toward the lower end of market expectations.	61	6
201412	66	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In response, market participants have increased the probability they attach to a sovereign bond purchase program in the first quarter of next year.	61	6
201412	67	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, front-month crude oil futures prices declined around 30 percent and longer-dated oil futures prices declined 15 to 20 percent.	61	6
201412	68	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants believe that the price declines have been driven primarily by supply dynamics, particularly the recent OPEC decision to maintain current production levels amid faster-than-expected growth in US shale output.	61	6
201412	69	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, in contrast to the decline in oil prices, industrial metals prices—one potential proxy for global economic activity—have been relatively stable, suggesting that oil price declines are likely only secondarily due to demand dynamics.	61	6
201412	70	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The oil price declines are squeezing the profit margins of many US energy- related firms and contributing to a widening in the high-yield corporate credit spread index, also shown in the middle-right panel, which has a relatively high energy weighting.	61	6
201412	71	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This spread widening may also reflect recent elevated high-yield issuance and a reported increase in credit differentiation as domestic policy normalization approaches.	61	6
201412	72	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows US dollar appreciation against major developed economies and large non-dollarized oil exporting countries over the intermeeting period and year-to-date.	61	6
201412	73	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The US dollar appreciation against major developed economy currencies, shown in solid shades of blue, is largely due to diverging monetary policy expectations and growth outlooks.	61	6
201412	74	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	US dollar appreciation against large petroleum exporting countries, shown in dashed shades of blue, largely reflects the impact of lower oil prices on these local economies.	61	6
201412	75	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Russian ruble, not shown in the chart due to its extremely large moves, has depreciated significantly, especially over the past couple of days.	61	6
201412	76	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The depreciation reflects a combination of low oil prices and the effect of western sanctions and ongoing tensions in Ukraine.	61	6
201412	77	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This, along with the increased possibility of defaults on the large stock of foreign-currency-denominated corporate debt, is leading to increased financial-stability risk in Russia.	61	6
201412	78	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In response to the recent depreciation, the Russian central bank increased its main policy rate from 10.5 percent to 17 percent on Monday night.	61	6
201412	79	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The recent declines in oil prices and concerns over global growth have weighed on emerging market risk assets, as shown in the bottom-right panel, and declines in EM asset prices accelerated late in the intermeeting period.	61	6
201412	80	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, there has recently been a meteoric rise in the Shanghai Composite Index, also shown in this panel.	61	6
201412	81	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Shanghai index has risen nearly 20 percent following an interest rate cut by the PBOC in mid-November.	61	6
201412	82	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This rate cut increased market expectations for further PBOC easing amid the subdued mainland inflation prints and activity data.	61	6
201412	83	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Turning to Desk operations, negative interest rates on eligible euro-area investments continue to present challenges to the management of the SOMA euro foreign reserves portfolio.	61	6
201412	84	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The approach taken to reduce the influence of negative interest rates on the portfolio’s return has resulted in an increase in the duration of the portfolio, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61	6
201412	85	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in a memo distributed before the meeting, the Desk would like to make some changes to the euro portfolio investment strategy to better balance the tradeoff between maintaining maturity liquidity and earning interest income in a negative interest rate environment.	61	6
201412	86	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Assuming the rate structure in France and Germany doesn’t move lower, this revised investment strategy would likely allow us to keep the duration of the portfolio below the FOMC-authorized limit of 18 months.	61	6
201412	87	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	However, that 18-month limit will constrain our ability to implement the revised strategy if French and German interest rates fall further.	61	6
201412	88	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	To avoid a situation in which the current duration limit becomes a binding constraint on the investment strategy in the negative interest rate environment, we plan to recommend that the FOMC increase the duration limit from 18 to 24 months.	61	6
201412	89	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk views the reauthorization of the foreign operations at the January 2015 FOMC meeting as an opportune time to make such a change.	61	6
201412	90	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the top-right panel, with the end of the asset purchase program in October, the SOMA currently stands at just under $4.3 trillion, including about $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities and about $1.8 trillion in MBS.	61	6
201412	91	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Rollovers of Treasury securities and reinvestments of agency principal payments will maintain the par value of the portfolio at its current level until these policies are ended.	61	6
201412	92	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	For context, only about $3 billion in Treasury holdings will mature in 2015, but the staff estimates that principal paydowns on MBS and maturing agency debt will total almost $300 billion next year.	61	6
201412	93	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	MBS reinvestment operations have generally gone smoothly, although in mid-November the Desk cancelled an MBS operation due to a technical glitch.	61	6
201412	94	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The problem was subsequently resolved, and the operation was successfully completed a few days later.	61	6
201412	95	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, the Desk began trading today with the three small firms that are participating in the Mortgage Operations Counterparty Pilot Program, as part of our ongoing efforts to explore ways to broaden access to open market operations and improve operational capacity and resiliency.	61	6
201412	96	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The Desk continues to take other steps to enhance our operational readiness.	61	6
201412	97	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	We plan to conduct small-value sales of MBS early next year.	61	6
201412	98	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, with tremendous support from the management and staff at FRB Chicago, the Markets Group has replicated the infrastructure and human capital necessary to ensure the implementation of all operations, market monitoring, and associated analytical work deemed critical should the New York Fed and its staff be affected by a serious contingency event.	61	6
201412	99	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	At the previous meeting I discussed a new service the Federal Reserve could offer known as segregated balance accounts (SBAs).	61	6
201412	100	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The discussion of this service in the October minutes generated considerable interest amongst Fed watchers.	61	6
201412	101	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	As you recall, SBAs are designed to improve competition in the deposit market.	61	6
201412	102	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The mechanism through which they would improve competition is similar to, but different in important respects from, the use of RRPs.	61	6
201412	103	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants interpreted the discussion in the minutes as suggesting SBAs would receive important regulatory relief which would substantially lower the balance sheet costs of attracting funds into such accounts.	61	6
201412	104	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	As you know, such relief was not part of the plan for the service, although some other types of regulatory decisions were required for SBAs to be viable.	61	6
201412	105	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, various system changes would be required.	61	6
201412	106	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The staff currently judges that in light of the competing priorities related to normalization and the small marginal effect SBAs would likely have on interest rate control given the readiness of other tools, further work on implementing SBAs should be shelved for now.	61	6
201412	107	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This judgment is supported by the reaction to a request for feedback on continuing work on SBAs in a memo that Bill English and I sent to the Committee.	61	6
201412	108	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Madam Chair, this completes my part of the Desk briefing.	61	6
201412	109	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to answer questions before moving on to Lorie’s part.	61	6
201412	110	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62	6
201412	111	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201412	112	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201412	113	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I have a short question, and I also have a clarification which will require a longer question.	62	6
201412	114	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	On slide number 10, you have the high yield OAS.	62	6
201412	115	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And if I did my numbers right, just looking at the red line, the broad index is off 22 percent.	62	6
201412	116	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If memory serves, energy is off about 68 percent.	62	6
201412	117	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	You mentioned it’s about 18 percent of the index, I think—it’s a heavy weight.	62	6
201412	118	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I just wanted to clarify that.	62	6
201412	119	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The index altogether is off by 22 percent, and, excluding energy, it would be something around 15 or 16 percent.	62	6
201412	120	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I just want to clarify that.	62	6
201412	121	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So it’s mainly energy-driven.	62	6
201412	122	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	I’m not as good with numbers in my head as you are.	62	6
201412	123	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That sounds about right.	62	6
201412	124	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Well, you’re much better with bigger numbers than I am, but just for clarification I think that’s correct.	62	6
201412	125	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So we read about panic—which we have been warning about, Madam Chair, at this table—at least I have, for quite some time.	62	6
201412	126	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I believe we are beginning to see that, but it is heavily concentrated with marginal energy operators.	62	6
201412	127	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I think that needs to be understood, and I’m going to talk a little bit about oil during the economic go-round.	62	6
201412	128	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I just want to put that in context.	62	6
201412	129	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And then, with regard to numbers, you did send around to the research directors an excellent, very insightful memo which gives more background to your slide number 14.	62	6
201412	130	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And these are numbers I know you’re familiar with, so I just want to make sure I understand them, because you referenced them just now.	62	6
201412	131	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Okay.	62	6
201412	132	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So you just said we have $2.3 trillion in Treasuries and about $1.8 trillion in mortgage-backed securities.	62	6
201412	133	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Is that correct?	62	6
201412	134	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s $2.5 trillion in Treasuries, I thought.	62	6
201412	135	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Okay, $2.5 trillion.	62	6
201412	136	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s even better.	62	6
201412	137	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We have only about $3 billion in Treasury redemptions in 2015, so nothing to speak of—	62	6
201412	138	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s correct.	62	6
201412	139	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	—until 2016.	62	6
201412	140	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And then, in this memo, which, again, was superb as far as I’m concerned, but here is where I get into the stuff I just want to make sure I understand and my colleagues understand.	62	6
201412	141	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So we estimate paydown reinvestments from mortgage-backed securities for 2015 will be approximately $20 billion per month.	62	6
201412	142	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Maybe a little bit higher, but about that level.	62	6
201412	143	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And your memo says that’s 25 percent of gross issuance and three times net issuance.	62	6
201412	144	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Correct.	62	6
201412	145	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s as long as we keep our mortgage-backed securities at about $1.8 trillion, until we change our reinvestment policy.	62	6
201412	146	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Then, in the memo you use the prepayment speed projections of BlackRock Solutions, and we project that by August 2021, we will have an MBS portfolio of $980 billion and a 90 percent confidence band around that of $700 billion to $1.16 trillion.	62	6
201412	147	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So, in other words, we’d halve our mortgage-backed security portfolio in a period of five years.	62	6
201412	148	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The stated intention of the Committee right now is to not let these reinvestments roll off until after we have raised rates, whenever that is going to be, whenever we begin to normalize.	62	6
201412	149	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So it’s really taking five years, and, therefore, we would reduce by $900 billion over that five- year period.	62	6
201412	150	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Correct?	62	6
201412	151	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201412	152	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s the point estimate, with a lot of uncertainty around it.	62	6
201412	153	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Right.	62	6
201412	154	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But you illustrated that, and you have a 90 percent confidence band around that.	62	6
201412	155	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Then, concomitantly, on excess reserves, you noted that they will be reduced from their current level.	62	6
201412	156	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We thought at the peak it would be $2.95 trillion, but it’s $2.5 trillion, whatever the number is.	62	6
201412	157	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Where is it now?	62	6
201412	158	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It depends on the take-up in the TDF and the overnight RRP.	62	6
201412	159	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So because the $400 billion TDF rolled off, we should add probably $400 billion to that number.	62	6
201412	160	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So it’s around $2.8 trillion to $2.9 trillion.	62	6
201412	161	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Okay.	62	6
201412	162	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And we expect to reduce it to what you call the normal level of $100 billion by mid-2021.	62	6
201412	163	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So over a six-year period, we will have gone from $2.9 trillion to $100 billion in excess reserves.	62	6
201412	164	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I just want to make sure I understand the numbers.	62	6
201412	165	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s a lot.	62	6
201412	166	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201412	167	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201412	168	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I hope the Committee realizes all these numbers.	62	6
201412	169	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	This is very important to me.	62	6
201412	170	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s asking a lot.	62	6
201412	171	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	To reduce by that size over that short of a time period, it’s going to require our successors, meaning President Plosser’s and my successors, and you all and your successors, to be very artful—and I’m trying to think through, how are those excess reserves going to be reduced by 95 percent?	62	6
201412	172	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s a big number.	62	6
201412	173	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would like the Committee just to start thinking about that.	62	6
201412	174	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would urge everybody to read this research-director memo.	62	6
201412	175	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It’s one of the most enlightening documents I have read yet.	62	6
201412	176	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Simon has written a lot of enlightening documents, but this one is particularly good because it puts this all in perspective.	62	6
201412	177	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We’re talking about big swings, and I think we just need to realize the order of difficulty and the art form it is going to require to pull it off.	62	6
201412	178	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And that’s why I mentioned it to you.	62	6
201412	179	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201412	180	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62	6
201412	181	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	62	6
201412	182	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201412	183	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201412	184	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a comment on slide 4, which I thought was quite interesting.	62	6
201412	185	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would be interested in seeing this for other meetings beyond the current one.	62	6
201412	186	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would help make the point that markets are focusing on other aspects of the SEP than the median.	62	6
201412	187	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what would this chart look like if we went back to September and to June, that kind of thing?	62	6
201412	188	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	If you look at chart 3, you can see that it is really in July that this divergence starts.	62	6
201412	189	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So the chart is going to be less interesting or require us to have positive term premiums or something else to produce these results.	62	6
201412	190	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the problem I was having with understanding slide 4 is that there’s lots of different stories I can construct to explain—	62	6
201412	191	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	62	6
201412	192	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This is just one way of taking a number and splitting it up into four parts.	62	6
201412	193	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	There are many ways you could split a number into four parts.	62	6
201412	194	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	62	6
201412	195	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I thought it would be more compelling if it actually worked for other meetings beyond this one.	62	6
201412	196	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Again, what I was trying to focus on is—	62	6
201412	197	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just this divergence.	62	6
201412	198	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	—there’s this big divergence recently.	62	6
201412	199	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	And we could go back and look at the history of the fourth to seventh versus the median dot—what was definitely true and striking to me is that until recently, if I took the mean of the PDF for the federal funds rate distributions, then that lined up pretty well with the market-implied path.	62	6
201412	200	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Sometime in late September they started to move further apart, particularly for the 2017 contract and further out.	62	6
201412	201	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	62	6
201412	202	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll note, Madam Chair, just for your amusement, that the implied federal funds rate for the end of 2017 is 2 percent, which corresponds to the lowest number, I think, on the SEP, in fact.	62	6
201412	203	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	62	6
201412	204	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Not adjusting for term premiums and the other stuff.	62	6
201412	205	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No.	62	6
201412	206	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s right.	62	6
201412	207	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	But then, when you adjust it, you get back to that.	62	6
201412	208	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201412	209	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201412	210	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	My question is on exhibit 1, panels 5 and 6, which are about US inflation expectations.	62	6
201412	211	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at panel 5, and it shows that the primary dealer inflation expectation, five-year, five-year-forward, is 2.2 percent.	62	6
201412	212	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And then I look at panel 6 and it says, if I’m interpreting this correctly, that the primary dealers are saying that their expectations went down 17 basis points on expected inflation.	62	6
201412	213	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	No?	62	6
201412	214	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Is that not right?	62	6
201412	215	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This is a question that came up last time.	62	6
201412	216	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	We asked them for their view of what CPI inflation will be five years forward, over the next five years after that.	62	6
201412	217	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Then we asked them to explain what the market pricing is.	62	6
201412	218	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So we are trying to get their beliefs or understanding of what in market sentiment is driving the drop in inflation compensation.	62	6
201412	219	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201412	220	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	But, you know, panel 5 says none of the primary dealers changed any of their expectations about inflation.	62	6
201412	221	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what that light blue line says, I guess.	62	6
201412	222	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That is correct.	62	6
201412	223	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	But, nevertheless, there are other traders in the market whose expectations—so that sounds like a money-making arbitrage opportunity for primary dealers.	62	6
201412	224	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	They could go and talk to their trading desks and see if they wanted to put on such a trade.	62	6
201412	225	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It would seem that they would have to be pretty confident about the source to do that.	62	6
201412	226	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	It’s not risk-free.	62	6
201412	227	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	No, it’s far from risk-free.	62	6
201412	228	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s not a risk-free arbitrage.	62	6
201412	229	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Well, it speaks to how seriously you want to take the idea that they haven’t changed their inflation expectations.	62	6
201412	230	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	They tell you in a survey, “I haven’t changed my inflation expectations, but I’m not willing to go bet against the market.”	62	6
201412	231	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	62	6
201412	232	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	62	6
201412	233	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201412	234	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that this gets back to something that we learned during the taper tantrum—that what we mean by “market expectations” isn’t really clear.	62	6
201412	235	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	There isn’t a person who is the market who has a set of expectations.	62	6
201412	236	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	There are a bunch of diverse market participants who each have their own expectations, and you can have a situation in which the average market participant has a set of expectations, but the marginal investor has a different set of expectations.	62	6
201412	237	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	And that is something that we try to tease out with these surveys and in conversations with people and by reading newsletters.	62	6
201412	238	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	But it just is a complicated problem.	62	6
201412	239	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I think it’s a point well taken.	62	6
201412	240	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, there is a diverse set of expectations out there, but I think, from the Committee’s point of view—sometimes we look at our primary dealer survey and we say, “Well, this is kind of the authoritative judgment on whether these expectations are really changing or not.”	62	6
201412	241	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And I don’t think that’s necessarily the way that we want to interpret the data.	62	6
201412	242	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	One of the things we did is add more participants in the surveys, just to see.	62	6
201412	243	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	And you can see a slight difference in focus between the buy-side and the dealers here.	62	6
201412	244	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	But they are both pretty consistent in thinking half of this, in the market’s mind—whatever that is— has to do with a fall in inflation expectations.	62	6
201412	245	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s the same as in the October one.	62	6
201412	246	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201412	247	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201412	248	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201412	249	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m a little embarrassed to ask this question.	62	6
201412	250	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m going to blame it on the very interesting charts on the SEP dots four through seven that distracted me as I tried to extract a little bit of what that was.	62	6
201412	251	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	So I might have missed the explanation later on.	62	6
201412	252	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	You started off in chart 1 describing how the 10-year rates had gone down so much more than anybody was expecting at the beginning of the year, and I don’t quite recall the explanation offered as to why they have gone down so much.	62	6
201412	253	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I think at one point you mentioned anticipated easier monetary policy.	62	6
201412	254	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	You probably mentioned lower inflation and oil supply, weak demand was mentioned in another case.	62	6
201412	255	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Do you want to give me an executive summary of that?	62	6
201412	256	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The forecast error for the US 10-year is not that big.	62	6
201412	257	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The absolute error over the past 10 years is about 93 basis points.	62	6
201412	258	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	For the bund, I think it is more like 80 basis points, and that is consistent with thinking something will change in the euro area.	62	6
201412	259	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So one of the reasons to show this is to remind ourselves that forecasting the future is really hard, and even if we get these experts, they are going to be wrong a lot.	62	6
201412	260	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The second one is to show that there is a distinct pattern here, which is easier policy probably in Germany and Japan than people thought was going to happen at the start of the year, a big drop in the price of oil, and the US doing relatively better.	62	6
201412	261	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So if I told you everything except the top line on the list and said, “Guess where the US 10-year rate would be,” you’d probably say, “Well, I’m going to take my estimate of 3.23 percent and make it a little bit higher than that.”	62	6
201412	262	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s the part that is somewhat surprising.	62	6
201412	263	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But if I think the long-term rates are low because the world economy is not so well, it becomes—	62	6
201412	264	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Well, that’s one portion of it, yes.	62	6
201412	265	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	—a decoupling type of hypothesis.	62	6
201412	266	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure I would have—	62	6
201412	267	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So that’s one hypothesis.	62	6
201412	268	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	62	6
201412	269	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201412	270	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Simon?	62	6
201412	271	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201412	272	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let me turn to Lorie, who is going to discuss normalization-related topics.	61	6
201412	273	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201412	274	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin again on exhibit 3 with a summary of the recent testing of the term deposit facility and reverse repos, and a staff proposal to continue ON RRP testing in 2015.	61	6
201412	275	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	These items were discussed in two of the staff memos you received ahead of the meeting.	61	6
201412	276	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, the staff completed a series of eight TDF test operations that included an early withdrawal option.	61	6
201412	277	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Including an early withdrawal option allowed banks to count term deposits as HQLA for purposes of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio.	61	6
201412	278	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The first few operations in the series provided a test of the attractiveness of an early withdrawal option, as the maximum award amount and TDF rate were the same as in previous operations.	61	6
201412	279	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with the feedback from banks before the series was initiated, allotment amounts in these operations with the option increased notably.	61	6
201412	280	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Subsequent operations in the series, shown in the dark blue line in the middle-left panel, also incorporated a higher maximum award amount and incremental increases in the TDF rate.	61	6
201412	281	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Take-up in these operations rose, on average, by an increase of $35 billion per basis point in the TDF rate.	61	6
201412	282	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	More broadly, the increased participation in these operations relative to those without the early withdrawal option, shown in the light blue line, was driven by both the introduction of the early withdrawal option and the higher maximum award amounts.	61	6
201412	283	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The staff will continue to evaluate the results of the most recent series of operations in developing options for additional TDF testing next year.	61	6
201412	284	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, the Desk proceeded with testing of both term and overnight reverse repos as directed by the Committee.	61	6
201412	285	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The details of these operations are shown in the middle-right panel for your reference.	61	6
201412	286	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	So far, operations have proceeded smoothly.	61	6
201412	287	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The announcement and conduct of term RRP operations to date provide a preliminary indication that term RRPs could be an effective supplementary tool for mitigating the effects of year-end dynamics on money market rates.	61	6
201412	288	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, recent overnight RRP testing has reinforced the idea that increases in the ON RRP offering rate put upward pressure on both secured and unsecured overnight rates.	61	6
201412	289	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The coming weeks will provide a useful test of how these supplementary tools could work in combination to support interest rate control over year- and quarter-ends.	61	6
201412	290	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to the term RRP operations, the Desk conducted two of the four announced operations.	61	6
201412	291	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, counterparties placed $102 billion and $75 billion in bids in the first two operations, respectively.	61	6
201412	292	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Participants generally viewed the award rates for the two operations, which were 8 basis points and 7 basis points, respectively, as roughly equivalent to their expectations for ON RRP rates through January 5, plus a small term premium to compensate for locking up liquidity.	61	6
201412	293	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Dealers and money market funds expect the award rate to fall further as operations approach year-end.	61	6
201412	294	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Based on the operations conducted so far, some firms appear to be substituting funds that they would otherwise invest in ON RRP operations into the term operations.	61	6
201412	295	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Looking at the bottom-right panel, prime and government money funds decreased their participation in the ON RRP operations that followed each of the term operations—shown by the red bars—by an amount that was roughly similar to their allotment in the term operations, which are represented by the blue bars.	61	6
201412	296	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As a result of this substitution, the total amount of reverse repos outstanding, including both term and ON RRPs, is currently $135 billion, which is actually a bit lower than the take-up in ON RRPs just before the term operations began.	61	6
201412	297	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	While we will learn more in coming weeks, the term RRP operation results to date, combined with anecdotal reports and the relatively benign expectations for year- end stress implied by market-based measures currently, together suggest that the use of term RRP operations over year-end may moderate some of the volatility in money market rates that we observed around the September quarter-end.	61	6
201412	298	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk also completed the directed series of ON RRP operations that involved modest, pre-announced changes in the offering rate.	61	6
201412	299	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	While several other factors also affected money market rates during the testing period, the tests provided further indication that ON RRPs provide a soft floor for both secured and unsecured money market rates.	61	6
201412	300	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the increases in the ON RRP offering rate to 7 basis points and 10 basis points corresponded with increases in secured and unsecured rates, including the federal funds effective rate.	61	6
201412	301	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The distribution of rates on federal funds trades, shown in the top-right panel, also shifted higher with each increase in the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201412	302	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	For example, when the overnight RRP rate was 5 basis points, as shown in the dark blue line, less than 1 percent of brokered federal funds trades occurred below the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201412	303	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As the overnight RRP offering rate was increased to 10 basis points, the distribution shifted higher, and again only about 1 percent of trades took place below the new overnight RRP offering rate.	61	6
201412	304	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants believe that the increase in the federal funds effective rate during the testing period was primarily due to increased bargaining power by FHLBs.	61	6
201412	305	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Moreover, it does not appear as if FHLBs had to change their behavior meaningfully in order to obtain higher rates.	61	6
201412	306	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Participation by FHLBs in overnight RRP operations—the dark blue line in the middle-left panel—was largely unchanged during the testing period.	61	6
201412	307	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	More broadly, federal funds trading volumes—the red line in the same panel—also remained stable.	61	6
201412	308	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Stable federal funds volumes alongside a higher federal funds effective rate could also indicate that foreign banking organizations are still willing to participate in IOER arbitrage at a spread to the IOER rate that is narrower than its level prior to the changes in the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201412	309	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that balance sheet costs may not be the primary factor currently affecting the rate at which FBOs borrow federal funds outside of key financial reporting dates.	61	6
201412	310	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Imperfect competition among banks may also play a role in determining the rates at which they borrow funds in order to conduct IOER arbitrage.	61	6
201412	311	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Secured rates, including the triparty repo rates, shown in the middle-right panel, also shifted up in response to the move in the overnight RRP rate.	61	6
201412	312	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	This rise in rates partially reflected the increased bargaining power of a broader set of cash lenders.	61	6
201412	313	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	However, other factors, such as changes in collateral supply and GSE cash management needs, also reportedly put upward pressure on repo rates, particularly early in the testing period when the overnight RRP rate was 5 basis points.	61	6
201412	314	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	While these changes to the overnight RRP rate have been informative, additional testing of overnight RRPs could further improve our understanding of this supplementary tool.	61	6
201412	315	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As outlined in the bottom-left panel, the staff recommends extending overnight RRP testing through January 2016.	61	6
201412	316	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Doing so would provide continuity in the usage of the tool, particularly given investors’ reported emphasis on developing relationships so as to ensure ongoing access to their counterparties’ balance sheets.	61	6
201412	317	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	If the operations were to cease in January, it is possible that, at the beginning of normalization, frictions in reestablishing these relationships could temporarily hamper the efficacy of an overnight RRP facility.	61	6
201412	318	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, ending overnight RRP testing could be read by some investors as suggesting that normalization remains a longer way off or that the Committee might be reconsidering the use of overnight RRPs during normalization.	61	6
201412	319	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Further, since we have conducted relatively few operations at rates above 5 basis points, it may be instructive to continue testing the tool at overnight rates between 5 and 10 basis points to learn more about the size and durability of the resulting market effects, or to test at even higher rates to see if similar effects hold.	61	6
201412	320	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	For these reasons, along with the continued benefits of promoting operational readiness, we recommend extending the overnight RRP exercise for another year.	61	6
201412	321	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed in the revised memo sent to the Committee on Friday, we would like to do so at this meeting, since the current resolution expires only two days after the January 2015 FOMC meeting.	61	6
201412	322	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	The draft resolution is in a separate handout titled “Overnight Reverse Repurchase Resolution.”2  Apart from the change in the terminal date, the draft resolution reflects minor wording changes from the resolution adopted by the Committee at its September 2014 meeting, and maintains the 0 to 5 basis point range in the overnight RRP offering rate.	61	6
201412	323	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	If the change in the resolution is approved, the FOMC minutes would inform the public of the extension.	61	6
201412	324	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, if the change is approved, the staff will recommend some additional tests at upcoming meetings, after we have had a chance to fully assess the results of the current tests.	61	6
201412	325	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, as discussed at the October meeting, the Desk reopened the overnight RRP counterparty process for firms meeting the existing eligibility requirements, and we wanted to provide a brief update on the results.	61	6
201412	326	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, 25 eligible firms submitted applications, including 12 money market funds, 7 banks, 5 FHLBs, and Farmer Mac.	61	6
201412	327	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	If the legal, credit, and compliance assessments of all applicants prove satisfactory, the total number of expanded RRP counterparties will increase to 142.	61	6
201412	328	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	This number incorporates the fact that we had one firm withdraw as a counterparty during the intermeeting period.	61	6
201412	329	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	It was a fairly idiosyncratic circumstance that prompted the withdrawal and is unlikely to be an indication of a broader trend.	61	6
201412	330	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	We plan to announce the new set of counterparties in mid-January and begin operating with them shortly thereafter.	61	6
201412	331	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201412	332	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201412	333	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201412	334	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Lorie?	62	6
201412	335	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	62	6
201412	336	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Lorie, I know you revised the memo, and I still don’t fully understand why we need to extend the resolutions for the testing until January 2016.	62	6
201412	337	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I think it could be confusing because we are thinking about lifting off in that time period, and I’m just wondering whether it might be better to do a sequence of resolutions so that we don’t confuse markets about what our intention is with liftoff.	62	6
201412	338	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Can you explain that a little bit more for me?	62	6
201412	339	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	I think certainly another option could be to vote at each meeting or to move this decision into the directive.	62	6
201412	340	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	We thought that keeping it as a testing operation and doing it for a year was the most neutral way to proceed.	62	6
201412	341	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	That’s what we had done previously, and we thought that the market would be less likely to read any policy intent with that plan.	62	6
201412	342	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	But there are certainly other avenues you could take.	62	6
201412	343	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the calculus we went through was to start by saying, gee, if it really seemed like we wanted to lift off, and if things go as expected until midyear, maybe you just extend it until midyear.	62	6
201412	344	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	But then it kind of does look like maybe you’re signaling something about the timing of liftoff.	62	6
201412	345	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	So we thought by just making it a calendar year, that makes it seem basically mechanical.	62	6
201412	346	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re just extending this thing for a year, and we can say, if asked, “Of course this is a tool we’re going to use during normalization.”	62	6
201412	347	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Whenever normalization happens, we’ll be changing the terms on which we’re going to be doing overnight RRP, but—	62	6
201412	348	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Could you write the resolution that says we’ll do this until liftoff or through January 2016?	62	6
201412	349	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s probably not consistent with the testing rationale we’re trying to put in there.	62	6
201412	350	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	This is just to give the authority to the Desk to continue the tests.	62	6
201412	351	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Your suggestion has a little bit of policy content in it.	62	6
201412	352	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Because what does it mean, “until” in that sense.	62	6
201412	353	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201412	354	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, let me follow up on President Mester’s suggestion, that perhaps we could just say the resolution does not have an end date at all and simply allow for testing until such time as the Committee deems that testing is no longer required.	62	6
201412	355	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	We thought about that, too.	62	6
201412	356	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	But we remembered that there were some around this table who were worried about giving the idea that overnight RRP is forever.	62	6
201412	357	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s true.	62	6
201412	358	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	So we thought that having an end date was actually useful for at least some of you to be comfortable with this.	62	6
201412	359	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	So we wanted to have an end date.	62	6
201412	360	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Bill, do you think we’re migrating toward making this a permanent tool?	62	6
201412	361	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	No, I don’t think so.	62	6
201412	362	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans document was very clear that this would be as small as possible during normalization and will be wound down as soon as it’s not needed.	62	6
201412	363	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Yes.	62	6
201412	364	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62	6
201412	365	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201412	366	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	There’s always some risk of people inferring a signal when one is not intended, but I think the way that Bill and Lorie and Simon have phrased this, it does seem sort of mechanical, number one.	62	6
201412	367	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, number two, it’s coming out at the same time as the SEP, and I don’t think there’s going to be much confusion on markets’ part that somehow the 2016 test date is overriding the SEP.	62	6
201412	368	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	So I think it’s probably a good time to do it precisely for that reason.	62	6
201412	369	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	I agree with that sentiment, and I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood that this wouldn’t be announced until the minutes are released.	62	6
201412	370	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Right, but the SEP would already—	62	6
201412	371	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The SEP would be there and you’d have to extend the discussion.	62	6
201412	372	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	That’s right.	62	6
201412	373	2014-12-17	meeting	LOGAN	I just wanted to make sure.	62	6
201412	374	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The action would have been taken at the same meeting as the SEP.	62	6
201412	375	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions or comments for Lorie?	62	6
201412	376	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201412	377	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201412	378	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If not, we’ll need to vote on the resolution to permit continued testing of overnight RRP agreements.	62	6
201412	379	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	62	6
201412	380	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	62	6
201412	381	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62	6
201412	382	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	62	6
201412	383	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	62	6
201412	384	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	62	6
201412	385	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201412	386	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, that passes.	62	6
201412	387	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And then we will also need to ratify open market operations for the System Open Market Account since the October meeting.	62	6
201412	388	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	62	6
201412	389	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	62	6
201412	390	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	62	6
201412	391	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	62	6
201412	392	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	62	6
201412	393	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201412	394	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, great.	62	6
201412	395	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	What would happen if we didn’t ratify?	62	6
201412	396	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think Simon would be in very deep trouble.	62	6
201412	397	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	62	6
201412	398	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let me say at this point our Board meeting is over, and we’re back to an FOMC meeting only.	62	6
201412	399	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And now we’ll continue with the chart show on the economic and financial situation.	11	1
201412	400	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn things over to John Stevens.	11	1
201412	401	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201412	402	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	I will be referring to the handout titled “Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11	1
201412	403	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The first exhibit summarizes recent information on the labor market.	11	1
201412	404	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The two employment reports that we have received since the October meeting were stronger than we had expected.	11	1
201412	405	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in panel 1, payroll employment gains averaged 278,000 per month over the past three months, 44,000 more per month than we had projected in the October Tealbook.	11	1
201412	406	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	In response, we have marked up our payroll forecast to 250,000 in December and 220,000 per month in the first quarter.	11	1
201412	407	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The unemployment rate, plotted in panel 2, held steady at 5.8 percent in November but has fallen more than 1 percentage point over the past 12 months and, by our estimation, is currently about ½ percentage point above its natural rate.	11	1
201412	408	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We expect the unemployment rate to edge down in December and to average 5.5 percent in the first quarter.	11	1
201412	409	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The middle panels display two labor market indicators that, in our judgment, point to some recent improvement but also suggest more slack than is indicated by the unemployment rate.	11	1
201412	410	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in panel 3, the labor force participation rate (the black line) is below both the staff’s estimate of its trend (the green line) and the level predicted by a simple regression of the participation rate on the current and lagged values of the output gap (the red line).	11	1
201412	411	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Similarly, panel 4 indicates that the share of workers reporting that they are working part time for economic reasons remains considerably above the level we might expect given the output gap.	11	1
201412	412	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Other labor market indicators also suggest that conditions are continuing to improve.	11	1
201412	413	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown by the black line in panel 5, the rate of job openings in the JOLTS has risen sharply this year.	11	1
201412	414	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Meanwhile, both the hiring rate (the red line) and the quits rate (the blue line) have moved up as well.	11	1
201412	415	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Panel 6 provides results from a recent inquiry conducted by the Reserve Banks about the hiring plans of their business contacts.	11	1
201412	416	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As noted on the first row of the table, the average share of firms planning to increase hiring over the next 12 months moved up to 52 percent, the highest reading since we started asking this question several years ago.	11	1
201412	417	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Among firms planning to increase hiring, more than one-fourth plan to raise starting pay to help with recruiting, a noticeably higher share than in early 2013.	11	1
201412	418	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The reported willingness to raise starting pay may, as shown in the last line of the table, reflect increases in the share of firms reporting difficulties finding workers with the required skills.	11	1
201412	419	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As noted in a box in the Tealbook, “Indicators of Labor Shortages,” other evidence also points to increasing instances of skill shortages, but the extent to which such shortages are restraining hiring and production appears to be about in line with what one would expect given measures of labor market and product market slack.	11	1
201412	420	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The next exhibit summarizes other recent economic developments and provides an update to our near-term GDP forecast based on information received after we closed the Tealbook projection.	11	1
201412	421	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in the inset box in panel 1, the PCE- relevant portion of retail sales for November was stronger than we had expected, and the gains for earlier months were revised up.	11	1
201412	422	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	In addition, households’ consumption of health-care services during the third quarter looks set to be revised up as well.	11	1
201412	423	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	All told, as shown by the blue bars, we now estimate that real PCE rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the third quarter and forecast that it will increase about 4 percent this quarter.	11	1
201412	424	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The projected pickup this quarter reflects the stronger retail sales data, higher-than-expected motor vehicle sales, and a rebound in energy services spending, which had been held down in the third quarter by unusually cool summer weather.	11	1
201412	425	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We continue to expect real PCE to increase about 3½ percent in the first quarter, supported by ongoing improvements in employment, household wealth, and consumer sentiment, as well as by the boost to real incomes from the drop in energy prices.	11	1
201412	426	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	In the housing market, panel 2, this morning’s data on single-family starts (the red lines) edged down, and adjusted permits (the black lines) were about unchanged.	11	1
201412	427	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	On net, the data we have received over the past few months have continued to disappoint and are consistent with only gradual increases in housing construction over the near term.	11	1
201412	428	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Nonetheless, we remain steadfast in our assessment that the current low level of construction activity will not be sustained as the strengthening job market and diminishing concerns about the economic outlook eventually fuel a recovery in household formation that will boost the demand for new housing.	11	1
201412	429	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in panel 3, shipments of nondefense capital goods (the black line) were little changed, on net, over the past three months, while orders (the red line) declined.	11	1
201412	430	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	However, with orders running above shipments, we continue to expect investment in equipment and intangibles to rise modestly in the near term.	11	1
201412	431	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in the inset box in panel 4, mining output was little changed in November and is projected to increase at an average annual rate of only 2½ percent in the fourth and first quarters after having risen at a 13 percent pace during the preceding three quarters.	11	1
201412	432	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	This sharp deceleration reflects slower gains in oil and gas extraction and a projected decline in drilling activity.	11	1
201412	433	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Manufacturing production jumped more than 1 percent in November, which was stronger than we had been anticipating, and we now expect manufacturing output to increase at a robust average pace of more than 5 percent per quarter in the fourth and first quarters.	11	1
201412	434	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	These projected gains are consistent both with a step-up in automakers’ assembly schedules in the first quarter (not shown) and with the new orders diffusion indexes plotted in panel 5.	11	1
201412	435	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Although the range of readings on new orders in November was unusually wide, all of the indexes were in positive territory, and the central tendency of these indexes points to solid increases in production over the next few months.	11	1
201412	436	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As indicated on line 1 of panel 6, after folding in the recent information for PCE received following the close of the Tealbook projection, we now estimate that real GDP increased at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the third quarter and that growth will step down to an average pace of 2½ percent this quarter and next.	11	1
201412	437	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Relative to the December Tealbook, line 2, this forecast is about ½ percentage point higher in the third and fourth quarters but little revised in the first quarter.	11	1
201412	438	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The step-down in growth this quarter continues to largely reflect a swing in the contributions from net exports and from federal defense spending.	11	1
201412	439	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Excluding these volatile spending categories, the rate of increase in private domestic final purchases (PDFP), line 4, averages about 3½ percent throughout the near term and does not show the slowdown from the third quarter that we see for real GDP.	11	1
201412	440	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Exhibit 3 describes our medium-term forecast and, for a longer perspective, reviews how that forecast has changed from one year ago.	11	1
201412	441	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in panel 1, our current Tealbook projection is for real GDP growth (the black line) to average 2½ percent per year from 2015 to 2017.	11	1
201412	442	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Compared with our forecast from this time last year (the red dashed line), this projection is about ¾ percentage point weaker per year on average.	11	1
201412	443	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	At the same time, as shown in panel 2, the unemployment rate fell more rapidly over the past year than we had projected in December 2013, and we have marked down the projected path.	11	1
201412	444	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	This change, in an environment of still relatively lackluster GDP growth, led us to mark down our estimates of potential output growth.	11	1
201412	445	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Indeed, as shown in panel 3, the growth of potential in the current Tealbook (the red bars) is projected to be noticeably slower than in last December’s Tealbook (the gray bars).	11	1
201412	446	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Accordingly, the path for the real GDP gap (panel 4) is narrower than it was a year ago, and we currently expect it to close in mid-2016, a little later than the unemployment rate gap, reflecting the additional cyclical slack that we judge to be present in the labor force participation rate.	11	1
201412	447	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown in panel 5, an important negative influence on the GDP projection relative to last December has been the sharply higher path over the past year for the real exchange value of the dollar.	11	1
201412	448	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	In addition, a weaker outlook for foreign growth (not shown) also holds down our projection, while oil prices and equity prices have become more supportive.	11	1
201412	449	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	All told, with an unchanged projection for inflation (which I will discuss in a moment) and a little tighter resource utilization, one might expect the path for the federal funds rate—shown in panel 6—to be higher than it was a year ago.	11	1
201412	450	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	However, we also made a small reduction in our estimate of the equilibrium real interest rate, which left our projection for the federal funds rate essentially unrevised.	11	1
201412	451	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Our inflation projection is described in the next exhibit.	11	1
201412	452	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown on line 3 of panel 1, we expect core PCE prices to rise at an annual rate of 1½ percent this quarter.	11	1
201412	453	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	This forecast is somewhat higher than in the October Tealbook, reflecting surprises in the price data for October in some volatile categories, particularly the non-market- based component of the index, from which we take little signal for near-term inflation.	11	1
201412	454	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We expect core inflation to remain at 1½ percent in the first quarter, unrevised from the October Tealbook.	11	1
201412	455	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Overall PCE prices, line 1, are projected to be about unchanged in the fourth quarter and to decline around ½ percent in the first quarter, reflecting the recent and expected declines in consumer energy prices.	11	1
201412	456	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We will provide you with an update to this forecast tomorrow morning after we receive the consumer price index for November.	11	1
201412	457	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As shown by the blue lines in panel 2, crude oil prices have continued to move down since the previous meeting.	11	1
201412	458	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Consistent with readings from futures markets, we expect the decline in crude oil prices to stop around the turn of the year and that oil prices will drift up gradually thereafter.	11	1
201412	459	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The path for retail gasoline prices—the black lines—has revised in a similar fashion, but because of the usual lag between changes in oil and gasoline prices, we do not expect retail gasoline prices to stop declining until sometime in the first quarter.	11	1
201412	460	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Recent readings on inflation compensation and expectations, panel 3, have been mixed.	11	1
201412	461	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The SPF measure of 10-year PCE price expectations (the blue dashed line) was unchanged in the fourth quarter, and the preliminary reading on longer-term inflation expectations in December from the Michigan survey (the black line) moved back into the narrow range that has prevailed in recent years after an unusually low reading in November.	11	1
201412	462	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	TIPS-based inflation compensation 5-to-10 years ahead (the red line) has declined noticeably, although staff models suggest that much of the decline likely reflected changes in term and liquidity premiums.	11	1
201412	463	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The black lines in panels 4 and 5 give our medium-term projections for total and core PCE price inflation, and the red dashed lines show our projections last December.	11	1
201412	464	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As can be seen, our forecasts for inflation have generally revised little over the past year apart from the recent energy-related drop in headline inflation.	11	1
201412	465	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	All told, we expect core PCE inflation of 1.5 percent in 2015, 1.6 percent in 2016, and 1.8 percent in 2017.	11	1
201412	466	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	As energy prices stabilize, total PCE inflation moves back closer to core inflation in the second quarter of 2015.	11	1
201412	467	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Panel 6 summarizes recent indicators of labor compensation.	11	1
201412	468	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	These indicators have been mixed recently but generally continue to point to gains over the past year in the vicinity of 2 percent.	11	1
201412	469	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	The employment cost index—the black line—last quarter posted its largest four-quarter change in several years, but the volatile measure of hourly compensation in the business sector—the blue line—was weaker than we had expected last quarter.	11	1
201412	470	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Finally, average hourly earnings—the red line—were, on net, about as expected in October and November.	11	1
201412	471	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	On balance, we view the recent gains in compensation as modest, and we continue to expect a gradual acceleration in labor compensation over the next few years as the labor market tightens further.	11	1
201412	472	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	Chris Erceg will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201412	473	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	As indicated in line 1 of the table in exhibit 5, foreign GDP growth appears to have been quite subdued in the second half of the year and well below what we were projecting at the time of your last chart show in June.	11	1
201412	474	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We expect that foreign growth will pick up next year and remain just above 3 percent over the forecast period.	11	1
201412	475	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	This outlook is little changed from our projection six months ago.	11	1
201412	476	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Although the underlying momentum of the foreign economy is weaker, several factors—in part engendered by this weakness—should boost growth in the period ahead:  greater monetary policy stimulus, substantial currency depreciation—panel 2—and the dramatic fall in oil prices since midsummer.	11	1
201412	477	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	These factors also have important consequences for the US economy, as I will examine later in my briefing.	11	1
201412	478	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	A good deal of the current weakness and forecast uncertainty is centered in the euro area and Japan.	11	1
201412	479	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Euro-area GDP, line 3, is currently rising at a less than 1 percent pace, consistent with the declines in PMIs shown in panel 3, and we have growth picking up only gradually.	11	1
201412	480	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Monetary policy stimulus measures announced this year—including the targeted longer-term refinancing operations, or TLTRO, in June and the September commitment to employ asset purchases to expand the balance sheet to 2012 levels—have helped push down bond yields and the euro.	11	1
201412	481	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Given the usual lags in monetary transmission, we project that the effects of these measures will become more apparent next year:  We estimate that they will boost euro-area GDP growth by nearly ½ percentage point on average in 2015 and 2016, when the stimulus from a lower euro is factored in.	11	1
201412	482	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	This estimate assumes that the ECB will announce additional asset purchases in January amounting to 200 billion euros.	11	1
201412	483	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The ECB is currently considering more-aggressive measures, but we have not yet built these into our baseline outlook.	11	1
201412	484	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	In addition to the stimulus from monetary easing and a weaker currency, we also see euro-area GDP as getting a significant boost from lower oil prices and waning fiscal and financial headwinds.	11	1
201412	485	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Japan, line 4, will also be happy to celebrate the end of 2014.	11	1
201412	486	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Although we expect Japan to move out of recession in the fourth quarter, GDP is likely to have flatlined in the second half of the year.	11	1
201412	487	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Due to the potent effect of the April VAT tax hike on domestic demand—consumption, panel 5, remains below its level prior to the start of “Abenomics”—the second installment of the tax hike was deferred until the spring of 2017.	11	1
201412	488	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Amid growing concern that the weak economy was undermining progress in boosting inflation to 2 percent, the BOJ decided in late October to step up its pace of JGB purchases under its Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing Program, QQE—to about 16 percent of GDP at an annual rate, panel 6—and the government pension fund simultaneously announced a large shift in its portfolio holdings toward domestic and foreign equity.	11	1
201412	489	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We see GDP growth picking up next year as the lower yen boosts exports and as increased monetary accommodation feeds through to domestic demand.	11	1
201412	490	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Turning to your next exhibit, real GDP growth in the EMEs in the third and fourth quarters looks to be well below what we projected in June.	11	1
201412	491	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The weakness is concentrated in Latin America.	11	1
201412	492	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	GDP growth in Mexico, line 2, was a dismal 2 percent in the third quarter, although most recent indicators—including manufacturing PMIs, panel 2—suggest greater underlying strength, and we see growth recovering to nearly 3½ percent next year.	11	1
201412	493	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	By contrast, we are much less optimistic about Brazil.	11	1
201412	494	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Brazil’s overly expansive policies following the global financial crisis have led to persistently high inflation, panel 3.	11	1
201412	495	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	With monetary and fiscal policy likely to be tight, Brazil’s growth prospects will depend on its ability to implement structural reforms and rebuild confidence.	11	1
201412	496	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Skipping halfway across the globe, real GDP growth in China, line 4 of the table, appears to have moderated a bit from its robust third-quarter pace.	11	1
201412	497	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Falling property prices this year, panel 4, have contributed to some slowing in residential investment from its previous very rapid pace, and recent indicators suggest some deceleration in manufacturing.	11	1
201412	498	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Even so, China’s slowdown appears to be in line with what we have been expecting for some time, and retail sales, panel 5, remain reasonably strong.	11	1
201412	499	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We expect that policy stimulus—including increased lending to the banking sector by the PBOC as well as steps to support the property sector—will allow GDP growth to continue to top 7 percent.	11	1
201412	500	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Of course, there are many downside risks, especially given the weakness in property markets.	11	1
201412	501	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	While I have already indicated that we see lower oil prices as likely to boost growth in oil-importing economies, your next exhibit provides a closer look at how the large fall in oil prices since June, panel 1, has affected the outlook.	11	1
201412	502	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	As best as we can tell, most of the decline reflects favorable supply surprises, including to US and Libyan oil production, and from OPEC’s decision to not curtail production.	11	1
201412	503	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Even so, slow growth in the global economy has also played an important role.	11	1
201412	504	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	A fall in the price of oil affects net oil importers, such as the United States, through several channels (panel 2).	11	1
201412	505	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	First, by reducing transfers to oil exporters, a lower oil price effectively acts as a tax cut to oil-importing countries.	11	1
201412	506	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Second, lower oil prices raise potential output both through boosting oil usage in production and through capital deepening.	11	1
201412	507	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Of course, for major energy producers such as the United States, this effect will be partly offset by lower oil production.	11	1
201412	508	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Third, lower oil prices reduce inflation.	11	1
201412	509	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Finally, the output response depends on monetary policy.	11	1
201412	510	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Although oil-importing economies should benefit from declining oil prices, observers have raised concerns that these declines may exacerbate disinflationary pressures and potentially even harm the economy.	11	1
201412	511	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Such a risk seems particularly relevant for the euro area and Japan.	11	1
201412	512	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	To explore this possibility, we used the staff’s general-equilibrium, perfect-foresight SIGMA model to gauge the effect of a 20 percent permanent decline in the oil price—caused by a favorable supply shock— from its current level.	11	1
201412	513	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The responses we will report later for the United States differ somewhat from those of the staff’s judgmental assessment, which is based on the FRB/US model.	11	1
201412	514	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The middle panels show the response of euro-area GDP growth, headline inflation, and the policy rate, while the bottom panels show the corresponding variables for the United States.	11	1
201412	515	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	A key difference between the two economies is that our baseline assumes that liftoff of the policy rate occurs in the second quarter of 2015 in the United States, but not until early 2018 in the euro area.	11	1
201412	516	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	If inflation expectations are anchored, as we assume in our baseline projections, the shock has fairly similar effects in the euro area and the United States.	11	1
201412	517	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Real GDP growth in this scenario—the red dashed lines in panels 3a and 4a—rises persistently above baseline—the solid black lines.	11	1
201412	518	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Total inflation, panels 3b and 4b, falls because of the relatively direct effect of lower oil prices and because core inflation falls a little as the lower oil prices reduce cost pressures.	11	1
201412	519	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Because inflation and output move in opposite directions, monetary policy is little affected in either economy.	11	1
201412	520	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We next consider the effects of the same 20 percent decline in oil prices in a scenario in which inflation expectations are not fully anchored and decline as actual inflation falls.	11	1
201412	521	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The decline in inflation expectations has very adverse effects on the euro area.	11	1
201412	522	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Given that the zero bound is expected to bind for a very long time even in the baseline, real interest rates rise substantially and cause euro-area GDP growth to fall below baseline, the green line in panel 3a.	11	1
201412	523	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	By contrast, US GDP in this case— the green line in panel 4a—is very similar to when inflation expectations are anchored, reflecting that monetary policy, panel 4c, cushions the shock by simply lifting off more slowly.	11	1
201412	524	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	To sum up, the fall in oil prices this year is likely to be a net positive for the global economy.	11	1
201412	525	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	However, for economies in which disinflation has been acute and the stability of inflation expectations is uncertain, lower oil prices pose some special challenges.	11	1
201412	526	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Your next exhibit considers how the dollar’s sharp appreciation since June is expected to affect the US economy.	11	1
201412	527	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Our forecast for the path of the dollar over the next two years, panel 1, is about 7 percent higher than we projected in June.	11	1
201412	528	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	On the one hand, we expect the dollar to appreciate a bit further against the AFE currencies, panel 2, as markets are surprised by a modestly faster removal of US policy accommodation than they seem to envision.	11	1
201412	529	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	On the other hand, we continue to project that the dollar will depreciate against the EME currencies, panel 3, as the Asian economies, especially China, rebalance toward domestic demand.	11	1
201412	530	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The stronger path for the dollar and modest weakening of the outlook for foreign growth are likely to translate into much weaker US export growth.	11	1
201412	531	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We now expect export growth, the blue bars in panel 4, to average only about 2 to 3 percent in 2015 and 2016, about half the pace we projected in June (the red bars).	11	1
201412	532	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Our forecast for import growth is only a tad higher than in June, as the effects of the stronger dollar are partly counterbalanced by downward revisions to the US outlook.	11	1
201412	533	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	All told, as shown in panel 6, we estimate that real net exports will make a contribution to US GDP growth of about minus 0.4 percentage point in both 2015 and 2016, in sharp contrast to the roughly neutral contribution we had expected in June.	11	1
201412	534	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Most of the revision in the net export contribution is due to the stronger dollar.	11	1
201412	535	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Your next exhibit examines the external sector of the US economy during three previous episodes of monetary tightening—those beginning in 1994, 1999, and 2004 —and compares them with our forecast for 2015.	11	1
201412	536	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The dashed vertical lines show the quarter in which a monetary policy tightening sequence began, while the shaded blue regions extend one year before and after this date.	11	1
201412	537	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Two interesting features are apparent from these episodes.	11	1
201412	538	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	First, the broad real dollar, panel 1, shows no tendency to rise during or shortly before past monetary tightenings and, in fact, depreciated substantially around the 2004 episode.	11	1
201412	539	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Second, US exports, panel 2, also grew robustly during each of these tightening episodes.	11	1
201412	540	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Thus, the dollar’s recent sharp appreciation appears a bit unusual and helps account for our forecast of relatively weak export growth in this current episode—the far-right shaded bar in panel 2.	11	1
201412	541	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Even so, the positive gap between foreign and US GDP growth over the forecast period, panel 3, provides some comfort for our forecast that the dollar will not appreciate a good deal more.	11	1
201412	542	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Moreover, the relatively modest gap between expected US and foreign policy rates—panel 4—at least seems consistent with limited upward pressure on the dollar.	11	1
201412	543	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	All told, we do not see our projection for the dollar and US external performance as being markedly at variance with the record of past Fed tightening.	11	1
201412	544	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Export growth is likely to be noticeably weaker but still positive.	11	1
201412	545	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Nonetheless, turning to exhibit 6, overall foreign growth is considerably weaker than in past monetary tightening, and there are serious downside risks in Europe, China, and many other EMEs that—if they materialize—could weigh heavily on the dollar and the US external sector.	11	1
201412	546	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	To judge the impact if these risks materialize and, thus, to conclude this briefing on a perky note, I revisit the SIGMA simulation that was featured in the December Tealbook.	11	1
201412	547	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The scenario assumes that total foreign GDP growth weakens by 1 percentage point over the forecast period per year, and that the broad dollar appreciates 10 percent relative to its baseline path.	11	1
201412	548	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Our scenario suggests that such a weakening would push US GDP growth well below 2 percent next year and core inflation below 1 percent.	11	1
201412	549	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I will now turn it over to Beth.	11	1
201412	550	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Thank you.	11	1
201412	551	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201412	552	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 1 shows the broad trajectories of your forecasts under your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201412	553	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top panel, you project slower growth this year than in 2013, and all but one of you see a pickup in GDP growth next year, with most of you anticipating real growth moving back toward its longer-run pace over 2016 and 2017.	11	1
201412	554	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Most of you project that the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, will decline through 2016, and all of you project that, by the fourth quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate will be at or below your individual judgments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	11	1
201412	555	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	The bottom two panels indicate that all of you see inflation rising gradually on balance over the forecast period, with only two of you expecting inflation above the Committee’s 2 percent goal in 2017.	11	1
201412	556	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Notably, your views on headline inflation in 2015 span a range from 1 to 2.2 percent.	11	1
201412	557	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the September Summary of Economic Projections and the December Tealbook.	11	1
201412	558	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As reflected in the top panel, in general, the revisions to your forecasts for real GDP growth were modest.	11	1
201412	559	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Although all of you revised up your projections for the second half of this year (not shown), the central tendencies of your projections for subsequent years were essentially unchanged.	11	1
201412	560	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the second panel, the central tendencies of your forecasts for the unemployment rate shifted down by roughly two-tenths each year through 2016, with many of you noting that recent data regarding labor market conditions shaped your revisions.	11	1
201412	561	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Notably, six of you lowered your projections for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, narrowing the range to 5.0 to 5.8 percent, although the central tendency was unchanged at 5.2 to 5.5 percent.	11	1
201412	562	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As the bottom panels indicate, nearly all of you marked down your projections for headline PCE inflation this year and next, although most of your projections for 2016 and 2017 were little changed.	11	1
201412	563	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	A majority of you revised down a bit your projections for near-term core inflation as well.	11	1
201412	564	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Many of you pointed to the recent substantial decline in energy prices as a reason for your downward revisions.	11	1
201412	565	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	The Tealbook forecast for economic growth is generally near the bottom of your central tendencies over the projection period, and the staff’s projections for the unemployment rate are about at the lower end of your central tendencies over the period.	11	1
201412	566	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Similarly, for headline and core inflation, the Tealbook projections are generally near the bottom of your central tendencies throughout the projection period.	11	1
201412	567	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the year and quarter in which you currently judge that economic conditions will make it appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds rate and the economic conditions you anticipate at that time.	11	1
201412	568	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top panel, a substantial majority of you view the first half of 2015 as the most likely time of liftoff, with five of you projecting liftoff in the first quarter and seven in the second quarter.	11	1
201412	569	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Two of you anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise rates for the first time in 2016.	11	1
201412	570	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	The bottom panel plots your views on the unemployment rate and core inflation in the quarter of liftoff.	11	1
201412	571	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	(Comparable scatterplots in previous briefings have employed headline inflation instead of core, but given the large transitory effects on inflation from changes in energy prices, core inflation seems more useful in this case.)  As shown in the plot, your projections for the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff range mostly between 5.3 and 5.7 percent, while your core inflation projections are mostly clustered between 1½ and 1¾ percent.	11	1
201412	572	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	All but two of you project that the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff will still be above its longer-run normal level, and all but one of you project that core inflation will be below the Committee’s longer-run objective for headline inflation of 2 percent.	11	1
201412	573	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Exhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201412	574	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	The median assessment of the appropriate funds rate path now stands at 1.13 percent at the end of 2015, 2.5 percent at the end of 2016, and 3.63 percent at the end of 2017.	11	1
201412	575	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Eight of you revised down your view of the appropriate funds rate in 2015 and 2016, with the median federal funds rate down 25 basis points in 2015 and 38 basis points in 2016.	11	1
201412	576	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Many of you noted that increases to the federal funds rate would likely be gradual, and almost all currently anticipate that it will likely be appropriate to increase the target range at a pace no greater than 25 basis points per meeting in the year of liftoff.	11	1
201412	577	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	A couple of you noted that the uncertain effects of rate increases on financial markets suggested that a relatively slow pace of rate hikes would be preferable.	11	1
201412	578	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	In addition, a few of you specifically noted that the inflation outlook indicated that a slow pace of tightening would be appropriate.	11	1
201412	579	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	All of you project levels of the federal funds rate over the next couple of years that are below the prescriptions of a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule given your economic projections.	11	1
201412	580	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	However, the revisions to your projections for the federal funds rate over 2015 and 2016 are broadly consistent with those prescribed by that rule, especially if the rule uses core, rather than headline, inflation.	11	1
201412	581	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the final exhibit, your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections have changed little since September.	11	1
201412	582	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	The top two panels in the column on the left show that nearly all of you judge the current level of uncertainty about real GDP growth and unemployment to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.	11	1
201412	583	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	A substantial majority of you also judge the level of uncertainty about inflation, shown in the lower two panels in the column on the left, to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.	11	1
201412	584	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	However, a couple more of you now view uncertainty about headline inflation as higher than the average level of the past 20 years than was the case in September.	11	1
201412	585	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top two panels in the column on the right, most of you continue to see the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced; offsetting risks for real GDP growth include, on the upside, stronger fundamentals, and, on the downside, a weaker international outlook than currently embedded in your forecasts.	11	1
201412	586	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	As reported in third panel on the right, six of you now see risks to headline inflation as weighted to the downside, while only one of you sees inflation risks as weighted to the upside; declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar were noted as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than currently in your forecasts.	11	1
201412	587	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201412	588	2014-12-17	meeting	KLEE	This concludes the staff presentations.	11	1
201412	589	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	11	1
201412	590	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions to any of our briefers.	12	1
201412	591	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201412	592	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question and I have an observation.	12	1
201412	593	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The question concerns the core PCE forecast on exhibit 4.	12	1
201412	594	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Since October we’ve seen a stronger dollar, weaker oil prices, and probably a slightly weaker foreign economic outlook, yet our core inflation forecasts are actually higher now than they were then.	12	1
201412	595	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not saying that I disagree with the current forecast, but how do you reconcile the evolution of the forecast of core inflation with the developments of the stronger dollar and weaker oil prices?	12	1
201412	596	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to understand the staff thinking on this, and then I want to make an observation or suggestion to the staff.	12	1
201412	597	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s very good stuff on oil prices here, but I’d be very interested now in seeing the consequences of the fall in oil prices in terms of international capital flows, demand for US Treasuries, and foreign exchange reserve accumulation.	12	1
201412	598	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Another consequence of this is going to be a big effect on current account balances around the world and potentially the demand for US Treasury securities.	12	1
201412	599	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it would be nice, at some future meeting, not only to take the real consequences of oil prices, but also to translate them into a financial dimension.	12	1
201412	600	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	We’ve been focusing both on the real implications and on the financial- stability implications.	12	1
201412	601	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	You’ve brought up yet another set of issues that we also would be very interested in working on.	12	1
201412	602	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Think about the Treasury market.	12	1
201412	603	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had very strong demand for Treasury securities from us through the LSAP program and very strong demand for Treasury securities from oil-producing countries in terms of their accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, and we’re sort of losing both of those.	12	1
201412	604	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	Yes, I think we believe that the net effect is certainly going to be to reduce external imbalances—smaller deficits for us, smaller surpluses for oil producers.	12	1
201412	605	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And is that a good thing?	12	1
201412	606	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that the end of the saving glut?	12	1
201412	607	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a lot of interesting questions, I think, embedded.	12	1
201412	608	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	On your question about core inflation—over the medium term, we do have some upward pressure on prices from the unemployment rate path being marked down, and so that’s offsetting some of what we’re seeing on the exchange rate, oil prices, and some of these other factors.	12	1
201412	609	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	In the end, it’s a wash for core prices.	12	1
201412	610	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We do end up with a lower rate in 2015 for total PCE price inflation because of the weaker energy prices, of course, but the main factor in there for core, I think, is really the markdown in the unemployment-rate path.	12	1
201412	611	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201412	612	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201412	613	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201412	614	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	On page 4, exhibit 3, you talk about inflation compensation, and a chart that we’ve all seen is the TIPS five-year, five-year-forward, which is declining.	12	1
201412	615	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	It looks like it’s about 2 percent here, and I think I heard you say that a good chunk of the decline is term and liquidity premiums.	12	1
201412	616	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	My question is, if it were to stabilize at this level through June, would we still be thinking it’s term and liquidity premiums—I don’t know what the short- and medium-run properties of these objects are likely to be—are there any refutable implications here from saying it’s inflation expectations or I think it ought to go away?	12	1
201412	617	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think there’s an immediate sense that those are factors that should reverse themselves in short order, if that’s your question, that we shouldn’t necessarily expect these term and liquidity premiums to move.	12	1
201412	618	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	These are durable explanations.	12	1
201412	619	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think my intuition, like yours, is that if it were just a decline in the actual and expected inflation that was permanent, that should ultimately show up in the model, and so in that sense you’d see a shift from the term premiums and liquidity premiums to expected inflation coming out of the models.	12	1
201412	620	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	But I don’t think that’s something that I necessarily would expect to see in the next few months.	12	1
201412	621	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	So we’re looking for a pretty bright economic outlook next year, and the international situation seems to be relatively optimistic compared with other things you might write down.	12	1
201412	622	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	That’s not likely to also have implications for the term premiums or the liquidity premiums?	12	1
201412	623	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	It certainly could, but what we’ve tried to do in the Tealbook kind of regression exercise is, looking at the term premiums or other premiums in this model, what are they functions of?	12	1
201412	624	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	You get something out of volatility.	12	1
201412	625	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	You get something out of some particular market factors in these markets, but they’re hard to explain, I think.	12	1
201412	626	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	What the model is telling us is that there are specific factors in the TIPS market and the nominals market that are moving around the TIPS-based inflation compensation independent of movements in inflation expectations, and I think that could be true for a while depending on how durable those factors are that are moving around the numbers in the TIPS yields.	12	1
201412	627	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	I think it would be good to get more direct evidence on that.	12	1
201412	628	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Some of the direct measures we have of the swap basis and nominal versus real asset swaps haven’t changed that much.	12	1
201412	629	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So it’s harder to do it if it lasts for one year, say.	12	1
201412	630	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Let me take one more crack at this.	12	1
201412	631	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	If there are really no identifiable differences across these three objects—inflation expectations, term premiums, or liquidity premiums—I don’t know how much confidence I have in any of the explanations.	12	1
201412	632	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I mean, identification from some additional series that we’re looking at ought to provide some information.	12	1
201412	633	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m sympathetic to what Simon was saying—it’s another way of saying that, I guess.	12	1
201412	634	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	But the models are pretty consistent right now.	12	1
201412	635	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s just that none of us have 100 percent confidence in any model.	12	1
201412	636	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s right, but to the point you were making, President Evans, the models are using, in the case of the Board model, nominal and real yields and survey measures of inflation expectations, and a no-arbitrage yield curve model to try to pick these things apart, and this is where the models end up.	12	1
201412	637	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Yes, it’s just that usually there are differential time-series implications from them that you can draw out.	12	1
201412	638	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Now, I understand the uncertainty and how much confidence you have around those estimates, but that’s fine.	12	1
201412	639	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’ll give up on that.	12	1
201412	640	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	If I could ask one more question, the international outlook seems to be maybe a little better than I might have expected.	12	1
201412	641	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Now, the imponderable question:  How important is the ECB follow-through on their balance sheet expansion for the way we’re viewing Europe and the rest of the world?	12	1
201412	642	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	What if they don’t get there?	12	1
201412	643	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Any commentary along those lines would be helpful.	12	1
201412	644	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Sure.	12	1
201412	645	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We think that their commitment to reflating the balance sheet back to 2012 levels played a substantial role in reducing term premiums and risk spreads—so those came down for periphery relative to core economies—and, finally, in the substantial depreciation of the euro.	12	1
201412	646	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	All those forces are an important part of our assumption that growth will pick up to an admittedly not very torrid pace next year.	12	1
201412	647	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	No, I understand.	12	1
201412	648	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But those are quite important.	12	1
201412	649	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	In terms of follow-through, we think that it is very important.	12	1
201412	650	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	They laid down a commitment in September, and markets are expecting them to deliver at least that, if not more.	12	1
201412	651	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201412	652	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201412	653	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201412	654	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201412	655	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a comment on the line of questioning that President Evans had about the term premiums and liquidity premiums.	12	1
201412	656	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My intuition is that if you looked at the zero-coupon inflation swaps as opposed to TIPS breakevens, you should typically not see as much liquidity movements in those zero-coupon inflation swaps.	12	1
201412	657	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the relative liquidity effects on TIPS versus Treasuries are much more pronounced than on the different sides of a zero-coupon inflation swap position.	12	1
201412	658	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that should help on the liquidity part.	12	1
201412	659	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the risk premium part, I think that as the memo from the Minneapolis Fed indicated, those are reflective, in our view, of actual fundamentals.	12	1
201412	660	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And so there is no reason to see those unwind relatively rapidly.	12	1
201412	661	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a question about the exercise in SIGMA on exhibit 7.	12	1
201412	662	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am puzzling over this, and I can’t quite figure it out.	12	1
201412	663	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you go to the US case, number 4, “Effects of a 20% Fall in Oil Prices on US Economy in SIGMA,” it seems in the unanchored case that inflation runs noticeably below what happens in the anchored case, which is what you’d expect, but it doesn’t seem to have material growth consequences.	12	1
201412	664	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would have thought that in this “perfect foresight” model, that would affect the real interest rate, and, therefore, have an effect on growth.	12	1
201412	665	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But obviously I’m wrong, so—	12	1
201412	666	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think it’s helpful to think about it abstracting from the zero bound.	12	1
201412	667	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	If an economy faces an unwanted fall in long-run inflation expectations, then the central bank would take aggressive actions, lowering real interest rates, to undo that.	12	1
201412	668	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	And, at least in the prism of our models, that would actually be stimulative.	12	1
201412	669	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	So you lower long-term interest rates across the maturity spectrum for some time, and that would be stimulative.	12	1
201412	670	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	It is kind of the flip side of what happened in the 1970s, when long-term inflation expectations became unanchored.	12	1
201412	671	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Then we eventually had to raise real interest rates and cause the economy to contract.	12	1
201412	672	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	So what happens with the zero bound is, it matters crucially how long the constraint lasts and how big the shock is.	12	1
201412	673	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Those are two key factors.	12	1
201412	674	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The shock we’re considering is pretty modest in size, but big enough that you can see it.	12	1
201412	675	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think long-term inflation expectations come down ¼ percentage point, and that’s more than what you would think would occur in response to a fall in oil prices, most likely.	12	1
201412	676	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But still, we wanted it to show up.	12	1
201412	677	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But the key thing is that, in the US case, with the zero-bound constraint and relatively small shocks, you get lower inflation in the very short term, so that raises the very near-term real interest rate.	12	1
201412	678	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But then you lower the whole path of interest rates thereafter because you raise rates more gradually, and that lowers real long rates going out for quite a long time.	12	1
201412	679	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	And so it becomes balanced—practically zero in our simulation.	12	1
201412	680	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Conversely, in the ECB’s case, they’re constrained for a long time, real interest rates go up for several years, and then the economy really gets walloped.	12	1
201412	681	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All right.	12	1
201412	682	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks a lot.	12	1
201412	683	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So you’re basically just offsetting the decline in anticipated inflation with a decline in the policy rate, and that—	12	1
201412	684	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	That’s right.	12	1
201412	685	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201412	686	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	12	1
201412	687	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	President Kocherlakota, if I can turn back just for a moment to the inflation swaps versus TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation, the Cleveland Fed has a model that uses inflation swaps to extract long-term expected inflation and inflation risk premiums.	12	1
201412	688	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	That model shows broadly similar results in the sense that it also shows 10-year expected inflation hasn’t declined a lot, at least based on their decomposition.	12	1
201412	689	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201412	690	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not as familiar with that model as I should be.	12	1
201412	691	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe I’m misremembering, but I thought in the actual data on the five-year, five-year-forward that you get out of the zero-coupon inflation swaps, you see that expected inflation has fallen, but not as much as what you get off breakevens.	12	1
201412	692	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So it’s chart 7.	12	1
201412	693	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	But what you’d usually expect is that there would be some disconnect between the fall in the swap-implied measure and the TIPS-implied measure, the cash market.	12	1
201412	694	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re not seeing a large movement there.	12	1
201412	695	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	That doesn’t mean that it isn’t the liquidity features, because if you talk to the swap traders, a lot of how they price this is what has happened in the cash market.	12	1
201412	696	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So we want to be a little bit careful—	12	1
201412	697	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s absolutely fair.	12	1
201412	698	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	Thanks.	12	1
201412	699	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201412	700	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201412	701	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have a question on exhibit 2, panel 6, which is on the near-term outlook for real GDP.	12	1
201412	702	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So Q3 in the October Tealbook was 2.7 percent at an annual rate, and Q3 currently is 4.6 percent.	12	1
201412	703	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	My question is, is that much of a difference consistent with historical norms in these kinds of revisions?	12	1
201412	704	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Or would you say that that’s an outsized surprise to the upside?	12	1
201412	705	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	I think this is on the larger side, so a big part of this—that last ½ percentage point since the December Tealbook—is the Quarterly Services Survey, which, this entire year, has been surprising us in different directions.	12	1
201412	706	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	We got a larger-than-expected reading on federal defense spending.	12	1
201412	707	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	That was a bit anomalous for some seasonal adjustment reasons, so we had some surprising readings.	12	1
201412	708	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	I think it’s more useful to take a look at, as on line 4 there, domestic final purchases.	12	1
201412	709	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	That revision is much smaller since the October Tealbook.	12	1
201412	710	2014-12-17	meeting	STEVENS	I wouldn’t pay as much attention to the revision on GDP.	12	1
201412	711	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201412	712	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And I have another question, also on oil prices, exhibit 7.	12	1
201412	713	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	In parts 3 and 4, we’re comparing euro-area GDP and US GDP in the aftermath of a 20 percent fall in oil prices.	12	1
201412	714	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I thought the conventional wisdom was that Europe is less sensitive to oil price movements because they have higher taxes on oil prices, so that the percent change in actual gasoline prices and so on is smaller.	12	1
201412	715	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	There might be other effects as well, so that Europe was less sensitive.	12	1
201412	716	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	But I’m looking at these two GDP pictures.	12	1
201412	717	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	They look like they’re the same.	12	1
201412	718	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So what’s the story there?	12	1
201412	719	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s certainly true for headline inflation that, because oil is heavily taxed, the share of energy in the overall consumption basket is somewhat smaller, and so you see smaller declines in headline inflation when comparing 3b and 4b.	12	1
201412	720	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But for output, essentially we have the view that transfers are much larger, basically in the case of an oil price decline like we’re considering, and they benefit the euro area much more because they don’t produce any of their own oil.	12	1
201412	721	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Essentially their net oil imports are something like 3 percent of GDP, whereas in the United States it is now much smaller.	12	1
201412	722	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	A few years ago, that would have been the case.	12	1
201412	723	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	But now we’ve become a major producer, and so our net oil import bill is on the order of 1½ percent of GDP.	12	1
201412	724	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The transfer effect is much larger in the euro area, and it kind of acts as a stimulus to aggregate demand.	12	1
201412	725	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	They get more money in their pocket, and they spend it.	12	1
201412	726	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	So you get a more front-loaded impact in consumption in the euro area.	12	1
201412	727	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s not hugely larger, because there are other factors at play, but it shows up in the simulation.	12	1
201412	728	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201412	729	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And just a follow-up to that, for Europe you have the unanchored case leading to slower GDP growth in 2016.	12	1
201412	730	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I know you said something about this, but I want to hear more about why that is, because that doesn’t occur in the US case, according to this.	12	1
201412	731	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	That’s right.	12	1
201412	732	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	In the unanchored case in Europe, the decline in inflation expectations pushes up real interest rates going out for several years.	12	1
201412	733	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	And that has a pretty contractionary effect on the economy, whereas in the US case, we are just constrained by the zero bound in this baseline for a couple of quarters.	12	1
201412	734	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	There is a very near-term effect of pushing downward the real interest rate, but going further out, we can simply allow the path of interest rates to run up more slowly, so the net effect on the real interest rate is going to be essentially zero.	12	1
201412	735	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	You see very little difference.	12	1
201412	736	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So what about QE in Europe?	12	1
201412	737	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	You would think that there would be a substantial monetary policy response.	12	1
201412	738	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	That’s right, exactly.	12	1
201412	739	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Because you get the fall in term premiums, and you don’t get the offsetting adjustments in the policy rate that would damp that effect.	12	1
201412	740	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	President Bullard, to that question, implicit in these scenarios is that the central bank is just using policy interest rates, so that if you thought that unconventional monetary policy or QE was entirely interchangeable with the conventional policy of altering the policy rate—	12	1
201412	741	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Which it clearly is.	12	1
201412	742	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	KAMIN: —well, which it clearly is, so then the scenario doesn’t quite work.	12	1
201412	743	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	But obviously the use of QE is a little bit more uncertain, both in the United States and particularly abroad, than the use of policy rates.	12	1
201412	744	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	That is clearly an attitude that is shared by the ECB itself, which is actively considering QE, but will be dragged into it with some members less happy about it than others.	12	1
201412	745	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	In some sense, one response to this scenario, if you were on the ECB board, might be to say, “Okay.	12	1
201412	746	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Well, we don’t want to get into that situation, so why don’t we use more unconventional monetary policy stimulus so that we could lift off our policy rate earlier, so that we could buy the policy flexibility that the United States has?”	12	1
201412	747	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201412	748	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201412	749	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	12	1
201412	750	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12	1
201412	751	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to continue on the subject of Europe.	12	1
201412	752	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Starting with exhibit 10, the point to me of that exhibit is, if we have weaker foreign growth than we expect in our baseline, it could have a pretty significant effect on some of the assumptions we have as we get toward liftoff.	12	1
201412	753	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And your picture of Europe is reasonably sanguine, it strikes me, in the fairly near term.	12	1
201412	754	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And that is a combination of extraordinary monetary policy and lower oil prices.	12	1
201412	755	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The question I have on the oil price effect is that they are buying oil in dollars, but they run their economy in euros.	12	1
201412	756	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	You would have to combine the exchange rate effect with the oil price in dollars to get the true cost effect to their economy, the benefit to their economy.	12	1
201412	757	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Have you calculated that?	12	1
201412	758	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And then, in the relative near term—this is a guess—a good part of their oil supplies would be under contract, which would have been contracts set before the decline in oil prices.	12	1
201412	759	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	So there would be a lag before their dollar price of oil actually is as cheap as we perceive it in dollar terms.	12	1
201412	760	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Have you calculated that?	12	1
201412	761	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	And if you have done all of that, then how are you as sanguine as you are in the near term about the European economy?	12	1
201412	762	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	Sort of leading the witness.	12	1
201412	763	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	12	1
201412	764	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I’m not sure I would want to characterize our forecast as “sanguine.”	12	1
201412	765	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think our growth outlook goes up from a very low level, so we essentially have euro-area GDP this year likely to come in at a snail’s pace of below 1 percent, rising to about 1½ percent next year.	12	1
201412	766	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Oil does play a material role in that, although there are many factors that we think provide a boost.	12	1
201412	767	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	The monetary easing and the exchange rate depreciation really provide the lion’s share in just getting you up there to 1½ percent from 1 percent.	12	1
201412	768	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	That’s roughly ½ percentage point right there.	12	1
201412	769	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	We think that fiscal pressures, which were very much toward consolidation until the last year or two, are going to also contribute favorably to growth and give you probably another couple of tenths.	12	1
201412	770	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Now, on the oil side, we do calculate the euro area price, and we feed that in.	12	1
201412	771	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think that that has moved a little over 20 percent since June.	12	1
201412	772	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	Steve looks like he has the chart—	12	1
201412	773	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	We have our little parsing table that suggests, looking at movements since June in oil prices and the dollar and taking into account these exchange rate effects that, in that sense, mute the effect of the decline in oil prices in local currency, that the fall in oil prices will, over the next couple of years, boost euro-area GDP by around ⅓ percentage point, and the depreciation of their currency against the dollar maybe another tenth.	12	1
201412	774	2014-12-17	meeting	KAMIN	So, all told, that rounds up to what Chris mentioned, which is about ½ percentage point of additional stimulus over the next couple of years coming from oil and the exchange rate.	12	1
201412	775	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	And we think that, given that this is quite persistent, the fact that there might be lags in transmission to prices probably wouldn’t have too big of an effect, though we still get in the ballpark of the assessments that Steve mentioned.	12	1
201412	776	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think it is also worth adding that we do perceive, as does the ECB, a lot of downside risk to this forecast.	12	1
201412	777	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s possible that even favorable developments could go badly, as we illustrated in the alternative scenario, and that very low wage growth  coming in at well below 2 percent could interact with low oil prices and really help bring down inflation.	12	1
201412	778	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	There are a lot of risks.	12	1
201412	779	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s an environment in which most of the ECB participants in their Survey of Professional Forecasters are projecting that the unemployment rate will be in double digits, basically over 50 percent of the forecasters four years ahead, and something like 40 percent of them five years ahead.	12	1
201412	780	2014-12-17	meeting	ERCEG	So there’s a lot of risk in the period ahead.	12	1
201412	781	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201412	782	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	2	2
201412	783	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I suggest we take a 20-minute break.	2	2
201412	784	2014-12-17	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201412	785	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready now to begin our economic go-round.	13	1
201412	786	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker is going to start us off.	13	1
201412	787	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	788	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	For this meeting, I have again written down a somewhat restrained projection with real GDP growth of around 2¼ percent for the next couple of years.	13	1
201412	789	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That rate is in line with the average rate we have seen over the past several years since the recession.	13	1
201412	790	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We have seen short spurts of stronger growth from time to time, like the one we are seeing this year, but these have been followed by periods of slower growth that bring down the medium-term average growth rate.	13	1
201412	791	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That pattern has left me generally very hesitant to project that a surge in growth that we see is going to be sustained in general.	13	1
201412	792	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, over the course of the past year or so, the magnitude of the acceleration in growth we’ve seen has been tempered in both the Tealbook and the SEP.	13	1
201412	793	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The last few months of data are starting to shift my thinking significantly, however.	13	1
201412	794	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Some recent developments that were largely absent during previous growth spurts have led me to believe that the probability of a sustained increase in growth has risen.	13	1
201412	795	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	At the previous meeting, we recognized the substantial improvements that we had seen in labor markets, and the staff described those nicely this afternoon.	13	1
201412	796	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The most recent numbers show continued improvement.	13	1
201412	797	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The November employment report brought average monthly payroll employment gains over the past 12 months to 228,000, a notable increase over the pace shown in the previous years.	13	1
201412	798	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The behavior in the JOLTS data this year, I think, is particularly striking.	13	1
201412	799	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We’ve seen a substantial increase in job openings this year, a 20 percent gain year-over-year, and hiring has increased significantly as well.	13	1
201412	800	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, quits are up 20 percent year-over-year, suggesting that workers are becoming more confident in their job prospects.	13	1
201412	801	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The fact that these flow indicators seem to have broken away from the path that has characterized their behavior since the recession is significant, I think.	13	1
201412	802	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	At various points in this expansion, some of us—Governor Tarullo, for example—have noted that measures of labor market fluidity or dynamism appear to be depressed relative to historical standards.	13	1
201412	803	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	In that context, the JOLTS data may be signaling something more fundamental by way of improvement in activity ahead.	13	1
201412	804	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The continuing improvement in labor market conditions has also been reflected in the unemployment rate, which has declined by 1.2 percentage points over the past year, faster than many of us expected and faster than in previous years.	13	1
201412	805	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	This decline has been accompanied by substantial changes in labor force participation and an unusually high rate of workers reporting that they are working part time for economic reasons, two factors the staff singled out in their presentation.	13	1
201412	806	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Given these conditions, there has been an ongoing debate about whether the narrowly defined unemployment rate U-3 continues to be an accurate measure of labor resource utilization.	13	1
201412	807	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	For example, relative to broader measures of unemployment, such as U-6, the current U-3 appears to be significantly below the rate that would be expected based on the relationship between U-3 and U-6 prior to 2007.	13	1
201412	808	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	At past meetings, I have reported on the work of Richmond Fed economists on other measures of labor underutilization that are both broader and take a more differentiated view of the labor market and labor market attachment than does U-6.	13	1
201412	809	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	These so-called nonemployment indexes weight individuals by their relative propensities to flow into employment.	13	1
201412	810	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, measures like U-3 or U-6 give everyone without a full-time job a weight of either zero or one.	13	1
201412	811	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It turns out that, based on the relationship between these nonemployment indexes and U-3 prior to 2007, U-3 is now right in line with what we would expect.	13	1
201412	812	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So this analysis says that the signal we are getting from the standard unemployment rate neither understates nor overstates the improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201412	813	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	One recurring motif in our discussions about labor market conditions this year has been the idea that the labor market can’t be back to normal if we haven’t yet seen a significant acceleration in wage rates.	13	1
201412	814	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I’m not sure whether this is a reasonable hypothesis or not, but I do know that wages and unemployment are not tightly correlated in the data.	13	1
201412	815	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	And, moreover, wage acceleration typically lags rather than leads price acceleration.	13	1
201412	816	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So the lack of apparent wage acceleration—apart from the last couple of quarters for the ECI—does not, in my view, provide much information regarding the degree of slack in the labor market.	13	1
201412	817	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	A strengthening labor market could help bring about a more persistent increase in consumption, and consumption growth in particular.	13	1
201412	818	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	In the past, I have been doubtful about prospects for a sustained increase in consumer spending growth because I felt we lacked evidence of more optimistic household expectations regarding job market prospects that I thought were fundamental to an acceleration in spending growth.	13	1
201412	819	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But I think that evidence is starting to emerge.	13	1
201412	820	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Both of the consumer confidence indexes have registered significant gains in recent months.	13	1
201412	821	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Drilling down into the Michigan survey, readings on current economic conditions, expected economic conditions 12 months ahead, and expected income growth have all shown sizable gains in the last few months.	13	1
201412	822	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	One should generally be skeptical about blips in these consumer survey measures because they typically don’t improve consumer spending forecasts by much, conditioning on other variables.	13	1
201412	823	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But these recent moves are striking, and they are well aligned with what is going on in labor market data.	13	1
201412	824	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So I take them as confirming signals that a meaningful pickup in the consumption growth trend could be ahead.	13	1
201412	825	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	A third area that suggests upside potential, to me, is manufacturing.	13	1
201412	826	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The ISM and most of the regional diffusion indexes have been elevated in recent months.	13	1
201412	827	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Manufacturing employment growth has been significantly more rapid this year than last.	13	1
201412	828	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Monday’s industrial production report showed especially robust growth in manufacturing production in November, and it was across a broad array of industries as well.	13	1
201412	829	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	And investment in equipment and intangibles was strong in the past two quarters.	13	1
201412	830	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Last month we heard an interesting report from a longtime contact of ours at the Association for Manufacturing Technology.	13	1
201412	831	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	He said that the association’s annual trade show this fall saw record attendance, which resulted in double the usual volume of orders.	13	1
201412	832	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	He described the growth in orders as driven by some dramatic improvements in technology that were on display at the show.	13	1
201412	833	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	He cited equipment that incorporates multiple functions—additive, subtractive, and bending—that used to require separate machines to be performed.	13	1
201412	834	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	His association is forecasting continued growth in orders, on the order of 5 to 10 percent, attributable to strength in automotive, aerospace, and industrial sectors.	13	1
201412	835	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Taken together, these developments suggest to me that this growth spurt is more likely to be sustained than previous growth spurts.	13	1
201412	836	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Turning now to inflation, the persistence of inflation around 1½ percent has had people worried about our 2 percent inflation goal.	13	1
201412	837	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The huge relative price shock from the decline in oil prices and the dollar’s appreciation are going to make it difficult to discern changes in longer- term inflation trends from incoming data on inflation over the next several months.	13	1
201412	838	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	However, the decline in gasoline prices can’t go on forever.	13	1
201412	839	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	What we’re facing in the coming months is just a transitory dip in headline inflation.	13	1
201412	840	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We can look through that to the core indexes to assess inflation trends, but big energy price moves tend to bleed through to core indexes to some extent as well, with a lag of a couple of months.	13	1
201412	841	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So the core indexes might be cloudy, too.	13	1
201412	842	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Thus, I’d avoid putting too much weight on incoming inflation data for the next few months.	13	1
201412	843	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But I don’t think that means policy should be on hold until energy price changes settle down.	13	1
201412	844	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Survey measures of inflation expectations have been stable.	13	1
201412	845	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	TIPS spreads have declined but are still near levels associated with the last several years of trading.	13	1
201412	846	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So I still believe we have good reason to be reasonably confident that inflation will trend back toward our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201412	847	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	848	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	849	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201412	850	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	851	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Building on what President Lacker discussed, I believe that highly-accommodative monetary policy, improved household finances, reduced fiscal drag, and tame non-oil commodity prices as well as oil prices have resulted in strong growth and an improving labor market.	13	1
201412	852	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Wage growth has gradually increased and is likely to rise at an increasing rate with further reductions in unemployment.	13	1
201412	853	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And as I have mentioned before, we are seeing a little laboratory in my Federal Reserve District of some 27 million people, in which unemployment is now 5.1 percent and wage-price inflation is running at 3.7 percent, the highest since 2008.	13	1
201412	854	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I was interested in exhibit 1, panel 6, and also in John’s presentation, exhibit 4, panel 6, with regard to the different Federal Reserve Banks’ surveys of who is going to be raising pay, et cetera.	13	1
201412	855	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would suggest that we certainly have an issue of pay and total compensation and inflation in the highly skilled areas.	13	1
201412	856	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If you look at Mercer data, for example, that is where they typically concentrate.	13	1
201412	857	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If you broaden out and talk to people, such as Manpower, their CEO, and so on, they do note that it may not be quite as aggressive at the lower income levels, but you are beginning to see about a 1 percent rate of wage-price inflation on the shop floor.	13	1
201412	858	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Looking ahead, from my perspective, faster wage gains and lower consumer energy prices will boost real household incomes and spending, contributing to a cycle of rising demand and employment.	13	1
201412	859	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I think we’re in a good dynamic here, and I believe that was the point that you were making, President Lacker.	13	1
201412	860	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	My projection for the real economy isn’t very different from the Tealbook baseline forecast, as updated December 11.	13	1
201412	861	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And for those that are “dot-ologists,”	13	1
201412	862	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I am number 15.	13	1
201412	863	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I won’t say much more than that.	13	1
201412	864	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I have GDP growing slightly more rapidly in 2015 than does the Tealbook and slightly less rapidly in 2016.	13	1
201412	865	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Consistent with that pattern of output growth, I have the unemployment rate drop a little further next year than shown in the Tealbook and have it hold steady in 2016.	13	1
201412	866	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But we end up pretty much in the same place.	13	1
201412	867	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I have revised my estimate of the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate downward a few tenths based partly on the good work done at the Chicago Fed by Dan Sullivan, which carefully controls for changes in the demographic composition of the population as well as its education and skills attainment.	13	1
201412	868	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I thought that was quite good work.	13	1
201412	869	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	My natural rate estimate is now roughly equal to that of the Tealbook.	13	1
201412	870	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	My inflation projection is quite different from that of the Tealbook, and I noted on panel 5 in the presentation made by Simon, the Board’s five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation reminded me of the old joke about the dyslexic agnostic that doesn’t believe in dog.	13	1
201412	871	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	You’ll get that in just a second.	13	1
201412	872	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I may be transposing things here, or I may just be too agnostic, but—you got it.	13	1
201412	873	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Good.	13	1
201412	874	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Williams, way to go.	13	1
201412	875	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201412	876	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I continue to believe that longer-term inflation expectations are anchored at a rate consistent with our inflation objective.	13	1
201412	877	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I note that since we last met—and this was mentioned in one of the presentations—the 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey are up slightly, about 10 basis points.	13	1
201412	878	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The New York Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations’ median three- year-ahead inflation is up 1 basis point.	13	1
201412	879	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The Philly Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters’ median 10-year inflation expectation is unchanged.	13	1
201412	880	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And according to a note I read by Morgan Stanley, the implied risk of deflation from the options market is 1 percent.	13	1
201412	881	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s unchanged over the last six months.	13	1
201412	882	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I’m convinced in the near term that inflation responds to changes in slack, as well as levels of slack, and I’d prefer to use the trimmed mean as my measure of core inflation rather than strip out food and energy prices.	13	1
201412	883	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And for all those reasons, I see inflation rising on a pretty consistent pace toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201412	884	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I also continue to believe that increases in the unemployment rate are difficult to contain once they begin, so the risks of misestimating slack are asymmetric.	13	1
201412	885	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I have talked about this before.	13	1
201412	886	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I consider it substantially more risky to overestimate slack than to underestimate it.	13	1
201412	887	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But because I anticipate a higher inflation path than does the Tealbook, and because I see both substantially less benefit from overshooting full employment and substantially greater risk, I believe it’s appropriate for monetary policy to move quite a bit more rapidly to a neutral policy stance than is called for in the Tealbook baseline forecast.	13	1
201412	888	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	In setting policy, I maintain that progress toward full employment is best gauged using the unemployment rate.	13	1
201412	889	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We have talked about that before.	13	1
201412	890	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I did note that of the 14 alternative indicators of slack examined in the Board staff memo distributed prior to this meeting, 11 had a strong pre-financial-crisis link to the unemployment rate.	13	1
201412	891	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Of these 11 indicators, 10 now show less comparative slack than does the unemployment rate.	13	1
201412	892	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The sole exception is the involuntary part-time employment gap.	13	1
201412	893	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Additionally, the unemployment rate remains a reliable guide, in my view, to wage and salary growth as measured by the employment cost index.	13	1
201412	894	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	My view, Madam Chair, is that progress toward price stability is best measured by recent history and the near-term trajectory of the core inflation measures, such as the Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean PCE inflation gauge.	13	1
201412	895	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Fluctuations in headline inflation in response to supply-side shocks are inevitable, and indeed, I would argue, desirable.	13	1
201412	896	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	They can be persistent.	13	1
201412	897	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	After all, even a fair coin will sometimes come up heads eight times in a row.	13	1
201412	898	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Low headline inflation that is supply-driven should not be a concern as long as nominal demand is projected to remain on a track consistent over the long term with our 2 percent inflation objective.	13	1
201412	899	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And I believe that’s where we are.	13	1
201412	900	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE inflation has averaged 1.65 percent over the past year.	13	1
201412	901	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It has been very steady for the past seven months.	13	1
201412	902	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Our forecasting model suggests that it will rise to just shy of 2 percent in 2015.	13	1
201412	903	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So if we haven’t quite yet achieved our intermediate- term target, as we define price stability, I think we are getting pretty close.	13	1
201412	904	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I also note that in table 2 of the appendix of the SEP and exhibit 3, which was summarized when we went through the projections of the SEP, five individuals sitting at this table feel liftoff should occur in the first quarter of 2015, while another seven feel it should occur in the second quarter of 2015.	13	1
201412	905	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So the dots tell us—or tell me, at least—that the time frame for liftoff has shifted forward.	13	1
201412	906	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	With regard to my interlocutors in the corporate sector—and I want to touch particularly on the subject of oil because Bill has twice, at the previous meeting and at this meeting, really drilled down—no pun intended—on that subject matter.	13	1
201412	907	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The net effect, except for the marginal oil operators, is viewed as very positive.	13	1
201412	908	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Obviously, if you’re in the transportation business, you’re happy.	13	1
201412	909	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The airlines are seeing this drop directly to the bottom line.	13	1
201412	910	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	My favorite retailer to look at, other than the largest one in the United States, would have to be 7-Eleven, because they’re a huge retailer of gas, as well as a seller of snacks and beer and cigarettes to construction workers.	13	1
201412	911	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Their average demography is about $48,500 in terms of income level.	13	1
201412	912	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It’s the second and third income quartile.	13	1
201412	913	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Their same-store sales are running at 4½ percent November over November.	13	1
201412	914	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	That’s up from 3.5 percent year-to-date before energy prices or gasoline prices at the pump began to come down, and that is versus 1.7 percent for last year.	13	1
201412	915	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And yet they still are massive retailers of gasoline.	13	1
201412	916	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So that’s net of that figure.	13	1
201412	917	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And then, the manufacturers I talk to in various sectors are also quite happy.	13	1
201412	918	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’ll give you an example, with permission from the CEO.	13	1
201412	919	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	A complex product line that uses a great deal of petroleum input and pulp input—Kimberly-Clark—had budgeted 40 cents per share of inflation costs due to energy.	13	1
201412	920	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	They just redid their budget, and now they expect to have 40 cents per share savings by virtue of the decline in oil prices.	13	1
201412	921	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would say from the telecoms that I speak to, it does confirm very much what we have heard in terms of the most recent numbers for capacity utilization and cap-ex.	13	1
201412	922	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	What they in the telecom business call “large enterprise investing” has been increasing for the last few months, and it was quite fallow for many months before.	13	1
201412	923	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And, finally, I would say that the National Federation of Independent Business is also indicating much more active interest in terms of their future capital commitments and hiring plans.	13	1
201412	924	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Vice Chairman Dudley may remember that the last time we talked, we had a long conversation.	13	1
201412	925	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	You asked me where energy prices might go, and I mentioned that the expectation was that the price of oil would dip down to $70 or below, according to practitioners in the business, and that it was likely to stay in the $70 to $80 range for a prolonged period of up to two years, but we might have dips down further.	13	1
201412	926	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I’ve gone back to the same group.	13	1
201412	927	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The price basket of OPEC oil crude dipped to just a fraction below $60 yesterday—that is the reference point.	13	1
201412	928	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Brent was $61.06.	13	1
201412	929	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So with that, I asked whether or not this would have a significant effect on cap-ex.	13	1
201412	930	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	What’s interesting in my District is I have 900 of the 1,900 operating wells in the country.	13	1
201412	931	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We have actually seen permits surge since October; we still are at 900 operating wells, but permits have increased.	13	1
201412	932	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Remember, prices began to come down in June.	13	1
201412	933	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So the expectation is that cap-ex adjustment will take place, but it will be less than people expect—the budgets have already been set over the next year—and could have an effect of about 5 percent, in answer to the question you asked me at the October meeting.	13	1
201412	934	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The real issue here is that the Saudis are basically engaging in an exercise of price discovery, and they just didn’t take seriously, nor did their colleagues—particularly the Kuwaitis and the Emirati—that this was a real development that would be lasting.	13	1
201412	935	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	They now believe it will be, and they want to test the market to see how far it will go.	13	1
201412	936	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And, by the way, I know that King Abdullah rather enjoys poking it to the Iranians in the process.	13	1
201412	937	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But this is really a price- discovery exercise.	13	1
201412	938	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	No one I talked to in the business believes this will be a sharp V-shape, which may mean that they are completely wrong.	13	1
201412	939	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Instead they claim—particularly the big ones that operate in Saudi Arabia and know the Saudis well—that these prices are likely to be staying very low, $70 to $80, maybe in the mid-$60s, for a period that could last up to two years.	13	1
201412	940	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I wanted to give you a little more background on that.	13	1
201412	941	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The other thing I would conclude with, Madam Chair—if you remember at the previous meeting, there was some concern that we would be signaling by the language that we added to the statement that we were becoming a little bit more hawkish or less dovish.	13	1
201412	942	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I do note that across the yield curve, rates really have not backed up at all.	13	1
201412	943	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The two-year is up 6 basis points, everything else is down 6 to 30 basis points, depending on how far out you go.	13	1
201412	944	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I also note that the 15-year fixed mortgage rate is actually down, even though the 30-year mortgage rate is up 4 basis points.	13	1
201412	945	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So there is not much change.	13	1
201412	946	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	As I mentioned before, the real angst in the marketplace right now is in the junk bond market, and that is driven largely by the 18 percent that are marginal energy operators.	13	1
201412	947	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The expectation is that they will fail or have problems, as will their suppliers.	13	1
201412	948	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And then the big ones will come pick them up at cheap prices, those that actually have real properties that they should exploit.	13	1
201412	949	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I would say in summary, Madam Chair, that the data continue to indicate that the economy is improving.	13	1
201412	950	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I believe they indicate that it’s improving at a faster pace than we had previously assumed.	13	1
201412	951	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’m in accord with President Lacker on that front, although I didn’t get as pessimistic as he did.	13	1
201412	952	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And I believe that the net effect of these lower energy prices is a huge boost in a society that is 70 percent consumption driven and 70 percent service driven.	13	1
201412	953	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	954	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	955	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201412	956	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	957	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we began expanding our balance sheet in 2008 and 2009, one of the biggest concerns raised was that such a policy would be inflationary.	13	1
201412	958	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yet six years later, one of the major problems confronting the economy remains an inflation rate that is too low, and this even at a time when the unemployment rate is approaching some estimates of the natural rate.	13	1
201412	959	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, if one focused on the consistently strong payroll employment growth over the past six months, the unemployment rate at 5.8 percent, and the forecast of real GDP growth in excess of potential growth, one might feel policy should lift off relatively soon.	13	1
201412	960	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, such an analysis would ignore the critical facts that current wage and price growth are significantly below levels consistent with our announced 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201412	961	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, my own forecast does not have us reaching a core PCE inflation rate of 2 percent any time soon.	13	1
201412	962	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	One possible explanation for the weakness in wages and prices is that labor markets have more slack than a cursory assessment would indicate.	13	1
201412	963	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the disruptions that occurred during the recession, it is quite possible that a U-3 unemployment rate, by itself, underestimates the amount of labor market slack.	13	1
201412	964	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	With U-6 and long-term unemployment still elevated, defining full employment with U-3 historical estimates may be why we are still seeing unusually low wage and price inflation, even as U-3 approaches a value that many deem to be consistent with full employment.	13	1
201412	965	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Another possibility is that the U-3 rate consistent with full employment is lower than our current estimates.	13	1
201412	966	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own estimate of full employment is 5¼ percent.	13	1
201412	967	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Before the recession, my estimate was a shade under 5 percent.	13	1
201412	968	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the past 40 years have taught us anything, it is that the natural rate moves around.	13	1
201412	969	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even relative to 2007, the labor force has become older and more educated.	13	1
201412	970	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Older and more educated workers tend to experience lower unemployment rates.	13	1
201412	971	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Other things being equal, this would be consistent with a slightly lower level of the equilibrium unemployment rate than my current estimate of 5¼ percent.	13	1
201412	972	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, as the unemployment rate declines with little evidence of wage and price pressure, in aggregate or by occupational grouping, I am likely to soon reduce my estimate of full employment to make it more consistent with the absence of wage and price pressures we are experiencing.	13	1
201412	973	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is quite possible that even if there are developing price pressures, they will not be obvious in the data by the middle of next year.	13	1
201412	974	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook forecast has total and core PCE inflation for the second quarter of next year at 1.4 percent and the ECI at 2.8 percent for all four quarters of 2015.	13	1
201412	975	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this is close to the actual outcomes, we will have little evidence of progress toward our 2 percent inflation goal based on wage and price data even by the middle of next year.	13	1
201412	976	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The very low wage and price pressures pose a challenge for deciding when liftoff should occur.	13	1
201412	977	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	One reason is that downward nominal wage rigidity may be complicating the signal that one can reasonably draw about labor market slack from current wage developments.	13	1
201412	978	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because many businesses did not cut nominal wages outright during the recession or in the earlier part of the recovery as equilibrium wages declined, we may now be observing slower wage growth to compensate for the earlier lack of downward adjustment.	13	1
201412	979	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to overcome this difficulty is to look at the wages of new hires, which are typically more sensitive to business cycle conditions than the wages of existing employees.	13	1
201412	980	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	New-hire wages could potentially be a leading indicator of emerging labor market tightness.	13	1
201412	981	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My staff has been analyzing the monthly wage file from the CPS.	13	1
201412	982	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	After controlling for demographic features of the data, they find that in previous recoveries, new-hire wages did grow significantly faster than existing employee wages.	13	1
201412	983	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, to date in the current recovery, that pattern has yet to emerge strongly in the data.	13	1
201412	984	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, unlike previous recoveries, they are not yet seeing much evidence of wage pressures and that is consistent with there still being significant labor market slack.	13	1
201412	985	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Needless to say, it is important not to focus solely on one indicator when assessing price and wage pressures and their relationship with the extent of slack in the economy.	13	1
201412	986	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Prices are affected by variables other than past wage movements.	13	1
201412	987	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, they can move before wages.	13	1
201412	988	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, the statistical relationship between aggregate wages and most real measures of labor market slack is not always stable.	13	1
201412	989	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, because of recent exchange rate and oil price shocks, it may be particularly difficult to determine underlying wage and price trends.	13	1
201412	990	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Still, at least so far, the bulk of evidence appears consistent with little incipient inflationary pressures.	13	1
201412	991	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In this context, there appears to be ample reason for patience.	13	1
201412	992	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is particularly true given the disinflation in Europe and Japan and the recent turbulence generated by sharply lower oil prices, which calls into question the robustness of a global recovery.	13	1
201412	993	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, it would be important to parse incoming wage and price data carefully.	13	1
201412	994	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The very low breakevens and five- year Treasury rates well below 2 percent, even though most investors expect us to tighten starting next year, indicate that we are still in danger of undermining our credibility on our inflation target.	13	1
201412	995	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The European quandary highlights why we should not take this risk lightly.	13	1
201412	996	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	All of the above provide ample reason to probe the degree of labor market slack further and to look for signs that we can confidently expect to move back to our inflation target over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201412	997	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	998	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	999	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201412	1000	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1001	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	The basic contours of my outlook have not changed materially over the past two SEP cycles.	13	1
201412	1002	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	President Fisher, you had a very interesting term.	13	1
201412	1003	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure I captured it correctly—SEP “projection-ologist” or something.	13	1
201412	1004	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Dot-ologist.	13	1
201412	1005	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Dot-ologist.	13	1
201412	1006	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	13	1
201412	1007	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m number eight.	13	1
201412	1008	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	We see GDP growth averaging about 3 percent over the next two years.	13	1
201412	1009	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	This is a faster pace than the Tealbook, and it largely reflects our higher assumption for potential output growth.	13	1
201412	1010	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thus, we too see the unemployment rate falling close to 5 percent by the end of 2016.	13	1
201412	1011	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	After a long period of unemployment and resource slack, we will have finally arrived at a satisfactory outcome for the employment side of the dual mandate.	13	1
201412	1012	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But also like the Tealbook, we project that the FOMC will fail to achieve its inflation objective within the SEP forecast period.	13	1
201412	1013	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	My forecast has inflation slowly crawling up and not getting back to 2 percent until sometime in 2018.	13	1
201412	1014	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Recall that since 2008, PCE inflation has averaged just 1½ percent per year.	13	1
201412	1015	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	So under my SEP forecast we will have missed our inflation target for ten years.	13	1
201412	1016	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I continue to see this outcome as highly unsatisfactory.	13	1
201412	1017	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Moreover, for the FOMC to achieve even this unsatisfactory outcome, I find it necessary to assume greater monetary accommodation than the Tealbook, the median SEP dot path, and 15 other SEP submissions.	13	1
201412	1018	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Conditional on my reading of economic and inflation fundamentals, I don’t have the funds rate lifting off until March 2016.	13	1
201412	1019	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, I think truly appropriate policy would have us achieving our 2 percent goal before 2018.	13	1
201412	1020	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	That would require even stronger accommodation than I’m writing down.	13	1
201412	1021	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	By the way, it’s essential to describe my policy assumption to give a better context to my SEP economic commentary.	13	1
201412	1022	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Now, returning to the outlook, the recent data on consumer spending and the labor market have been somewhat better than we expected, and as a result, we boosted our near-term forecast a bit.	13	1
201412	1023	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	My business contacts and directors indicate that not much has changed since last time.	13	1
201412	1024	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Most reports are positive about prospects for continued strength in the US economy.	13	1
201412	1025	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	For example, automakers, not surprisingly, were pleased with the November sales numbers.	13	1
201412	1026	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Looking ahead, both Ford and GM expect sales in 2015 to be up a bit from this year’s pace.	13	1
201412	1027	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	They also are benefiting from consumers buying more expensive vehicles, and they suggested that continued attractive financing rates are likely to be important for a continuation of strong consumer sales.	13	1
201412	1028	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But, not to be too upbeat, US automakers do note that their foreign competitors are getting an edge in the marketplace from the stronger dollar.	13	1
201412	1029	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	They like to talk like that.	13	1
201412	1030	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	More generally, my directors and other contacts continue to be gloomy about the international situation.	13	1
201412	1031	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Most of the commentary was similar to the last round, although some mentioned that their businesses in Europe had weakened even further.	13	1
201412	1032	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Like many, I see the international situation as the major downside risk to the US growth outlook.	13	1
201412	1033	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	At only 3 percent growth, the US economy is not likely to pull up the rest of the world.	13	1
201412	1034	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	They’re going to have to do it largely on their own.	13	1
201412	1035	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But I’m also concerned that the US economy will not be able to decouple completely from the rest of the world.	13	1
201412	1036	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	The CEOs I speak with describe Europe as a mess.	13	1
201412	1037	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Matters there certainly could get worse, especially if policymakers simply muddle along.	13	1
201412	1038	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	And a worsening Europe could have a substantial negative impact on US corporate risk aversion and, with that, on domestic investment and hiring.	13	1
201412	1039	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Now, let me turn to inflation.	13	1
201412	1040	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	The bulk of the incoming information has been discouraging.	13	1
201412	1041	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	First, aggregate wage increases continue to be very modest.	13	1
201412	1042	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	One CEO of a large firm told me that they were raising wages by 3 to 6 percent for some lower-paid, second-tier jobs in the $12 to $16 an hour wage range.	13	1
201412	1043	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But it turns out that this follows a wage freeze last year.	13	1
201412	1044	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, the same CEO indicated that he sees no inflationary pressures.	13	1
201412	1045	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	He reiterated by saying, “Zero.”	13	1
201412	1046	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Next, the further drop in oil prices and appreciation of the dollar will lower inflation, at least in the near term.	13	1
201412	1047	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Third, market measures of inflation compensation have fallen even further.	13	1
201412	1048	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Although this move may be difficult to parse, some portion of it ought to be due to lower expected inflation, as the dealer survey suggested.	13	1
201412	1049	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	This is going in the wrong direction.	13	1
201412	1050	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	To conclude, my outlook for inflation is nowhere near satisfactory, in my opinion.	13	1
201412	1051	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Over the past six years, inflation has averaged 1½ percent per year.	13	1
201412	1052	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Over the next five years, I expect that inflation will average only 1¾ percent.	13	1
201412	1053	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Putting us on a path that returns inflation to target sooner rather than later should be our paramount concern at this time.	13	1
201412	1054	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Getting stuck at 1¾ percent would be a credibility failure of our long-run strategy for monetary policy.	13	1
201412	1055	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1056	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1057	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201412	1058	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1059	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	All signs confirm that the expansion is on track.	13	1
201412	1060	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consumer spending has been surprisingly strong, supported by falling energy prices, improving household balance sheets, and renewed confidence.	13	1
201412	1061	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Strength in the manufacturing sector is also noteworthy, with capacity utilization in that sector near historical norms.	13	1
201412	1062	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I continue to expect real GDP growth to run well above potential output through next year, and my contacts are actually, nowadays, more upbeat about the outlook—which is a big change—telling me that there’s more upside than downside risk to my forecast.	13	1
201412	1063	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the jobs front, at our previous FOMC meeting, I think I referred to recent gains as “robust.”	13	1
201412	1064	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With the further pickups over the past two months, I guess I’ll have to say that they were very robust, and the unemployment rate has also edged down, accompanied by improvement in a wide set of labor market indicators.	13	1
201412	1065	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this wave of transparency, I am SEP respondent number five and will not go through all of the details of my forecast, unless everyone would like to hear it.	13	1
201412	1066	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Nobody will know for five years.	13	1
201412	1067	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As labor market conditions continue to improve, the question of what constitutes maximum employment becomes a more pressing topic that President Lacker already talked about.	13	1
201412	1068	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Distinguishing between structural and cyclical factors in labor markets is essential to this question, and my staff, like others in the System, as already mentioned, have been working to provide some answers to this question.	13	1
201412	1069	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	One structural factor that’s been a concern of late is job polarization, which refers to the disappearance of middle-skill, routine jobs that are replaced by computer-based technologies or are offshored.	13	1
201412	1070	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although this process has been ongoing for three decades now, it accelerated during the recent recession and may have left a sizable number of routine jobs permanently dislocated.	13	1
201412	1071	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff examined the extent to which this type of structural job loss has contributed to the mismatch and pushed up the natural rate of unemployment during the latest downturn and recovery.	13	1
201412	1072	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They found only minimal effects, largely consistent with earlier research conducted by the staff of the New York Fed.	13	1
201412	1073	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Workers in routine jobs have seen a pickup in their job-finding rates similar to workers with more favored nonroutine jobs, and, more generally, job mismatches associated with polarization appear to be limited, boosting the unemployment rate by only ¼ percentage point at most.	13	1
201412	1074	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	To further probe the role of mismatch, my staff also updated their earlier work on the interaction between the Beveridge curve and aggregate labor demand, as reflected in the job creation curve, and their results, which encompass a full range of sources of mismatch, also shows a limited effect of mismatch today.	13	1
201412	1075	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Combined, these findings and the other research that was done in recent years on this topic add to my confidence that the long-term natural rate has not risen by a significant amount in the aftermath of the recession.	13	1
201412	1076	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	My estimate of the natural rate remains at 5.2 percent, and I see the actual unemployment rate converging on that milepost by the end of next year.	13	1
201412	1077	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s unchanged from my September forecast.	13	1
201412	1078	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given the sizable improvement in the labor market, inflation is now the most worrying issue.	13	1
201412	1079	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s been running too low for quite some time, and declines in energy prices, commodity prices, and import prices will push down the headline numbers further through next year.	13	1
201412	1080	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, core inflation has not slipped, and as commodity prices and the dollar stabilize and domestic wages pick up, I expect inflation to gradually rise and reach our longer-term objective in 2017.	13	1
201412	1081	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, the possibility of a bounceback in oil prices as market conditions normalize adds some upside risk to the forecast.	13	1
201412	1082	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me add a little bit of commentary on that.	13	1
201412	1083	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s been the big topic of discussion at our board meetings and in discussions with contacts.	13	1
201412	1084	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is an interesting comparison between what’s happening in Texas, where there’s tight oil and the investment cycle is very short, and what’s happening with some of the global oil companies.	13	1
201412	1085	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In Texas, the return to investment is very rapid and, once you get the permit, you can go in, drill the oil, get the oil out, and move out.	13	1
201412	1086	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you think about global oil companies who are doing deepwater research and drilling, these are projects that tend to take five to seven years to fully develop and bring back returns.	13	1
201412	1087	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that area you do hear reports of significant changes in willingness to invest in exploration, willingness to basically deploy capital, given not only the low level of oil prices, but the uncertainty there.	13	1
201412	1088	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I think the question that did come up is the one that President Fisher talked about— how is this dynamic with Saudi Arabia going to play out?	13	1
201412	1089	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	How long will that take?	13	1
201412	1090	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	You mentioned, I think, a figure of a couple years.	13	1
201412	1091	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some of our discussions suggested that this may collapse or shift sooner than that, but it’s a matter of uncertainty.	13	1
201412	1092	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you think about investment in this area, I think it’s something that would, given a long lead time, lead to a pullback in investment until some of this uncertainty clears up.	13	1
201412	1093	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	May I clarify, Madam Chair?	13	1
201412	1094	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I was referring to Saudi Aramco in my numbers, not just the titans of oil in Texas.	13	1
201412	1095	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there is a different dynamic between different types of oil exploration and drilling.	13	1
201412	1096	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	13	1
201412	1097	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there is uncertainty around the future of oil prices, and we could see a jump back up in the next year or so.	13	1
201412	1098	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This outlook for gradually rising inflation is supported by the continuation of well-anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201412	1099	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with President Fisher, I believe inflation expectations have remained well anchored.	13	1
201412	1100	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I remain steadfast in my view that I don’t agree with the Board’s staff view that inflation expectations are anchored below 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1101	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think they are actually anchored at 2 percent, so let me explain that a little bit.	13	1
201412	1102	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the Survey of Professional Forecasters, long-term expectations of PCE and price inflation have been glued to 2 percent—that’s 2.0 percent—over the past two years.	13	1
201412	1103	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That sounds like success to me.	13	1
201412	1104	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although CPI long-run inflation expectations have come down a touch, analysis by my staff suggests that this is much ado about nothing.	13	1
201412	1105	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the drop is small.	13	1
201412	1106	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, more importantly, it mainly served to bring the midpoint of the distribution of expectations back down from elevated levels recorded in the aftermath of the financial crisis.	13	1
201412	1107	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The recent decline mainly reflects lower inflation expectations among respondents whose earlier expectations were unusually high.	13	1
201412	1108	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some of those respondents, when asked, “Why did you have high inflation expectations?” attributed their elevated responses, in part, to the uncertainty about the inflationary impact of the Fed’s ballooning balance sheet.	13	1
201412	1109	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you think about the dynamic of inflation expectations on the CPI, basically the reason they went up, at least in part, was concerns about the Fed’s policy actions.	13	1
201412	1110	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Clearly, as President Rosengren pointed out, inflation has not risen.	13	1
201412	1111	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	These risks have not materialized.	13	1
201412	1112	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They have actually shifted down their views of long-run inflation expectations from high to more in the middle.	13	1
201412	1113	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The decline in inflation expectations among this group implies that respondents now show much greater agreement about the likelihood of moderate inflation in the future.	13	1
201412	1114	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, of course, market-based measures of expected inflation and associated risks, in particular breakeven inflation rates, have come down by more than the survey-based measures.	13	1
201412	1115	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, consistent with the findings noted in the Tealbook, a model developed by my staff at the San Francisco Fed attributes these declines to risk and liquidity premiums rather than expected inflation.	13	1
201412	1116	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That brings us to President Kocherlakota and his staff’s memo—which I thought was very thought-provoking and very insightful—that basically made the point that we should not distinguish between these two components, meaning inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium.	13	1
201412	1117	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the memo, we should simply react to the full inflation compensation in order to account for market participants’ valuation of the risks associated with different inflation outcomes.	13	1
201412	1118	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, despite the theoretical elegance of his argument, and also my staff’s being thrilled to be able to talk about market-based probabilities and statistically estimated probabilities during the FOMC briefing, I am unconvinced that market prices likely reflect the preferences of American households in the way that the memo lays out.	13	1
201412	1119	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	One reason is that a large share of American households doesn’t actively participate in financial markets.	13	1
201412	1120	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, the marginal investor could well be a foreign hedge fund, which would invalidate the welfare rationale for using market prices.	13	1
201412	1121	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Certainly, part of the recent decline in breakeven rates reflects a flight to safety from abroad into nominal Treasuries.	13	1
201412	1122	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	More generally, as highlighted by the field of behavioral finance, there are a variety of reasons why sentiment and other factors and frictions not associated with marginal utility might influence market prices.	13	1
201412	1123	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, if the real world did approximate the framework of the full participation in complete markets assumed in the Minneapolis Fed’s memo, one implication of that is that our large-scale asset purchase programs would be ineffective.	13	1
201412	1124	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Without some imperfect substitutability among assets, such purchases would have no economic effects through portfolio balance channels.	13	1
201412	1125	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	My reading of the available evidence suggests that’s not the world that we live in.	13	1
201412	1126	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	For these reasons, I remain convinced that it makes sense, in theory, to consider inflation expectations as well as the risk premium associated with inflation separately.	13	1
201412	1127	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that’s in theory.	13	1
201412	1128	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In practice, of course, we have imperfect tools to distinguish between these signals.	13	1
201412	1129	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given these measurement difficulties, we should not be too cavalier about the decline in breakeven inflation and should continue to monitor and analyze it and other measures carefully.	13	1
201412	1130	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1131	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1132	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander—President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201412	1133	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	13	1
201412	1134	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1135	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thank President Williams and his staff for his close attention to the Minneapolis Fed memo, although I would recommend—some of the sections that occur later in the memo on limited participation and incomplete markets might address some of the concerns that you raise in your remarks.	13	1
201412	1136	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think a general point would be that we were trying to make—we may not have made it as clearly as we could have—is that it’s important to take into account relative valuations of resources across states of the world as well as the likelihood of those states of the world occurring.	13	1
201412	1137	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Basically, using probabilities alone is akin to counting up GDP by counting up how much things weigh as opposed to using values instead because, basically, probabilities don’t take into account how much people actually value the resources in those different states of the world where you need to have a price to do that.	13	1
201412	1138	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, as President Williams and his staff pointed out, I think there are definitely issues about how well financial market prices—and we tried to talk about some of that in the memo— measure exactly marginal valuations for everybody in the economy.	13	1
201412	1139	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there are reasons to think they are relatively close, but that we can argue about.	13	1
201412	1140	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should keep in mind that just looking at probabilities alone is not sufficient, because we want to know how much people value resources, not just how likely states of the world are.	13	1
201412	1141	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1142	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1143	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201412	1144	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1145	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I will start with a summary of reports of contacts from around my District.	13	1
201412	1146	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, reports were quite positive.	13	1
201412	1147	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	General demand conditions remain on the upswing, and demand for labor is rising.	13	1
201412	1148	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We also heard positive reports on the direction of capital expenditure outlays and plans.	13	1
201412	1149	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Neither the falling price of gasoline nor the rising dollar has yet materially affected the pace of business activity, although we heard acknowledgement that both will come into play in 2015.	13	1
201412	1150	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I might add that one director talked about the gasoline price having an effect on the composition of sales.	13	1
201412	1151	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The largest national auto retailer spoke about the preference of Americans now for SUVs and light trucks.	13	1
201412	1152	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	He said, “Don’t listen to what the American public says.	13	1
201412	1153	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	They say they want broccoli, but they want to buy a donut.”	13	1
201412	1154	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13	1
201412	1155	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We had over 300 responses in response to the Board of Governors employment survey.	13	1
201412	1156	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	For us, almost 60 percent of respondents said they intend to increase employment over the next 12 months.	13	1
201412	1157	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	A significant plurality cited expected growth and sales as the most important factor pushing them to hire.	13	1
201412	1158	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard comments that higher turnover is beginning to present problems.	13	1
201412	1159	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Compensation growth, while still generally subdued, appears to be firming.	13	1
201412	1160	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Comments on transport and logistics challenges were worthy of note.	13	1
201412	1161	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts expressed some concern about the growing vulnerability of the economy to transportation bottlenecks.	13	1
201412	1162	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	They cited the shortage of truck drivers and railcars as well as the Long Beach Port congestion.	13	1
201412	1163	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard the view that transportation problems are likely to get worse.	13	1
201412	1164	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Our reports from District contacts evidence rising confidence.	13	1
201412	1165	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Most interpretations of recent national data, both inside the Fed and externally, emphasize the strength of the data, so the cautious contrarian in me says, “Don’t get carried away.”	13	1
201412	1166	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me mention some cautionary points on the current and near-term situation.	13	1
201412	1167	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Tracking estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth, including hours, point to a marked slowdown from well over 4 percent annualized third-quarter growth to down around 2½ percent this quarter.	13	1
201412	1168	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent inflation readings remain well below the Committee’s target, with little evidence of acceleration.	13	1
201412	1169	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Headline inflation numbers will likely be extremely soft in the first quarter, with widening divergence of headline and core.	13	1
201412	1170	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	How to explain the declining market- based indications of inflation expectations is not, in my opinion, a closed debate.	13	1
201412	1171	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Payroll jobs growth is certainly quite strong and encouraging.	13	1
201412	1172	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	But considering the level of U-6, the still elevated U-3/U-6 differential, and continuing weak wage growth, I still see a fair measure of employment slack remaining.	13	1
201412	1173	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	These are just cautionary comments.	13	1
201412	1174	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My baseline forecast submitted for this meeting has not substantially changed from October and September.	13	1
201412	1175	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My central assumption is that the economy will continue to enjoy an underlying run rate of growth around 3 percent.	13	1
201412	1176	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	In that respect, my forecast sees stronger growth than the December Tealbook by more than ½ percentage point.	13	1
201412	1177	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I adjusted down my headline inflation projection over the next year, reflecting the playing through of the drop in oil prices.	13	1
201412	1178	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have core inflation slightly above the Tealbook over the forecast horizon but do not have core or headline inflation reaching target until 2017.	13	1
201412	1179	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards risks to my outlook, I share the view that substantially lower gasoline and energy prices will likely produce a clear benefit to the real economy in the medium term.	13	1
201412	1180	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff did some statistical modeling of the effect of lower oil prices.	13	1
201412	1181	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This work suggested positive consumption and investment effects materializing in the second half of 2015.	13	1
201412	1182	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	However, the share of oil and gas structures investment, as a percentage of total investment in structures, has grown significantly since the mid-1990s.	13	1
201412	1183	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As a consequence, the effect of sustained low oil prices on drilling activity could be a slight drag on growth in the near term.	13	1
201412	1184	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	A second risk to my outlook relates to the impact of a stronger dollar on net exports in the context of weak global growth.	13	1
201412	1185	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The Tealbook seems to have incorporated effects of these factors into their baseline growth forecast.	13	1
201412	1186	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have not yet done so.	13	1
201412	1187	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Given the structure of US exports, I don’t feel I am on firm ground estimating the downside effect of the higher dollar on exports.	13	1
201412	1188	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I am also uncertain about the second-quarter positive effects on our economy, of what one would expect to be stronger export performance growth and ultimate demand in economies whose currency has depreciated.	13	1
201412	1189	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I found the exercise of projecting economic conditions at liftoff to be quite useful.	13	1
201412	1190	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Like the Tealbook, I can imagine circumstances leading up to liftoff when the incoming data and near- term outlook could be very short of our mandated objectives.	13	1
201412	1191	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Assuming a mid-2015 liftoff date, our communications in anticipation of liftoff will probably begin as early as the March FOMC meeting.	13	1
201412	1192	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At this time, it is likely, in my view, that headline PCE inflation will be moving sharply away from our longer-term objective.	13	1
201412	1193	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The decline in oil prices to date could contribute to negative headline inflation through the February PCE price report.	13	1
201412	1194	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, we could be looking at a two-quarter growth rate for this quarter and next, well below the average of the second and third quarters of 2014.	13	1
201412	1195	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My point is that the array of data relative to mandate could be confidence challenging and require that the Committee look through, discount, and explain away aspects of the picture presented by the data.	13	1
201412	1196	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This could be an awkward place to be as we approach liftoff.	13	1
201412	1197	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I will pick up on this thought again in the policy round.	13	1
201412	1198	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1199	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1200	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201412	1201	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1202	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My overall view is that the economy is building momentum in terms of output and employment.	13	1
201412	1203	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District economy continues to expand.	13	1
201412	1204	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Fifty percent of our contacts reported an improvement in business conditions over the past six to eight weeks compared with 10 percent that reported a deterioration.	13	1
201412	1205	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	This yields an implied diffusion index of 40, slightly less than the 47 we saw at the time of our previous meeting but significantly higher than the 10 we saw last December.	13	1
201412	1206	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Fourth District business contacts remain optimistic about the economy.	13	1
201412	1207	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, over half plan to increase capital spending next year.	13	1
201412	1208	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	In many cases, this investment is being made to expand capacity rather than merely replace depreciated equipment.	13	1
201412	1209	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets have also improved further.	13	1
201412	1210	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	For the year to date, employment growth has picked up to 1.4 percent, the closest the region has come to the nation’s growth rate in several years.	13	1
201412	1211	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports on hiring plans for the coming year continue to indicate steadily improving labor markets.	13	1
201412	1212	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate for the four states in our District fell to 5.3 percent in October, down almost 1½ percentage points since the end of last year.	13	1
201412	1213	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The decline in unemployment, the pickup in employment growth, and anecdotal reports of increased plans to hire all paint a favorable labor market picture for the Fourth District.	13	1
201412	1214	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	We do not yet see much evidence of broad wage or price pressures either up or down.	13	1
201412	1215	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My directors continue to report that wage gains are moderate in the 2 to 3 percent range, on average.	13	1
201412	1216	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturers reported that lower-skilled production jobs are readily filled without significant wage growth.	13	1
201412	1217	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	However, we also continue to receive reports of wage pressures increasing for hard-to-find skills and also in high-cost locations.	13	1
201412	1218	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	In general, prices for finished goods remain stable, although we have received reports of higher nonlabor input costs, such as freight charges, despite the lower fuel costs.	13	1
201412	1219	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My view of the national economy is little changed since the previous meeting.	13	1
201412	1220	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Incoming information has largely been positive and has given me more confidence that momentum is increasing.	13	1
201412	1221	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Growth is picking up, and labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201412	1222	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	We see this across a broad range of indicators, including payroll and household employment, and job openings and quits in JOLTS, which are trending higher and have recently hit multiyear highs.	13	1
201412	1223	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The percentage of the labor force employed part time for economic reasons remains elevated relative to the period from about 1995 until the crisis, but it, too, has declined significantly and stands at the level we saw in the early 1990s.	13	1
201412	1224	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	There are even tentative signs from the employment cost index that wage gains may be starting to pick up.	13	1
201412	1225	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, headline inflation has moved further below our target of 2 percent, driven by the sharp decline in oil prices.	13	1
201412	1226	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	This change in prices partly reflects weaker global demand, but most analyses indicate that it has been driven mainly by supply changes.	13	1
201412	1227	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So far there’s been little pass-through to core inflation measures, which have remained relatively stable.	13	1
201412	1228	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m not anticipating much pass-through because, although results vary across studies, most of the research, including that by the Cleveland Fed staff, suggests that pass-through of energy price shocks to core inflation has been fairly muted since the 1990s.	13	1
201412	1229	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	On balance, lower oil prices should be a net positive for the US economy, although a fair amount of media attention is focused on the negative effects on domestic oil producers.	13	1
201412	1230	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So long as inflation expectations remain anchored, the appropriate monetary policy response to a negative oil supply shock would not be to increase the level of accommodation.	13	1
201412	1231	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the positive effect on growth from the drop in oil prices will point to slightly tighter policy being appropriate.	13	1
201412	1232	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Of course, this is dependent on inflation expectations remaining anchored.	13	1
201412	1233	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I do not find the declines we’ve seen in some of the market-based inflation compensation measures as that troubling yet.	13	1
201412	1234	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So far the changes in expectations are within the ranges we’ve seen in recent years and partly reflect changes in liquidity and risk premiums.	13	1
201412	1235	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s 10-year CPI inflation expectations measure, which was mentioned earlier, has remained quite stable near 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1236	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Survey measures like the SPF have also been stable, and as the Board staff indicates, the decline in the medium-run inflation expectations measure from the Michigan survey could be reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices rather than a sustained drop in inflation expectations.	13	1
201412	1237	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I do think we need to keep our eyes on inflation developments.	13	1
201412	1238	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	We also should remember that inflation expectations are endogenous.	13	1
201412	1239	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	To the extent that we believe that the downward pressure on inflation is transitory, we should make sure that message is conveyed.	13	1
201412	1240	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My outlook remains positive.	13	1
201412	1241	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project GDP growth to be about 3 percent over the next couple of years before returning to trend growth of 2½ percent in 2017.	13	1
201412	1242	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The factors supporting above-trend growth include highly accommodative monetary policy, improving household and business balance sheets and confidence, and strengthening labor markets.	13	1
201412	1243	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	As the expansion continues, I expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline over the forecast horizon, slightly undershooting and then returning to 5½ percent, my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate, in 2017.	13	1
201412	1244	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Lower oil and commodity prices will temporarily lower headline inflation, but as these prices stabilize, the economy continues to expand at a slightly above-trend pace, and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable.	13	1
201412	1245	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I project inflation to gradually rise to our 2 percent objective by the end of 2016.	13	1
201412	1246	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My projections are dependent on appropriate monetary policy, which, in my view, should reflect actual and projected progress toward the Committee objectives, including the speed with which progress is being made.	13	1
201412	1247	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I believe we should recognize the substantial progress we’ve made toward our goal of full employment.	13	1
201412	1248	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I expect that progress to continue, perhaps at an accelerated pace.	13	1
201412	1249	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Under these conditions, a key condition informing my expected liftoff of the fed funds rate from the zero lower bound is when projected inflation between one and two years ahead reaches the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1250	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My projection continues to show us reaching this liftoff condition in the first quarter of 2015, and I’ve incorporated this into my projections.	13	1
201412	1251	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	After liftoff, as the expansion continues at an above-trend rate in my projection, I believe it will be appropriate to raise interest rates gradually for a time, similar to a path suggested by a Taylor 1999 rule with inertia, but then to raise rates at a pace more in line with a less inertial Taylor rule.	13	1
201412	1252	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	There continue to be a number of risks to the forecast, but I view these as balanced.	13	1
201412	1253	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The recent volatility in private financial markets, driven by the drop in oil prices, has a potential for broader spillovers.	13	1
201412	1254	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Also, conditions abroad may have worsened since our October meeting.	13	1
201412	1255	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, there also seem to be better prospects now for an effective policy response in key economies there, including the euro area.	13	1
201412	1256	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	On the positive side, US growth and employment may be picking up at a faster pace than projected, which suggests we’re getting close to liftoff, and we should remain focused on preparing the public for it.	13	1
201412	1257	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m not sure the public understands that forward-looking monetary policy means it will be appropriate to begin reducing the degree of policy accommodation when the outlook calls for future inflation to be at our goal even though trailing headline inflation is below our goal, and, similarly, when the unemployment rate is not yet at its estimated long-run level.	13	1
201412	1258	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the SEP indicates that all but one participant sees inflation below 2 percent at the time of liftoff, and all but five see inflation at 1 percent or less at the time of liftoff.	13	1
201412	1259	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	In our desire to clarify that we take the downside risk to inflation very seriously, we may have conveyed less of the consensus view that the effect of the oil price shock on inflation is likely to be transitory, and that lower oil prices are likely to be a net positive for the US economy.	13	1
201412	1260	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m concerned that people have taken too negative a read of our views and haven’t fully appreciated the positive developments.	13	1
201412	1261	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Unless the public understands the outlook as we see it, I’m not sure they’ll understand the rationale for our change in policy, whenever that time comes.	13	1
201412	1262	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1263	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1264	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201412	1265	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1266	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District economy continued to expand during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201412	1267	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The unemployment rate across District MSAs dropped to 6.0 percent during the most recent reporting period, just 0.2 higher than the national unemployment rate.	13	1
201412	1268	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Before the 2007–09 recession, the District unemployment rate tended to run slightly higher than the national average.	13	1
201412	1269	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	During much of the past five years, however, the national unemployment rate was notably higher than what we measured in the Eighth District.	13	1
201412	1270	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The fact that these two rates have returned to their historical relationship during 2014 can be taken as a sign of a return to normalcy in US labor markets.	13	1
201412	1271	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Eighth District business contacts surveyed during the intermeeting period expressed a generally optimistic outlook for local economic conditions in 2015.	13	1
201412	1272	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, 63 percent said they expect business conditions to improve further in 2015, while only 5 percent said they expect business conditions to be worse.	13	1
201412	1273	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal information also suggests a slight increase in prices during the fourth quarter.	13	1
201412	1274	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Sixty-five percent of contacts reported that prices charged to consumers have stayed about the same as a year ago, while 21 percent reported an increase and 14 percent reported a decrease.	13	1
201412	1275	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	First-quarter expectations suggest an upward movement in prices with about half of business contacts expecting to keep prices unchanged and 34 percent expecting to increase them.	13	1
201412	1276	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I took this to indicate deflation is not imminent.	13	1
201412	1277	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Business contacts with a national footprint were optimistic about the current holiday season.	13	1
201412	1278	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	A contact at a very large retailer felt that the climate for consumer expenditures will be much stronger this holiday season than last year due to decreasing gasoline prices and a more stable political environment in Washington.	13	1
201412	1279	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Another very large retailer reported strong demand for electronics as well as impressive foot traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores.	13	1
201412	1280	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We are hearing continuing reports of serious congestion problems in the national railway system, tending to slow down service and push up costs, as President Lockhart alluded to.	13	1
201412	1281	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	A logistics firm that hires tens of thousands of temporary workers during the holiday season said it expects to keep more of these workers on after the holidays than it has in the past.	13	1
201412	1282	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I found these anecdotal reports encouraging.	13	1
201412	1283	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	For the national economy, in my view the story continues to be that the US economy has considerable momentum and is being further aided by two tailwinds:  a lower rate structure as compared with several months ago and a sharp drop in oil and gasoline prices.	13	1
201412	1284	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	For the momentum part of the story, we can consider that GDP growth has likely been in excess of 4 percent at an annual rate over the second and third quarters of 2014, and that many private- sector tracking estimates of current-quarter GDP growth are running about 3 percent.	13	1
201412	1285	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Based on my discussions with CEO District contacts, I think there may be some upside risk to the 3 percent number, so that early next year we could be looking at three very strong GDP growth quarters in a row.	13	1
201412	1286	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Commensurate with this robust performance, labor markets have been improving more rapidly than many around this table anticipated.	13	1
201412	1287	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment will likely continue to tick down and is within just a few jobs reports of the Committee’s central tendency for the long-run value of this important variable.	13	1
201412	1288	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, some recent reports on retail sales, consumer confidence, and industrial production seem to confirm a narrative of substantial economic strength.	13	1
201412	1289	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Based on the performance of the real economy alone, my judgment is that the Committee can no longer justify its continued zero-rate policy.	13	1
201412	1290	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	These data are far too hot to rationalize what was really an unprecedented emergency policy in reaction to a very severe crisis.	13	1
201412	1291	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Even for those who think my characterization of the US economy is too rosy, I think that the most that can be said is that the Committee should perhaps be running a policy with rates somewhat below normal, but not pinned down all the way to the floor at zero.	13	1
201412	1292	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Even as we begin to normalize the policy rate next year, monetary policy will likely remain very accommodative for several years.	13	1
201412	1293	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The real economy is strongly signaling that we need to get on with this process before it gets away from us and causes us to take more drastic action later or possibly face a new crisis.	13	1
201412	1294	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I might also remark that, in terms of goal variables, if you take unemployment and inflation and you put a quadratic objective on them and look at how far inflation is from target and how far unemployment is from target, we’re about as close as the Committee has ever been to our goal variables in that respect.	13	1
201412	1295	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We’re closer than we have been 90 percent of the time since 1960.	13	1
201412	1296	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	There are two caveats to the view that I just outlined.	13	1
201412	1297	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	One is the international situation and the other is inflation.	13	1
201412	1298	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning the international outlook, many in financial markets have been concerned that slower growth in Europe, Japan, and China bodes ill for the US macroeconomic outlook.	13	1
201412	1299	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We also saw part of the Tealbook looking at a scenario of weaker foreign growth.	13	1
201412	1300	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that the situation as it currently stands is threatening to the United States in a direct sense.	13	1
201412	1301	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	While there is certainly some direct effect on the United States from slower global growth, my sense is that the United States is actually likely to benefit from a lower rate structure globally than would have otherwise occurred and from lower oil and gasoline prices than would have otherwise occurred.	13	1
201412	1302	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The risk, from the perspective of this Committee, with respect to foreign developments is that weak economic performance abroad morphs into a full-blown financial crisis, most likely in Europe or China, as it did in Europe in 2011 and 2012.	13	1
201412	1303	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Developments in that direction would have important impacts on US financial markets and likely on US macroeconomic performance.	13	1
201412	1304	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	However, as we sit here today, I do not see this as something that we can predict with much accuracy, and I do not think it is any more likely today than it has been since ECB President Draghi’s “whatever it takes” speech in London in 2012 brought the previous crisis to a conclusion.	13	1
201412	1305	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Domestic inflation has been running below the Committee’s target, but my current forecast continues to call for inflation returning to target over the medium term.	13	1
201412	1306	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The fact that inflation is running below target is enough to justify a policy rate that is somewhat lower than normal, but it is not enough to justify a policy rate that remains pinned down at zero.	13	1
201412	1307	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	According to leading New Keynesian theories, the main determinant of actual inflation is inflation expectations, and, in this regard, the steep decline in TIPS breakeven inflation rates is quite disconcerting.	13	1
201412	1308	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I also learned a lot from President Kocherlakota’s memo on inflation and inflation expectations and inflation risk premiums.	13	1
201412	1309	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that the Board staff is too quick to dismiss these important market developments on inflation expectations.	13	1
201412	1310	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The worry for me is not so much that year-over-year PCE inflation remains somewhat low, but rather that the shift in inflation expectations is so severe that actual inflation begins to fall further just at the point when the Committee is trying to take on board the robust developments in the real economy.	13	1
201412	1311	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This may create a situation in which inflation expectations and actual inflation continue to fall instead of rising back toward target as I expect.	13	1
201412	1312	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	A modern central bank cannot afford to be complacent about inflation expectations that are shifting away from target over periods as long as 5 and 10 years.	13	1
201412	1313	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This problem is severe enough—the 5-year TIPS breakeven was 115 basis points on Friday—that the Committee needs to be prepared to arrest this trend if necessary.	13	1
201412	1314	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I will discuss ways to be prepared for this possibility more in my policy remarks tomorrow.	13	1
201412	1315	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1316	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1317	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201412	1318	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1319	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The outlook for the Third District has improved somewhat since our previous meeting.	13	1
201412	1320	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity continues to grow moderately, and expectations of future activity remain very optimistic.	13	1
201412	1321	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey current activity index for November came in at an extraordinarily high number of 40.8, the highest reading since 1993.	13	1
201412	1322	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Unfortunately, most of that was in seasonal- adjustment factors and probably wasn’t expected to be sustained.	13	1
201412	1323	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Nonetheless, it still showed great strength.	13	1
201412	1324	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The industrial production numbers that came in just this week showed very strong activity, as has been noted several times, and also the capacity utilization rate was very high, almost near historical averages.	13	1
201412	1325	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Very strong performance.	13	1
201412	1326	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Looking ahead to our December BOS results, which will be released on Thursday at 10:00 am, they pulled back, as we probably expected, from the 40 to 23.2, which is about where they were in October, the month before—still a very strong number and well above the sort of nonrecessionary averages for that survey.	13	1
201412	1327	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Even though it fell back, it’s still a very strong number.	13	1
201412	1328	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Contacts in the region confirm this assessment, as do most of our recent state indicators, which are composed mostly of employment growth, unemployment rates, manufacturing hours, and wage and salary data.	13	1
201412	1329	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Growth is broad based across a wide range of manufacturing categories.	13	1
201412	1330	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	This strength is mirrored in our new Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey.	13	1
201412	1331	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Its current activity index remains at a high level of 41.2.	13	1
201412	1332	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Just as important, though, is the Future General Activity Index, which continues to show a high degree of optimism in the District.	13	1
201412	1333	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	At 54.1 in December—again, to be announced on Thursday—it is relatively close to where it was the previous month, which was 57.7—again, very high numbers for optimism.	13	1
201412	1334	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Moreover, there is a new statistic we have created that measures the dispersion of the responses for future activity and has shown a marked decline in recent months; based on our research, this indicates less uncertainty about the future than perhaps existed in the past, which is also encouraging.	13	1
201412	1335	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	A reduction in this uncertainty statistic, we found, is indicative of future strength in our index for capital expenditures.	13	1
201412	1336	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The results of a special question on labor markets, which was summarized in the staff briefing earlier, showed continued improvement.	13	1
201412	1337	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Fifty-six percent of the manufacturers said they expected to hire additional workers over the next 12 months.	13	1
201412	1338	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	That is up from 45 percent in January.	13	1
201412	1339	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	And 59 percent of the nonmanufacturers indicated the same thing—again, up from 44 percent in January.	13	1
201412	1340	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	As in the nation, auto sales in the District are robust.	13	1
201412	1341	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Non-auto retailers contacted around Thanksgiving reported modest growth.	13	1
201412	1342	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Construction of high-rise office buildings in Center City is robust.	13	1
201412	1343	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It now includes the new Comcast Tower, which has shown up in the F.W.	13	1
201412	1344	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Dodge index for the value of contracts for nonresidential buildings, creating a huge spike in our local contracting number.	13	1
201412	1345	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	There are two other buildings coming on line soon.	13	1
201412	1346	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	However, as indicated by growth of only 2 percent in permits for single-family housing, residential real estate is exhibiting, at best, only modest growth and modest house price appreciation, and the modest house price appreciation we have experienced has slowed even a bit more.	13	1
201412	1347	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	On the other hand, the multifamily sector of the market remains very strong.	13	1
201412	1348	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the national outlook, my view has not really changed very much since our last SEP, and I remain fairly upbeat.	13	1
201412	1349	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	For me, the intermeeting releases have resulted not so much in a change in my forecast but in me becoming more confident about the sustainability of the growth we have seen and about my outlook in general.	13	1
201412	1350	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	A portion of that optimism revolves around continued increasing strength in the labor market.	13	1
201412	1351	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	And 2014 will likely see the strongest change in employment in any calendar year since 1999 and the strongest 12-month interval by the end of this year of any period since early 2000.	13	1
201412	1352	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s a pretty extraordinary record to have the strongest employment growth in nearly a decade and a half.	13	1
201412	1353	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, this strength should support somewhat stronger-than-trend growth, in my view, in 2015.	13	1
201412	1354	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Moreover, a wide range of other labor market conditions, including broader measures of unemployment and the JOLTS data, are also consistent with continued improvements in the labor market.	13	1
201412	1355	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Given the ongoing strength in the labor market, a continued consistent decline in household debt-to-income ratios, improved household access to credit, and falling prices at the pump, I project that consumer spending will grow slightly above trend next year.	13	1
201412	1356	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I anticipate that business investment will grow at about trend and residential investment will grow modestly.	13	1
201412	1357	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Putting these broad features together leads me to continue anticipating aggregate growth of about 3 percent next year, falling to about 2.6 percent in 2016 and 2.5 percent in 2017, which is near the high end of my estimate for trend growth, which is between 2.3 and 2.5 percent.	13	1
201412	1358	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	By the way, I am number 14, if anybody is interested.	13	1
201412	1359	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to look at what has happened in the past year.	13	1
201412	1360	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s pretty remarkable.	13	1
201412	1361	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	In the third quarter of 2013, real GDP growth was 4½ percent.	13	1
201412	1362	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	In the fourth quarter of 2013, 3½ percent.	13	1
201412	1363	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Of course, then we had the aberration in the first quarter with the winter, which was negative 2 percent; second quarter of 2014, 4.6 percent; third quarter of 2014, 4.6 percent.	13	1
201412	1364	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	At least those are the current estimates.	13	1
201412	1365	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The fourth quarter of 2014 is likely to be close to 3 percent.	13	1
201412	1366	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	That is five out of six quarters of 3½-plus percent growth.	13	1
201412	1367	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s a pretty extraordinary record for the past five quarters.	13	1
201412	1368	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	How much evidence does it take us to believe that policy needs to adjust to that strong growth and become a little less accommodative than zero interest rates?	13	1
201412	1369	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Continued labor market strength leads me to forecast the unemployment rate falling to 5.7 percent by the end of this year.	13	1
201412	1370	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Next year we will see it continue to fall, although probably at a somewhat slower rate, because we are almost at what we think is the long-term sustainable pace.	13	1
201412	1371	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We are very near our unemployment rate range that the Committee has for the sustainable rate in the long term.	13	1
201412	1372	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we will be at 5.4 percent before the middle of next year, and that will begin slowly shrinking, reaching only 5.3 percent by the end of next year.	13	1
201412	1373	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Headline inflation will be somewhat softer over the next couple of quarters, as we all know, reflecting the decline in energy prices.	13	1
201412	1374	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	But those prices should stabilize, and headline inflation will return to that 1½ to 2 percent range over the second half of next year and, I believe, converge to 2 percent in 2016.	13	1
201412	1375	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	This Committee correctly looked through the very large oil price increases and the increases in headline inflation that we witnessed in 2011, when headline inflation reached over 3 percent in some months and in some quarters.	13	1
201412	1376	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to do the same thing here.	13	1
201412	1377	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We should not let the change in relative prices and their effects on headline inflation drive us to largely reassess our view of inflation in the longer term.	13	1
201412	1378	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Again, as many people have said, as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored—and I believe they are—I’m not going to repeat the evidence that others have offered.	13	1
201412	1379	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	My own view of appropriate policy is somewhat different from my previous SEP submission.	13	1
201412	1380	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I have reduced my long-run neutral rate from 4 to 3.75 percent, which I think is consistent mostly for demographic reasons.	13	1
201412	1381	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I have also reduced my policy rate because the rules I follow suggest that inflation is going to get back to 2 percent a little later than I previously thought.	13	1
201412	1382	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	That is cause for making a more gradual adjustment in my policy rate.	13	1
201412	1383	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	My path calls for liftoff in the first quarter of next year, with gradual rate hikes reaching an IOER rate of 2 percent, but I guess we don’t use IOER—1.875 percent for the midpoint of the federal funds rate target range, to be more precise, by the end of next year.	13	1
201412	1384	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I believe by 2017 we should be at our long-run neutral rate of 3.75 percent.	13	1
201412	1385	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I think this path is both feasible and desirable, is gradual, and is measured in its approach.	13	1
201412	1386	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I continue to be concerned that if we do not begin this process reasonably promptly, we will face a much higher risk of having to raise rates much more quickly and, thus, returning to those old go-stop policies of the past.	13	1
201412	1387	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	When we do that, we will induce greater, not less, economic and financial instability in the years to come.	13	1
201412	1388	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, while the Committee may still believe that June is a reasonable expectation for liftoff, I believe it is very important that we convey in our language and our messaging to the markets that there remains significant probability on liftoff before then, and mostly in the first quarter.	13	1
201412	1389	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We may not lift off in the first quarter, but the more we encourage the markets to have zero probability on that event, when the time comes for us to move—if that happens to be earlier than the market expects—then we will probably be faced with having to surprise the market substantially and create more volatility than would indeed be necessary.	13	1
201412	1390	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1391	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1392	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201412	1393	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1394	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy has continued to expand at a relatively steady pace, with the exception of energy and agricultural production.	13	1
201412	1395	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Most of our industry contacts note positive expectations for both consumer spending and business activity in the months ahead.	13	1
201412	1396	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	District labor markets have improved further alongside an expanding economy.	13	1
201412	1397	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Exemplifying the recent strength, unemployment rates declined considerably in October, with five of the District’s seven states reporting unemployment rates that range from a low of 3.4 percent in Nebraska to 4.7 percent in Wyoming.	13	1
201412	1398	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Recent surveys showed that firms expected wage increases to average just over 3 percent for their current employees, while wage increases for new employees were reported to be considerably higher, averaging 4.7 percent.	13	1
201412	1399	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Wage increases were expected to be especially prevalent for skilled positions in transportation, banking, IT, and construction.	13	1
201412	1400	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	A large trucking firm reported that drivers’ wages would be increased 13 percent, effective in January.	13	1
201412	1401	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	In agriculture, low crop prices are expected to stress some producers over the coming year as working capital erodes because of weaker profit margins.	13	1
201412	1402	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	For the most part, however, farmland values have remained relatively steady despite weaker incomes.	13	1
201412	1403	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	With respect to District energy producers, the steady decline in oil prices has led to diminished expectations for drilling activity next year.	13	1
201412	1404	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	One District contact currently expects that if oil prices are in the $60 to $70 range next year, there will be a 20 percent decline in cap- ex.	13	1
201412	1405	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	The declines should occur gradually based on existing leasing arrangements on drilling equipment and the fact that many firms have hedged prices for about half of their production next year.	13	1
201412	1406	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Larger declines in production activity and corresponding layoffs could occur if low prices persist into 2016.	13	1
201412	1407	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed since our previous meeting, and my confidence in the economy’s fundamentals continues to grow.	13	1
201412	1408	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	A stronger labor market across many dimensions points to a sustainable growth outlook.	13	1
201412	1409	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	With payroll growth averaging 250,000 per month over the past six months, labor demand has picked up for middle-skill jobs, those that were most negatively affected during the recession.	13	1
201412	1410	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Correspondingly, employment growth has picked up for workers with a high school diploma and some college education, two groups of workers that had experienced only limited recovery prior to this year.	13	1
201412	1411	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	The Board staff memos on the labor market and cyclical dynamics offered useful insights on the progress toward our objectives.	13	1
201412	1412	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Similarly, my staff constructed a measure that offers additional information on the amount of spare capacity in the economy.	13	1
201412	1413	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	It combines four different output gap measures along with fiscal policy information, such as personal current tax and corporate tax receipts, to produce a sort of composite output gap.	13	1
201412	1414	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	This measure shows the current output gap in the range of about 1 percent.	13	1
201412	1415	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Assuming trend growth of 2 percent, a growth rate of 3 percent over the next year will eliminate the excess capacity in the economy according to this measure.	13	1
201412	1416	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	If labor market conditions continue to evolve at a similar pace of improvement, as we have seen over the past 12 months, the economy looks to be about a year away from full capacity and full employment.	13	1
201412	1417	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	With the labor market approaching a level consistent with sustainable long-run economic growth, upward pressure on wages should begin to emerge.	13	1
201412	1418	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	As the quits rate has increased over the past two years, average wage growth from job switchers has risen from roughly 4.3 percent per quarter in early 2013 to 5.6 percent in the third quarter of this year.	13	1
201412	1419	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Wage growth was highest for switchers in leisure and hospitality and professional and business services.	13	1
201412	1420	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	It was lower for switchers in manufacturing, education, and health industries.	13	1
201412	1421	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	With the quits rates rising and returning to pre-recession levels, I expect to see even greater wage growth for job switchers, and eventually for others, as competitive pressures take hold.	13	1
201412	1422	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding inflation, I expect in the near term there will be downward pressure on domestic prices exerted by slower global growth and the recent shifts in foreign exchange rates.	13	1
201412	1423	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	If energy prices should continue to fall, we could see inflation expectations sag.	13	1
201412	1424	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Notwithstanding such risk, I expect that strong economic growth and a return of labor market conditions toward full employment levels over the next year will move inflation toward our target level within the next two years.	13	1
201412	1425	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	In particular, increasing nominal wage growth should provide upward pressure on inflation, particularly in labor-intensive industries such as the services sector, for which the recent QSS report showed stronger-than-expected consumption of services in the second half of 2014.	13	1
201412	1426	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1427	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1428	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201412	1429	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1430	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I plan to discuss my troubling inflation outlook, some evidence from labor markets in support of that outlook, and the credibility risk posed by that outlook.	13	1
201412	1431	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I talk about my inflation outlook, I just want to be clear about my monetary policy assumption.	13	1
201412	1432	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My monetary policy assumption that I’m going to be using for the purpose of these remarks is similar to that in Tealbook A, so liftoff in the second quarter of 2015.	13	1
201412	1433	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That differs from what I do see as appropriate monetary policy.	13	1
201412	1434	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m respondent number 10 in the SEP.	13	1
201412	1435	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Like financial markets, I see the fed funds rate at the end of 2017 as being around 2 percent, and so my path for the fed funds rate is considerably lower than the central tendency of this Committee or as modeled in Tealbook A.	13	1
201412	1436	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, for the purposes of these remarks, as I said at the beginning, I’m going to be using the same monetary policy assumption as described in Tealbook A.	13	1
201412	1437	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Under that monetary policy assumption, I see inflation returning to target, but only very gradually, in 2018.	13	1
201412	1438	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be useful for us to spend more time in our conversations to dig into the differences in our outlooks for inflation.	13	1
201412	1439	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought it was great that some people were offering very specific forecasts that differed from that in Tealbook A, and I thought that was important because that presumably shapes the differences in our policy outlook as well.	13	1
201412	1440	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Digging into why we have those differences in those inflation outlooks, I think, could be very useful.	13	1
201412	1441	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For me, a key factor underlying my inflation outlook is that improvements in economic activity are anticipated to put only modest upward pressure on inflation.	13	1
201412	1442	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the Phillips curve is relatively flat.	13	1
201412	1443	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, this flatness is broadly consistent with the recent behavior of labor markets both in the Ninth District and in the nation.	13	1
201412	1444	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the Ninth District, in some ways labor markets are very tight there, and we’ve heard some unemployment rates mentioned.	13	1
201412	1445	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now let’s talk about some low unemployment.	13	1
201412	1446	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate in the Minneapolis–St Paul metropolitan area, which has a population of about 3 million, was 3.2 percent in October.	13	1
201412	1447	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate in Fargo was 2.2 percent.	13	1
201412	1448	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s hardly surprising, with these kinds of unemployment rates, that we hear widespread reports that firms can’t find desirable workers.	13	1
201412	1449	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, despite these labor shortages, we continue to hear relatively few reports of wage pressures.	13	1
201412	1450	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, outside of the oil boom area in western North Dakota, our business contacts consistently report wage growth in 2014 of 2 to 3 percent, although the reports are often closer to the top of that range than they were a couple years ago.	13	1
201412	1451	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These are backward-looking data, obviously, so if we look forward it might be different.	13	1
201412	1452	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What was most surprising to me, I have to say, is that this general pattern holds true even in Fargo, which I had mentioned earlier has a 2.2 percent unemployment rate.	13	1
201412	1453	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, many of you, I’m sure, remember your North Dakota geography, but just in case you don’t [laughter], Fargo is on the eastern edge of North Dakota, and it’s 400 miles from the heart of the oil boom on the western side of the state.	13	1
201412	1454	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s a big state.	13	1
201412	1455	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So this is on the wage-pressure side, and I think one thing we should be trying to drill in at and trying to get a better understanding of is how those wage pressures translate into pricing pressures.	13	1
201412	1456	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s the next step actually, right?	13	1
201412	1457	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because our goals are shaped in terms of price inflation.	13	1
201412	1458	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our business contacts generally do not see themselves as having much power to raise prices.	13	1
201412	1459	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When they talk about wage increases, they say that they will be absorbing those wage increases by reducing margins.	13	1
201412	1460	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of hard evidence, the latest year-over-year CPI increase in the Twin Cities was less than 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1461	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This basic story is also playing out in the national economy.	13	1
201412	1462	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have seen a striking improvement in employment in 2014, and it’s possible to see some signs of compensation pressures emerging in the past few quarters.	13	1
201412	1463	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, by and large, the improvement in the labor market activity has been associated with little change in wage and price growth.	13	1
201412	1464	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this recent national evidence and recent Ninth District evidence are consistent with the flat Phillips curves that underlie the Tealbook’s and my sluggish inflation outlook.	13	1
201412	1465	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, of course, inflation has already been below target for over 30 months, and, in my assessment, this projected long stay—something like seven to eight years below 2 percent— creates substantial risk to the credibility of our target.	13	1
201412	1466	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If I were asked, I, too, would answer as several Presidents answered before me.	13	1
201412	1467	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do believe that our expectations remain well anchored.	13	1
201412	1468	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My core fundamental belief is that.	13	1
201412	1469	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have faith in that.	13	1
201412	1470	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, I think there is evidence that suggests that there is some risk to that credibility.	13	1
201412	1471	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The continued decline in market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations over the intermeeting period suggests that the downside risk to our target may already be materializing.	13	1
201412	1472	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the Minneapolis staff and I stressed in the memo we sent in the intermeeting period, we think it’s important not to remove these risk premiums when thinking about these market- based measures.	13	1
201412	1473	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even if you don’t buy into that story, I think that the decline has to be seen as being a signal that we’re seeing a decline in longer-term inflation expectations themselves.	13	1
201412	1474	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Of course, declines in longer-term inflation expectations would spill back and create further downside risks to inflation itself.	13	1
201412	1475	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to stress that this erosion of credibility scenario is still only a risk to my baseline outlook, and I wouldn’t necessarily say that it’s a high probability risk.	13	1
201412	1476	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The problem is that the experience in Japan and the more recent experience in Europe both suggest that it would be very hard for us to respond effectively to this risk if it were to materialize.	13	1
201412	1477	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Japanese central bank is relying on extensive support from the fiscal authority to be able to respond effectively.	13	1
201412	1478	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should not be building that into our tools about how to respond to that scenario.	13	1
201412	1479	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For that reason it’s a risk that bulks large in my policy thinking, and I’ll say more about that in the next go-round, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1480	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1481	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201412	1482	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1483	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Like many others, I’m more confident about the strength and durability of expansion.	13	1
201412	1484	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	There are several reasons for that.	13	1
201412	1485	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the passage of time is important.	13	1
201412	1486	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Many of the headwinds that have blunted the economy’s momentum in recent years have subsided.	13	1
201412	1487	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The most obvious is on the fiscal side.	13	1
201412	1488	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I expect the fiscal impulse in 2015 to be slightly positive when one includes both the federal and state and local government sectors.	13	1
201412	1489	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Another headwind that’s subsiding is credit availability.	13	1
201412	1490	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s continuing to improve.	13	1
201412	1491	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Some of this presumably represents the better-capitalized banking system, but some may also be due to improved confidence by lenders in the economic outlook.	13	1
201412	1492	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, in assessing consumption, I think, along with many others, the outlook is quite positive.	13	1
201412	1493	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The real income trend is strengthening, helped by lower energy prices, faster payroll growth, and higher hours worked.	13	1
201412	1494	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Interesting to me, the New York Fed’s most recent Survey of Consumer Expectations, which was released last week, shows a meaningful uptick in household one-year-ahead expectations for both nominal earnings growth and nominal household income.	13	1
201412	1495	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Translate that to real, and it’s an even bigger uptick.	13	1
201412	1496	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, lower oil prices I view as likely to be a substantial positive for global growth.	13	1
201412	1497	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, the lower headline inflation is already provoking a more-aggressive monetary policy response in Europe and Japan, and, more importantly, the drop in oil prices should lead to a shift in the global fiscal stance toward stimulus as oil exporters faced with much lower oil income run smaller surpluses and/or bigger deficits.	13	1
201412	1498	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other side, for some oil importers, the drop in energy prices represents a very large windfall.	13	1
201412	1499	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This is a huge transfer from oil producers to importers.	13	1
201412	1500	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	A $40 drop in the per barrel price of oil represents a transfer of about $1 trillion a year from oil producers to oil importers, which I think is significant.	13	1
201412	1501	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the inflation outlook, I’m not very worried about the fact that lower oil prices are pushing down the headline inflation rate.	13	1
201412	1502	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The effect is likely to be temporary as long as it doesn’t affect wage trends or inflationary expectations, and I would say those conditions are broadly satisfied at this point.	13	1
201412	1503	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to survey measures of inflation expectations, it’s true that the November University of Michigan survey dipped, but we saw a partial retracement of that in the December preliminary results.	13	1
201412	1504	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, I think the decline that we saw in the November Michigan survey is not really corroborated by other surveys of household inflation expectations.	13	1
201412	1505	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the New York Fed survey shows expectations at both the one-year and three-year horizons as having been stable recently.	13	1
201412	1506	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I asked my staff, “How should I reconcile the differences between the University of Michigan results and the New York Fed survey, and what should I put more weight on?”	13	1
201412	1507	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	What do you think the answer was?	13	1
201412	1508	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think this reflects bias [laughter] in the particular measurement.	13	1
201412	1509	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s a pretty strong case to be made that the New York Fed survey is actually the superior measure.	13	1
201412	1510	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	A few key points worth mentioning.	13	1
201412	1511	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The first point is that the University of Michigan inflation expectations survey is much more sensitive to oil and gasoline price developments than the New York Fed survey.	13	1
201412	1512	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This may be due to the fact that the University of Michigan survey asks about prices, which brings gasoline prices into people’s minds, while the New York Fed survey asks the question in terms of inflation.	13	1
201412	1513	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The second point is when oil and gas prices drop, it’s quite common that this actually feeds through to 5-to-10- year-forward inflation expectations in the University of Michigan survey.	13	1
201412	1514	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, what we’re seeing in terms of the University of Michigan survey right now—a big drop in oil prices and that leading to a drop in 5-to-10-year-forward inflation expectations—is not unusual.	13	1
201412	1515	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s actually pretty typical, and that means, I think, we should discount it more heavily.	13	1
201412	1516	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The last point is that there seems to be quite a bit more noise in the University of Michigan survey compared with the New York Fed survey in terms of measurement error.	13	1
201412	1517	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The sample for the New York Fed survey is considerably larger, and, more importantly, it’s panel data.	13	1
201412	1518	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re asking the same people the same question month after month.	13	1
201412	1519	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the New York Fed survey appears to be the more reliable measure.	13	1
201412	1520	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to wages, which is sort of the second parameter that might cause you to become more worried about inflation expectations, the trend doesn’t seem to have changed much.	13	1
201412	1521	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, there’s no evidence that nominal wage growth is declining.	13	1
201412	1522	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, if you look really closely at the recent ECI and average hourly earnings data, if anything, wage compensation trends may be starting to firm just a little bit.	13	1
201412	1523	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the survey-based measures of inflation expectations, when I look at nominal wage growth, both of those series suggest that we should look through the effect of the oil price decline on overall inflation.	13	1
201412	1524	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With nominal incomes rising at more than a 4 percent annual rate and the risk of recession very low, it seems that the risk of the type of debt deflation dynamic for the United States is very low right now, and that’s very different than the situation in Europe and Japan, in which both inflation and nominal income growth are much lower.	13	1
201412	1525	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, when I review the inflation statistics, as I raised in the question to the staff earlier, I’m a bit surprised that the core deflator has remained stuck at 1½ percent.	13	1
201412	1526	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I was actually thinking that it would decline a bit because of the decline in energy prices and the appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201412	1527	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in many ways, although we’re wringing our hands and worrying that inflation is below our target, in some ways it’s actually a good thing.	13	1
201412	1528	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It does allow us to be more patient in terms of the timing of liftoff, and it also should enable us to probe more aggressively to see how low full employment actually is as we go through the monetary policy normalization process.	13	1
201412	1529	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If inflation was running at 2.3 percent or 2.4 percent today, we’d be having a very different conversation.	13	1
201412	1530	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’re going to want to let the unemployment rate fall slightly below its natural rate in order to push inflation up, and that has a pretty significant benefit.	13	1
201412	1531	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That tight labor market should create pressure to rehire some of the long-term unemployed, which would be good not just for them, but good for the country because it would expand the economy’s productive capacity.	13	1
201412	1532	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in terms of risks to the outlook, I think they really seem to lie mostly overseas at this point.	13	1
201412	1533	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	One risk we haven’t talked about in any detail is the recent developments in Russia.	13	1
201412	1534	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The ruble has declined precipitously.	13	1
201412	1535	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s caused the Russian central bank to raise interest rates substantially, and it’s not really clear that they’re in a position that’s going to turn out to be sustainable.	13	1
201412	1536	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This, of course, would ripple back mostly to Europe if you think about what the near-term effects would be, through the trade channel and also through their banking system exposures.	13	1
201412	1537	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Several large European banks have significant exposure to Russian corporates on the order of 50 percent or more of their core Tier 1 capital.	13	1
201412	1538	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the developments in Russia are also concerning from a geopolitical basis.	13	1
201412	1539	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I would think that as the economic circumstances of Russia deteriorate, Vladimir Putin will have an incentive to take greater risks geopolitically to divert attention from what’s an increasingly problematic domestic economy.	13	1
201412	1540	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1541	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1542	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201412	1543	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1544	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The economy, particularly the labor market, has made remarkable progress in the past two years, with U-3 having declined from 7.8 percent at the end of 2012 to 5.8 percent at present.	13	1
201412	1545	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	This means that the unemployment rate is now within hailing distance of the most recent estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201412	1546	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Indeed, it is tangential to the range that is given by the SEP, which ends at 5.8 percent.	13	1
201412	1547	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We should celebrate this.	13	1
201412	1548	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But, as an aside, we should note that there is a tendency for estimates of the natural rate to adjust adaptively to the actual rate.	13	1
201412	1549	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	It tends to come down.	13	1
201412	1550	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	This is serious—it tends to come down with the actual rates.	13	1
201412	1551	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure we’ll stay at 5.8 percent as the natural rate.	13	1
201412	1552	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But, in any case, we are much closer than we were until very recently.	13	1
201412	1553	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We are also seeing signs of faster output growth fueled mainly, I suppose, by the two forces of very low interest rates and the decline in the price of oil.	13	1
201412	1554	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We are seeing improvements in consumer sentiment and growth and investment, which seem to be picking up, aside from what may happen with regard to oil investment.	13	1
201412	1555	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Earlier speakers have expanded on the growth they are seeing in their Districts and in the data, and I agree with those who believe that the recent trends are more likely to have legs than the earlier false starts, but I will come back to that in a minute.	13	1
201412	1556	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, all of this looks very good, but we have some “buts.”	13	1
201412	1557	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, investment will be reduced by the decline in energy investment.	13	1
201412	1558	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Second, net exports will be reduced by the appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201412	1559	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Third, net exports will be reduced by the slowdown in foreign growth.	13	1
201412	1560	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Here I take some encouragement from the fact that the staff forecasts increases in foreign growth, particularly in Europe, in the coming years, and one really hopes that is right for many reasons.	13	1
201412	1561	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I suppose someone will talk about a Greek exit from the European monetary union or a substantial prolongation of European instability and extremely low, even negative, growth.	13	1
201412	1562	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But the Tealbook does not believe that will happen, and I take some comfort from that.	13	1
201412	1563	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Further, and here Vice Chairman Dudley and I have not spoken previously, we do not know how the volatility in the price of oil and the associated financial market instability will affect the world economy, nor do we know what the geopolitical consequences of the unfolding Russian economic crisis, which is becoming very difficult for the Russians, will be.	13	1
201412	1564	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	In short, although this feels much better, we do have to remind ourselves that two or three quarters of good data do not establish a solid trend.	13	1
201412	1565	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We have several times hoped we were heading back to 3 percent growth only to have to reduce our forecasts in light of weaker data.	13	1
201412	1566	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is also to say that we have always to remind ourselves that our forecasts have very wide, not narrow, confidence bands around them.	13	1
201412	1567	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Despite the headwinds I have just noted, I am, on balance, also relatively optimistic about the prospects for both the labor markets and overall growth.	13	1
201412	1568	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But there is inflation, and this has two aspects.	13	1
201412	1569	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, there is the large impact on the inflation rate of the decline in the price of oil.	13	1
201412	1570	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The Tealbook forecasts that the PCE price index will decline in both this quarter and the next quarter.	13	1
201412	1571	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But this energy price effect will be temporary.	13	1
201412	1572	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	As the Chair has said, the FOMC has looked through the higher price of oil on several previous occasions, including notably in 2008.	13	1
201412	1573	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The FOMC was right to do that then, and we will be similarly right to look through the lower price of oil now.	13	1
201412	1574	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I expect we will all agree that this is the right approach, in particular because the extremely low inflation expected in the next year or so is the result of a positive supply shock, which is growth-inducing, rather than the result of exceptionally low demand, which is the fear behind very low inflation when you are thinking of temporary inflation.	13	1
201412	1575	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The more serious inflation problem is to be found in the Tealbook forecast for core inflation for the coming years—2014 and 2015 have core inflation of 1½ percent, which is obviously significantly below our 2 percent target—and the Tealbook predicts that even by 2017 the core inflation rate will be 1.8 percent and not yet 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1576	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, how should we think about this core inflation?	13	1
201412	1577	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I have two main reactions.	13	1
201412	1578	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The first is to point out that 1.8 percent is very close to 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1579	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Using the staff’s baseline prediction for inflation, and estimating probabilities using stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model kindly supplied by the staff, the probability that inflation in 2017 will be greater than 2 percent is 40 percent, and above 1.8 percent is 48 percent.	13	1
201412	1580	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We are not talking about very different outcomes for inflation.	13	1
201412	1581	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	My second reaction is to say that while I believe the staff’s views as reflected in the Tealbook forecast are plausible, there are several possible reasons to expect, nonetheless, that nominal wage growth may begin to rise more than predicted in the Tealbook as the level of unemployment continues to decline.	13	1
201412	1582	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	One reason is the basic economics of supply and demand.	13	1
201412	1583	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is, of course, taken into account in the Tealbook, because there are increases in price inflation and nominal wage growth in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201412	1584	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But I would add to that a lesson of experience that when one proclaims the end of a well-established relationship, more often than not, that is the moment that the relationship makes its presence known shortly thereafter.	13	1
201412	1585	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think this may well happen again in the case of the flat Phillips curve.	13	1
201412	1586	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s go back to the key question, which is, what should we do?	13	1
201412	1587	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, what should we do if the labor markets continue to strengthen in the months to come, but core inflation remains around 1.5 percent?	13	1
201412	1588	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, we have two choices.	13	1
201412	1589	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Some would insist that we not begin normalization until the core inflation rate reaches 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1590	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	However, the consensus statement says—I had to mention it here—[laughter]—that in considering how to manage policy, we must follow a balanced approach with respect to the dual mandate.	13	1
201412	1591	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll expand on that tomorrow.	13	1
201412	1592	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1593	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1594	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201412	1595	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1596	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I join the general view that has been expressed this afternoon that the steady growth of what is almost now a year’s duration is likely to continue.	13	1
201412	1597	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Like President Lacker and a few others here, I found myself looking for reasons to believe that this time, the relatively strong performance will continue, as opposed to our past pattern of a period of sustained decent growth faltering after fiscal or monetary stimulus has been removed.	13	1
201412	1598	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Several of you have mentioned some reasons to believe that.	13	1
201412	1599	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I will just note three quickly.	13	1
201412	1600	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	One, I just alluded to the fact that, this time around, when we began tapering early this year and through the end of the LSAPs,, we didn’t see the kind of stumbles that occurred earlier when either fiscal or monetary stimulus was withdrawn, and what had been a promising period of an uptick in growth was followed by a disappointing couple of quarters.	13	1
201412	1601	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Two, as Jeff also noted, beyond the continued improvement in the unemployment rate and the recent strength of monthly jobs numbers, we are now seeing more structural dynamism in labor markets.	13	1
201412	1602	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Following on the increases in job openings, albeit with some lag, the quits rate has been edging up this year.	13	1
201412	1603	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	It is now solidly in pre-crisis territory, which is probably notable since each of the past two recessions resulted in the quits rate never quite getting back to where it had been previously.	13	1
201412	1604	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	That is some indication of an uptick in dynamism.	13	1
201412	1605	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The hires rate isn’t quite there yet, but it has also improved, on net, this year.	13	1
201412	1606	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Three, while it is hard to say where the equilibrium point for household debt is or should be, it is pretty clear that a considerable amount of deleveraging has taken place.	13	1
201412	1607	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	We are now at levels of household debt comparable with those prevailing in the early years of the past decade, before the effect of the mortgage mania had accelerated the growth of household debt.	13	1
201412	1608	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The pace of decline in the ratio of household debt to GDP has diminished considerably in the past year or so.	13	1
201412	1609	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	It is not unreasonable to think that the change in the second derivative will portend some leveling off of this ratio in the not-too-distant future, an inference that is buttressed by the fact that the dollar amount of total household debt has risen modestly over the past year.	13	1
201412	1610	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I should probably add that student debt accounts for a fair bit of that increase, and serious delinquency rates of student debt have risen quite a bit, now surpassing credit card debt, which was the traditional leader in this category.	13	1
201412	1611	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	This is hardly an unalloyed good.	13	1
201412	1612	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, as Governor Fischer and President Lockhart have already said, and I think Jay may say it as well, it is not as though we have unqualifiedly good news.	13	1
201412	1613	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that what we have seen explains and justifies the prevailing attitude today that, with continued progress for another couple of quarters, concerns about premature liftoff or the inevitable choppiness of the first rate increase will diminish enough to put a federal funds rate increase in play.	13	1
201412	1614	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	On the other hand, as Governor Fischer also pointed out, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty that remains.	13	1
201412	1615	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	On the upside of economic performance, it is possible that we would get unexpectedly high jobs numbers for the next few months, along with more concrete signs of accelerating wage increases.	13	1
201412	1616	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I’m sure that would lead some to want to consider an earlier liftoff.	13	1
201412	1617	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	From my perspective, there are at least two plausible scenarios that would make me, at least, more hesitant to move in the June–September timeframe that is represented by many of the dots of voters in this SEP.	13	1
201412	1618	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	One, which has already been mentioned by several people, is the external downside risk from global markets.	13	1
201412	1619	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	It is certainly reasonable to expect, as the Tealbook does, that the euro zone will improve slightly next year, and that some form of QE there will help stave off any deflationary or recession threat.	13	1
201412	1620	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But the euro zone does lack much capacity to absorb any further shocks, whether from renewed sovereign debt problems or geopolitical turmoil or other sources.	13	1
201412	1621	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Were things to go awry in the euro zone and China’s growth to slow more than the current consensus suggests, financial markets, and market psychology more generally, might pose risks to the United States.	13	1
201412	1622	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I know that most models suggest a limited vulnerability to external developments of this sort, but my memory, at least, of past episodes suggests that the models may be missing something, particularly in the absence of either fiscal or monetary stimulus in the United States.	13	1
201412	1623	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think Governor Brainard, fortunately, probably has a better perspective on this than I.	13	1
201412	1624	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The other scenario is the one that concerns me perhaps more, and that’s anticipating that jobs numbers and other indicators, including unemployment, may suggest, by the first part of next year, continued moderate strengthening of labor markets, but that there also would be evidence of labor participation increasing, part-time employment diminishing, and still no real signs of wage acceleration, much less upward pressure on inflation.	13	1
201412	1625	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The question would be what to do in those circumstances.	13	1
201412	1626	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	This returns me to a theme that I’ve sounded, probably ad nauseum, over the past year or two here, which is that with all of the uncertainties in labor markets, we all have to admit that we have been surprised about something that has happened in labor markets over the past couple of years, and we are well advised to be pretty pragmatic and pretty data sensitive in thinking about and assessing what is actually going on in labor markets.	13	1
201412	1627	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	There are some labor economists who are already beginning to do some work on what they find to be the changes in life-cycle labor market behavior that could conceivably be second only to the broad entry into the labor market of women over a three-decade period in changing the shape of labor market behavior.	13	1
201412	1628	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t know whether that is actually occurring yet, but we do know that a lot of things that have happened in labor markets—participation rates and other things—haven’t conformed to what might have been expected based on pre-crisis behavior.	13	1
201412	1629	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	This may be another area in which the crisis and the Great Recession have accelerated trends that were previously a little harder to detect.	13	1
201412	1630	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	When we look at wages and the anticipation of wage increases, even though the NFIB is now predicting more wage increases being paid by its members—we should probably note that they have been predicting that for two years now, and we haven’t yet seen it realized.	13	1
201412	1631	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	As I think Presidents Kocherlakota and Rosengren have both pointed out, in some discrete analyses that their staffs did, there is some reason to believe that the performance of labor markets and wage markets in the past is not necessarily a great predictor of where we are right now.	13	1
201412	1632	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Then Governor Fischer alluded to the Phillips-curve issue, and that the slope may indeed change or revert to where it has been.	13	1
201412	1633	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But for a while now, the Phillips curve has been pretty flat, and we can’t predict with any certainty that it will normalize, understanding that “normal” may vary from time to time.	13	1
201412	1634	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Again, this all leads me to the anticipation that if we face this set of circumstances in the spring or the early summer, I think it behooves us to think carefully about whether we would be prepared to lift off, notwithstanding the fact that there will have been continued economic growth in that period.	13	1
201412	1635	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know that that’s where we’ll be.	13	1
201412	1636	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think it’s not so likely that we will have six more months of really solid job numbers and not see some changes in wage patterns and part-time unemployment, but we might, and I think we should just remain open to that.	13	1
201412	1637	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	What we’ve been doing in the past couple of meetings, I think, is trying to begin weaning the markets gradually off what has been something like calendar-based guidance and more toward a focus on conditions as we see them evolving in the nearer term.	13	1
201412	1638	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I just want us to make sure that we don’t replace a calendar approach for holding off rate increases with a calendar approach for starting them and instead really stick to what we all tend to mouth as the mantra— that we want to be reacting to conditions, be state contingent, be conditional, whatever one’s favorite phrase is—and that, I continue to think, will probably serve us best over the next couple of quarters.	13	1
201412	1639	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1640	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1641	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201412	1642	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1643	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	My forecast is very close to that of the December Tealbook and, for that matter, the September Tealbook.	13	1
201412	1644	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I see continued growth in the region of 2½ percent.	13	1
201412	1645	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Consumer spending ought to be strong, supported by much lower energy prices, higher levels of confidence, continued low interest rates, and higher stock prices.	13	1
201412	1646	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Businesses should respond by hiring and investing.	13	1
201412	1647	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In the labor market I see continued improvement across a broad range of measures, including strong payroll growth at well over 200,000 per month, a flattening out of labor force participation at roughly current levels for a couple of years at least, and the elimination of remaining slack.	13	1
201412	1648	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Wages ought to react positively.	13	1
201412	1649	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In fact, we may already be seeing the beginning of that, and I see inflation moving back up to the 2 percent objective as slack is eliminated.	13	1
201412	1650	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The one place where I differ very modestly from the baseline is in the pace of rate increases.	13	1
201412	1651	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In particular, it seems to me that if we are broadly on the baseline path, we would be raising rates more than 25 basis points per quarter in 2016, and that’s what the baseline shows.	13	1
201412	1652	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I would think we would be moving along a little more rapidly than that, but it’s not a huge difference.	13	1
201412	1653	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Also, I would say I take some positive signal from the Reserve Bank inquiries of District business contacts.	13	1
201412	1654	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It’s nice to see measures like that coming up all over the place that tend to suggest that the time for wage increases and greater hiring is coming soon.	13	1
201412	1655	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I find this narrative, which is broadly that of the Tealbook and the central tendency of the SEP, both fairly plausible and fairly positive.	13	1
201412	1656	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In fact, I would go so far as to say there’s real upside.	13	1
201412	1657	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think anyone should fall over dead with surprise if the alternative view on pages 6 and 7 of Tealbook A, materializes since all it does is represent a straight-lining, in effect, of 2014.	13	1
201412	1658	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	That said, in the spirit of poking holes in this consensus and perhaps the spirit of cautious contrarianism, I think Dennis said, I’m going to mention three gaps or disconnects and also one emerging risk scenario that I think could threaten the narrative.	13	1
201412	1659	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	And I have to admit, I can’t dismiss them from my mind, and we’ve talked about these in one form or another.	13	1
201412	1660	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The first is the gap between the relatively strong performance here in the United States and the weakness we see in Europe and elsewhere around the world, the threat being that we will feel this weakness over time, perhaps through the stronger dollar or through the risk-off channel if the bad events do happen.	13	1
201412	1661	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I see this as the principal threat to the baseline narrative.	13	1
201412	1662	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The alternative scenario in Tealbook A, titled “Weaker Foreign Growth and Stronger Dollar,” captures that pretty well.	13	1
201412	1663	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The second gap is one we spent some time on today, and that is the gap between survey measures of inflation expectations, which are stable, and market-based inflation compensation based on TIPS and inflation swaps, which show meaningful declines at the distant horizon.	13	1
201412	1664	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I thought that the paper that Yuriy Kitsul shared before the meeting was quite useful, showing that inflation compensation between 5 and 10 years out has declined by 72 basis points so far this year—it’s actually more than that now, this is a week-old paper.	13	1
201412	1665	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	And different models propose different decompositions of this change, as we’ve discussed.	13	1
201412	1666	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The Board model happens to assign the smallest amount to actual expectations of lower inflation and to inflation risk premiums and the largest amount to liquidity premiums, which is really meant to capture the greater attraction of nominals due to their higher liquidity as well as other factors related to supply and demand.	13	1
201412	1667	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Other models tend to agree that there’s relatively little to be seen in actual changes in inflation expectations but assign greater increases to the inflation risk premium.	13	1
201412	1668	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Inflation swaps send a similar signal.	13	1
201412	1669	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I look at all of these, and my instinct is to dismiss them and want to go with the survey-based measures, but I have to admit they raise concerns.	13	1
201412	1670	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It’s very difficult to convince oneself that there isn’t something here to at least be concerned about, and it will bear close monitoring.	13	1
201412	1671	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The third gap I will mention is that between the median rate forecast in the SEP and the baseline, on the one hand, and the forecast reflected in market readings, on the other hand—and that gap is now quite large.	13	1
201412	1672	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	At the short end, OIS quotes show a rate of about 1½ percent at year-end 2016 compared with about 2½ percent in the SEP.	13	1
201412	1673	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Some of that may reflect a difference between the Committee’s modal outlook and the risk-neutral pricing of OIS, but not all of it.	13	1
201412	1674	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	At the longer end, if you drop the SEP forecast and pretend it’s a 10-year bond, you get a yield to maturity of about 3 percent, but the yield this morning was about 2.07 percent, and the difference is that the Treasury market is pricing in a much lower path of rates.	13	1
201412	1675	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The one-year- forward rate in five years is 2.7 percent, fully 100 basis points below the Committee’s long-run equilibrium.	13	1
201412	1676	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Why is the market pricing in lower yields than the Committee?	13	1
201412	1677	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Board models attribute about half of that to term premiums and only small amounts to real short rates and expected inflation.	13	1
201412	1678	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I guess there are two narratives.	13	1
201412	1679	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	One may be that the market is concerned about the possibility of weaker growth and lower expected inflation.	13	1
201412	1680	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Another explanation is that, given the sharp differences in economic performance and expectations for policy, global fixed income investors would rather own dollar-denominated risk-free instruments at the 10-year tenor yielding 2 percent rather than other alternatives like comparable euro-denominated instruments that yield 0.6 percent or even lower-yielding Japanese ones.	13	1
201412	1681	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The recent data tend to support this story.	13	1
201412	1682	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	My own sense is that the Treasury market is, in fact, pricing in lower oil prices and stronger foreign demand for Treasuries as opposed to concerns about slower US growth or lower inflation.	13	1
201412	1683	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	But there is likely some truth in both these explanations.	13	1
201412	1684	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Again, I find it hard to dismiss that.	13	1
201412	1685	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Separately, I would add another risk scenario, which is certainly not an odds-on thing at this point, but I think there may be a heightened risk of an emerging markets selloff or even a rout driven by declining oil prices, a stronger dollar, and evolving events in Russia.	13	1
201412	1686	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The sensitivity of investors to these developments may be tested by the likely acknowledgement in tomorrow’s statement that the time for increases in US interest rates may be drawing near.	13	1
201412	1687	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In any case, these three gaps will be adjusted or eliminated over time.	13	1
201412	1688	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I’m not suggesting that that process needs to be destabilizing or destructive, but I do think that they point to risks of weaker growth and lower inflation, and perhaps I’m just constitutionally more focused on avoiding downside risks, or it may be that the risks to the downside actually are greater and represent more difficult challenges for policy than the upside risks—for example, the risk that we might get several more payroll reports well in the 300,000 level.	13	1
201412	1689	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow.	13	1
201412	1690	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1691	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201412	1692	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201412	1693	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, we’ve had two strong payroll reports, and American consumers are demonstrating more confidence both in their actions and in their expectations, bolstered, in part, by significantly lower prices at the pump.	13	1
201412	1694	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	These are very welcome developments.	13	1
201412	1695	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But we also see the increasingly resilient growth in the United States taking place against a backdrop of considerable risks to the outlook in several important foreign economies, and the dollar has continued its sharp appreciation.	13	1
201412	1696	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, progress in moving inflation back up toward our target has been quite limited, even looking through the recent sharp drop in oil prices.	13	1
201412	1697	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, then, I would say that conditions continue to validate our strategy of ending asset purchases in October—this time for real, or so we hope—while remaining somewhat patient on the removal of monetary accommodation, even as we see the day of liftoff coming, I think, into clearer view.	13	1
201412	1698	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The news from the labor market has been unambiguously positive.	13	1
201412	1699	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate has moved down further.	13	1
201412	1700	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Payroll employment is now averaging above 280,000 per month.	13	1
201412	1701	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And whereas previously nearly all of the take-up in slack was seen only in the overall unemployment rate, now we’re seeing other margins of slack also showing improvement.	13	1
201412	1702	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The participation rate has been about flat since the spring, which is encouraging, given that we think there is an underlying trend of decline, and it suggests some cyclical improvement.	13	1
201412	1703	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The number of employees working part time for economic reasons has moved noticeably lower in the past three months after remaining stubbornly high, and it’s also notable that most of the reduction in unemployment over the past year has been accounted for by a welcome and overdue reduction in long-term unemployment.	13	1
201412	1704	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But, of course, while we see evidence that labor market slack is diminishing across a number of dimensions, we don’t actually have very good measurements of how much slack remains.	13	1
201412	1705	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we see no clear evidence of a broad-based acceleration in wages.	13	1
201412	1706	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We hear a lot of anecdotes.	13	1
201412	1707	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	There are some regional and skill-specific pressures, but all three of the measures that we traditionally look at on the aggregate measure of wages show increases from a year ago that are still mired in the 2 to 2¼ percent range, well below increases prior to the crisis and little different from the pace in recent years.	13	1
201412	1708	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The incoming data on aggregate spending, I think, reinforce the picture of solid underlying growth momentum in the domestic economy.	13	1
201412	1709	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The data on consumer spending received after publication of the Tealbook suggest that second-half GDP is increasing at above a 3 percent pace, which is very welcome.	13	1
201412	1710	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The continued low rates and the recent sharp declines in oil prices should continue to boost consumer spending into the next year, while also, on balance, providing a plus to business investment and output.	13	1
201412	1711	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also significant that potential disruptions to the fiscal-policy trajectory, which have damaged incipient recoveries previously, have been taken off the table, which removes a significant source of risk.	13	1
201412	1712	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	One note of weakness, I think, on the domestic aggregate demand front is familiar.	13	1
201412	1713	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We still see weakness in single-family housing, and the data that we saw this morning has single- family permits, the best gauge of activity in this sector, changing little again.	13	1
201412	1714	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Now, on the risk side, I think the inflation picture bears continued vigilance.	13	1
201412	1715	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Even looking through the recent sharp declines in oil prices on the assumption they will stabilize and pass through to retail prices over the next two quarters, the level of inflation that might be expected to prevail seems to be centered around 1½ percent, below our target.	13	1
201412	1716	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there are good reasons to expect inflation to move up toward the target as slack is eliminated, we haven’t seen any sustained movement in that direction thus far.	13	1
201412	1717	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Taken together with the recent shift down in market-based indications of inflation expectations, this points to some downside risks in the inflation outlook, especially given the backdrop of falling commodity prices and disinflationary pressures abroad.	13	1
201412	1718	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We also are seeing some financial risks from the big adjustments recently in the price of oil, and they bear watching, I think.	13	1
201412	1719	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also important to recognize possible risks from a further deterioration in economic conditions abroad.	13	1
201412	1720	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting period saw further evidence of stagnation or weakening in economic activity in some of the largest foreign economies, further monetary accommodation or expectations of future easing in response, and a further notable increase in the dollar.	13	1
201412	1721	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Realized and expected changes in foreign monetary policy arise in the context of continued underperformance in key foreign economies struggling with deflationary pressures, compounded in some cases by an unwillingness or inability to engage in meaningful fiscal support to domestic demand and ongoing and unresolved structural challenges.	13	1
201412	1722	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent events in Greece remind us that although there has been notable progress, threats to financial stability in the euro area remain.	13	1
201412	1723	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the United States obviously has a very large and diversified internal market, this doesn’t imply that we are in any way a closed economy or immune from foreign shocks.	13	1
201412	1724	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Connections between the United States and foreign markets are still extremely large in both directions, and recent experience tells us that financial market disturbances abroad can have very large effects on US asset prices and on financial markets more generally.	13	1
201412	1725	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Due to the lag in the dollar’s effects on trade, net exports will likely continue to subtract from GDP growth over the medium term.	13	1
201412	1726	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, I suspect that increases in the value of the dollar have not yet run their course.	13	1
201412	1727	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Staff memos have noted that, on net, the effect of dollar appreciation on US GDP growth can be expected to be relatively modest, but this net effect conceals two important and significant gross effects, an initial and substantial depressing effect of dollar increases on net exports and a subsequent, partially offsetting positive effect from a more-accommodative monetary policy.	13	1
201412	1728	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	If a strengthening dollar does weigh heavily on net exports, all else being equal, we will need to adjust the pace of normalization in response.	13	1
201412	1729	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The good news is that the US economy and financial system have become more resilient over the past two years, and internal sources of demand seem sufficiently strong, particularly with the boost from low gas prices, to continue growth momentum in the face of headwinds from abroad.	13	1
201412	1730	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But I would not lightly dismiss risks that those headwinds could intensify.	13	1
201412	1731	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Overall, when considering appropriate policy, I would place robust domestic demand growth in the context of a global environment of weak foreign aggregate demand and large persistent disinflationary pressures.	13	1
201412	1732	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Such an environment, in my view, suggests that downside risks to US growth remain, and, coupled with persistently weak core inflation below our target and some deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, it warrants a still cautious approach to policy normalization.	13	1
201412	1733	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201412	1734	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13	1
201412	1735	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me thank everyone for a very thoughtful round of observations on the economic outlook.	13	1
201412	1736	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think this has been an unusually rich discussion.	13	1
201412	1737	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not going to be able to do it justice.	13	1
201412	1738	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I have a couple of comments of my own, but before I share those, I’ll try as I usually do to summarize the main themes in your economic remarks, taking note particularly of how they bear on your assessment of progress we have seen toward closing the employment and inflation gaps and the question of whether incoming evidence suggests some meaningful change in the likely pace of future progress.	13	1
201412	1739	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I think everybody agreed that conditions have continued to improve, and the degree of underutilization of labor resources is diminishing.	13	1
201412	1740	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you noted that the employment reports we received since our October meeting suggest faster progress than you had expected.	13	1
201412	1741	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Up until last spring, payroll gains were averaging around 200,000 per month.	13	1
201412	1742	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	By April, that three-month moving average had ramped up to around 240,000, and now the three-month average is running at almost 280,000.	13	1
201412	1743	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Even if the pace of job gains were to step down in line with the Tealbook projection, employment growth would still be on solid footing.	13	1
201412	1744	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate declined only 0.1 percentage point over the past two months, but labor force participation is up 0.1 percentage point and the employment-to-population ratio is up 0.2 percentage point since our October meeting.	13	1
201412	1745	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The share of the labor force working part time for economic reasons remains quite high, but it, too, has continued to edge down.	13	1
201412	1746	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	It has declined 0.1 percentage point per month for the past four months.	13	1
201412	1747	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you pointed out that the JOLTS data also paint a more encouraging picture of the labor market.	13	1
201412	1748	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Job openings have flattened out at a pace slightly above their pre-recession level after rising strongly earlier in the year, and hires and quits have both moved up over the past two months and are now close to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201412	1749	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	There continue to be reports, of course, of wage pressures in specific geographic areas and sectors.	13	1
201412	1750	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re even seeing signs here and there of a possible incipient pickup in wage growth in aggregate data.	13	1
201412	1751	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, there was a bump up in average hourly earnings in November, and the ECI measures of compensation and wage and salary growth have also been rising more rapidly than earlier in the year.	13	1
201412	1752	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	But in terms of longer-term trends, wage gains still look pretty tepid.	13	1
201412	1753	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	On a 12-month basis, average hourly earnings have barely edged above 2 percent, and, over the past year, the wages and salaries component of the ECI has risen by a similarly modest amount.	13	1
201412	1754	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren noted work that his staff is doing as well, looking at the wages earned by new hires and the fact that that measure doesn’t yet show any meaningful pickup in wages.	13	1
201412	1755	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	We continue to discuss our diverse views on whether U-3 is an adequate summary statistic of where the labor market is.	13	1
201412	1756	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Although different views bear on how we see the inflation risks for the future and our possible stance on policy, I think everyone around the table agrees that the labor market has improved, and it looks likely to continue to do so.	13	1
201412	1757	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the outlook for the labor market depends on economic growth, and I heard most of you express reasonable confidence that, even with the downside risks we’re seeing for the global growth outlook, that you expect growth to be at least adequate to sustain continued improvement in the labor market over coming months.	13	1
201412	1758	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you noted that despite slightly softer growth abroad in the third quarter, US growth looks like it’s running near 3½ percent in the second half of the year, and that’s above our expectations at the time of the October meeting.	13	1
201412	1759	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Looking at your SEP submissions and some of your comments, the growth outlook beyond this year hasn’t actually changed much since September, but most of you are anticipating above-trend growth.	13	1
201412	1760	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve been disappointed before, and President Lockhart and others remind us that we should be careful not to become overconfident, but I did hear a good deal of upbeat sentiment around the table that you think the economy really is exhibiting greater momentum.	13	1
201412	1761	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	You feel increased confidence that next year will be a year in which we do see a faster pace of growth, and that the expansion seems to be on track.	13	1
201412	1762	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The continued decline in oil prices since our October meeting is one of the most notable economic developments shaping the outlook.	13	1
201412	1763	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you noted that the spending stimulus due to lower energy prices does provide an offset to the restraint from the stronger dollar, and consumers, especially low-income consumers, should benefit from the decline in energy prices.	13	1
201412	1764	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had an interesting discussion about the likely impact of lower energy prices on North American drilling activity and capital spending, and that’s something that will bear close watching.	13	1
201412	1765	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	But I think all of you agreed that, on balance, the net effect of the decline in oil prices for US GDP growth is positive—at least of the magnitude of decline we’ve seen so far.	13	1
201412	1766	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	However, some of you noted the effect that the decline in oil prices will have on the global economy.	13	1
201412	1767	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Even though one can make the case that the net effect is positive, there really are very different regional effects, taking account of the possibility in Europe of pushing inflation expectations down and financial market effects.	13	1
201412	1768	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	This is something that’s going to bear close watching and is a risk.	13	1
201412	1769	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the US outlook, a number of you also pointed to increased consumer confidence and expressed your belief that a good dynamic, a kind of self-reinforcing multiplier- accelerator type of positive dynamic, may finally be coming into play.	13	1
201412	1770	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, incoming data during the intermeeting period have been mixed.	13	1
201412	1771	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Tealbook revised up its estimate of core PCE inflation in the current quarter after seeing October’s data.	13	1
201412	1772	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Tomorrow morning we’ll look at the CPI release and see if that’s consistent with this assessment.	13	1
201412	1773	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, though, the drag from declining energy prices on headline inflation now looks like it will be larger than previously projected, with the 12-month rate likely to drop below 1 percent early next year.	13	1
201412	1774	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, several of you pointed to downward pressure on inflation from dollar appreciation, which likely will lower non-energy commodity and imported goods prices.	13	1
201412	1775	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the question of whether lower energy prices and the higher dollar will leave an imprint on inflation beyond the next couple of quarters, I heard mixed views.	13	1
201412	1776	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you expressed confidence in your projection that inflation will likely move back to 2 percent over time in an environment of continued improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201412	1777	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you pointed out that, with respect to inflation expectations, survey-based measures have remained stable and suggest that long-run inflation expectations are well anchored.	13	1
201412	1778	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And we’ve had a very rich discussion that I’m not even going to try to summarize regarding how to interpret the decline we’ve seen in five-year, five-year-forward breakevens that have continued to decline further since our October meeting.	13	1
201412	1779	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The staff’s financial Board briefing yesterday pointed out that there are an awful lot of different ways to break this down into inflation expectations, inflation risk premiums, and liquidity effects, and the breakdown that one gets is actually highly model sensitive.	13	1
201412	1780	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think this is something, obviously, to which we’re going to be paying close attention as we go forward.	13	1
201412	1781	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	All in all, while most of you see the drop in headline inflation as largely transitory and continue to expect that it will move gradually back toward 2 percent, some of you are concerned that we may be seeing the beginning of a worrisome downward adjustment in inflation expectations.	13	1
201412	1782	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If inflation expectations were to shift down markedly, this would create downside risks to inflation itself, and a failure on our part to take decisive action could exacerbate this risk by diminishing the credibility of our commitment to our 2 percent inflation objective.	13	1
201412	1783	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, inflation developments will bear close watching.	13	1
201412	1784	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and see if anyone would like to comment on this summary.	13	1
201412	1785	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201412	1786	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201412	1787	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Then let me just add a few brief comments of my own.	13	1
201412	1788	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	First, I want to join with the others who described incoming news pertaining to the labor market as encouraging.	13	1
201412	1789	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	My own reaction to incoming data, including the two employment reports, is that we are seeing a pattern of across-the-board improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201412	1790	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Virtually every indicator I monitor shows movement in the right direction.	13	1
201412	1791	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, I consider the quits rate a very useful cyclical indicator, and I’m encouraged by the increase we have seen in the past couple of reports.	13	1
201412	1792	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	A substantial share of quits results from job offers that employed workers receive and accept, and an increase in the prevalence of such offers points to the possibility of more-rapid wage increases and, I think, suggests real improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201412	1793	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	To the extent that there are also people who quit into unemployment, an increase in these flows suggests that workers have become less wary about leaving one job without having lined up the next.	13	1
201412	1794	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m similarly encouraged by the more favorable assessments of the labor market we’re seeing in household surveys.	13	1
201412	1795	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If you will forgive me for returning yet again to my cross- country road trip analogy [laughter], whereas in October my assessment was that we were just pulling into Cleveland, by now I think we’ve left President Mester’s office.	13	1
201412	1796	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’re in the process of crossing the Allegheny Mountains.	13	1
201412	1797	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	There remains some way to go to the Weehawkin end of the Lincoln Tunnel, but I’m feeling a lot more hopeful now that we’ll make it all the way to Manhattan without hitting any major delay.	13	1
201412	1798	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn to inflation.	13	1
201412	1799	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Due to the recent momentum we have seen in the labor market, coupled with the downward pressure we are seeing on inflation, it now seems likely that the economy will return to maximum employment before inflation is returned to our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201412	1800	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Assuming that the labor market continues to improve, a key policy question for us will be how inflation developments should bear on our decision concerning the timing of liftoff.	13	1
201412	1801	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	We included a new question in the SEP to help gain some insight into your thinking on this topic, and I appreciate your willingness to provide more detailed information concerning your views both on the appropriate timing of liftoff and the economic conditions you expect to prevail at that time.	13	1
201412	1802	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	It appears from your responses that most of you anticipate that liftoff will become appropriate during the first three quarters of next year.	13	1
201412	1803	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you report that you expect core inflation will be running about 1½ percent or just a tad higher, while headline inflation will be running under or only slightly above 1 percent.	13	1
201412	1804	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	At the point that you see liftoff as appropriate, it therefore appears that most of you do not expect to have discernable evidence in hand that would confirm that inflation is actually moving back up to 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1805	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say that, like most of you, I also anticipate liftoff under conditions like these, but for me to support a decision to lift off with core inflation in the neighborhood of 1½ percent and headline inflation significantly lower, I will need to feel reasonably confident that inflation will actually begin moving back up to 2 percent over the next couple of years.	13	1
201412	1806	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	To make such a forecast, I will be relying on theory, consistent with historical evidence, that with well-anchored inflation expectations, inflation will move up as the output gap shrinks and commodity prices stabilize.	13	1
201412	1807	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Incoming evidence confirming that inflation expectations remain well anchored, that energy and commodity prices are stabilizing, and that resource slack will continue to erode, possibly even with some small overshoot in the labor market, would bolster my confidence that inflation will, in fact, head back toward our 2 percent longer-run objective, in line with my SEP submission.	13	1
201412	1808	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I admit this is a forecast-based approach to tightening, but I’m comfortable with this approach because, given the lags in monetary policy, I think we have to base our decisions on where we think inflation and real activity are heading and not where they are.	13	1
201412	1809	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	That said, if unfolding developments were to materially diminish my confidence in this inflation outlook, then I probably would want to be more cautious about removing accommodation.	13	1
201412	1810	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, there are a few things I will be watching closely.	13	1
201412	1811	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	One is wage developments.	13	1
201412	1812	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, as several of you mentioned, we may be seeing some tentative signs—and I’d underline “tentative”—that nominal wage growth may be stepping up.	13	1
201412	1813	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Even though I recognize that the link between nominal wage growth and consumer price inflation is pretty weak, if a sustained step-up in nominal wage growth were to emerge, this would suggest that we’re moving closer to our full employment objective, and it would enhance my confidence that PCE inflation would move back to 2 percent.	13	1
201412	1814	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Conversely, if nominal wage growth fails to step up at all while core PCE inflation was, for example, to move yet lower, I would be more cautious about lifting off.	13	1
201412	1815	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Similarly, for now I consider the jury to be out on whether recent movements in TIPS breakevens reflect some broad-based reduction in confidence in our willingness and ability to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective or whether they instead reflect the transitory influence of recent oil price declines and possibly financial market spillovers from European inflation developments.	13	1
201412	1816	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	But should we see further declines in measures of inflation expectations after oil prices have leveled off, this, too, would give me pause.	13	1
201412	1817	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the decline in inflation compensation and financial market developments more generally, I would note that a possible interpretation both of the move down in inflation compensation and also the sizable gap between our SEP  paths for the federal funds rate and the path implied by market prices is that market participants believe that the equilibrium real interest rate has declined.	13	1
201412	1818	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Such a decline would imply a higher likelihood of periods when nominal rates will be at the zero lower bound and inflation will be below target.	13	1
201412	1819	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If inflation is expected to be near 2 percent during normal times but below 2 percent during zero-lower-bound periods and the odds of zero-lower-bound episodes are increased, we would expect to see inflation compensation drift down.	13	1
201412	1820	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think this interpretation is perhaps in line with President Kocherlakota’s memo to us on this topic.	13	1
201412	1821	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, I found the Tealbook analysis pertaining to the cost of insurance against inflation outcomes quite interesting.	13	1
201412	1822	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	It suggests that the cost of insuring against high inflation outcomes has moved down while the cost of insuring against low inflation outcomes has moved up, consistent with the decline in the equilibrium real rate.	13	1
201412	1823	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	In summary, I don’t think there’s a simple clear-cut answer to the question of whether inflation near current levels would or would not be consistent with liftoff being appropriate.	13	1
201412	1824	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the answer will depend on both the outlook for inflation at the time and our confidence in the projection.	13	1
201412	1825	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think the current language in paragraph 3 of alternative B is, therefore, appropriately open ended on this question.	13	1
201412	1826	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201412	1827	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think before dinner it would be good if we could ask Bill to provide his briefing on the policy round, and then we’ll resume with that tomorrow morning.	21	2
201412	1828	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201412	1829	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I will be referring to the exhibits labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201412	1830	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	We made small changes to the final sentence of the first paragraph of all three alternatives that are shown in blue to take account of the rebound in the Michigan survey measure of longer-run inflation expectations that we received on Friday.	21	2
201412	1831	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The top two panels on the first page of the handout provide information on labor market conditions and inflation.	21	2
201412	1832	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in line 1 of the panel to the left, the overall unemployment rate has edged down in recent months, while the broader U-6 measure, line 2, has moved down more noticeably.	21	2
201412	1833	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Gains in payroll employment, line 3, have picked up of late.	21	2
201412	1834	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Your SEP submissions for the unemployment rate suggest that you anticipate underutilization of labor resources to continue to diminish over coming quarters.	21	2
201412	1835	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the table to the right, you generally see the recent drop in energy prices holding total PCE inflation somewhat below the core rate in 2015, but, by 2016, the central tendency of your projections for total PCE inflation moves back in line with the core rate.	21	2
201412	1836	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The middle-left panel plots your projections of unemployment rate gaps and four- quarter inflation at the time of liftoff.	21	2
201412	1837	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Like Beth, I am showing core rather than headline inflation in order to abstract from the temporary effects of changes in energy prices.	21	2
201412	1838	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Most of you expect the actual unemployment rate to be within three-tenths of a percentage point of your estimate of its longer-run normal level and the four-quarter change in core PCE prices to be between 1.5 and 1.7 percent.	21	2
201412	1839	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	By these two metrics, at least, you appear to have a reasonable consensus on the economic conditions you anticipate at the time that the first increase in the federal funds rate becomes appropriate.	21	2
201412	1840	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	That said, your expectations for the calendar date of liftoff span the period from 2015:Q1 to 2016:Q4.	21	2
201412	1841	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown by the lines in the middle-right panel, the median path for the federal funds rate from the dealer survey has changed little since the time of the September meeting.	21	2
201412	1842	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	By contrast, the median federal funds rate in the SEP, indicated by the dots, has moved down somewhat.	21	2
201412	1843	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The bottom panel highlights a number of considerations relevant for updating the forward guidance regarding liftoff.	21	2
201412	1844	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	First, the responses from the Desk’s survey assign roughly even odds to a change in the forward guidance at this meeting but also attach a significant probability to a change in March.	21	2
201412	1845	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Many respondents expect the “considerable time” language to be replaced with more data-dependent language or with less calendar-specific language, such as “patient.”	21	2
201412	1846	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Second, concerning how the statement may evolve over time and along different paths for the economy, the new statement in alternative B that indicates that the Committee “can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy” could be retained until the meeting at which the Committee judges that liftoff is drawing close.	21	2
201412	1847	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Third, alternative B is consistent with the October statement, although the anchoring of “considerable time” to the end of purchases in October may come as a surprise to some investors.	21	2
201412	1848	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, at the end of 2016, you generally see the inflation rate near 2 percent and the unemployment rate near your assessments of its longer-run normal level, while most of you have the federal funds rate still noticeably below its longer- run value.	21	2
201412	1849	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	These projections continue to support the post-liftoff forward guidance included in recent statements.	21	2
201412	1850	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to the alternatives for this meeting, you may view recent economic developments and the outlook as broadly in line with your earlier expectations.	21	2
201412	1851	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	If so, you may view the updates to the language in alternative B, on page 6, as appropriate.	21	2
201412	1852	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	In light of the recent strong employment gains and improvement in the broad measures of labor utilization, paragraph 1 offers a positive assessment of the labor market, saying that conditions have “improved somewhat further,” with the option of dropping “somewhat,” and then indicating that “underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.”	21	2
201412	1853	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative B continues to state that inflation is running “below the Committee’s longer-run objective” but notes that this partly reflects “declines in energy prices.”	21	2
201412	1854	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	It acknowledges that market-based measures of longer- term inflation compensation have declined “somewhat further” but states that survey- based measures “have remained stable.”	21	2
201412	1855	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Consistent with your SEP submissions, paragraph 2 of alternative B continues to report that the Committee expects “economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate,” and “sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.”	21	2
201412	1856	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The language on the outlook for inflation is revised to more clearly state—along the lines of your SEP submissions—that inflation is expected “to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.”	21	2
201412	1857	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	However, it adds a note of caution that “the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.”	21	2
201412	1858	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	With regard to the forward guidance in paragraph 3, alternative B provides new language stating that “based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.”	21	2
201412	1859	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	In order to indicate that the Committee is not signaling a change in its policy intentions, the new language is accompanied by a sentence indicating that the new guidance is consistent with the “previous statement that it will likely be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of [the] asset purchase program in October.”	21	2
201412	1860	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, the post-liftoff guidance in paragraph 5 of alternative B is unchanged.	21	2
201412	1861	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The changes to the statement language in alternative B may not surprise many market participants.	21	2
201412	1862	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	However, the sentence confirming the consistency of the new and old language concerning liftoff, by tying the “considerable time” to the end of the purchase program in October, may cause expectations for the timing of liftoff to become more concentrated in the second quarter of 2015.	21	2
201412	1863	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Of course, investors’ responses to the statement are difficult to predict with confidence and will depend importantly on the release of information from the December Summary of Economic Projections and also on the postmeeting press conference.	21	2
201412	1864	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, page 8, presents a more positive and confident assessment of the recent economic developments and the outlook.	21	2
201412	1865	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Most important, paragraph 2 states that the Committee “sees sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support attainment of its employment objective” and indicates that the risks to inflation, as well as to economic activity and the labor market, are “nearly balanced.”	21	2
201412	1866	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	It does not refer to monitoring inflation developments closely.	21	2
201412	1867	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C offers two options for replacing the “considerable time” language: The first, paragraph C., simply states that the Committee anticipates retaining the current target range for the federal funds rate for “some time.”	21	2
201412	1868	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	The second, paragraph C.ʹ, would say that “economic conditions will soon warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”	21	2
201412	1869	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph C. would modify the current post-liftoff guidance by indicating that a target federal funds rate below longer-run normal levels may be warranted “as employment and inflation approach mandate-consistent levels” rather than after that time.	21	2
201412	1870	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative C includes a shorter discussion of reinvestment than the other two alternatives, and the reference is moved to the end of the statement, reducing the emphasis on that policy decision.	21	2
201412	1871	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	A statement like that in alternative C, particularly the guidance in C.ʹ signaling imminent liftoff and the revision to C. weakening the post-liftoff guidance, would surprise market participants.	21	2
201412	1872	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Medium- and longer-term interest rates would likely rise, inflation compensation and equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201412	1873	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative A, on page 4, expresses somewhat less confidence about recent developments and the economic outlook.	21	2
201412	1874	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 1 doesn’t note the recent stronger labor market data, and paragraph 2 indicates that the Committee continues to closely monitor both inflation and inflation expectations.	21	2
201412	1875	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative A offers two options for forward guidance:  Paragraph A. retains the “considerable time” phrase but without anchoring that phrase to the end of asset purchases.	21	2
201412	1876	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	As a second option, paragraph A.ʹ states that the Committee will be patient—perhaps “highly” patient—in beginning to normalize the stance of policy “in order to ensure that inflation returns to the 2 percent objective at an appropriately rapid pace.”	21	2
201412	1877	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	It includes the possibility of indicating that the Committee intends “to reverse recent declines in longer-term inflation expectations.”	21	2
201412	1878	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	A statement like that in alternative A would likely cause market participants to push further into the future their expectation for the timing of the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and might flatten the expected subsequent path of policy firming.	21	2
201412	1879	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Accordingly, medium- and longer-term real interest rates would probably decline, inflation compensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar could depreciate.	21	2
201412	1880	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	A draft directive for all three alternatives is shown on page 11 of your handout.	21	2
201412	1881	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you.	21	2
201412	1882	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201412	1883	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I realize I’m the last thing standing between you and your reception, but I’d be happy to take your questions.	22	2
201412	1884	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	22	2
201412	1885	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Actually, I’m the last person between you and the reception.	22	2
201412	1886	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	22	2
201412	1887	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Bill, you said that alternative B is consistent with our old guidance, although the anchoring could surprise some investors.	22	2
201412	1888	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Then you mentioned that the anchoring is dating the term “considerable time” from October, and you said that including it may cause markets to be more concentrated on the second quarter.	22	2
201412	1889	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	Yes.	22	2
201412	1890	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I guess my question is, if we just said what we have in red here, “based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy,” and left out the reference to October, then said “especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal,” so you took out that small section, which you’ve highlighted, would that lead the market to rule out that we wouldn’t be flexible in deciding to move in the second quarter or later?	22	2
201412	1891	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I’m not sure.	22	2
201412	1892	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I mean, we thought it was helpful to have the sentence saying that the Committee is not intending this to be a change in its forward guidance.	22	2
201412	1893	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the question is, what did people understand the forward guidance to be in October?	22	2
201412	1894	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that some in the markets think that that was basically “considerable time,” and they’re expecting a repetition of “considerable time.”	22	2
201412	1895	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	So by saying “considerable time following the end of its purchase program in October,” you’re pulling a little closer in time the point at which it may be appropriate to raise rates.	22	2
201412	1896	2014-12-17	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s consistent with the new “patient” wording, which I think means something like “not the next couple of meetings,” but it’s not pushing all the way out maybe six months or so, which I think is what market participants read the “considerable time” as meaning.	22	2
201412	1897	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	2	2
201412	1898	2014-12-17	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201412	1899	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Bill?	2	2
201412	1900	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	2	2
201412	1901	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	2	2
201412	1902	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	See you tomorrow at 9:00 am December 17 Session .	2	2
201412	1903	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201412	1904	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201412	1905	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to start by asking David Wilcox to update us on the CPI read this morning.	11	1
201412	1906	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201412	1907	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	This morning’s release was a little weaker than we had been looking for.	11	1
201412	1908	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Our forecast for energy prices was close to what was published, with about a 3¾ percent decline in energy prices in November.	11	1
201412	1909	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	And, with food, we were pretty close as well.	11	1
201412	1910	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	For core CPI, we had been looking for an increase of 0.2 and got 0.1 percent.	11	1
201412	1911	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Now, we have done a preliminary translation of the CPI prices into PCE terms, and there we think we’re going to be down a little more than 0.1 percent from our expectation in the Tealbook that we published last week.	11	1
201412	1912	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	A preliminary look at how that’ll play out for the quarterly arithmetic is that, for core PCE inflation at an annual rate, we had been expecting 1.6 percent in Q4, and we think that today’s release will take us down to about 1.3 percent.	11	1
201412	1913	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	So we’ll be down about 0.3 on the quarter.	11	1
201412	1914	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	For quarterly arithmetic reasons, our projection for Q1 would come down a couple of tenths, from 1.5 percent to about 1.3 percent.	11	1
201412	1915	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	So, a revised projection, as of this morning, is that we’d have two quarters of core inflation at 1.3 percent on the PCE basis.	11	1
201412	1916	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	For top line, we had been looking for a Q4 figure of minus 0.1 in the Tealbook, and we think that’ll be down to about minus 0.3 or minus 0.4 in Q4.	11	1
201412	1917	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	And for top-line PCE inflation in Q1, we’d been looking for a decline in the Tealbook of minus 0.6.	11	1
201412	1918	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	We think that’ll be down to about minus 0.7—so just one-tenth of 1 percentage point erosion in Q1.	11	1
201412	1919	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Those are pretty preliminary figures, as you can imagine.	11	1
201412	1920	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Heartbeats were going quickly upstairs to get even this much produced.	11	1
201412	1921	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions?	12	1
201412	1922	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201412	1923	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	David, the thing that made a big impression on me was the two quarters of negative PCE inflation in the forecast.	12	1
201412	1924	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Does that still remain?	12	1
201412	1925	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12	1
201412	1926	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	And does it extend any further?	12	1
201412	1927	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	No.	12	1
201412	1928	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	As we mentioned, those are predominantly reflecting the steep decline in energy prices in the fourth and first quarters.	12	1
201412	1929	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Those energy price declines are pretty amazing at this point.	12	1
201412	1930	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	They are now at something like minus 27 percent at an annual rate in Q4 and somewhere in the range of minus 35 to minus 40 percent at an annual rate in Q1.	12	1
201412	1931	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	So that’s what’s generating the negative top-line PCE figures for Q4 and Q1 in our projection.	12	1
201412	1932	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	It’s minus 27 percent times what?	12	1
201412	1933	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	What’s the weight in the index?	12	1
201412	1934	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	Let’s see whether I have weights here.	12	1
201412	1935	2014-12-17	meeting	WILCOX	In the CPI, the energy index gets a weight of about 10 percent or so, and, in the PCE, it gets a weight of 5½ percent.	12	1
201412	1936	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I guess there’s no one around old enough to remember what happened in 1986, when oil prices reached $6 a barrel, at which rate they collapsed.	12	1
201412	1937	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I remember that.	12	1
201412	1938	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Oh, yes—you would.	12	1
201412	1939	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I’ll have to remember.	12	1
201412	1940	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I was a toddler.	12	1
201412	1941	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	12	1
201412	1942	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Not that long ago.	12	1
201412	1943	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We also had the run-up, though, as you remember—because Bob Hormats and I used to front the US-Saudi oil commission starting in the Carter Administration—and that was a reaction to the run-up in oil prices.	12	1
201412	1944	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	They overshot on the upside and came dramatically down.	12	1
201412	1945	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I don’t remember how we handled it from a monetary policy standpoint.	12	1
201412	1946	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	On that, I would defer to the Chair.	12	1
201412	1947	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The point is that this is not unprecedented, and this isn’t as radical a price movement as we saw back then.	12	1
201412	1948	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think I’ve said it before in this forum—that many Russian economists attribute the collapse of the Soviet Union to that price and not to the difficulty of running the system.	12	1
201412	1949	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Exactly.	12	1
201412	1950	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It certainly helped.	12	1
201412	1951	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	12	1
201412	1952	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	So maybe we’re having a second round.	12	1
201412	1953	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	A second collapse.	12	1
201412	1954	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further questions for David?	12	1
201412	1955	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12	1
201412	1956	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If not, then let me just start off this morning.	12	1
201412	1957	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	First of all, I want to thank you for the comments and suggestions you’ve provided on our draft policy statements in the run-up to this meeting.	23	2
201412	1958	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	As has been evident from our ongoing interactions, we have a range of views on how our forward guidance should be cast, and I appreciate everyone’s willingness to work together to find some common ground and to communicate our policy intentions to the public as clearly as possible.	23	2
201412	1959	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m hopeful that the language we have before us today in alternative B, if we choose to adopt it, will enhance our flexibility and simplify our communications as we move closer toward policy normalization.	23	2
201412	1960	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	By indicating that the new “patient” language is consistent with the previous “considerable time” language, alternative B also signals continuity in our approach to policy.	23	2
201412	1961	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Looking ahead, in our January statement, we can drop the phrase “considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October” and retain the “patient” language until we get closer to liftoff.	23	2
201412	1962	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	To further improve our policy communications, I believe it would be useful if I could try to clarify some aspects of our thinking during the press conference, but only with your broad assent.	23	2
201412	1963	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, I would appreciate your views on two specific questions during the go- round.	23	2
201412	1964	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The first question is how to describe what we mean by the word “patient.”	23	2
201412	1965	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	This will be an obvious question in the press conference and one that, frankly, deserves an answer.	23	2
201412	1966	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	My inclination would be to characterize “patient” by stating something like this:  “Based on its current outlook, the Committee judges it unlikely to begin the normalization process for at least the next couple of meetings.”	23	2
201412	1967	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would immediately follow that by reiterating that this expectation is entirely data dependent, and if progress proves faster than we expect, we likely would move earlier than now anticipated.	23	2
201412	1968	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	In this sense, no meeting is off the table.	23	2
201412	1969	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	That said, unless there is a surprise, this definition does mean that January and March are unlikely.	23	2
201412	1970	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	April and later meetings are completely live possibilities.	23	2
201412	1971	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let me emphasize that the absence of a press conference does not, in my view, take April off the table, and I will emphasize this in the press conference if I’m asked about it.	23	2
201412	1972	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	If the Committee wants to begin normalizing policy in April, we already have arrangements in place to hold the press conference call.	23	2
201412	1973	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	This was something that would also be webcast, and it would occur at 2:30 pm, the normal time for a press conference following the 2:00 release of our statement.	23	2
201412	1974	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	The second question is whether you would be comfortable with my characterizing participants’ views on the likely timing of liftoff and the economic conditions that are expected to prevail at that time.	23	2
201412	1975	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Based on your responses in the SEP, I could say, “Assuming that the economy evolves broadly in line with participants’ expectations, almost all participants believe that it will be appropriate to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate in 2015.	23	2
201412	1976	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	There are a range of views on the appropriate timing of liftoff within the year, in part reflecting differences in participants’ expectations for how the economy will evolve.	23	2
201412	1977	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of liftoff, participants expect to see some further decline in the unemployment rate and improvement in labor market conditions.	23	2
201412	1978	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	They expect core inflation to be running near current levels, but they will want to be reasonably confident in their forecast that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent longer-run objective over time.”	23	2
201412	1979	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, again, I would clearly frame this in the context of our expectations being completely data dependent.	23	2
201412	1980	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me conclude by saying that I don’t think that we will be well served by being overly vague on the likely course of policy, particularly if we want to guard against abrupt market moves today and down the road.	23	2
201412	1981	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	But we obviously cannot deliver too much precision, as our policy does depend entirely on how the economy evolves.	23	2
201412	1982	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there, and, with that, I look forward to hearing your views.	23	2
201412	1983	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me first call on President Lockhart to begin our go- round.	23	2
201412	1984	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	1985	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect the consensus of the Committee to settle on removal of the “considerable time” phrase as in alternative B, and I’m prepared in the end to support alternative B, but with some apprehension.	23	2
201412	1986	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I want to pick up where I left off in the economy round and express some cautionary concerns.	23	2
201412	1987	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we are well advised to be as realistic as we can about the data we’ll have in hand and the conditions that could prevail at the time when we might begin to signal imminent liftoff, perhaps in the spring.	23	2
201412	1988	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As I argued in the economy round, we may have at least a couple of indications in the data to look through, particularly in the inflation data.	23	2
201412	1989	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t feel we absolutely need to make the changes captured in alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201412	1990	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m sympathetic to the approach of retaining “considerable time” for one or two more meetings without its link to the ending of asset purchases in October.	23	2
201412	1991	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This is, in effect, the treatment of “considerable time” in alternative A, and I could support inserting that into alternative B.	23	2
201412	1992	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Because, in my view, the “considerable time” phrase is widely equated with about six months, its last use in October—with its connection in that statement to the October QE end— might suggest that we’re signaling an April liftoff.	23	2
201412	1993	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Then, because there’s no press conference scheduled for April, market expectations as of now seem to have centered on June.	23	2
201412	1994	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I would prefer not to lock in June and would hope that the Chair’s communication would not inalterably fix the market’s focus on June.	23	2
201412	1995	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the message of data dependency has to be forceful enough to allow for adjustment based on our reading of the status and evolution of economic circumstances.	23	2
201412	1996	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My preferred signaling regarding liftoff—conditioned, of course, on supportive data—is liftoff at midyear or a little later.	23	2
201412	1997	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I think alternative B at this meeting, with its introduction of the new “patient” theme, could be interpreted as slightly hawkish and could bring some near-term tightening.	23	2
201412	1998	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At the long end of the curve, that will probably do no harm.	23	2
201412	1999	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect some market participants to interpret the word “patient” by reference to the pattern of 2004.	23	2
201412	2000	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Market participants don’t have anything else to go on, so they could take “patient” to signal March or April.	23	2
201412	2001	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	If the Committee decides to go with alternative B, I would urge that the Chair be given permission to convey some strong points explaining the decision in the press conference.	23	2
201412	2002	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I support Chair Yellen’s request that she downplay any likelihood that the liftoff decision would come in January or March.	23	2
201412	2003	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I also support her request to characterize the mainstream views of the Committee members and participants regarding economic conditions at liftoff.	23	2
201412	2004	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this serves to stress the economic conditionality associated with the message of data dependency.	23	2
201412	2005	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The Chair should convey that “patient” is not meant to signal a date or time frame.	23	2
201412	2006	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s also time to explain that every meeting is in play, and that the Chair will call a press conference when needed.	23	2
201412	2007	2014-12-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2008	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2009	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201412	2010	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2011	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B, although I have some comments regarding the wording of the statement that I’ll turn to in a minute.	23	2
201412	2012	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The recovery has picked up a great amount of steam.	23	2
201412	2013	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, inflation remains low, but, with remaining slack diminishing and commodity import prices likely stabilizing, I see inflation gradually returning to our objective.	23	2
201412	2014	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The statement appropriately recognizes these developments and provides a smooth transition in preparation for liftoff sometime next year.	23	2
201412	2015	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I continue, personally, to view a June 2015 liftoff as appropriate, but, of course, that’s entirely data dependent.	23	2
201412	2016	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The healthy tenor of recent economic data and business reports bolsters my confidence in the ongoing expansion.	23	2
201412	2017	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Performance in the labor market has been especially impressive, and, after a long seven years in the wilderness, we’re probably only about a year away from finally reaching our goal of maximum employment.	23	2
201412	2018	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	To be consistent with the unvarnished improvement in these labor market data, paragraph 1 of alternative B should omit the bracketed “somewhat,” in my view.	23	2
201412	2019	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Including “somewhat” would be inconsistent with the very positive October–November labor market reports and other labor market indicators, as we discussed yesterday.	23	2
201412	2020	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, a consequential change in statement language is the “patient” wording in paragraph 3, as President Lockhart mentioned, and my comments are actually going to follow very closely with the comments of President Lockhart.	23	2
201412	2021	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The staff memo did lay out, I think nicely, how the statement could evolve from the word “patient” into the future.	23	2
201412	2022	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I will mention that we’ve had two other staff memos over the past several months that explained how “considerable time” could very nicely play out through the future to “some time” and how “considerable time since October” could play out into the future very nicely.	23	2
201412	2023	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think all of these approaches represent reasonable bridges between now and liftoff, whenever that’s appropriate.	23	2
201412	2024	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The main goal that we’re trying to achieve is basically not, in my view, to move market expectations around.	23	2
201412	2025	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Market expectations are pretty reasonable about liftoff right now.	23	2
201412	2026	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our goal is basically to explain in a smooth and easy-to-understand way that we are moving closer to liftoff.	23	2
201412	2027	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are different ways to do that, and my main comments are that I’m more concerned about the word “patient” than maybe I was about “considerable time.”	23	2
201412	2028	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let me explain my concerns around the word “patient.”	23	2
201412	2029	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I beg the Committee’s patience in listening to my concerns.	23	2
201412	2030	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I will make a promise here:  I will leave time for everyone to finish their holiday shopping.	23	2
201412	2031	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s always a risk of misinterpretation when we change words or when we add a word to the statement or subtract something, and that’s just part of life.	23	2
201412	2032	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I do think that the word “patient” does bring up a couple of issues.	23	2
201412	2033	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, my concern about the word “patient” boils down to:  I myself didn’t really know what it meant in terms of monetary policy.	23	2
201412	2034	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I’m going to get back to the Chair’s suggestion because I think that’s an important element of our communications strategy.	23	2
201412	2035	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are two competing definitions out there, and they differ dramatically.	23	2
201412	2036	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	One interpretation of “patient” is “relatively soon.”	23	2
201412	2037	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As President Lockhart said, that’s how we used “patient” back in January and March of 2004.	23	2
201412	2038	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	“Patient” meant that we’re going to raise rates in the next few meetings.	23	2
201412	2039	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let’s go back to March 2004, the last time we used “patient.”	23	2
201412	2040	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, that FOMC raised the funds rate in June 2004.	23	2
201412	2041	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s two meetings after the use of “patient.”	23	2
201412	2042	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then I went to a dictionary and looked up the word “patient,” and, actually, the definition is exactly the opposite.	23	2
201412	2043	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It means “not soon,” and I assume that’s the usage that my esteemed colleague President Evans means when he says on numerous occasions that we need to be patient in removing accommodation.	23	2
201412	2044	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I believe President Evans would describe “sometime in 2016,” perhaps, as actually being patient.	23	2
201412	2045	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, what is the FOMC trying to communicate with this word “patient”?	23	2
201412	2046	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is it soon or not soon?	23	2
201412	2047	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I figured this out on my own—I guessed that these problems were recognized, and that led to the classic Fed “belt and suspenders” approach that we always take, which is to anchor expectations on, apparently, this first definition, in which “patient” means “relatively soon.”	23	2
201412	2048	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the belt is the additional language in the statement that says that the “patient” language is exactly entirely consistent with the October “considerable time” language.	23	2
201412	2049	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s no change there.	23	2
201412	2050	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the suspenders of this approach are Chair Yellen’s proposal that she explain in today’s press conference that “patient” means no increase in the next few meetings.	23	2
201412	2051	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, actually, after going through my concerns about what “patient” means, I think this does define “patient.”	23	2
201412	2052	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a very effective way to explain what the word “patient” means here.	23	2
201412	2053	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It does, I hope, shift us away from what “patient” meant in 2004.	23	2
201412	2054	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The combination of putting in the belt of that extra sentence and adding the suspenders of the Chair explaining and putting a good commentary about what “patient” means and its data dependence actually solves these problems.	23	2
201412	2055	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I can support the language that’s in the statement, conditional both on having that sentence in the paragraph that says that this is not a change in our views, and on the Chair’s having permission to describe what “patient” means.	23	2
201412	2056	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do have some lingering concerns that, when there’s consequential language in our policy decisions, I would prefer them to be explained in the statement rather than relying on the Chair to define the terms, but maybe that’s a conversation for a later day.	23	2
201412	2057	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, Madam Chair, I do have great confidence that, in the press conference, you’ll be able to explain this very effectively.	23	2
201412	2058	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that this will be fine.	23	2
201412	2059	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the questions you asked, my answer to the first one is that I agree, I do think that you should define “patient” as meaning no increase for at least the next couple of meetings, along with the data dependence and all of that, and no decision on liftoff being made.	23	2
201412	2060	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do agree with your summarizing the SEP views on the conditions at liftoff as being further labor market improvement with inflation running near current levels.	23	2
201412	2061	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, on that, I would make sure that this isn’t described as necessary conditions for liftoff—that we need a 1.5 percent on inflation or a 5.7 percent or something on unemployment—but that it’s described as, under the current view of the Committee, these are the conditions that are expected around liftoff.	23	2
201412	2062	2014-12-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I support alternative B, and thank you.	23	2
201412	2063	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2064	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201412	2065	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2066	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201412	2067	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I like several aspects of alternative B.	23	2
201412	2068	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, we were overconstrained by the “considerable time” language.	23	2
201412	2069	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given our imperfect understanding of wage and price dynamics, we should be flexible to move the timing of our liftoff up or back, depending on incoming data.	23	2
201412	2070	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, it further emphasizes that we’d be moving from time-dependent to more data- driven language as monetary policy normalizes.	23	2
201412	2071	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, patience is the appropriate policy for now.	23	2
201412	2072	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nominal wage growth and price inflation have been stubbornly low.	23	2
201412	2073	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should wait for some evidence that inflation is more clearly on a gradual path toward our 2 percent inflation target.	23	2
201412	2074	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Certainly, lower oil prices and a stronger dollar will have some effect on the overall level of prices, but to have such little evidence of wage and price pressures indicates that we still have significant labor market slack.	23	2
201412	2075	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The challenge is likely to be determining when to stop being patient.	23	2
201412	2076	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it is very unlikely that we will have much evidence of wage and price pressures soon, certainly not at the next two meetings.	23	2
201412	2077	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, the earliest is likely to be the middle of next year.	23	2
201412	2078	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	This will be the art of the liftoff.	23	2
201412	2079	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We want to make sure we have enough evidence that labor markets have tightened, but we must have and must appreciate the need for some insurance, given the long lags and uncertainty surrounding the effect of our first tightening.	23	2
201412	2080	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the two questions that you have, I actually very much like the word “patient.”	23	2
201412	2081	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it is an improvement.	23	2
201412	2082	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If you define it in terms of “unlikely at the next several meetings,” it is very unlikely that we would have any evidence that wages and prices are going to be moving toward 2 percent in the next two meetings.	23	2
201412	2083	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I’m very comfortable with that.	23	2
201412	2084	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If anything, even though we should look through the oil price changes, it’s going to be very hard to look through them over the next two meetings.	23	2
201412	2085	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I think it is very appropriate.	23	2
201412	2086	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of tying it to the SEP liftoff and providing a little more clarity as to what we want to see to take the word “patient” out, I believe that’s more difficult.	23	2
201412	2087	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t think we want to be overly specific on that.	23	2
201412	2088	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would want to be confident we’re moving back to 2 percent inflation, and so that’s not just labor market statistics.	23	2
201412	2089	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s not just wages or prices.	23	2
201412	2090	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s looking at the constellation of data that we have and saying that we have more confidence than what we’ve had over the past several years that we’re actually on the right path.	23	2
201412	2091	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I would not tie it to labor market markers that, at the same inflation rate and with a slightly lower unemployment rate, would be sufficient.	23	2
201412	2092	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I don’t think it would be sufficient just to see one piece of data on wages or prices.	23	2
201412	2093	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’re going to want to look at the constellation and—	23	2
201412	2094	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Just to clarify, what I said was that we would want to be reasonably confident that inflation is moving back toward our target, even though it’s below.	23	2
201412	2095	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I meant that to take account of exactly what you’re saying.	23	2
201412	2096	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	That’s not any simple statistic.	23	2
201412	2097	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	It’s looking at a whole constellation of factors to make that judgment.	23	2
201412	2098	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	23	2
201412	2099	2014-12-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we’re reasonably confident that we’re back on the path toward the 2 percent inflation rate, I would be comfortable with that.	23	2
201412	2100	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2101	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201412	2102	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2103	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I can support alternative B today as offered, because it’s merely a modest restatement of our current patient policy strategy without committing to a date-based future action.	23	2
201412	2104	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	That said, I expect the public to quickly embrace June 2015 as the focal point for our eventual policy liftoff, and I’m uncomfortable with that assessment today as I read the economic situation.	23	2
201412	2105	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	After six years of inflation averaging 1½ percent, I would prefer a course of action that maximizes our likelihood of achieving 2 percent inflation by 2017 at the latest, and we need to hit our price-stability objective in a sustainable manner, not simply as a short-term burst of transitory relative price adjustments when oil prices bounce back.	23	2
201412	2106	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Given my assessment of the economy’s fundamentals, I myself will be surprised if it becomes appropriate to begin increasing short-term policy rates before March 2016.	23	2
201412	2107	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But things can change—I recognize that.	23	2
201412	2108	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Within this context, I prefer the conditional language in paragraph 3ʹ of alternative A.	23	2
201412	2109	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Its conditionality with respect to achieving our price-stability mandate is much clearer, and I believe the public would better infer that we intend to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective sooner rather than later.	23	2
201412	2110	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	At a time when the Bank of Japan and the ECB are struggling at the zero lower bound with low inflation, there’s no more powerful tool available than a strong and credible public expectation of actions to achieve this better outcome.	23	2
201412	2111	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	This is an important preventive defense for ourselves.	23	2
201412	2112	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Without such a marker, I fear that the focal point for liftoff will be too firmly date-based on June 2015, without enough data conditionality, in the event our inflation improvements stall.	23	2
201412	2113	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I did like very much some of the suggestions that President Lockhart made in terms of trying to push a little further into the future the start of our normalization.	23	2
201412	2114	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, yesterday you listed a number of policy caveats related to this conditionality test.	23	2
201412	2115	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I believe my own list is well aligned with your comments.	23	2
201412	2116	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	For me to envision a June 2015 liftoff as the appropriate response to economic conditions, I would like to see a number of developments—first, continued strong employment growth, associated improvements in other labor market indicators, and continued growth above potential.	23	2
201412	2117	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Second, I’d want to see clear signs that wages were beginning to increase toward the range of 3 to 4 percent that I associate with neutral cost pressures.	23	2
201412	2118	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I think this is important for reinforcing the evidence that resource gaps have been sufficiently narrowed and for establishing cost increases that would be more consistent with an underlying inflation rate of 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2119	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	The third important condition would be an increase in TIPS-based inflation expectations from today’s low levels.	23	2
201412	2120	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	As you and President Kocherlakota mentioned yesterday, there are serious costs when we live in a world with low inflation, a low equilibrium real rate, and monetary policy stuck at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201412	2121	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	If market measures of inflation compensation are lower today because the market participants are much more mindful of and averse to these costly low-inflation scenarios, then the FOMC should better ensure that we hit our 2 percent objective with greater confidence and more quickly.	23	2
201412	2122	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	The final signal I would be looking for would be an increase in my inflation projection to 2 percent in 2017 at the latest under the contemplated post-liftoff path.	23	2
201412	2123	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	As you suggested yesterday, Madam Chair, there is a risk that core and underlying inflation measures could become persistently too low owing to relative price downdrafts outside of our control.	23	2
201412	2124	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	You mentioned that you would be monitoring for things like that.	23	2
201412	2125	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	It’s not your base case, of course.	23	2
201412	2126	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	In this case, inflation’s behavior would likely be inconsistent with our price-stability objective, in my opinion.	23	2
201412	2127	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	We thus may still need to reinforce our patient, data-conditional policy messages along the path in order to keep inflation up.	23	2
201412	2128	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	It’s certainly possible that these caveats will be overcome by mid-2015.	23	2
201412	2129	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	That’s part of the conditionality test.	23	2
201412	2130	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Still, I continue to worry that we’re hoping to thread the needle and bring inflation up to 2 percent from below without ever crossing over 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2131	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I think this hopeful scenario is fraught with risks that inflation will stall out before we get to 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2132	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	If confronted with a choice of stalling at 1½ or 1¾ percent inflation versus modestly overshooting inflation at 2¼ to 2½ percent inflation for a time, I firmly believe that the latter is more consistent with our stated long-run strategy for monetary policy.	23	2
201412	2133	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Now, on the questions that you asked, I think your characterization of the liftoff dates is accurate—almost all participants in 2015.	23	2
201412	2134	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I don’t disagree with that.	23	2
201412	2135	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	In terms of the definition of “patient,” my own preference is some adjustment along the lines that President Lockhart was trying to convey, so it would be longer than one to two meetings.	23	2
201412	2136	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	But I defer to your judgment on that.	23	2
201412	2137	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	I understand the importance of this, and I would not disagree with the important objectives you have for the press conference today.	23	2
201412	2138	2014-12-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2139	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2140	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201412	2141	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2142	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	For some time I’ve argued that, as we approach a more normal policy-setting environment, we should be moving our forward guidance away from date-based guidance to more state-contingent guidance describing the conditions we deem important in determining appropriate policy.	23	2
201412	2143	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	In reformulating the forward guidance, over time, I believe we should strive to remove the focus from the date of a policy change to the conditions we look at in determining actual and projected progress of the economy toward our goals.	23	2
201412	2144	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Chair Yellen’s remarks yesterday, on the economic conditions and indicators she’ll be looking at in coming months to inform her view of when to lift off, seemed a very good way to frame the discussion—perhaps not doable in the statement, but something to strive for in our public discourse and around the table.	23	2
201412	2145	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Similarly, at our October meeting, we took an important step in the right direction in our statement by adding the qualifier that the timing of liftoff would vary if incoming information suggested either faster- or slower-than-anticipated progress toward our goals.	23	2
201412	2146	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	With the end of the asset purchase program, with market participants expecting some type of change in guidance, and with the Chair holding a postmeeting press conference, we have a unique opportunity to take a further step today to clarify our policy expectations.	23	2
201412	2147	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Now, my preferred choice of guidance would be different than in alternative B.	23	2
201412	2148	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	But, given that we will be taking out the “considerable time” qualifier at the next meeting, as you suggest, and as you plan in the press conference to clarify what “patient” means, I can support that going forward today.	23	2
201412	2149	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Also, the fact that you’re going to give some context for what we’re going to have to see in order to have liftoff is, I think, the right way to go.	23	2
201412	2150	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So I’m very supportive of that.	23	2
201412	2151	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	My own preference would be not to put a number, necessarily, on core inflation but to describe that it probably won’t be at 2 percent, and that we’re going to be forward-looking.	23	2
201412	2152	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So I support that.	23	2
201412	2153	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	I do think it’s right to change the forward guidance today, notwithstanding some of the comments that we heard from President Lockhart and others about there being some risks to changing the forward guidance.	23	2
201412	2154	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Looking ahead, based on the economic progress that’s been made and my forecast of continued progress, I believe the time for lifting off from the zero lower bound is nearing, and we have to do our best to prepare the public and markets for it.	23	2
201412	2155	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The SEP suggests the consensus among participants is that liftoff is going to be in the first half of the year provided the economy evolves as anticipated.	23	2
201412	2156	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The policy rules that we look at and the optimal control exercises in the Tealbook all point to an approaching liftoff.	23	2
201412	2157	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Monetary policy will, of course, remain extremely accommodative for some time to come, even after the first rate increase.	23	2
201412	2158	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	And I think that’s something that we need to inform the public of as well.	23	2
201412	2159	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Yet, of course, liftoff will certainly be a historic event, given the journey the economy and monetary policy have been on for the past six years.	23	2
201412	2160	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The Committee always has to balance several considerations when it begins contemplating a change in policy direction.	23	2
201412	2161	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	But, in the current circumstances, these considerations are heightened.	23	2
201412	2162	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	We’ve seen several false starts, when it looked as though the economy was poised to accelerate, only to slow down again.	23	2
201412	2163	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So it’s natural to be cautious, especially with interest rates at the zero lower bound, making the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks.	23	2
201412	2164	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, recent data suggest growth and employment may be accelerating more than anticipated.	23	2
201412	2165	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we’ve not been in the situation of zero interest rates before.	23	2
201412	2166	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	So we may be underestimating the costs of moving too slowly to normalize policy.	23	2
201412	2167	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The Committee will, of course, continue to monitor economic developments and will do its best to balance these considerations.	23	2
201412	2168	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	We do not know today when liftoff will be appropriate.	23	2
201412	2169	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	It will depend on how the economy evolves.	23	2
201412	2170	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	But we do know that a large majority of participants assess that the economy will evolve so that liftoff will be appropriate in the first half of next year.	23	2
201412	2171	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	With liftoff in sight, it is prudent to continue to prepare the public for the contemplated policy change that will be coming so that they will not be caught off guard.	23	2
201412	2172	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	And I do like the fact that you’re going to use a press conference for that.	23	2
201412	2173	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2174	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201412	2175	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2176	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have just a few remarks.	23	2
201412	2177	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to talk about three topics.	23	2
201412	2178	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	One is that the constellation of data that we face today is not consistent with a policy rate pinned down at the zero lower bound, and, for this reason, I think it’s important for the Committee to be considering normalization strategies.	23	2
201412	2179	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I’ll talk about that a little bit.	23	2
201412	2180	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The second topic is that inflation expectations are falling.	23	2
201412	2181	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is of paramount concern for a central bank.	23	2
201412	2182	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation expectations should not fall over a horizon as long as 5 to 10 years.	23	2
201412	2183	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We need to be ready to react to this, if necessary.	23	2
201412	2184	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Frankly, I don’t think that we’re ready to react to this.	23	2
201412	2185	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Third, our policy options today are cementing date-dependent policy.	23	2
201412	2186	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Evans on this, and I have some suggestions about how to move toward more state-contingency by creating windows of meetings at which the Committee may potentially move, instead of single meetings.	23	2
201412	2187	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	On the first topic, concerning the constellation of data, unemployment is only a few ticks away from our own estimates of the natural rate.	23	2
201412	2188	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	If you’d rather look at indexes of labor market performance, they are also not far from their long-run averages.	23	2
201412	2189	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation is only a few ticks away from our target.	23	2
201412	2190	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Constructing a quadratic objective in inflation and unemployment deviations, as we have in St Louis, shows that this Committee is closer to achieving its goals than at about 90 percent of the Committee meetings that have occurred since 1960.	23	2
201412	2191	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I think the idea that we’re far away from our goals is false.	23	2
201412	2192	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The policy stance, on the other hand, is to have the policy rate still near zero and liftoff still some time away.	23	2
201412	2193	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The policy stance is dramatically different from what it has been for similar data constellations in the past.	23	2
201412	2194	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We have a large balance sheet, and we have a zero interest rate policy.	23	2
201412	2195	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	From this perspective, our policy is badly out of position compared with historical norms.	23	2
201412	2196	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I want to push back against those who believe it’s inappropriate to be thinking about normalization.	23	2
201412	2197	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It’s totally appropriate to be thinking about normalization now and at coming meetings.	23	2
201412	2198	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The second topic is that inflation expectations are falling, and I don’t think we should be making as many excuses about this as we are at this meeting.	23	2
201412	2199	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The experience in Japan over the past 20 years and in the euro area today shows that allowing expectations of inflation over longer-term horizons to fall can create unique and very difficult problems for central banks.	23	2
201412	2200	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We need to be prepared, although it’s not my baseline case, to make a move—and possibly a dramatic move—to shore up inflation expectations, if that becomes necessary, over the next six months.	23	2
201412	2201	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Probably the most potent tool we have at this point, given that QE is out of the picture, would be to delay the date of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2202	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I have argued in the past that promising to stay at zero even longer can be counterproductive with regard to inflation expectations, and so if we have to do this, I want to do it in a particular way.	23	2
201412	2203	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	If we have to delay liftoff at some point in order to shore up longer-run expectations, I would prefer to do that in reaction to bullish data on the economy, as opposed to weakening data on the economy.	23	2
201412	2204	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	That would send a signal that it’s the expectations of inflation we care about, and it’s not sending the signal that we think the economy is going to be weaker in the future, and that we’re reacting to that.	23	2
201412	2205	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This has been a very difficult issue for the Committee over the past five years, but, if we have to play that card, that’s the way I would prefer to play it.	23	2
201412	2206	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	That would avoid the negative feedback that could otherwise occur—we’re delaying liftoff because we see a weaker economy in the second half of 2015 or out into 2016, and we see even lower inflation numbers.	23	2
201412	2207	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	That process can become self-fulfilling and lead to a bad equilibrium, and that’s exactly what we’re trying to avoid.	23	2
201412	2208	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I would just put that out there as a possible contingency if the inflation expectations situation does not turn around in the next six months.	23	2
201412	2209	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	There is a fairly substantial risk that inflation will continue to decline—and that, possibly, inflation expectations will continue to decline—in the months ahead.	23	2
201412	2210	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The third topic is that our policy choices today are cementing too much date dependency.	23	2
201412	2211	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The probabilities of action by this Committee are totally piling up on June.	23	2
201412	2212	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The primary dealer survey put no weight on meetings other than meetings that had a press conference attached, and put most weight on the June meeting as a possible date of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2213	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s particularly telling that we have a lot of weight on the June meeting—no primary dealers, or maybe only one, on the April meeting, and none on the July meeting.	23	2
201412	2214	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So, ideally, as we’re sitting here today, we should see a spread-out probability structure of three possible meetings.	23	2
201412	2215	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to suggest a way to do that here.	23	2
201412	2216	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	What are the dangers with putting all of your eggs in the June basket?	23	2
201412	2217	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think one of the main dangers for the Committee is that the data running up to the June meeting aren’t ideal or aren’t what we’re hoping for.	23	2
201412	2218	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, if they are, everything will go smoothly.	23	2
201412	2219	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m talking about the case in which they’re not.	23	2
201412	2220	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Suppose we get somewhat weaker data during that period.	23	2
201412	2221	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Then, should the Committee decide to plow ahead, even with less-than-desirable data, that can erode the credibility of the Committee that policy is state dependent, because what you’re doing is saying, “We’re going to move in June even if the data don’t agree with us.”	23	2
201412	2222	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And then people start to think that we’re not sufficiently attentive to incoming data on the economy.	23	2
201412	2223	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I also would like to reiterate that I think this harms the natural decisionmaking process on the Committee.	23	2
201412	2224	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of the compromise on the Committee has to do with trading off things that you might do at one meeting versus doing them at the next meeting or possibly pulling them earlier.	23	2
201412	2225	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Because of our press conference structure, it puts a lot of pressure on certain meetings.	23	2
201412	2226	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Members of the Committee feel as though, if they’re going to get something done, they want to get it done at a particular meeting, and it hardens positions, I think, relative to what they would otherwise be.	23	2
201412	2227	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	My solution is that we have press conferences associated with every meeting.	23	2
201412	2228	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	At this point, I’m not going to insert the passionate speech about press conferences at every meeting that I’ve given at other meetings in the past, but I’ll reiterate a little bit of it here.	23	2
201412	2229	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think you could announce today, even at the press conference, that we’re going to have press conferences at every meeting in 2015, or you could say, “I would contemplate having press conferences at every meeting in 2015.”	23	2
201412	2230	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This would put all of the dates on the table.	23	2
201412	2231	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It would spread out the probabilities the way I’m talking about.	23	2
201412	2232	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It would make all meetings ex ante identical and distribute the probability of a liftoff move more or less equally among April, June, and July instead of just June.	23	2
201412	2233	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It would create a window for possible action by the Committee.	23	2
201412	2234	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee could then walk into one of those meetings at which the data were relatively favorable and say, “Okay.	23	2
201412	2235	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We’re ready to go at this meeting.”	23	2
201412	2236	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think it would matter much in any of those three meetings, in a macroeconomic sense, as long as we got going on the normalization process.	23	2
201412	2237	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	But it would allow us to move when the data speak to that possibility, instead of having to possibly move against what the data are telling us at a particular meeting.	23	2
201412	2238	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This would mitigate, in my mind, some of the risk of a liftoff event that would be harkening back to the June 2013 meeting and its aftermath, in which, I think, the Committee felt a lot of pressure to do something at that meeting, as opposed to waiting until the August meeting.	23	2
201412	2239	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t believe the Committee was quite ready.	23	2
201412	2240	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	We put a lot of pressure on the press conference.	23	2
201412	2241	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The ultimate reaction of that was that the Committee came off as quite a bit more hawkish than it probably was, and we ended up with the taper tantrum and its effects in the summer of 2013.	23	2
201412	2242	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	You could mitigate quite a bit of this by creating this window of possible meetings at which we could move.	23	2
201412	2243	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that the prospect of a surprise press conference fixes the situation, because this is mostly about expectations, as we sit here today, about when the Committee will move.	23	2
201412	2244	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It’s true that we could move at any time.	23	2
201412	2245	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, we can call a meeting at any time and take action at any time, but we would want to do that only in particularly dire circumstances, and it would shock markets to do that.	23	2
201412	2246	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think the fact that we could call a press conference would fix the problem of expectations, which are really piling up on June at this point.	23	2
201412	2247	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have just a couple of further comments.	23	2
201412	2248	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	One is that, Madam Chair, you asked for comments on defining “patience” as “at least the next couple of meetings.”	23	2
201412	2249	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Here I’d like to associate myself with the comments of President Williams, which I thought were very good.	23	2
201412	2250	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	“Patient” could be interpreted as “a very long time.”	23	2
201412	2251	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Even if you define it in the press conference, there’ll still be market chatter that will continue in the coming weeks, and it might have the effect of pushing out expectations of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2252	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s a risk that we face.	23	2
201412	2253	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think you need to push back hard against that in the press conference in order to get this to be right.	23	2
201412	2254	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I also agree with President Williams that we should define things in the statement and not in press conference comments.	23	2
201412	2255	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	If it is, in fact, the policy of the Committee, we should define it here at the Committee.	23	2
201412	2256	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	It leaves ambiguity to put too much pressure on the press conference, and, at some points in the past—in particular, June 2013—it didn’t work out very well.	23	2
201412	2257	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Let me bring up one other problem with the “patient” language that I think needs to be addressed.	23	2
201412	2258	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	By using “patience” and then defining it as “the next couple of meetings,” we’re harkening back to the 2004–06 tightening cycle, which is not something I would prefer to do.	23	2
201412	2259	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I do not believe that that tightening cycle was very successful in the end.	23	2
201412	2260	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The bursting of the housing bubble caused global macroeconomic disaster, from which we’re still trying to recover.	23	2
201412	2261	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So, saying that we’re going to use “patient” in the same way that we used it in 2004 will immediately trigger a lot of discussion that we’re going to do the whole tightening cycle the way we did it in the period from 2004 to 2006, which involved moves of 25 basis points at 17 consecutive meetings and was way too mechanical and not data dependent enough.	23	2
201412	2262	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I would encourage you, Madam Chair, to push back against the interpretation that this is a repeat of the 2004–06 tightening cycle.	23	2
201412	2263	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And, really, all of us should push back against that interpretation because I don’t think that that was a successful tightening cycle.	23	2
201412	2264	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, my last comment on the word “patient” is that, if we include “patient” in there, which I think we will, taking “patient” out is actually the tightening move.	23	2
201412	2265	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	As soon as you take “patient” out, it means that action is imminent.	23	2
201412	2266	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	This is a general problem with this kind of approach, and that can’t be fixed.	23	2
201412	2267	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee should be aware of this.	23	2
201412	2268	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Once you say you’re going to take “patient” out, you’re basically committing to future action, except, perhaps, in dire circumstances in which the data go in a dramatically different direction.	23	2
201412	2269	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thanks for the opportunity to comment, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2270	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201412	2271	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201412	2272	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I had a question.	23	2
201412	2273	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	You were implying that the dealers were putting very little probability on meetings not associated with  press conferencess.	23	2
201412	2274	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think, in fact, some probability is placed on meetings not associated with press conferences.	23	2
201412	2275	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Actually, the probability mass on June isn’t particularly high, so maybe Simon or Lorie, if you could just—	23	2
201412	2276	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	There is about 26 percent probability on June.	23	2
201412	2277	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	They definitely think it’s more likely—	23	2
201412	2278	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	23	2
201412	2279	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll tell you what data I’m looking at.	23	2
201412	2280	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Wait.	23	2
201412	2281	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Can I just hear the rest of what Simon—	23	2
201412	2282	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Just to say what data I’m looking at, I looked at the New York Fed data on the primary dealer survey.	23	2
201412	2283	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	They were asked a specific question:  When do you think the most likely date is?	23	2
201412	2284	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	And they said June.	23	2
201412	2285	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	One person said April.	23	2
201412	2286	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	No one had weight on other meetings.	23	2
201412	2287	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Some had September.	23	2
201412	2288	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	But, no, that’s the most likely.	23	2
201412	2289	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two questions:  There is, what do you think is most likely?	23	2
201412	2290	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And, what does your probability density function look like across the meetings?	23	2
201412	2291	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Those are very different things, and so we don’t want to confuse those two.	23	2
201412	2292	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	23	2
201412	2293	2014-12-17	meeting	BULLARD	My argument is that we’re going to cement that, and the probabilities are going to pile up on June after this meeting.	23	2
201412	2294	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s possible, but right now, it’s not piled up on June.	23	2
201412	2295	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the point I want to make.	23	2
201412	2296	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, just for comparison—Simon, what are the probabilities that you were going to mention?	23	2
201412	2297	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The weight on June from the dealers is about 26 percent—close to 30 from the sell side.	23	2
201412	2298	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	The sell side actually has quite a lot of weight on the July meeting, which is not a press conference meeting.	23	2
201412	2299	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	So, to me, there is a slight bias to the press conference in their thoughts.	23	2
201412	2300	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	However, most of them seem to think that there is a chance you could move at a non– press conference meeting, because they seem to understand that it’s a data-dependent strategy.	23	2
201412	2301	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Is the other 74 percent spread on both sides or more on the later part?	23	2
201412	2302	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s more toward the later part.	23	2
201412	2303	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s very little weight on this meeting, for example.	23	2
201412	2304	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	January gets a little weight.	23	2
201412	2305	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s about 5 to 6 percent on March.	23	2
201412	2306	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s the same for April, actually, as for March, and then it starts to move up.	23	2
201412	2307	2014-12-17	meeting	POTTER	And there’s still some weight in 2016.	23	2
201412	2308	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2309	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2310	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201412	2311	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2312	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Some of my comments will align with the remarks of President Bullard, but I want to start off by talking about the economy a little bit and reminding us about the progress that we’ve made.	23	2
201412	2313	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I alluded to this somewhat yesterday.	23	2
201412	2314	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Over the past five quarters, GDP growth has come in above 4 percent in three of those quarters.	23	2
201412	2315	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Four out of those five quarters, GDP growth has been 3½ percent or greater.	23	2
201412	2316	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The only bad quarter was winter, as we all know.	23	2
201412	2317	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	If, in December, employment comes in about as we expect, the increase in employment in calendar year 2014 will be the largest since 1999.	23	2
201412	2318	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy is improving.	23	2
201412	2319	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes, inflation is a bit low.	23	2
201412	2320	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m sympathetic to that and sensitive to that.	23	2
201412	2321	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	But I also believe it’s not that far away from where we would like to be, and, indeed, I don’t really think that deflation is the serious problem here.	23	2
201412	2322	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We do want to get our target back up, but I do believe expectations are anchored in a way that will continue.	23	2
201412	2323	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Given this progress and given the state of the economy, I cannot support alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201412	2324	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Alternative C more closely aligns with my assessment of appropriate policy.	23	2
201412	2325	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I believe our policy statement—and the forward guidance, in particular—should reflect the performance that we’ve seen in the economy and the expected continued progress that we think it’s going to make.	23	2
201412	2326	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Our statement needs to communicate in some way that there’s measurable probability that liftoff may occur in the first quarter of next year, even if the most likely scenario is still June.	23	2
201412	2327	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I do not think the somewhat tortured language of alternative B sends that message.	23	2
201412	2328	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s mostly a message of status quo, of no change:  We still are where we thought we’d be, and there’s been no progress other than what we thought.	23	2
201412	2329	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet progress has been quite considerable.	23	2
201412	2330	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I worry that continuing to allow expectations to place near-zero probability of liftoff in the first quarter is asking for more volatility later when we finally do lift off.	23	2
201412	2331	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It also risks making it more difficult to lift off earlier, because we will fear upsetting expectations.	23	2
201412	2332	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	As President Bullard suggested, expectations are piling up on June.	23	2
201412	2333	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	And building those expectations up so high, I think, is not a good idea and is a recipe for volatility.	23	2
201412	2334	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Most policy rules that I consider—for example, those in the Tealbook B—continue to suggest that liftoff should be occurring now, and that the funds rate should be significantly higher than zero by June of next year.	23	2
201412	2335	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	By the way, I want to emphasize that, even after liftoff from the zero bound, policy will remain highly accommodative.	23	2
201412	2336	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to disabuse the public and the markets of the notion that, somehow, highly accommodative policy means staying at zero until we reach our goals.	23	2
201412	2337	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	To me, that is a recipe for big trouble.	23	2
201412	2338	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I also interpret the Board staff’s memo on the relationship between unemployment rate rises and recessions as highlighting the risks of keeping policy overly accommodative.	23	2
201412	2339	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I am on record as indicating that waiting too long to raise rates could lead to the need for more aggressive policy in the future, which could potentially lead to unnecessary volatility and instability.	23	2
201412	2340	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Substituting the word “patient” for “considerable time,” to me, seems unnecessary and confusing.	23	2
201412	2341	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s yet another adjective that we need to explain, and it’s mostly time dependent in its nature.	23	2
201412	2342	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	At least in alternative C, we just drop the word “considerable” and put that it’ll be “a time” before we lift off.	23	2
201412	2343	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, while I’m not happy with that because of its calendar dependence, at least it signals that there’s been a change in the way we’re thinking about forward guidance, and that something is different.	23	2
201412	2344	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Continuing to refer to time, as in alternative C, remains problematic, as I said.	23	2
201412	2345	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I believe that, by using paragraph 3 in alt-C, the markets are more likely to interpret this language in a way that the expected funds rate would look more like our policy rate paths in the SEP than it does now.	23	2
201412	2346	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Let me turn to two issues—about the word “patience” and the suggestions of the Chair.	23	2
201412	2347	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Adding yet another word in “patience” that we have to define makes our statement read like Chinese water torture:  drip, drip, drip.	23	2
201412	2348	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s another definition and another something vague.	23	2
201412	2349	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	But if we use such a term—and this is as President Bullard and President Williams suggested—it’s important that if the Committee believes that it means we won’t move for two meetings, then that ought to go in the statement.	23	2
201412	2350	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s the Committee’s statement.	23	2
201412	2351	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Leaving such things to press conferences is dangerous and risky.	23	2
201412	2352	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	If that’s what the Committee believes, it should put it in the statement.	23	2
201412	2353	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I do think the statement will be read as saying that the probability of a liftoff earlier than June is zero.	23	2
201412	2354	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	And so we’re stuck at June.	23	2
201412	2355	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	To echo what President Bullard said, I don’t believe that contingency planning for a press conference in April would be very effective, because what we need to do is to spread the mass of probability about when liftoff occurs wider and have some mass earlier in the year.	23	2
201412	2356	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	If we don’t, we’re going to find ourselves in a situation in which we’re going to get to that point and we’ll feel as though we want to lift off, but we won’t because we’ll upset expectations.	23	2
201412	2357	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We’re doing ourselves a disservice by doing it this way.	23	2
201412	2358	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	So I would encourage that it go in the statement, not be elaborated on in the press conference.	23	2
201412	2359	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, I like the notion of characterizing the conditions under which we’ll lift off.	23	2
201412	2360	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I actually believe that that ought to be front and center in our discussion of our policy decision, not patience and time.	23	2
201412	2361	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to reverse the ordering of those two discussions and emphasize what we’re looking at when it comes to liftoff.	23	2
201412	2362	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet we’re still making “patient” or “considerable time” the front-and-center message that we’re giving.	23	2
201412	2363	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that’s a mistake.	23	2
201412	2364	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to talk more about the conditions under which we are going to lift off, make our policy state dependent, and not allow it to pile up on expectations of particular dates.	23	2
201412	2365	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	We know that, in the past, that’s frustrated us, and the more we’ve relied on time-related guidance, we have always come to regret it.	23	2
201412	2366	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it was President Bullard who suggested that, once we get “patient” in the statement, it’s going to be yet another word that we’re going to have to figure out how to get out from under and worry about the signals it’s going to give when the time comes.	23	2
201412	2367	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	So I believe this path that we’re on to do it this way is not serving our policy well, no matter whether you want to lift off later or you want to lift off earlier.	23	2
201412	2368	2014-12-17	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2369	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2370	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201412	2371	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2372	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	My main concern about our choice of forward guidance today is that we preserve the flexibility to live up to our promise of data dependence.	23	2
201412	2373	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Today I think we need to be particularly mindful of the fact that the outlook for both inflation and the real economy can change rapidly, and that judgments about appropriate policy can shift accordingly.	23	2
201412	2374	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s not hard to find examples of this in the past, especially around policy turning points.	23	2
201412	2375	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The outlook for real activity shifted dramatically from late 1998 to early 1999.	23	2
201412	2376	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	In late 1998, we were afraid of the domestic effects of overseas turmoil, coincidentally including a fall in the ruble, and then, in early 1999, it became clear that the effects would be minimal, and that growth was picking up pretty rapidly.	23	2
201412	2377	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, the inflation outlook shifted quite significantly from mid-2003, when we thought inflation had sunk below 1 percent, to early 2004, when inflation and growth were clearly rising.	23	2
201412	2378	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	My sense right now, as I talked about yesterday, is that the risks are tilted to the upside for real activity, and, once the transient effects of falling oil prices have passed through, I suspect that the relatively small current shortfall of inflation from target could easily diminish rapidly.	23	2
201412	2379	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Market participants have come to focus on June as the most likely liftoff date.	23	2
201412	2380	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	A number of you have commented on that.	23	2
201412	2381	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But, at this juncture, I think we have to leave the door open for an earlier move, perhaps as early as March.	23	2
201412	2382	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	In the interest of transparency, I will now reveal that I am respondent 17, who, careful readers of the SEP will recall, wrote down April 2015 as the liftoff date.	23	2
201412	2383	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I did so while taking seriously the pledge of our current and previous Chairs that important policy decisions need not be confined to meetings with preannounced press conferences.	23	2
201412	2384	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So I appreciate your intention to explain that to the public.	23	2
201412	2385	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Our 2004 experience suggests that, when conditions warrant, we’re going to want to prepare for liftoff by providing a clear signal in the statement at the previous meeting.	23	2
201412	2386	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That’s just a reality.	23	2
201412	2387	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, the 2004 experience is going to lead people to expect such notice.	23	2
201412	2388	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I think the word “patient” can provide us with that flexibility.	23	2
201412	2389	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The meeting at which we drop it is the one at which we’re essentially signaling a move at the next meeting.	23	2
201412	2390	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I would note—and thanks to President Williams for introducing into the discussion a dictionary definition of “patient” as “not soon”—that I take “soon” to mean “the next meeting.”	23	2
201412	2391	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So “patient” means “not the next meeting.”	23	2
201412	2392	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That’s what “patient” means to me.	23	2
201412	2393	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It seems plain that that’s the natural reading of “patient.”	23	2
201412	2394	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But, to me, “patient” means that we’re not going to move in January, and we can drop “patient” in January and move in March.	23	2
201412	2395	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That seems like the plain interpretation.	23	2
201412	2396	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Now, moving in April would mean making a call in March.	23	2
201412	2397	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So it would mean dropping “patient” in March after two uses, which is, of course, consistent with our 2004 experience.	23	2
201412	2398	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I seriously believe that we could receive data between now and March that make that appropriate to us.	23	2
201412	2399	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	There’s even a chance—a smaller chance, but a chance—that we get data by the January meeting that warrant signaling a March liftoff.	23	2
201412	2400	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I’d note that five of us think that we’re likely to get enough data to lift off in March, and I take it that they’re taking into account a meeting-ahead signaling.	23	2
201412	2401	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So I’m thinking that the SEP indicates that five of us believe we could get data by January to indicate a March liftoff.	23	2
201412	2402	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It would take just four more to move us to a majority to shift from Q2 to Q1—that is, a majority favoring a Q1 liftoff.	23	2
201412	2403	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know whether we will or we won’t.	23	2
201412	2404	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know whether I’m interpreting this correctly or not.	23	2
201412	2405	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But I think it’s a possibility we should prepare for.	23	2
201412	2406	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	That’s my simple point.	23	2
201412	2407	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t believe we should take March off the table.	23	2
201412	2408	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Your language of “a couple of meetings” does not literally do that, and, of course, the recitation of the data- dependence formulation at least provides the fig leaf of contingency and of us dropping the signal in January and moving in March.	23	2
201412	2409	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But I think saying “a couple of meetings” is effectively coming close to the border of taking March off the table, and so I’d be disinclined to use “a couple of meetings” as a formulation.	23	2
201412	2410	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	If I were you, I’d prefer to back off from providing so strong a signal about what “patient” means.	23	2
201412	2411	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I also think that the question of a press conference in April is too important to be left to just a questioner.	23	2
201412	2412	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	If they all have something more important on their minds, then this information doesn’t get out.	23	2
201412	2413	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s important that, if we take that seriously, we need to be really thoughtful about how to prepare for that.	23	2
201412	2414	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	The fact that we’re going to signal this a meeting in advance—one option is just to announce at the meeting at which we drop “patient” that we’re having a press conference at the next meeting.	23	2
201412	2415	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	To my mind, it wouldn’t be inconsistent with the strength of the signal that dropping “patient” is going to provide for us to essentially say, “All right.	23	2
201412	2416	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We’re going to have a press conference at the next meeting.”	23	2
201412	2417	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	If you want to send a smoke screen and provide some optionality, maybe say we’re going to have press conferences in August and July, too.	23	2
201412	2418	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	But I think we could be more thoughtful about approaching the April press conference, and it’s too important to leave to just whether it’s asked in a press conference.	23	2
201412	2419	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	It should be part of your prepared statement.	23	2
201412	2420	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Your characterization of views on participants is something I’m comfortable with, but there’s a nuance here that I think we need to be mindful of.	23	2
201412	2421	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We’re asked in the SEP what conditions would look like when we lift off.	23	2
201412	2422	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	We weren’t asked, “What would you need to see to lift off?”	23	2
201412	2423	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Those are two different things.	23	2
201412	2424	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Some of us might lift off on a given date even if conditions were a little different than the forecast path we’ve written down, given the history we’ve come into these meetings with.	23	2
201412	2425	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Do you see what I’m saying?	23	2
201412	2426	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	23	2
201412	2427	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I didn’t say a whole lot about what people expect.	23	2
201412	2428	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	All I said was some further improvement in labor market conditions and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back up to 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2429	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Right.	23	2
201412	2430	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Those seem to characterize what we all thought would be true when we moved, but we weren’t asked whether those were requirements, conditions, or triggers for us moving.	23	2
201412	2431	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	I know you didn’t characterize it that way, but I want to just be mindful of the distinction and be careful not to characterize it that way, if we haven’t been asked about it that way and haven’t been really discussing those conditions as being that way, given how the SEP is constructed.	23	2
201412	2432	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	So those are my comments, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2433	2014-12-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much.	23	2
201412	2434	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2435	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201412	2436	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2437	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Yesterday’s go-round reflected general confidence in the economy’s ability to sustain growth with labor market strength and stable inflation expectations.	23	2
201412	2438	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	This narrative, although not without noted risk and remaining weak spots, such as housing or tepid wage gains, seems to me inconsistent with a policy that continues to support negative real interest rates and is slow to normalize.	23	2
201412	2439	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	So while I would have preferred to signal an earlier liftoff, as do most policy rules in the Tealbook B, I can support alternative B today and its attempt to lean forward with language changes that offer additional flexibility and the opportunity to underscore conditionality on a path to normalization.	23	2
201412	2440	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	As the Tealbook B, notes and as President Lockhart and others have mentioned, the history associated with the proposed language around “patience” may give the public some sense that we are looking to a sequence of guidance changes from that period.	23	2
201412	2441	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	So I think the Chair’s plan to emphasize data dependence and conditionality about liftoff will be especially important today.	23	2
201412	2442	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	In that regard, I support both approaches that you’ve outlined around the explanation of “patient” and characterizing participant views.	23	2
201412	2443	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Also, in paragraph 1, I would prefer to characterize labor market conditions as having improved “further,” rather than using “somewhat” in that characterization.	23	2
201412	2444	2014-12-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2445	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2446	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201412	2447	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2448	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a couple of remarks.	23	2
201412	2449	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to deviate from my prepared text to start off with, and then I’ll come back to my prepared text.	23	2
201412	2450	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My first remark is about the thinking, as I hear it, around liftoff.	23	2
201412	2451	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m concerned, I guess, about the thinking of liftoff as this discrete event.	23	2
201412	2452	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Mester described it as historic.	23	2
201412	2453	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think President Lockhart has used that same term in public remarks.	23	2
201412	2454	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I worry that we’re bulking it too large as a discrete event and that we’re viewing it as very irreversible.	23	2
201412	2455	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I listened to your description of the conditions that are likely to prevail at the time of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2456	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is obviously not going to be my preferred policy path, but I thought you did a good job yesterday of describing the conditions that are likely to prevail.	23	2
201412	2457	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation might be well below target still at that time.	23	2
201412	2458	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we have to face the fact that this Committee is going to be very—well, let me say a couple of things.	23	2
201412	2459	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is, it would be better if we were to be planning more strategically about what post-liftoff policy is going to look like.	23	2
201412	2460	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have a little bit of time left.	23	2
201412	2461	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We don’t want to have it be that we’re going to raise interest rates by 25 basis points every other meeting.	23	2
201412	2462	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We want to have something that’s more responsive to the ebb and flow of data than just having a sequence or plan like that.	23	2
201412	2463	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we want to be prepared psychologically, within the Committee and publicly, for the possibility that we might return to the zero lower bound, if necessary, to stimulate the economy if conditions evolve accordingly.	23	2
201412	2464	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we build this up too much externally, communicating that liftoff is a historic event and we’re finally liberating the US economy from the chains that it’s been in for the past eight years, that makes it very challenging for us to reverse course after liftoff.	23	2
201412	2465	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So there are two aspects to what I’m trying to say.	23	2
201412	2466	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is planning more strategically within the Committee for what we’re going to be doing after liftoff, and then the second is communicating, I think, about what that strategy is likely to be.	23	2
201412	2467	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second piece I wanted to comment on concerns my thinking.	23	2
201412	2468	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe it’s useful to tie back our policy recommendations to our consensus statement.	23	2
201412	2469	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I want to say a couple of things about the maximum-employment mandate.	23	2
201412	2470	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ve had a great year in terms of employment.	23	2
201412	2471	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Plosser emphasized the right points yesterday.	23	2
201412	2472	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with this completely.	23	2
201412	2473	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It was a fantastic year in terms of employment.	23	2
201412	2474	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But my thinking about the employment mandate is basically asymmetric.	23	2
201412	2475	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t believe that it was included in the Federal Reserve Act as a way to tighten policy.	23	2
201412	2476	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s fundamentally in there as a way to provide a way to ease policy relative to what would be true if we had only a price-stability mandate.	23	2
201412	2477	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More colloquially, no one is going to complain to the Federal Reserve, “You’ve created way too many jobs.	23	2
201412	2478	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Stop creating so many jobs.”	23	2
201412	2479	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what promoting maximum employment means— trying to make jobs as high as you can, given you’ve got a price-stability mandate.	23	2
201412	2480	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the growth in employment is very welcome.	23	2
201412	2481	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It hasn’t influenced my inflation outlook that much relative to a year ago, though, for a variety of reasons.	23	2
201412	2482	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I don’t view it as necessitating a change in policy stance.	23	2
201412	2483	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, regarding a concern that President Plosser raised about employment—if we overshoot on employment, we might have to raise rates in order to bring it back down—I think you’d want to average out.	23	2
201412	2484	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You might have high employment for some period of time and then have lower employment later.	23	2
201412	2485	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The higher employment is a good thing, so we want to take that into account as a positive sign.	23	2
201412	2486	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not about changes per se— it’s about the levels we’re trying to achieve.	23	2
201412	2487	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	23	2
201412	2488	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are the two things I wanted to hit on.	23	2
201412	2489	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I hope I’m encouraging a more strategic approach to both thinking and communicating about post-liftoff policy, and at least my own thinking about the employment mandate is, as I described, basically asymmetric.	23	2
201412	2490	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With all of that in mind, Madam Chair, at this meeting I’m unwilling to support alternative B.	23	2
201412	2491	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would have been willing to support alternative A, especially with paragraph 3ʹ.	23	2
201412	2492	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, as you’ll hear, my analysis of the current situation suggests that an even stronger response is desirable.	23	2
201412	2493	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The situation as I see it is characterized by three key facts.	23	2
201412	2494	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first fact is about past inflation.	23	2
201412	2495	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Year-over-year inflation has run below our 2 percent target for over 30 months.	23	2
201412	2496	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Essentially since the time we announced the target, it’s fallen below target and has stayed below target.	23	2
201412	2497	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second fact is about future inflation.	23	2
201412	2498	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The current FOMC staff projection is that inflation will be below target in each of the next four years.	23	2
201412	2499	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is risk to that outlook, as Governor Fischer reminded us yesterday.	23	2
201412	2500	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should be thinking about this.	23	2
201412	2501	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe the right way to think about this is more in probability space.	23	2
201412	2502	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff projection means that in the staff’s assessment, in any of the next four years, the probability of inflation’s being below target is larger than 50 percent.	23	2
201412	2503	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we weight that, as our Minneapolis memo encouraged us to do, by what kinds of real conditions associated with those low-inflation outcomes are likely to prevail, I think you would be driven to say that the likelihood of low inflation is larger even than 50 percent.	23	2
201412	2504	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Fact 1:  We’ve had low, below-target inflation for 30 months.	23	2
201412	2505	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Fact 2:  Future inflation looks as though it’s going to be low, according to the staff forecast, for four years.	23	2
201412	2506	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Fact 3:  Longer-term inflation expectations have declined.	23	2
201412	2507	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	From November 2010 through July 2014, 31 consecutive meetings, the FOMC went out of its way and was in a position to state that longer-term inflation expectations remained stable.	23	2
201412	2508	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because of the decline in longer-term inflation expectations in the past few months, at least as reflected in the market-based measures, the Committee has not been able to make this assertion in the past two FOMC statements—and in the one that I suspect will be issued today.	23	2
201412	2509	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What is a proposed response to these three facts—low inflation for the past two and a half years, low inflation for the next four years, and declining long-term inflation expectations?	23	2
201412	2510	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The proposed response to these three facts in alternative B is to communicate that the FOMC is continuing on the path of gradual removal of accommodation that it initiated a year ago—or, more arguably, in May 2013.	23	2
201412	2511	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my assessment, the FOMC’s failure to respond to weak inflation runs the risk of creating a harmful downward slide in inflation and inflation expectations of the kind that we have seen in Japan and Europe.	23	2
201412	2512	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll emphasize again that I see this as a risk.	23	2
201412	2513	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s not my baseline outlook—it is a risk.	23	2
201412	2514	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see this risk as unacceptable, given how hard it would be for the FOMC to respond successfully if this risk did, in fact, materialize.	23	2
201412	2515	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I said, I would have been willing to support alternative A at this meeting.	23	2
201412	2516	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But my preferred response would be for the FOMC to communicate that it’ll keep the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged as long as the one-to-two-year-ahead outlook for the inflation rate remains below 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2517	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Going further than that, I think the FOMC should also make clear that, if this forward guidance were to prove inadequate in terms of moving inflation back to target, the Committee is willing to use additional tools, such as asset purchases, to push inflation and inflation expectations upward.	23	2
201412	2518	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2519	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2520	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201412	2521	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, you’re getting a considerable range of views at this meeting, and I’m going to express a view that’s counter to what my distinguished colleague from Minneapolis just expressed.	23	2
201412	2522	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I went back to the transcript of the October meeting.	23	2
201412	2523	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	On page 139, I said, “Optimal policy is very sensitive to changes in economic conditions.	23	2
201412	2524	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Given the sensitivity, I don’t want to be locked into a particular timing of liftoff or pace of substantive rate increases....	23	2
201412	2525	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I consider”—and I’m quoting myself, my favorite source—“‘considerable time’ as having been, and continuing to be, a bad idea.	23	2
201412	2526	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I believe that we need to consider this in December.	23	2
201412	2527	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If economic conditions improve between now and then, that will certainly condition my vote then.”	23	2
201412	2528	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I looked through some of the comments of our colleagues.	23	2
201412	2529	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Governor Powell, for example, said on page 158, “It may well be that in December, depending on conditions and expectations, we can take [‘considerable time’] out of the statement completely.”	23	2
201412	2530	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	President Mester said, “My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the conclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance [and] replace ‘considerable time.’ ”	23	2
201412	2531	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Then she went on to say that we will know from the December SEP if our policy intentions have shifted.	23	2
201412	2532	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We say we are, as President Lacker mentioned, data dependent.	23	2
201412	2533	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	At that meeting in October, we added language, which I thought was wise and therefore voted for, emphasizing that policy would be data driven, not date driven, and trying to take that date-driven edge off it.	23	2
201412	2534	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If our claims that policy is data dependent are to have credibility at all, I believe we must signal that our expectations for liftoff have shifted forward.	23	2
201412	2535	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Also, the sentences we have that have “patient” as a qualifier and which, as you’ve indicated, you will explain during the press conference—I’ll get to that in a minute—retain what I call the past tense pluperfect reference, which is to October when we’re issuing a statement in December.	23	2
201412	2536	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I believe that “the conditions have changed,” to quote Governor Powell, and that expectations have changed and the data have changed, to quote myself.	23	2
201412	2537	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And our SEP has five members expecting liftoff in the first quarter and seven expecting it in the second quarter, so that’s a heavy weight out of the 17 of us who are at the table.	23	2
201412	2538	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The point is, we have to recognize—and I don’t believe alternative B appropriately recognizes—the progress that’s been made in the data, and I don’t believe that the way the statement is written shifts forward to the degree I would like to see it shifting forward.	23	2
201412	2539	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Yesterday Governor Tarullo said we need to be pragmatic.	23	2
201412	2540	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So if you’ll indulge me for a second, I’m going to go back to my past.	23	2
201412	2541	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I started out as a midshipman at the US Naval Academy.	23	2
201412	2542	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I was taught to drive ships.	23	2
201412	2543	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I was stationed on a ship called the USS Truckee.	23	2
201412	2544	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It contained 18 million gallons of the most explosive fuel of all.	23	2
201412	2545	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It was a jet fueler.	23	2
201412	2546	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Prudence demanded that we would ease back on the throttle as we approached our port or near the dock.	23	2
201412	2547	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Otherwise, we ran a substantial risk.	23	2
201412	2548	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Well, we’re considerably closer to that dock now, from an economic standpoint, given the data—even closer than I thought we would be at our previous meeting.	23	2
201412	2549	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Yet, as we get closer, the economy is picking up speed and momentum.	23	2
201412	2550	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It would be irresponsible not to take these changed circumstances into account and acknowledge them in our statement.	23	2
201412	2551	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I don’t believe the statement does that.	23	2
201412	2552	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Madam Chair, much as I’d love to drive across the country with you from San Francisco all of the way to the Lincoln Tunnel—and I think we’d have a lot of fun—I do like the boating or ship analogy better than the driving analogy because a ship doesn’t have brakes and is relatively unforgiving if you overshoot your destination.	23	2
201412	2553	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	In the case of the ship I was on, we would blow up.	23	2
201412	2554	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	We have substantial combustible fuel in $2.9 trillion in reserves.	23	2
201412	2555	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	If you multiply that by the factor of other liquidity in the system, I really do believe that we are in a similar situation to the docking of the ship that I was taught to drive.	23	2
201412	2556	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	You don’t throw the engine into reverse, move to a restrictive policy stance, and immediately arrest your forward motion.	23	2
201412	2557	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I believe that, as we approach this dock and as we see in the data that we’re picking up momentum on the economy, it’s important to start before April in beginning the process of throttling back and arresting our motion.	23	2
201412	2558	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	It’s clear from the statement you made earlier—and I say this with the greatest respect— and from what I heard at the table yesterday, particularly given how people felt and the likely voters next year, that the intention is certainly to move toward possibly throttling back in June.	23	2
201412	2559	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	And Bill’s answer to my question just before dinner confirmed my view on that.	23	2
201412	2560	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’m not saying it’s wrong, Bill—I’m just saying that that seems to be the sentiment at the table.	23	2
201412	2561	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I cannot support alternative B.	23	2
201412	2562	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Now, I realize there are tail risks out there.	23	2
201412	2563	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	There was reference yesterday to the emerging markets, in particular.	23	2
201412	2564	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would be very cautious—and I’ve said this before—in dealing with Japan as an analogy.	23	2
201412	2565	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’ve lived there.	23	2
201412	2566	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’ve worked there.	23	2
201412	2567	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Governor Brainard and I dealt with that.	23	2
201412	2568	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I dealt with it in the Carter Administration, which was a long time ago, Stan.	23	2
201412	2569	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But you cannot possibly liken us to Japan, given the gearing of that economy and given the structural deficiencies that that economy has.	23	2
201412	2570	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Therefore, I do not like, and have never liked, that analogy.	23	2
201412	2571	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	With regard to Russia, you’re right—it’s worrisome.	23	2
201412	2572	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I think the sanctions present a greater issue than even the oil price declines, although that clearly compounds the situation.	23	2
201412	2573	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	What you have is a fierce animal, trapped and caught in a cage, and I don’t believe we should be spending our time worrying about contagion from Russia or what we might do to condition anything that has to do with their behavioral pattern.	23	2
201412	2574	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the other emerging countries, again, we all know that some did well in taking advantage of the low interest rate period to restructure their economies, and that others did extremely poorly.	23	2
201412	2575	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I think we have to worry about our own ship here.	23	2
201412	2576	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Our ship of the economy is indeed approaching the dock that we had, in terms of employment and economic progress, and I think we should start throttling back a little bit earlier.	23	2
201412	2577	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I would agree with President Williams on one thing—taking out the word “somewhat.”	23	2
201412	2578	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	In fact, I’d take out the words “somewhat further” and just say “labor market conditions improved.”	23	2
201412	2579	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	They have.	23	2
201412	2580	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	So I would at least take out the word “somewhat,” and I would suggest taking out the word “further” as well.	23	2
201412	2581	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	With regard to your point, I would simply suggest that you avoid a fixation on having to be at 2 percent inflation, if we have supply-driven disinflationary pressures, in order to start liftoff, as long as you and our successor Committee feel that the expectations are holding.	23	2
201412	2582	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’ll add one other thing.	23	2
201412	2583	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Having been on the first communications subcommittee, I suggested then that whoever was Chair should have a press conference at every meeting.	23	2
201412	2584	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I’m not trying to flatter you, but you have the talent to do that, and I think you should consider it.	23	2
201412	2585	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	The question of when you announce that is really a sensitive issue.	23	2
201412	2586	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I wouldn’t announce that here, because it telescopes a little bit.	23	2
201412	2587	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	But you might consider saying at the next press conference, “We’re having a press conference at every meeting,” because I believe it can be done.	23	2
201412	2588	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I also like it because it gets us out of here well before 12:00 noon.	23	2
201412	2589	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201412	2590	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2591	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201412	2592	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor—	23	2
201412	2593	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Oh, she wants to clarify her statement.	23	2
201412	2594	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	No, I have a question, and maybe you can clarify it.	23	2
201412	2595	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	The way I read the proposal for alternative B is that the “considerable time” is quoting from the October statement.	23	2
201412	2596	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Correct.	23	2
201412	2597	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	And the intention is that in January, you won’t need to do that quoting.	23	2
201412	2598	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, that is correct.	23	2
201412	2599	2014-12-17	meeting	MESTER	Okay—thanks.	23	2
201412	2600	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Remember, Bill English said yesterday that that anchoring could surprise some investors.	23	2
201412	2601	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I understand why it’s there.	23	2
201412	2602	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Again, I refer to it as past tense pluperfect only because it’s an odd juxtaposition.	23	2
201412	2603	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	Yet the attempt is to clarify it with the word “patient.”	23	2
201412	2604	2014-12-17	meeting	FISHER	I think “patient” confounds it the way it’s written, but that’s a minority opinion, obviously.	23	2
201412	2605	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201412	2606	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2607	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Almost everything I want to say has been said, but I’ll put it together differently.	23	2
201412	2608	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	The one thing that hasn’t been said is what I was sure would have been said, which is this quote from Through the Looking-Glass, by Lewis Carroll: “‘When I use a word,’ Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less.’”	23	2
201412	2609	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I thought that was going to be the theme of several speeches.	23	2
201412	2610	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201412	2611	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Actually, I was in the Williams school of “patient,” but then I realized that, having grown up in the British Empire, in which you say things like “terribly nice,” meaning “very nice”	23	2
201412	2612	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	—[laughter]—I’m not a reliable guide to what this term means.	23	2
201412	2613	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	On the issues, this has been a very good discussion.	23	2
201412	2614	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	A lot of very interesting things have been said, but we also have to make a decision.	23	2
201412	2615	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	It was generally agreed yesterday, and everybody today has agreed, that the labor market has been improving recently, particularly in the past two months, and is now within hailing distance of the full-employment rate of unemployment as defined by this meeting’s SEP.	23	2
201412	2616	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We also agreed that the inflation picture is more complicated in that the staff forecast does not get to the 2 percent target level even by 2017.	23	2
201412	2617	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	So when should we begin normalizing?	23	2
201412	2618	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I believe a balanced approach would wait for liftoff until we have both employment and inflation not far from their target levels and expected to move toward their targets.	23	2
201412	2619	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	With unemployment at 5.8 percent and core inflation at 1.5 percent, both employment and inflation are not far from their target levels.	23	2
201412	2620	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	In saying that, I know I’ll be told that 0.5 percent on a number that’s 2 percent is 25 percent.	23	2
201412	2621	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s true.	23	2
201412	2622	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But the precision of that—we had from President Kocherlakota a very interesting discussion on how to think about the unemployment target and suggesting that the next consensus statement should say that the target level of unemployment is zero, and so forth.	23	2
201412	2623	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	On the inflation target, we really do not have a good basis for deciding that it’s 2 percent and not 1.8 percent.	23	2
201412	2624	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I worked at the Bank of Israel with a target range for the inflation rate, but I understand that that was rejected in the consensus statement.	23	2
201412	2625	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	But it seems to me that there’s a significant degree of uncertainty, and that if we were to get stuck at 1.8 percent and the economy was growing rapidly, and so forth, we should not take that as something that requires us to do more to get to 2 percent.	23	2
201412	2626	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	What we have in the forecasts—probably our best forecasts are the staff estimates—but also in the SEP is that they both expect a move toward the target levels, albeit at different rates.	23	2
201412	2627	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	So we need a few more months of data to convince ourselves that the situation justifies the start of normalization, and the wording in alternative B basically says that.	23	2
201412	2628	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	In alt-B, I would also take out the word “somewhat.”	23	2
201412	2629	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I wouldn’t take out the word “further,” because we had enormous amounts of progress on unemployment before the October meeting, and we ought to recognize that as well as what’s happened since October.	23	2
201412	2630	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to just mention a few things that we need to take into account before we start normalizing.	23	2
201412	2631	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, we need to explain repeatedly that liftoff is the end of one story, that of the battle of the zero lower bound, but it is also the start of the no-less-important story of normalization.	23	2
201412	2632	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	And I agree with what was said by President Lacker and by others around the table—that we really are overemphasizing the importance of the liftoff, not in absolute terms but relative to what will happen later.	23	2
201412	2633	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Second, every time we raise rates, we are going to go through a procedure like the one we’ve gone through now.	23	2
201412	2634	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t see that it’s going to be very different.	23	2
201412	2635	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think, as somebody who wasn’t here before, that we are doing things in a different way—with more consensus, more efforts to reach a consensus, and models that have advanced significantly since, say, 20 years ago and even since 2004—and that we’re operating on a new basis.	23	2
201412	2636	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	In that basis, we’ll find every decision as complicated as this one, and we should start making it clear to the world that that’s the situation.	23	2
201412	2637	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	That means that we need to turn our attention and that of the staff, whose technical expertise I value more and more every day, even more to the technical issues that will arise as we normalize, including how to coordinate the use of our two interest rate instruments and when to begin asset sales, which we’ve left on the side, although there was considerable praise yesterday from President Fisher for this memo that was sent around by the Desk.	23	2
201412	2638	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I hope to absorb that thoroughly on the weekend.	23	2
201412	2639	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Third, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about how normalization will play out.	23	2
201412	2640	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We need to continually remind people that the future is uncertain, and I think we also need to try to anticipate the main difficulties we could face during the normalization process.	23	2
201412	2641	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sure the Desk has very clear ideas on this.	23	2
201412	2642	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I suspect we also ought to be looking at the sorts of disturbances, most of them economic—possibly not all economic—that are likely to challenge the markets.	23	2
201412	2643	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	When we lift off, we need to remind ourselves—and this follows on things that I think both President Bullard and President Plosser said—that an interest rate of zero is far from normal, and that monetary policy will continue to be expansionary for a long while, at least for several years after liftoff.	23	2
201412	2644	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	We should also remind ourselves not to get into the mode of “The Fed continued tightening.”	23	2
201412	2645	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	“The Fed continued normalizing” is what we will be doing.	23	2
201412	2646	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	What is the bottom line?	23	2
201412	2647	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	When should we lift off?	23	2
201412	2648	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the answer is, when the data tell us to do so.	23	2
201412	2649	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	And that depends very much on what happens in the next few months, in particular.	23	2
201412	2650	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that we do not have language that rules out March.	23	2
201412	2651	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	It’s less likely by far than June, but it is still possible that the data will surprise us on the upside.	23	2
201412	2652	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2653	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2654	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201412	2655	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2656	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to clarify what I was saying about the employment mandate, because I certainly wasn’t trying to imply that the FOMC should have a target of zero percent unemployment.	23	2
201412	2657	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think about the two mandates as lexicographic, so if inflation is running below target, I don’t need to look at the employment mandate at all.	23	2
201412	2658	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You’re just trying to get inflation back to target.	23	2
201412	2659	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Or if the outlook for inflation is running above target, then the employment mandate comes into play.	23	2
201412	2660	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have to decide whether it’s worth the cost to bring inflation down and how we want to do that—well, I think I’ve tried to say what I meant to say.	23	2
201412	2661	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	23	2
201412	2662	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’m just not sure how you signed on to the consensus statement.	23	2
201412	2663	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m asking myself that question.	23	2
201412	2664	2014-12-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201412	2665	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201412	2666	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2667	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Let me first say that I realized after yesterday’s meeting I had taken a sufficient amount of cold medicine that I wasn’t entirely sure what I had said.	23	2
201412	2668	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	So if I contradict anything I said yesterday, apologies in advance.	23	2
201412	2669	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	This is what I really believe.	23	2
201412	2670	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23	2
201412	2671	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Let me begin by saying I support alternative B.	23	2
201412	2672	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I recognize, as a number of you have pointed out, that there are risks around any shift in language, particularly a shift that is not going cold turkey in getting markets off of thinking in calendar terms but, instead, is trying to wean them somewhat gradually with the use of an intermediate term.	23	2
201412	2673	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I found that a lot of what John said resonated with me—that there are a number of paths to the end, but the end is still the same, which is, when we reach liftoff, to be doing it in a way that I would characterize as eliciting significant but not violent market reactions, because it would have already been sufficiently anticipated, both with economic developments and with things that the Chair had said.	23	2
201412	2674	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	So I think that, with the Chair’s comments not just at the press conference today, but also in the various public opportunities that she has in the first part of and middle of next year, we are in a better position to be weaning the market from a calendar sense and getting them more into a data-dependent sense, which we all purport to believe is the optimal situation.	23	2
201412	2675	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The result of everything we’re doing today probably will be to move to more of a focus on June.	23	2
201412	2676	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	That’s not actually where I am.	23	2
201412	2677	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know what dot number I was, but I had a September liftoff date, and even that, of course, is conditional on the data.	23	2
201412	2678	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I should note in passing that this is another instance in which the failure of the SEP to identify who’s a voter in which year means that we’re providing a little bit of misleading information to markets, because, based on what I’ve heard around the table, I think next year’s voters are a little bit less front loaded in terms of their liftoff date than the participants as a whole.	23	2
201412	2679	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But that’s something to be taken up another day.	23	2
201412	2680	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	The final thing I wanted to say is, the analytic issue of whether the greater risk lies in falling behind an inflation increase, on the one hand, or a premature liftoff, on the other, is one to which many people have alluded, but we haven’t actually discussed it very much.	23	2
201412	2681	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	People have more given their conclusions, either based on faith or based on some reference to past circumstances.	23	2
201412	2682	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I’m inclined to think that the risk of premature liftoff in current circumstances is greater than the risk of falling behind the inflation curve.	23	2
201412	2683	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	In fact, as I sit here today, I think it’s at least as likely that I’ll ultimately be motivated to favor liftoff for financial-stability reasons as for inflation reasons.	23	2
201412	2684	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But it would be useful, perhaps at some point early in the new year, either to have a discussion in a formal sense or to have us individually give some thought to, and bring our thoughts to the table on, this point, because the current conditions are sufficiently different from past cycles of tightening or deferral of tightening as to maybe make some of those semiautomatic references not as salient as they might be.	23	2
201412	2685	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	One question that arises is, would the possible need for a steeper increase after initial liftoff, because liftoff had been delayed, end up imposing costs that outweigh those benefits of delay in the first place?	23	2
201412	2686	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Narayana raised a number of issues—and Governor Fischer did, too—in talking about what the path is going to be following liftoff.	23	2
201412	2687	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Each of those, as Governor Fischer says, is not going to be able to be pinned down because of the uncertainty about what will happen, but a bit more analysis around that may clarify at least my thinking as to when, in these various states, liftoff might be appropriate.	23	2
201412	2688	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	I will say that one of the reasons why I’m inclined toward the greater risk lying in the premature liftoff than in waiting too long is precisely that almost everyone around the table anticipates not a big acceleration in economic growth but, instead, more or less the maintenance of the growth that we’ve seen in everything but the first quarter of this year.	23	2
201412	2689	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	So it doesn’t feel like a circumstance in which things can get away from us, whereas we are at the zero lower bound, we’ve got deflationary risks, at least in other parts of the world, and thus, again, my instinct is that the risks of going too quickly outweigh the risks of waiting a bit.	23	2
201412	2690	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	And President Kocherlakota raised a very good point:  Why don’t we think about going back, even if we have increased?	23	2
201412	2691	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Well, here another consideration would be, what does that do to the credibility of the institution in the eyes of the market if we lift off one month and, a few months later, are saying, “No, actually, we need to go back to zero again”?	23	2
201412	2692	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	All of that, I think, would profit from a formalized discussion that the staff and the Chair lay out for us or even from individuals picking up that theme over the next couple of meetings.	23	2
201412	2693	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	But with all of that, Madam Chair, I support alternative B, and even I think that removing “somewhat” would be okay.	23	2
201412	2694	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	23	2
201412	2695	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And let me say that we are tentatively planning both a staff paper and a discussion of the issues that you mentioned for January.	23	2
201412	2696	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	So I hope we will have a more significant discussion about that and a full go-round.	23	2
201412	2697	2014-12-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2698	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201412	2699	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2700	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B, and I would also support removing “somewhat.”	23	2
201412	2701	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	If the economy moves generally along the baseline path, then I would support lifting off in June, other things being equal.	23	2
201412	2702	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see March as at all off the table.	23	2
201412	2703	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It would take strong results to justify it, but I didn’t think in September that we would have the kinds of employment reports we’ve had since September.	23	2
201412	2704	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	So if you can imagine, we get three more employment reports between now and the March meeting, and, if we get really strong employment reports and, in addition, inflation provides grounds for confidence in a return to 2 percent, then I would see March as potentially on the table as well.	23	2
201412	2705	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Having said that, I also put significant probability mass on liftoff later than June, as in the primary dealer survey.	23	2
201412	2706	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It’s all going to depend on the path of the economy.	23	2
201412	2707	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I actually think we’re getting to the point at which personal assessments of probability matter less than having a plan for dealing with the entire probability distribution.	23	2
201412	2708	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Getting to the language, I do like “patient” for both practical and other reasons.	23	2
201412	2709	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	First, in terms of “considerable time,”	23	2
201412	2710	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I guess I regard “considerable time” as effectively out of the statement, given, as President Mester pointed out, that this is really referring back to a previous statement.	23	2
201412	2711	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It effectively is a dead letter and certainly will be a dead letter during the press conference.	23	2
201412	2712	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	When someone asks you if it’ll be in the January statement, I suspect you’ll say, “No.”	23	2
201412	2713	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	So I think it is out of the statement for all practical purposes at that point.	23	2
201412	2714	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I also think we’re talking now about one or two meetings in either direction, and there’s not a lot that really rides on that in the long run.	23	2
201412	2715	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	As long as we are transparent, predictable, and data-based in what we do here, it’ll be okay.	23	2
201412	2716	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Having said that, there’s another reason that I like the word “patient”	23	2
201412	2717	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	:  I look at the risk weighting of undershooting and overshooting by a couple of meetings as asymmetric.	23	2
201412	2718	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The very difficult mistake to recover from would be to go too soon.	23	2
201412	2719	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Maybe there’s an exogenous event, but, in any case, we go, and then suddenly things turn bad for some reason that will look really obvious in hindsight.	23	2
201412	2720	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Now we’re sitting around this table talking about restarting the asset purchase program and suffering from immense criticism that will be very hard to defend.	23	2
201412	2721	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	That’s a place where we really don’t want to be.	23	2
201412	2722	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	If we turn out to be a meeting or two late, we can move a little faster.	23	2
201412	2723	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	There are ways to deal with that.	23	2
201412	2724	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I just don’t see those risks as particularly symmetric.	23	2
201412	2725	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s appropriate at this time to start to prepare the public—the markets, really—for the onset of normalization.	23	2
201412	2726	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	There could easily be a reaction in the markets after this statement.	23	2
201412	2727	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I think that would be appropriate.	23	2
201412	2728	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Turning to your two questions at the beginning of this round, Madam Chair, I’m okay with your definition of “patient.”	23	2
201412	2729	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I do think we need a shorter-handled tool, in a way.	23	2
201412	2730	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	“Considerable time” was really a six-month tool.	23	2
201412	2731	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	“Patient” is really a two-meeting tool.	23	2
201412	2732	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I realize that’s time based and kind of awkward, but it’s also swimming in a sea of data dependency and seems to work, and we should do what works.	23	2
201412	2733	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	In terms of leaving meetings on the table, I’ll conclude with this thought:  It’s really a bad idea to think that we could raise rates and do it in the sense of calling a press conference suddenly at the end of a meeting or the day of a meeting.	23	2
201412	2734	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	That is not a way I would go at all.	23	2
201412	2735	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I just think it can’t be that important to do it.	23	2
201412	2736	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It would have to be really important to raise rates then rather than seven weeks later.	23	2
201412	2737	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	It would be a big surprise to the market.	23	2
201412	2738	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	This is a tremendously important event in our history, and it ought not to be thrown together in that way.	23	2
201412	2739	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	So I guess I would offer for consideration a thought that, if it’s a close call in March, then there would be an option to put April on the table, and maybe July as well, at that time, but well in advance.	23	2
201412	2740	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	If we’re going to put April on the table, I wouldn’t do it on the day of the meeting.	23	2
201412	2741	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	I would do it as part of the March meeting so that we don’t surprise the market.	23	2
201412	2742	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	As I said, it’s really critical that we be transparent.	23	2
201412	2743	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	The market will come to understand what we’re going to do if we’re transparent and predictable, and that’s tremendously important in this process.	23	2
201412	2744	2014-12-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2745	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2746	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201412	2747	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2748	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, we have seen two strong payroll reports, and the labor market is clearly continuing to strengthen, which is very welcome.	23	2
201412	2749	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But, of course, we also see continued risks associated with below-target inflation, with some deterioration in market-based measures of inflation expectations and this taking place against a global backdrop, which is broadly disinflationary.	23	2
201412	2750	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	What does this mean for policy?	23	2
201412	2751	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	First, it’s important to acknowledge that the continued underlying momentum in the economy validates the pace of tapering and the end of asset purchases.	23	2
201412	2752	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s a very welcome change from previous attempts to end unconventional policy.	23	2
201412	2753	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, conditions overall, I think, validate our strategy of remaining somewhat cautious on the removal of monetary accommodation, although I believe we can acknowledge that the date of liftoff is now coming more clearly into view.	23	2
201412	2754	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	For my part, I think market expectations are nicely aligned with our outlook on the appropriate timing of liftoff, which makes me quite cautious about any change in wording that could perturb current expectations.	23	2
201412	2755	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The danger is that markets take signal from the change in wording when none is intended, and, of course, we know from past experience how disruptive unintended signals can be.	23	2
201412	2756	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, I would probably have been more comfortable leaving the existing forward guidance anchored and making the outlook section of the statement do more of the work.	23	2
201412	2757	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think I would not have been inclined to introduce a new qualitative concept.	23	2
201412	2758	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I worry, in particular, that the choice of the word “patient” could be read as suggesting the same timing and pace of tightening as the last time the word was used, neither of which is appropriate to today’s conditions.	23	2
201412	2759	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	However, I think we all recognize that many around this table did not like the existing language and were very uncomfortable keeping it, and, under those constraints, I think the language in alternative B is as good an approach as any of the alternatives.	23	2
201412	2760	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, I would give my vote to the Chair in navigating these shoals and gently guiding market expectations using the press conference.	23	2
201412	2761	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the outlook, the main takeaways on the outlook for the full employment part of the dual mandate are captured well by paragraphs 1 and 2.	23	2
201412	2762	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I would also be inclined to drop the word “somewhat.”	23	2
201412	2763	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Describing the recent data and outlook for inflation is trickier.	23	2
201412	2764	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I still believe, in light of recent data, that, as resource slack diminishes further, inflation is likely to move back up toward our 2 percent goal, but the risks to that outlook are clearly on the downside.	23	2
201412	2765	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So I think it’s right to note, as alternative B does, some concern about the inflation outlook and just to recognize that, if we were in the same circumstances with a sharp increase in the price of oil and as far away from the 2 percent target above it as we are currently below it, we would certainly note that in our statement.	23	2
201412	2766	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe it’s appropriate to do that here.	23	2
201412	2767	2014-12-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2768	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2769	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you all for your—	23	2
201412	2770	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve got one more.	23	2
201412	2771	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, sorry.	23	2
201412	2772	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	My deepest apologies.	23	2
201412	2773	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	No worries.	23	2
201412	2774	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It happened one time under Chairman Bernanke’s watch, too.	23	2
201412	2775	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So you can do it once.	23	2
201412	2776	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter.]	23	2
201412	2777	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B, and I am comfortable with what the Chair proposes to communicate at the press conference in terms of the “patient” language.	23	2
201412	2778	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think “at least the next couple of meetings” is a good way of characterizing it.	23	2
201412	2779	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the way you propose to characterize the participants’ views for 2015 sounds very good to me.	23	2
201412	2780	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Before I get into the statement language, I do want to make some more general observations about monetary policy.	23	2
201412	2781	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, in terms of my own thinking, I believe the likely timing of liftoff has moved in somewhat, given the strength of the recent data and the fact that I have greater confidence now that that momentum will be sustained in 2015.	23	2
201412	2782	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s not just having strong employment reports, but also being more confident that the momentum will be sustained.	23	2
201412	2783	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Before, I was putting more of my weight on June than other meetings, but my expectations were more skewed June or later.	23	2
201412	2784	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now I would say that I see June as more of a midpoint, with the probability weight of June also increasing somewhat.	23	2
201412	2785	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The important question in my mind, as I talked about yesterday, is how much weight to give to the decline in inflation that’s been generated by this sharp drop in energy prices.	23	2
201412	2786	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	My own bias has been mostly to look through that decline as long as the decline does not lead to a fall in wage compensation and other recent nominal income trends are largely undisturbed, and provided that inflation expectations remain broadly anchored.	23	2
201412	2787	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	To date, I view these two conditions as still in place, and, because lower oil prices are likely to be a net positive for growth, that’s also important, as it increases my confidence in the sustainability of the expansion.	23	2
201412	2788	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for the time being, I’m very much looking through the decline in oil prices, although that could change in light of future developments.	23	2
201412	2789	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, in terms of this issue of being patient with respect to the timing of liftoff, not in terms of the statement language but more as a general concept, I think it’s also important not to be too patient.	23	2
201412	2790	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, some argue—and I’ve made the argument myself—that it would be less risky to be a little bit late rather than a bit early in terms of the timing of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2791	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I still agree with that, but I do think it’s important not to push that idea too far.	23	2
201412	2792	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, if we were too late and the unemployment rate were to fall considerably below the natural rate, inflation could rise substantially above our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201412	2793	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand that the Phillips curve is very flat, so there’s a low probability of this happening.	23	2
201412	2794	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But this rests on the very strong assumption that inflation expectations will remain well anchored even at very low unemployment rates, and I’m just not sure that that’s actually the case.	23	2
201412	2795	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If the unemployment rate fell very low, the Phillips curve would steepen, and so there’s a risk in that.	23	2
201412	2796	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some argue that, if that happened, we have the tools to deal with that situation.	23	2
201412	2797	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s true, but if we’re late, we would really have to make monetary policy tight in order to push the unemployment rate up, and that would be quite problematic.	23	2
201412	2798	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The staff memo talks about the fact that, in the postwar period, every time the unemployment rate has risen four-tenths of 1 percent or more on a three-month moving-average basis, the US economy has tumbled back into recession.	23	2
201412	2799	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s not something that I want to revisit any time soon, because I don’t think I want to probe the zero lower bound again, at least during my tenure.	23	2
201412	2800	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, I believe it’s desirable to get off the zero lower bound as long as we think we can do so safely.	23	2
201412	2801	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Although we refer to a rise in the federal funds rate target as a tightening of monetary policy—and this harkens back to what Stan was saying—there’s a problem there in terms of talking about the tightening of monetary policy, because all that the first hikes are going to do is to be a very slight removal of a very high level of accommodation.	23	2
201412	2802	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we need to emphasize that fact in our communications—that even after the initial few tightening moves, monetary policy will still be very supportive of economic activity.	23	2
201412	2803	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Fourth, in terms of how fast to go once we begin to raise the federal funds rate, obviously, the economic news will be very important.	23	2
201412	2804	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But how financial market conditions evolve is going to be important as well, and this deserves more emphasis in terms of our communications.	23	2
201412	2805	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The linkage of monetary policy to the real economy works through the transmission channel of financial market conditions.	23	2
201412	2806	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So if it’s like the taper-tantrum episode and if financial conditions were to tighten significantly with the first rate hike, then we should go more slowly, everything else being equal.	23	2
201412	2807	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Conversely, if financial conditions don’t tighten at all, which has been the situation since we began to end the asset purchase program, then we need to move more quickly.	23	2
201412	2808	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think we need to get market participants sensitized to this—that financial market conditions are going to be an important factor in our thinking in terms of the monetary policy normalization process.	23	2
201412	2809	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If they internalize the importance of financial market conditions in our own thinking, this would presumably reduce the risk of unusually large movements in financial market conditions in response to our actions.	23	2
201412	2810	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This would be a good outcome, at least initially, because our control of financial market conditions might be quite poor at first.	23	2
201412	2811	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, raising short-term rates for the first time in more than six years is a substantial regime shift.	23	2
201412	2812	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, given all of the uncertainties about how financial conditions will respond at liftoff, I do think it’s important that we try to have liftoff occur with as little drama as possible.	23	2
201412	2813	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s already going to be plenty of drama in lifting off with a new set of tools and in a regime shift of raising short-term rates after more than six years at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201412	2814	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I do think we want to foreshadow the expected timing of tightening as much as is feasible, subject to the inherent uncertainties of the economic outlook.	23	2
201412	2815	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In an ideal scenario, the initial rate hike would occur precisely when it’s broadly expected.	23	2
201412	2816	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This would work best to minimize the risks of another taper tantrum and minimize the risks of disruption to global financial markets.	23	2
201412	2817	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It also might help minimize the risks of the types of large-scale capital flow reversals that we saw in 2013 that made life particularly difficult for some emerging market economies.	23	2
201412	2818	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning now to the statement, I think we want the statement to be read as modestly hawkish, reinforcing the notion that June, conditional on the data coming in relatively close to our expectations, is becoming more likely.	23	2
201412	2819	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The Chair can reinforce this at the press conference.	23	2
201412	2820	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement generally does this, and, particularly, it seems a little bit more positive about the growth outlook.	23	2
201412	2821	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t overemphasize the fact that inflation is below our objective, noting in paragraph 2 that inflation is expected to move back toward target.	23	2
201412	2822	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We could even be a little bit more positive on the growth side in paragraph 1, but I can accept it as written.	23	2
201412	2823	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I would take out the word “somewhat” because I do think we want to indicate that we really have upgraded our outlook a little bit.	23	2
201412	2824	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I definitely would support that.	23	2
201412	2825	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Getting the right message on inflation is very important right now because a lot of market participants are unclear about how much weight we will give to inflation in determining the timing of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2826	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We need to make it very clear that we don’t have an inflation threshold.	23	2
201412	2827	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, there’s not a requirement that inflation must be moving up at the time of liftoff.	23	2
201412	2828	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Instead, we just must expect that inflation will rise in the future back to our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201412	2829	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Liftoff is about lessening the degree of extreme monetary accommodation, and, of course, you want to begin this process well before employment and inflation reach your objectives.	23	2
201412	2830	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I believe many market participants are confused about this, and that explains some of the difference between what we think we’re going to do and what market participants expect for this.	23	2
201412	2831	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we have to work on that a little bit.	23	2
201412	2832	2014-12-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201412	2833	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201412	2834	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201412	2835	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think the main open issue in the statement is the bracketed word “somewhat” in paragraph 1, and I heard one, two, three, four, five, six—eight people propose removing it.	23	2
201412	2836	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m certainly comfortable removing it.	23	2
201412	2837	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anyone who supports the statement who would be uncomfortable seeing it removed?	23	2
201412	2838	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201412	2839	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s go ahead and remove “somewhat.”	23	2
201412	2840	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Then I think everything else stays as is, and why don’t we then vote on alternative B with “somewhat” removed?	23	2
201412	2841	2014-12-17	meeting	LUECKE	This vote, as Chair Yellen indicated, will be on alternative B, depicted on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout.	23	2
201412	2842	2014-12-17	meeting	LUECKE	It will not have the word “somewhat” on line 3.	23	2
201412	2843	2014-12-17	meeting	LUECKE	It will also cover the directive on page 11.	23	2
201412	2844	2014-12-17	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President Fisher   No President Kocherlakota  No President Mester   Yes President Plosser   No Governor Powell   Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes .	23	2
201412	2845	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201412	2846	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201412	2847	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	And let me confirm that the next meeting will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, January 27 and 28.	23	2
201412	2848	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I believe box lunches are now available for people, and, for anybody who is going to be around and would like to watch the press conference, there’s a TV in the Special Library.	23	2
201412	2849	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	I will do my best, and I will consider at the press conference what I’ve heard you say.	23	2
201412	2850	2014-12-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	1	1
201412	2851	2014-12-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
