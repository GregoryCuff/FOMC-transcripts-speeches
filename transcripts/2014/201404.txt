201404	0	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	5	5
201404	1	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Unfortunately, this is the last FOMC meeting for both President Pianalto and Governor Stein.	5	5
201404	2	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think you know that tonight we will have a joint farewell reception and dinner for our colleagues, as well as for former governor Sarah Bloom Raskin.	5	5
201404	3	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I would like to take this opportunity to thank them here as well.	5	5
201404	4	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Sandy began attending FOMC meetings in 1993 as a first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and then started attending as president of the Bank in the relative calm of 2003.	5	5
201404	5	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	5	5
201404	6	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	All in all, she has attended 101 FOMC meetings, which is more than any other currently serving president.	5	5
201404	7	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Sandy has always been a voice of reason, and her contributions have been much appreciated, particularly during some of the darkest days of the financial crisis.	5	5
201404	8	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Jeremy is one of our newest colleagues.	5	5
201404	9	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	He joined the Committee in June 2012 and has attended 16 meetings.	5	5
201404	10	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	During his time here, Jeremy has had to grapple with how to set policy in an economy that is still recovering from the crisis, and he has made very important intellectual contributions to the work of the Board and of the FOMC.	5	5
201404	11	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Both Sandy and Jeremy have been wonderful colleagues.	5	5
201404	12	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Sandy and Jeremy, thank you both for your service.	5	5
201404	13	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I want you to know you will be greatly missed, and we will have more words to say this evening.	5	5
201404	14	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Applause]	5	5
201404	15	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Bill, do you want to introduce your colleague?	5	5
201404	16	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	5	5
201404	17	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to introduce Antoine Martin, who is at the table, from the research department in New York.	5	5
201404	18	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Welcome, Antoine.	5	5
201404	19	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	5	5
201404	20	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And now let’s turn to our first topic, which is monetary policy normalization.	92	9
201404	21	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say that this discussion will take place as a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board.	92	9
201404	22	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And with respect to our Board meeting, I will need a motion to close the meeting.	92	9
201404	23	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So moved.	92	9
201404	24	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	25	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	92	9
201404	26	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to start off our session this morning with a few remarks on the objectives and timetable for our work on monetary policy normalization.	92	9
201404	27	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Before doing so, though, I want to give special thanks to the staff for all their hard work on these complicated issues and for the excellent set of memos that they prepared for this meeting.	92	9
201404	28	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me begin by saying I am completely convinced that we have the tools to adjust the stance of policy as needed to meet our macroeconomic objectives.	92	9
201404	29	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So this discussion is about how to deploy our mix of tools to attain these objectives most effectively in a way that balances other considerations appropriately.	92	9
201404	30	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	As the briefing materials make clear, however, there is quite a mix of subtle and intertwined issues to take into account, involving market functioning, the scope of our activities in the nonbank sector, communications, financial stability, and possible implications of our current choices for our longer-run operating procedure.	92	9
201404	31	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t want to get into the substance of these issues at this point.	92	9
201404	32	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to make a few overarching comments that may serve to frame our discussion.	92	9
201404	33	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	If the recovery proceeds broadly as we expect, we will likely begin to raise interest rates sometime next year.	92	9
201404	34	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I believe it is important that we communicate our normalization plans to the public well before that time.	92	9
201404	35	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would see the press conference after the September meeting as potentially providing a good opportunity to lay out for the public some of our thinking on these matters.	92	9
201404	36	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	If you agree with this timetable, we will need to make substantial progress in nailing down our approach over the course of this meeting and, then, the June and July meetings.	92	9
201404	37	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	There are difficult issues here, which we need to work through collectively, before we can be confident that we are ready to manage the normalization process and convey that confidence to the public.	92	9
201404	38	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So I think a concentrated effort will surely be required to make the necessary progress by September.	92	9
201404	39	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course—and fortunately—we are not starting from scratch.	92	9
201404	40	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Our deliberations will build on our earlier discussions of normalization and draw on the results from the ongoing testing of our tools.	92	9
201404	41	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	One lesson from our earlier efforts at spelling out our exit strategy, which is a topic we discussed at length in our meeting just a year ago, is that what may seem perfectly sensible ex ante may end up seeming much less attractive as conditions change in unforeseen ways.	92	9
201404	42	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we need to accept the reality that we cannot know exactly what kind of market conditions and considerations we will face when the time comes to begin raising rates.	92	9
201404	43	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And we cannot know with precision how well any particular strategy will work.	92	9
201404	44	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So, while I don’t want to prejudge any decisions on specific issues, I believe it is important that we create a framework in which we can deploy our mix of tools relatively flexibly to deal with contingencies that may arise.	92	9
201404	45	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But it is equally important that we agree on a framework that we can explain simply and clearly, so as to convincingly convey our confidence that we can adjust the stance of policy as appropriate to promote our macroeconomic objectives.	92	9
201404	46	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we should also provide clarity, to the extent possible, about the mechanics of our approach in order to ease the transition for market participants, particularly in those markets in which we may be acting in new ways.	92	9
201404	47	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And I think our success will depend in part on our communication strategy.	92	9
201404	48	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I want to end by encouraging everyone to be open to the range of possibilities before us and to keep in mind our overarching goals.	92	9
201404	49	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Despite the timetable I indicated, there is no need to reach firm conclusions at this meeting.	92	9
201404	50	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	My hope is that over the course of today’s discussion we can begin to locate, and then refine, our sense of common ground—that we can share frankly our individual perspectives and reservations, and, more pragmatically, perhaps, we can rule out at least some alternatives in order to narrow the field of our future decisionmaking.	92	9
201404	51	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We have asked you to weigh in on a number of different questions to provide some preliminary feel for where common ground may lie.	92	9
201404	52	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But at this stage, your answers to some of the questions may be that you just don’t know and are open to different possibilities, and that is a perfectly fine answer.	92	9
201404	53	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We have a lot of time for today’s discussion, so I hope you will use the Q&A period after the staff presentations to make comments and ask questions that will clarify for all of us some of the difficult issues involved in these choices and help us explore more fully how the available tools are likely to work in practice.	92	9
201404	54	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	As you all know, “two-handed” interventions are always welcome at FOMC meetings, but I would say especially so today.	92	9
201404	55	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to encourage active back-and-forth discussions with the staff and with one another as we explore the main issues.	92	9
201404	56	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, we do also want to have a go-round to hear at least your preliminary views and concerns.	92	9
201404	57	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So with that, what I’d like to do is turn the floor over to the staff for a set of presentations.	92	9
201404	58	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Jane Ihrig is going to give the first portion of those presentations.	92	9
201404	59	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	60	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	I will be referring to the handout titled “Material for Briefing on the Monetary Policy Normalization.”	92	9
201404	61	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In our briefing today, we will review some key points from the memos on normalization that you received over the intermeeting period.	92	9
201404	62	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The first exhibit summarizes information from the memo that outlined near-term approaches for conducting policy with a large balance sheet.	92	9
201404	63	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	As noted in the top-left panel, the Committee has a number of tools to use to raise rates.	92	9
201404	64	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Increasing interest on excess reserves will likely, by itself, raise short- term rates, but these rates could potentially not increase one-for-one and could vary relative to IOER rate over time.	92	9
201404	65	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The Committee has at its disposal several tools that could be used in various combinations to improve control over the level of short-term rates, including overnight repurchase agreements (which I’ll refer to as ON RRPs), term RRPs, and term deposits.	92	9
201404	66	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	As noted to the right, the memo considers five options for implementing normalization.	92	9
201404	67	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Of course, the Committee is not constrained to choose a single option; it could choose a mix of options or adapt its policy approach over time, observing the effects of its policies and making adjustments along the way.	92	9
201404	68	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The key features of the five options presented in the memo are summarized in the middle panel.	92	9
201404	69	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The first three options would combine IOER with a full-allotment ON RRP facility and would not use term draining tools.	92	9
201404	70	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The ON RRP facility would likely help to set a floor under overnight rates, as investors with access to the facility rate would not have an incentive to lend to any counterparty below this rate.	92	9
201404	71	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	I should note at the outset that the Committee might want to impose limits on the allotment of its ON RRP facility in order to support financial stability; such limits could be used in any of the options.	92	9
201404	72	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In option 1, the ON RRP rate is set equal to the IOER rate, and these rates would be the center of policy communication.	92	9
201404	73	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The next two options are similar to option 1, but with the ON RRP rate set below the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	74	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In option 2, the spread would be small, with the Committee targeting an administered rate or possibly an alternative overnight market rate, such as the ON GC repo rate.	92	9
201404	75	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In option 3, the spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate would be larger, and the ON RRP rate would be adjusted to move the federal funds rate to the desired target rate or range set by the Committee.	92	9
201404	76	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The spread between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate is larger in option 3 than in option 2 in order to maintain incentives for the federal funds trading that we currently see.	92	9
201404	77	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Option 4 also uses IOER but introduces term draining tools along with an ON RRP facility.	92	9
201404	78	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Here the ON RRP rate is set well below the IOER rate, to support trading in the funds market.	92	9
201404	79	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Term draining operations would be used as necessary to hit the target funds rate or range.	92	9
201404	80	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Option 5 is the approach envisioned by the Committee a few years ago, prior to the introduction of the ON RRP exercise.	92	9
201404	81	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Here IOER would be supplemented only with term draining tools to tighten the relationship between the IOER rate and market rates.	92	9
201404	82	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In options 4 and 5, the quantity of reserves needed to be drained would be uncertain and would depend on the level of the federal funds rate target chosen and the desired spread between the IOER rate and federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	83	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	It is possible that policymakers would judge the relationship between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate to be sufficiently stable after relatively little draining of reserves.	92	9
201404	84	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Alternatively, if a very large amount of reserves needed to be drained, the Federal Reserve might have to build a large book of term deposits and term RRPs.	92	9
201404	85	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The bottom panel lists six key policy issues that you may want to consider as you evaluate these alternative approaches.	92	9
201404	86	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	First, you may want to evaluate how the options differ in terms of their control of short-term interest rates.	92	9
201404	87	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	By increasing the IOER rate, all options can likely move market rates higher, but the degree of control is uncertain.	92	9
201404	88	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The ON RRP exercise suggests that such a facility is likely to help set a firmer floor on market rates.	92	9
201404	89	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Option 1, with the ON RRP rate set to the IOER rate, would likely result in the most control, because other short-term money market rates would probably trade at or slightly above these two administered rates.	92	9
201404	90	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The other options, in which the ON RRP rate is set below the IOER rate, may see market rates trade between the two administered rates.	92	9
201404	91	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Of course, use of the term tools, as under options 4 or 5, could help to improve control as well, though the extent of the required operations is uncertain.	92	9
201404	92	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Second, you may want to evaluate how efficient the options are in conducting monetary policy.	92	9
201404	93	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	It is difficult to determine each option’s full range of effects on financial markets and financial intermediation.	92	9
201404	94	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	That said, if you prefer to have interest rates on similar assets set at similar levels, then you may prefer a relatively narrow spread between the IOER rate and other overnight administered and market rates, as in options 1 or 2.	92	9
201404	95	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	You may also want to take account of the effects of the different options on the level of reserve balances and the efficiency of financial intermediation.	92	9
201404	96	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Third, you will need to decide whether you want to have an active federal funds market, so you can continue to target the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	97	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In options that include no spread or a fairly narrow spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates, such as options 1 and 2, trading in the federal funds market would likely decline to a level that may lead the federal funds effective rate to become less tightly connected to other money market rates.	92	9
201404	98	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Josh will talk about issues related to the functioning of the funds market and possible adjustments that the Committee could make.	92	9
201404	99	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Fourth, you will need to consider the potential financial-stability implications of these options and particularly of the introduction of a full-allotment ON RRP facility.	92	9
201404	100	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	As Antoine and Fabio will discuss in a few minutes, there are potential financial- stability benefits and costs to having such a facility, and there are steps that could be taken to mitigate some of the costs.	92	9
201404	101	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Fifth, you will probably want to assess the possible implications of extending the Fed’s footprint in the nonbank financial sector.	92	9
201404	102	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In particular, ON and term RRPs would increase the Federal Reserve’s direct interaction with nonbank counterparties, and possibly substantially so.	92	9
201404	103	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	There are benefits to interacting with nonbanks, such as increasing competition among money market participants for the Federal Reserve’s assets, which can enhance the Fed’s ability to influence the level of short-term rates.	92	9
201404	104	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	But there are costs that must also be weighed, including the “optics” of relying heavily on GSEs and money funds to conduct policy.	92	9
201404	105	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In practice, the extent of the Federal Reserve’s interaction with such counterparties would be influenced by the relative setting of the administered rates and any quantity limits associated with the operations.	92	9
201404	106	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Sixth, you should be aware of the potential consequences—both financial and political—associated with how these options would affect the Federal Reserve’s interest expense and, hence, its remittances to the Treasury.	92	9
201404	107	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Such effects would depend on take-up and the effect on market rates.	92	9
201404	108	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	It seems likely that term tools, with their relatively high rates, would be more costly than overnight tools, but of course it would depend on the volume of reserves drained.	92	9
201404	109	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	An option in which the ON RRP rate is set near the IOER rate would likely be the least costly option, because market rates would likely be closest to the IOER rate in that case.	92	9
201404	110	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Finally, I would note that one of the memos laid out options for additional testing of your tools.	92	9
201404	111	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The specific plan for near-term testing of term deposits includes eight consecutive, weekly, seven-day term deposit operations starting in mid-May.	92	9
201404	112	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The first four operations envisioned would incrementally raise the maximum individual award amount from the current $1.25 billion to $10 billion, with offering rates maintained at 1 basis point above the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	113	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	The subsequent four operations would gradually increase the rate paid on term deposits to a maximum of 5 basis points above the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	114	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	We would be interested in your views on this and other testing that you might find helpful as you consider these issues.	92	9
201404	115	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Josh will continue the presentation with the materials shown in your second exhibit.	92	9
201404	116	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Thank you, Jane.	92	9
201404	117	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	As outlined in the upper-left panel of exhibit 2, my portion of the briefing will start with a discussion of the current state of the federal funds market and briefly note how the effective federal funds rate is constructed each day and how it is used in financial markets.	92	9
201404	118	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Then I will turn to a discussion of some of the contractual issues that could arise if the publication of the federal funds rate unexpectedly changed or ceased and highlight some of the risks that this may introduce.	92	9
201404	119	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	I will then discuss several options for preventing or mitigating the impact of these risks, including the possible consideration of alternative policy rates.	92	9
201404	120	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	I will conclude with a brief review of possible alternative target rates.	92	9
201404	121	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	First, regarding the state of the federal funds market, prior to 2008, trading activity in the fed funds market was relatively robust, with about $200 billion in trades each day across the entire fed funds market, as seen in the upper-right panel.	92	9
201404	122	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Roughly 60 percent of this activity was believed to comprise interbank borrowing and lending, with most of the remainder made up of lending by GSEs to banks.	92	9
201404	123	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	In the past few years, average daily volume has shrunk to about $60 billion, 30 percent of its pre-crisis level, with a substantial majority of the remaining activity representing one type of lending:  Federal Home Loan Banks lending to foreign banking organizations.	92	9
201404	124	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Trading in the fed funds market is conducted in two ways: directly between holders of reserve balances or via a broker.	92	9
201404	125	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The effective federal funds rate is constructed by the Desk each morning based on data received from four of the largest brokers for all fed funds trades conducted through those brokers on the prior day.	92	9
201404	126	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The effective rate is then published by the Desk.	92	9
201404	127	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	In addition to its role in monetary policy, the effective federal funds rate appears in a number of financial products as a reference rate.	92	9
201404	128	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Although it is much less widely used than LIBOR, the effective federal funds rate is referenced in a broad set of financial contracts and agreements, most notably fed funds futures and overnight indexed swap, or OIS, contracts.	92	9
201404	129	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	This widespread use could lead to complications if the publication of the effective federal funds rate were to unexpectedly cease or if there were a substantial change in its definition.	92	9
201404	130	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	These complications could lead to contractual disputes—most notably, claims of contract frustration.	92	9
201404	131	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Under those conditions, the financial system could face a number of potential problems, including a reduction or elimination of liquidity and significant market uncertainty related to cash flows and valuations.	92	9
201404	132	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The scope of disruption is uncertain.	92	9
201404	133	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	For example, a change in the methodology or definition of the effective federal funds rate could create problems for existing contracts if the rate published by the Federal Reserve ceased to be viewed as consistent with the spirit of the effective fed funds rate.	92	9
201404	134	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The relevant contract law doctrines are complex and their application is fact specific and uncertain, and so it is difficult to state the precise conditions under which changes in methodology or definition could lead to claims of contract frustration.	92	9
201404	135	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	However, on the basis of the limited set of contracts reviewed, the staff believes that the burden on a party seeking judicial modification or termination of its contract on such grounds would be high.	92	9
201404	136	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Broadly speaking, there are three developments, outlined in the middle-left panel, that could reduce the already limited volume in the federal funds market, possibly increasing the likelihood of encountering the issues that I have mentioned.	92	9
201404	137	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	First, regulatory changes could make banks less willing to borrow in the federal funds market in order to earn the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	138	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	For example, changes in regulations associated with Basel III could lead internationally active banks to find federal funds arbitrage trades unprofitable and, therefore, reduce these transactions.	92	9
201404	139	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The second possibility is that the Federal Home Loan Banks could decide for a number of reasons to limit or even stop their lending in the federal funds market.	92	9
201404	140	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Because nearly 90 percent of the brokered fed funds market is made up of FHLBs lending to foreign banks, such a decision could greatly reduce the volume of trading.	92	9
201404	141	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Third, policies adopted during normalization could limit the federal funds activity that we currently see.	92	9
201404	142	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	For example, offering overnight reverse repos to a broad set of counterparties at rates near IOER, as is the case in some of the options that Jane highlighted, could further reduce fed funds trading volumes and lead the effective federal funds rate to become more volatile and less tightly connected to other money market rates.	92	9
201404	143	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	There are several possible policy responses to these concerns, outlined in the middle-right panel.	92	9
201404	144	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Policymakers could focus on near-term monetary policy frameworks that would not reduce the incentives for the federal funds trading that we currently see.	92	9
201404	145	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Generally speaking, these frameworks contemplate the use of an overnight reverse repo facility at a relatively wide spread in relation to IOER or no use of overnight reverse repo at all.	92	9
201404	146	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Alternatively, the Committee could change the target rate it uses to communicate policy.	92	9
201404	147	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	There are a number of possibilities in this regard, as outlined in the lower-left panel.	92	9
201404	148	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	First, the Federal Reserve could publish and use as a target a broader measure of overnight bank funding costs that would include both fed funds and Eurodollar transactions.	92	9
201404	149	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Such a rate would likely be more robust during normalization because Eurodollars trade in a larger market, as seen in the lower-right panel, with a broader range of participants.	92	9
201404	150	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Second, the Committee could choose to target a secured overnight rate, such as the rate on overnight Treasury general collateral repo.	92	9
201404	151	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	This market is substantially larger than either the federal funds or the Eurodollar market and has a broader range of participants.	92	9
201404	152	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The Treasury repo rate is somewhat more sensitive to flight-to- quality flows than other money market rates, so if this rate were to become the policy target and the target were not reduced in the face of a flight-to-quality shock, it is possible that other money market rates could face greater upward pressure.	92	9
201404	153	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	A third option would involve targeting a broad set of short-term interest rates.	92	9
201404	154	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	The target might be specified as a range or a weighted average, or it could be left undefined.	92	9
201404	155	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	An attractive feature of such a target is that it would encompass a broad range of markets and participants.	92	9
201404	156	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	It might therefore be an attractive alternative, as it would provide some flexibility around how tightly any one interest rate should move in response to a change in the target.	92	9
201404	157	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Finally, the Committee could consider adopting an administered rate as its policy rate.	92	9
201404	158	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	This could include, for example, the IOER rate or the rate on a standing overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201404	159	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	A key benefit of an administered rate would be that policymakers could control it with certainty, which could be helpful in cases in which it may be operationally complex or otherwise difficult to keep a selected market rate close to the desired target.	92	9
201404	160	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	If policymakers were willing to tolerate some deviation between the administered policy rate and market rates, using an administered rate as a target could provide more flexibility during normalization, while still providing clarity on the stance of policy.	92	9
201404	161	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Administered rates are used by other central banks, such as the Bank of England and the ECB.	92	9
201404	162	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	With that, I’d like to turn to Fabio for a discussion of some of the financial- stability implications of a fixed-rate, full-allotment overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201404	163	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Thank you, Josh.	92	9
201404	164	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	In our remarks, Antoine and I will focus on the potential financial-stability implications of a standing fixed-rate, full-allotment ON RRP facility.	92	9
201404	165	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	As indicated in the top-left panel of exhibit 3, there are potential financial-stability benefits and costs to having such a facility.	92	9
201404	166	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	The provision of a new, risk-free liquid asset, possibly in very large quantities, could support financial stability by crowding out private, seemingly safe “money-like” liabilities created by financial and nonfinancial firms.	92	9
201404	167	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	During crises, however, rapid take-up at the ON RRP facility could magnify flight-to-quality flows and contribute to a rapid decline in the availability of short-term funding for a range of private firms.	92	9
201404	168	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	As noted to the right, three recent episodes of widespread flights to quality—	92	9
201404	169	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	September 2008 and the debt-ceiling standoffs of July–August 2011 and October 2013—provide a useful illustration of the dynamics that may threaten financial stability and how an ON RRP facility might affect such flows.	92	9
201404	170	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	During these episodes, investors ran from short-term vehicles that embedded liquidity and credit risk, although the timing and severity of runs on individual instruments varied considerably.	92	9
201404	171	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, in the week of September 15–19, 2008, investors redeemed $310 billion, on net, from prime MMFs, while during the debt-ceiling standoffs in 2011 and 2013 run dynamics occurred, but on a more modest scale.	92	9
201404	172	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Safe-haven inflows were also quite large during these episodes, although destinations—which can include Treasury bills, government MMFs, and bank liquid deposits—varied.	92	9
201404	173	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, government-only MMF assets and liquid deposits together increased about $300 billion in one week in September 2008.	92	9
201404	174	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	During the debt-ceiling episodes of 2011 and 2013, investors shunned some government securities and banks attracted large inflows.	92	9
201404	175	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	As indicated in the bottom-left panel, the introduction of a standing ON RRP facility could amplify some of these flight-to-quality dynamics and alter the destinations of safe-haven flows.	92	9
201404	176	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Cash that would have moved quickly into liquid deposits—particularly at custodian banks—could go instead into the ON RRP facility—for example, through MMFs that invest in ON RRPs.	92	9
201404	177	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	The sources of flight- to-quality flows, such as prime MMFs, could experience larger outflows than in past episodes, and the availability of short-term funding for broker–dealer and nonfinancial firms through instruments like repo and CP could decline more quickly.	92	9
201404	178	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Moreover, it is possible that additional flight-to-quality flows might occur because of the creation of a perfectly elastically supplied risk-free asset.	92	9
201404	179	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Some potential mechanisms for such flows include greater portfolio reallocations by MMF counterparties to the ON RRP facility, larger investor shifts from prime MMFs to government MMFs that hold ON RRPs, and larger inflows to these government MMFs or directly to the ON RRP facility from other sources, including from investors abroad.	92	9
201404	180	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	As discussed in the staff memo, such flows could potentially be very large.	92	9
201404	181	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	The financial-stability implications of potentially altered flight-to-safety flows would depend in large part on the institutions and firms that lose short-term funding as investors shift to ON RRPs.	92	9
201404	182	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, on average in the first quarter, MMF counterparties provided over $500 billion in private financing that matures within a week, primarily to large banks and their subsidiaries (such as broker–dealers).	92	9
201404	183	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition, the redirection of cash that might have gone into liquid deposits in the past may have financial-stability implications, as the banks that received such cash would have had a broader range of options for reinvesting it than MMFs.	92	9
201404	184	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Antoine will now examine some facility design features that might mitigate run risks.	92	9
201404	185	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Thanks, Fabio.	92	9
201404	186	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In the spirit of the discussion about funding flows, I will consider in my remarks the consequences of having an ON RRP facility once a run is under way.	92	9
201404	187	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	First, it is worth noting that central bank intermediation of money markets in times of acute stress, when investors are particularly risk-averse, may be desirable.	92	9
201404	188	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But the question is whether the adjustments could be too large or occur too rapidly, and so be disruptive.	92	9
201404	189	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In the remainder of my presentation, I will discuss options to reduce the risk that an ON RRP facility could contribute to liquidity dislocations; specifically, lowering the interest rate offered at the facility and maintaining caps on the facility, or both.	92	9
201404	190	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	As noted in the bottom-right panel, lowering the rate at the ON RRP facility in times of crisis would make it a less attractive option, as long as market participants remain somewhat rate sensitive.	92	9
201404	191	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But it may not be reliable enough as a standalone tool.	92	9
201404	192	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Lowering the rate preemptively would be difficult and could send a negative signal to market participants and unintentionally trigger a run.	92	9
201404	193	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Waiting until after a surge of investment at the facility has been observed could mean that lowering the rate happens too late.	92	9
201404	194	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Instead, imposing permanent but adjustable caps on the facility usage, designed to rarely bind in normal times, could address the financial-stability risk effectively.	92	9
201404	195	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The caps could be set for each investor, as is the case today, or at some aggregate amount.	92	9
201404	196	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The cap could also be rigid, so that no investment is allowed above the cap, or flexible, with some investment allowed above the cap, but at a lower interest rate.	92	9
201404	197	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The appropriate design would presumably depend on an assessment of the possible risks.	92	9
201404	198	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Let me start by discussing individual versus aggregate caps.	92	9
201404	199	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	For individual caps, all counterparties could have the same fixed limit on the amount they can invest.	92	9
201404	200	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	For example, today all counterparties can invest up to $10 billion, but no more.	92	9
201404	201	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Or each counterparty could have its own individual limit—for example, based on historical usage of the program by the counterparty.	92	9
201404	202	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One could consider average take-up over a recent period multiplied by, say, 1.5.	92	9
201404	203	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	A counterparty that has invested $6 billion, on average, in the past would, thus, have a cap of $9 billion.	92	9
201404	204	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The main benefit of individual caps is that counterparties know exactly how much they can invest.	92	9
201404	205	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In contrast, an aggregate cap would specify the maximum amount of total investment.	92	9
201404	206	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	For example, it could specify that total take-up at the facility cannot exceed $200 billion.	92	9
201404	207	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In the rare instances in which the sum of the bids exceeds the cap, the bids would have to be rationed in some manner.	92	9
201404	208	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The main benefit of an aggregate cap is that it would likely be tighter than the sum of individual caps.	92	9
201404	209	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Let me turn now to rigid versus flexible caps.	92	9
201404	210	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	A rigid cap could not be breached, as is the case today.	92	9
201404	211	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	A counterparty cannot invest more than $10 billion at the facility.	92	9
201404	212	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	A flexible cap could allow some investment above the cap but at a lower rate—conceivably, at a negative rate.	92	9
201404	213	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	For example, a counterparty could be allowed to invest more than $10 billion, but each dollar above that amount would earn 15 basis points less than the current rate of 5 basis points, or negative 10 basis points.	92	9
201404	214	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	An aggregate flexible cap would work along the same lines.	92	9
201404	215	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In all cases, the cap could be adjusted over time.	92	9
201404	216	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	What is the best design for a cap?	92	9
201404	217	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	This could depend on what risk you are most concerned about.	92	9
201404	218	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	If your main concern is to have a tight cap, to limit the potential for very rapid increases in take-up, then a rigid aggregate cap may be appealing.	92	9
201404	219	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	If your main concern is allowing some flexibility for the provision of a safe asset in a crisis, then flexible individual caps may be appealing.	92	9
201404	220	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	It seems likely that a well-designed system of caps could significantly reduce the financial-stability risks posed by an ON RRP facility in a crisis.	92	9
201404	221	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The final page of your handout shows the discussion questions that was distributed with the cover memo for the normalization memos.	92	9
201404	222	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	You may want to address these questions in your comments during the go-round.	92	9
201404	223	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Thank you, that completes our prepared remarks.	92	9
201404	224	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	We’d be happy to take your questions.	92	9
201404	225	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	226	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you very much for a very comprehensive set of memos.	92	9
201404	227	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	It was really useful to get an idea of all of the various levers that we have.	92	9
201404	228	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And one of the nice things is that we have lots of levers.	92	9
201404	229	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	One of the disadvantages is that, when we have so many levers that we can pull, it’s a little hard to calibrate them.	92	9
201404	230	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first question I had was if you could give me a sense of the magnitudes that we might expect under normal circumstances.	92	9
201404	231	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we were to raise the IOER rate to 50 basis points, I would be curious what you thought we would have as a take-up of the reverse repo facility for option 1, option 2, and option 3.	92	9
201404	232	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know it’s a very rough estimate.	92	9
201404	233	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know there are a lot of things we still have to learn.	92	9
201404	234	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But I don’t really have a very good sense of magnitudes at this point, so getting a better sense of that would be useful.	92	9
201404	235	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The follow-up to that question is, given what you think we are going to be seeing on average, what is the likely volatility—not in a situation of great duress, but just the standard kind of things that we see around the end of the year and the end of the quarter.	92	9
201404	236	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	What kind of variation do you think we would see in the reverse repo facility as well?	92	9
201404	237	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Can you give me some idea of magnitudes?	92	9
201404	238	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know it’s a very rough estimate.	92	9
201404	239	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Sorry, just a clarifying point.	92	9
201404	240	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You said “raise the IOER rate to 50 basis points,” and then you asked about take-up at the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	241	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	What is the rate that you would anticipate on the overnight RRPs?	92	9
201404	242	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Option 1, option 2, and option 3 left that very vague.	92	9
201404	243	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So perhaps you can give me some sense of your thinking on option 2 and option 3.	92	9
201404	244	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I took option 3 as maybe a spread not that different from where we are, and option 2 as being maybe 10 basis points, or something like that.	92	9
201404	245	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if you have a different idea of what option 2 and option 3 implied, it would be really helpful just to give me an idea of the sensitivity or the elasticity of take-up from these various options.	92	9
201404	246	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One thing to say first is that the estimate is going to depend on what you think the frictions are that are keeping market rates lower than the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	247	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	For example, if you think that the reason interest rates are low is predominantly due to balance sheet costs, then lowering the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates means that you are going to see an increase in take-up.	92	9
201404	248	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And it is through the increase in take-up that markets really are getting closer to the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	249	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	If you think that the main frictions are bargaining frictions or limited competition frictions, then you should be able to see a reduction in the spread between market rates and the IOER rate without necessarily seeing any increase in take-up.	92	9
201404	250	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And different people have different views on what is happening.	92	9
201404	251	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Depending on which of these frictions is most important—and there might be other frictions that would have a different effect—you would have different answers.	92	9
201404	252	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	If we just increased the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate by the same amount today, I think that it’s not obvious that we would see a large increase in take-up compared with what we have seen.	92	9
201404	253	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One thing that could make a difference is that once the system becomes permanent, market participants could decide to change some of their relationships.	92	9
201404	254	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And we already saw that happening in January when the exercise was extended for one year; so this could increase to some extent.	92	9
201404	255	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And then once you reduce the spread—say, going from option 3 to option 2—and you get the overnight RRP rate to be closer to the IOER rate, I think we would expect some increase in take-up, but that really depends on what we think the frictions are.	92	9
201404	256	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Once we have made those two rates equal, so that there is no IOER arbitrage trade anymore, it is much more difficult to estimate what the take-up is going to be.	92	9
201404	257	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But it’s likely to be large.	92	9
201404	258	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just to follow up, if I may—	92	9
201404	259	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course.	92	9
201404	260	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	—can you give me a little bit better sense of what “large” means?	92	9
201404	261	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know it’s a very rough estimate—	92	9
201404	262	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Relative to $3 trillion?	92	9
201404	263	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	—but relative to the size of our balance sheet, it would be interesting to get an understanding of your best guess.	92	9
201404	264	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I know that there’s a big range around this.	92	9
201404	265	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	President Rosengren, if it was Treasuries only, I think the maximum would be $2.5 trillion, which would be very large.	92	9
201404	266	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And that—	92	9
201404	267	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	$2.5—	92	9
201404	268	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Trillion, because that’s what we would have to offer.	92	9
201404	269	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I mean, we would have to shave that just a little bit.	92	9
201404	270	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’d have to cap it there.	92	9
201404	271	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	272	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’d have to cap it there.	92	9
201404	273	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So you would hit the caps on a regular basis.	92	9
201404	274	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	No, that’s the largest feasible amount—if we could operate with Treasury securities-only, subject to some other considerations.	92	9
201404	275	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can understand that’s the maximum.	92	9
201404	276	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But under option 1, what is your best guess on average?	92	9
201404	277	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Well, we did $180 billion yesterday.	92	9
201404	278	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That was a rather large take-up outside of quarter-end.	92	9
201404	279	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	My guess is, then, some of the banks are modeling this.	92	9
201404	280	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You would be looking at somewhere from $750 billion to $1 trillion as the minimum amount of usage at the equal rate—this is at the start—depending on which is the most important, the balance sheet cost or the competitive aspect.	92	9
201404	281	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If it’s true that the foreign banking organizations just need a spread of 5 basis points, then you’d be at the lower end, I think, of that take-up.	92	9
201404	282	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If they need a spread of 10 to 15 basis points, then the balance sheet cost would hit, as Antoine was saying, and you’d see larger take-up.	92	9
201404	283	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So the answer is we don’t really know.	92	9
201404	284	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We know one thing—that the longer it’s been there, even though it’s in a testing phase, the more usage there is as people get more used to using it.	92	9
201404	285	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And it’s clear that usage has been quite high over the past week relative to the usual dynamics, we’d argue, which would be quarter-end.	92	9
201404	286	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I was personally surprised that it was $180 billion yesterday.	92	9
201404	287	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There are reasons why it was that high.	92	9
201404	288	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The thing that we don’t know is, if we move the rate up, how quickly we would see a large take-up.	92	9
201404	289	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Right now it’s not really taking flows out of the banks, and what the banks are trying to understand is what those flows would look like, as Antoine was saying.	92	9
201404	290	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Can I add something?	92	9
201404	291	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	You asked about options 1, 2, and 3.	92	9
201404	292	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	So in option 1, the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate are equal.	92	9
201404	293	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In options 2 and 3—especially 3, in which you could have the federal funds market—then you have to think hard about not only the IOER rate and the overnight RRP rate, but also the federal funds rate because, as Simon said, foreign banks are the ones that are arbitraging the fed funds market with the money funds who may be using the overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201404	294	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	So it actually does get somewhat complicated when we try to think of how much the take-up is going to be—because there are a lot of different rates, a lot of moving parts in there.	92	9
201404	295	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	In option 3, it’s not just those two administrative rates you asked about, but there would also be other market rates that are going to help determine the take-up.	92	9
201404	296	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard has a two-hander.	92	9
201404	297	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	298	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Just to follow up on this a little bit, give me the pros and cons of the case in which you would pick option 1.	92	9
201404	299	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	You’d set the repo rate equal to the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	300	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Take-up is unpredictable, as you just discussed, but you put a cap on at some fairly large size that the Committee is comfortable with.	92	9
201404	301	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Is there anything wrong with that case, or are there good and bad aspects of that case?	92	9
201404	302	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	To the extent that we think that banks are really facing balance sheet costs and that you put a cap in so that these balance sheet costs don’t get eliminated, then you have different costs that different financial institutions are facing, and you would imagine that banks are going to take some kind of evasive actions in order to reduce those costs or in order to be more competitive.	92	9
201404	303	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And so you’re likely not to have a level playing field, and I think we would be concerned about that.	92	9
201404	304	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So to the extent that you think that different kinds of institutions are facing different costs, I think we would like to not disadvantage banks in a way that would create potentially very large inequities.	92	9
201404	305	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	You’d be mitigating their situation, but by putting a cap on, you wouldn’t be fully mitigating it.	92	9
201404	306	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	It would be fully mitigated if you let the take-up be full.	92	9
201404	307	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That’s right, yes.	92	9
201404	308	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In addition there are some costs—for example, the FDIC assessment fee—that would remain present and the banks would have to pay, but that the extended set of counterparties would not necessarily have to.	92	9
201404	309	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But still the Committee could make a judgment that there’s a limit on how much of this we want to do, and some inefficiencies are going to be left in the market, and that’s the way it’s going to be.	92	9
201404	310	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That’s exactly right.	92	9
201404	311	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If I could follow up for a moment, I think there are two issues that the Committee would have to trade off in that case.	92	9
201404	312	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One is that if the rate on the overnight RRPs were the same as the IOER rate, for the reason of the FDIC premium costs and other costs the banks face, you might end up with a whole lot of overnight RRPs and not a lot of reserves.	92	9
201404	313	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If you put a cap on, then you’d have to ration who gets the overnight RRPs and who doesn’t because the rate would be at a level that would lead to extra demand for the overnight RRPs.	92	9
201404	314	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The other factor that you’d have to think about is that if you set a high cap—if you had a whole lot of overnight RRPs—you’d be doing a whole lot of transacting and a whole lot of your policy implementation through the nonbank part of the financial sector.	92	9
201404	315	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think some parts of the Committee might be unhappy with that—operating so much with money funds and with GSEs, and not operating in the traditional arena, which is the banking sector.	92	9
201404	316	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander?	92	9
201404	317	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Actually, it’s a direct follow-up to this, if I might.	92	9
201404	318	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	On this issue of discomfort with or aversion to doing too much quantity with the nonbank sector, with the money fund sector—I understand it, and I think it’s more than just an optical issue.	92	9
201404	319	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are financial- stability considerations as well.	92	9
201404	320	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We had a very, very interesting suggestion in one of our staff discussions, if you’ll recall.	92	9
201404	321	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	In principle, you could imagine restricting our counterparties not to money funds broadly, but to money funds that invest only with us or money funds that invest only in Treasury securities, in which case some of these inequity issues go away, and I think some of the financial-stability issues potentially go away.	92	9
201404	322	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I am interested in whether folks who know about this think that’s a feasible option and what its operational challenges would be.	92	9
201404	323	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It doesn’t have any operational challenges.	92	9
201404	324	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I have two reactions, and I think Simon may have others.	92	9
201404	325	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One is that a lot of our money market fund counterparties that we’ve signed up now are not government-only money funds.	92	9
201404	326	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You would have to exclude them.	92	9
201404	327	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The other is that simply because we are not transacting directly with the prime money funds doesn’t mean that they’re not going to be affected by what we do.	92	9
201404	328	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Sure.	92	9
201404	329	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Funds will move from the prime money funds to the government-only funds with which we’re transacting.	92	9
201404	330	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So, for example, to take the financial-stability issue of what would happen when there are runs, it’s not clear to me that you’d actually be better off in that case.	92	9
201404	331	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You’d still have people running from the prime money funds to the government-only money funds, and it just isn’t obviously an improvement in terms of the financial-stability implications.	92	9
201404	332	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Essentially, you have the channel I was discussing before.	92	9
201404	333	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	It might take care of one thing, which is the portfolio reallocation, because you would restrict the portfolio holdings of these money funds that we’d be facing, but it’s not obvious we’d be addressing the second piece, which is the outflows from the prime money funds to this facility, which appear likely to occur at a higher speed than the portfolio reallocation.	92	9
201404	334	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Oh, absolutely.	92	9
201404	335	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s not a substitute for the capping mechanism.	92	9
201404	336	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s an ex ante comfort issue.	92	9
201404	337	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But the clearest answer is that, operationally, it’s very easy to do.	92	9
201404	338	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Just take them off the list.	92	9
201404	339	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	I have one quick follow-up on President Bullard’s suggestion.	92	9
201404	340	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One of the things that we discussed in the memo that discussed caps is the idea of having a single-price auction as a way of implementing the cap.	92	9
201404	341	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So you can imagine the situation in which you’d set the IOER and overnight RRP rates equal.	92	9
201404	342	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	You’d set a cap, and you’d design the overnight RRP as a single-price auction, and then you would get a wedge between the IOER rate and the effective overnight RRP rate, but that would be a market-determined spread.	92	9
201404	343	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So that would be one way of running option 1.	92	9
201404	344	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, did you have a two-hander?	92	9
201404	345	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I just want a clarification here.	92	9
201404	346	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As I recall, we’re dealing with 94 or so money market funds.	92	9
201404	347	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	How many of those are government-only?	92	9
201404	348	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Thirty-two.	92	9
201404	349	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But the fungibility issues are germane.	92	9
201404	350	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We should bear in mind what happens in a panic.	92	9
201404	351	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	You’d have flows that end up running into the government-only fund, right?	92	9
201404	352	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s been the previous pattern because they’re trying to get access to—	92	9
201404	353	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I have a related question later, but I just wanted to clarify that.	92	9
201404	354	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201404	355	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92	9
201404	356	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’re still with President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	357	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	358	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	He’s still got the floor, but we’re encouraging follow-up.	92	9
201404	359	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	To President Bullard’s point, one of the advantages of option 1 is there’s just one rate that’s been chosen, and Antoine gave you a way that the market would determine this other rate.	92	9
201404	360	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That has some clarity attached to it, as compared with having more than one rate.	92	9
201404	361	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have just one last follow-up, and then I’ll cede the floor—a follow-up to Jeremy’s question.	92	9
201404	362	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	To the extent that a lot of the prime money market funds are invested in European bank debt instruments and Europe is presumably not raising rates at the time that we are—if we followed up on Jeremy’s suggestion, one possible outcome would be that prime money market funds would no longer be feasible, and we would move to a money market fund industry that’s primarily focused on government-only funds.	92	9
201404	363	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, from a financial-stability standpoint, that might be an optimal solution.	92	9
201404	364	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do you think that is a likely outcome if we followed up on Jeremy’s suggestion, assuming that Europe is not going to be in a position of raising rates at a time that we’re raising rates?	92	9
201404	365	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Remember, it’s dollar rates that we’re talking about.	92	9
201404	366	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So despite the fact that they’re European, they’re still borrowing to fund their dollar assets.	92	9
201404	367	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s the dollar rate that really applies.	92	9
201404	368	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But as our rates get expensive relative to theirs, they may not decide to have as big a dollar exposure as they had before, right?	92	9
201404	369	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, they have to finance their dollar book of assets.	92	9
201404	370	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what’s motivating their borrowing here in dollars.	92	9
201404	371	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t really matter what the European rates are.	92	9
201404	372	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	President Rosengren may have in mind that the European banks would reduce their dollar asset holdings and therefore their need for dollar funding.	92	9
201404	373	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So my question is, is that a likely outcome or not—do you think the prime money market funds would continue to exist the way they are?	92	9
201404	374	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Nobody knows; it’s just not clear.	92	9
201404	375	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think it certainly cuts both ways, in the sense that they might reach for yield even more in that world, in which they don’t have access to the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	376	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So you’d want some way of controlling that.	92	9
201404	377	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	European banks might also be doing more business in the States, as our economy picks up, and so that is an offsetting factor, too.	92	9
201404	378	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	So their demand for dollar funding might not fall.	92	9
201404	379	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201404	380	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	381	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201404	382	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	383	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I will confess that I’m one of the dimmer bulbs at this table, so I have a very basic question.	92	9
201404	384	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Right now we have excess reserves, and to me, what that means is, if you look at what the demands for reserves are to meet reserve requirements, if you look at what is required for liquidity requirements—which is changing—or for clearing needs, we agree that right now we have excess.	92	9
201404	385	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Is that correct?	92	9
201404	386	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	$2.3, $2.4 trillion.	92	9
201404	387	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So when we say “normalization,”	92	9
201404	388	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I want to make sure we’re all talking about what normalization is.	92	9
201404	389	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Normalization, to me, is not just stopping large-scale asset purchases and controlling short-term rates.	92	9
201404	390	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	To me, normalization is that banks find their end-of- day positions closer to their demands for reserve requirements, liquidity requirements, or clearing needs.	92	9
201404	391	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Is that what we are talking about?	92	9
201404	392	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I just want to make sure we have a common understanding.	92	9
201404	393	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Ultimately, and we don’t know what those numbers are, but my question was going to be: What is that?	92	9
201404	394	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s not $2½ trillion, or $2-point-something trillion.	92	9
201404	395	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we would make a distinction between two things.	92	9
201404	396	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One is normalizing rates—that is, beginning to raise interest rates.	92	9
201404	397	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re going to raise interest rates when reserve balances are still large.	92	9
201404	398	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I understand that.	92	9
201404	399	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But the ultimate goal should be what I just mentioned, I would think.	92	9
201404	400	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	In the long run, it will mean normalization, if you like, of our balance sheet.	92	9
201404	401	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That takes longer; in the Tealbook projections, it takes five years or something like that.	92	9
201404	402	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And, exactly what that normalized balance sheet is, I think, is subject to discussion by this Committee.	92	9
201404	403	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Do you want to go back to a long-run regime with a very low level of excess reserves, implementing policy the way it used to be done?	92	9
201404	404	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You could also go to a long-run policy implementation regime that’s a floor regime with a much higher level of reserves and a bigger balance sheet.	92	9
201404	405	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It has been suggested that we might want to go to a long-run regime in which we’d be supplying a lot of short-run safe assets, and so we’d be running with a bigger balance sheet if we did that.	92	9
201404	406	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So I think the long-run balance sheet normalization raises a number of additional questions that the Committee would need to consider.	92	9
201404	407	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	This is my point.	92	9
201404	408	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	By the way, with my personal priors, it’s going to take more than five years.	92	9
201404	409	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Let’s set that aside.	92	9
201404	410	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Simon, I think that’s yours, too.	92	9
201404	411	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s a little bit longer-term than five years.	92	9
201404	412	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s a long term.	92	9
201404	413	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Yes.	92	9
201404	414	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But I think that’s where you start and you back your way down.	92	9
201404	415	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I’ll make this point in the go-round, but just to make sure you understand, I realize it is going to take a very long time.	92	9
201404	416	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	This is an issue we created; and now we’re trying to solve it and do so in a thoughtful manner.	92	9
201404	417	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Unless you know what the endpoint is, I don’t think you can decide what the intermediate points are.	92	9
201404	418	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Otherwise we’re going to get into trouble along the way.	92	9
201404	419	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So to me that’s an important definition, Madam Chair, and Bill just framed the questions very well.	92	9
201404	420	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s what we need to determine first, in my opinion, and, as you mentioned earlier, we have a long time between now and September, but it’s actually a very short period of time given the complexity of this issue.	92	9
201404	421	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And I might add—and forgive me for saying this—but due to the complexity of the tools that we have, which the economic literature did not prepare us for, we have to achieve a level of understanding that I don’t think we have yet.	92	9
201404	422	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I appreciate the presentation.	92	9
201404	423	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Exhibit 2 was particularly helpful just in terms of dimension—or “dementia,” whichever you wish to use.	92	9
201404	424	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	425	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But we’d better figure out what our long-term definition of normalization is, and then we back in from there.	92	9
201404	426	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s the point I wish to make.	92	9
201404	427	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	If it’s one of those several options, then that gives us a sense of direction.	92	9
201404	428	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I want to push back a little against that, because I think no matter where the Committee wants to be in the long run, no matter what the policy implementation looks like in 2030, you’re going to be raising rates—I hope, if everything goes as we think—next year with a level of reserves that’s going to be around $3 trillion, and we have to think about how we can successfully, efficiently, and effectively do that.	92	9
201404	429	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And I think you could do that in a variety of ways, and it wouldn’t necessarily have implications for where you want to be in 2030.	92	9
201404	430	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There are some links there, and we provided a memo that talks some about that, but I think there’s a fair amount of flexibility between what you choose to do in 2015 and where you want to be in 2030.	92	9
201404	431	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Bill, we have a lot of liquidity that we have to deal with.	92	9
201404	432	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t dispute that.	92	9
201404	433	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But I’m just saying we need to at least keep that in the back of our mind.	92	9
201404	434	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We are not at odds here.	92	9
201404	435	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re just trying to figure out and, again, bear in mind the endpoint, define it.	92	9
201404	436	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And we’re still going to have to deal with the fact that, one hopes, things go well, the economy strengthens, and we are going to have to raise rates.	92	9
201404	437	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But the toolkit that we use for that has to be kept in line with longer-term principles.	92	9
201404	438	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my point.	92	9
201404	439	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So it’s not a difference of opinion— it’s just really trying to get a definition on the table.	92	9
201404	440	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren?	92	9
201404	441	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have a two-hander on that.	92	9
201404	442	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I just think we should be agnostic about what the endpoint is, because if we decide to go with a reverse repo facility, until we have some idea of magnitudes and volume and how much it is going to vary, I have no idea whether the reverse repo facility would be a feasible solution in the long run or not.	92	9
201404	443	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if it is, then that is going to imply a much larger balance sheet than we would have if we go with a federal funds rate, and I don’t think we have to decide that until we know how successful the reverse repo facility will be.	92	9
201404	444	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I actually think the opposite.	92	9
201404	445	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t think we know the endpoint until we know how some of these other tools work.	92	9
201404	446	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I would be more interested in taking the approach that in one or two years we learn which of these options are really feasible, and then we have the discussion about what we think is the right solution in 2030.	92	9
201404	447	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But I don’t think we should prejudge it in September—I think that prejudging it would be dangerous until we have a better understanding of how the tools work.	92	9
201404	448	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Well, clearly, we need to get a better understanding of how all the tools work.	92	9
201404	449	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And we are testing.	92	9
201404	450	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, there is no dispute here.	92	9
201404	451	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201404	452	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I would like to land slightly between the two of you [laughter], in the sense that I think it is relevant to have a path back to the long-term framework.	92	9
201404	453	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we pick a certain path that then rules out a path back to a given framework, that’s relevant.	92	9
201404	454	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So you have to be comfortable that whatever path we pick in the near term doesn’t rule out a path that you might prefer in the long term.	92	9
201404	455	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And as long as you’re comfortable that you’re not ruling out a path for the longer term, then I think you can really try to optimize over the short term.	92	9
201404	456	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s how I would look at it.	92	9
201404	457	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think our view was that it’s pretty difficult right now to rule out any path with the options that are there, because the way the tools will work will change as the balance sheet starts to fall anyway, and we will learn quite a lot.	92	9
201404	458	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There is nothing in any of the five options that prevents you from either going back to the old system or going to a new system.	92	9
201404	459	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is a path back to any longer-term framework.	92	9
201404	460	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So that would suggest that you should optimize over the short to medium term, recognizing that you do have a path back.	92	9
201404	461	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	462	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There are costs, obviously, of switching frameworks frequently, and we should bear those in mind.	92	9
201404	463	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Bill.	92	9
201404	464	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans, two-hander.	92	9
201404	465	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201404	466	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m sympathetic to the flexibility that has been described right here.	92	9
201404	467	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	One thing that I think I heard somewhere in the presentation or in the questions and answers was that the take-up by money funds is going to depend in part on the perceived permanence of this facility.	92	9
201404	468	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So in the testing of this, at some juncture we are going to have to either make a representation that we haven’t figured that out or we are going to have to commit to permanence—aren’t we?	92	9
201404	469	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We have it through January 2015 based on the resolution that you passed last time.	92	9
201404	470	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m sorry—I interpreted the permanence as a money market fund’s willingness to actively, with both feet, go in and recruit customers for this, thinking “I want to make sure I’ve got 10 years of this.”	92	9
201404	471	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	People will be looking at the choices that are made over the next few months to think about how permanent the overnight RRP is.	92	9
201404	472	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If some of those choices are announced at the September meeting, and if the choice is to keep the overnight RRP facility, we will learn more about what some of those flows would look like in the current situation.	92	9
201404	473	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If they feel it is going to be part of the permanent framework, that will allow them to think about the counterparty relationships they have right now and some of the other relationships they might want to get to use that facility.	92	9
201404	474	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201404	475	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no further two-handers, President Bullard.	92	9
201404	476	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	477	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I want to return to the financial-stability issue.	92	9
201404	478	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	We had a panel in exhibit 3, on the lower left, on possible amplification effects.	92	9
201404	479	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And then for potential mitigants, on the lower right, the first one is to lower the overnight repo rate.	92	9
201404	480	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And it says, “probably not a reliable stand-alone tool.”	92	9
201404	481	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m going to ask Mr Martin, why is that not a reliable tool?	92	9
201404	482	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	It sounded to me like the description that you gave was that maybe the policy decision wouldn’t be the right one in that circumstance.	92	9
201404	483	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	To me, that’s maybe not a good description, because you are talking to the policy committee.	92	9
201404	484	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	485	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	What I meant to say was that even the most enlightened policymakers might have a hard time getting the timing exactly right.	92	9
201404	486	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One thing you could consider doing is to say, “Well, we’re going to monitor the situation.	92	9
201404	487	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And when we think that there is going to be a run, we’ll lower the rate.”	92	9
201404	488	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	I think that’s difficult to do, and there is this worry that if you do indeed lower the rate, people might say, “Oh, my God.	92	9
201404	489	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	These guys know something that we should know, too.”	92	9
201404	490	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And you create a run.	92	9
201404	491	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201404	492	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But that’s a problem in any kind of crisis situation.	92	9
201404	493	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But one of the nice things about a cap, if I might say so, is that you have the ability to stop the initial onboarding, the initial surge.	92	9
201404	494	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And then you can manage that cap and manage that rate.	92	9
201404	495	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So you can lower the rate after the cap has been reached, or you can decide that you keep the rate fixed but you maintain the cap at its existing value, or you increase it.	92	9
201404	496	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	You have a lot more flexibility.	92	9
201404	497	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But what you’re worried about—and this is what I meant by saying that it might not be a sufficiently robust standalone tool—is that if you need to always have the interest rate at a facility exactly right, you might just be off by a day or two, and that could be damaging.	92	9
201404	498	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Also, it might be very difficult to find a rate that prevents people wanting to put their money with the Fed.	92	9
201404	499	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s safe; the Fed can return the money to them.	92	9
201404	500	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In some severe states of the world, their private counterparty might not be able to return the money to them.	92	9
201404	501	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And people become very rate insensitive.	92	9
201404	502	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	—which we saw in September 2008.	92	9
201404	503	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One point that was in the memo and that, in my view, is important is that you want these mitigants—whatever they are, caps, rates that move because of auction approaches or whatever—to always be in place.	92	9
201404	504	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You don’t want there to be a switch that somebody has to turn because that is then very bad news, potentially, for market participants.	92	9
201404	505	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So you want it to be part of the furniture.	92	9
201404	506	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Maybe these things hit at the end of every quarter, when we know that usage of this thing is going to go up.	92	9
201404	507	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So it just becomes something that we are used to and isn’t that big a deal.	92	9
201404	508	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201404	509	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But, still, what I would think of is a policy rule that reacted partly to a financial crisis–type variable, and, in principle, that policy rule would be exactly the right one, and then that would all be possible.	92	9
201404	510	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And then, in that case, lowering the rate would be a sufficient mitigant, and you would offset any probability of crisis.	92	9
201404	511	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	You are just saying there is some noise around that, and in a crisis situation that might be a problem.	92	9
201404	512	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Yes.	92	9
201404	513	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That’s right.	92	9
201404	514	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In normal times, we should expect that adjusting the rate of the overnight RRP facility would be a very effective tool.	92	9
201404	515	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Specifically, in times of crises and when people become interest-rate insensitive, it might not be enough just to change the rate, and you might want to have something else, like a belt and suspenders.	92	9
201404	516	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But, in general, if you lower the rate enough—if you can turn it negative—it is going to reduce flows.	92	9
201404	517	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201404	518	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	92	9
201404	519	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And we can turn it negative if you want to.	92	9
201404	520	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	92	9
201404	521	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think, Bill, what you were just describing sounds like an auction in which you are basically, on every single day, auctioning off something like 120 percent of what you expect the demand to be, and you have a reserve price.	92	9
201404	522	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So on a normal day, you are just hitting the reserve price.	92	9
201404	523	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That is the rate that we set.	92	9
201404	524	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And if the demand at the auction turns out to be bigger, then the market sets the price.	92	9
201404	525	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So you just seamlessly move back and forth between us setting the price with the market setting the quantity, and us capping the quantity with the market setting the price.	92	9
201404	526	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And, as you said, if you did this on a regular basis, you wouldn’t have to change tools.	92	9
201404	527	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think something along those lines is probably right.	92	9
201404	528	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It seems quite seamless.	92	9
201404	529	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You may want also to have some sort of overall cap.	92	9
201404	530	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You said, I think, 120 percent of some moving average or something.	92	9
201404	531	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You may also want to say “and no more than” something.	92	9
201404	532	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the mechanism design is a question, but something like that seems right.	92	9
201404	533	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201404	534	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I thought about these mitigants for financial crises I tried to put myself in the position of being in this room or on a videoconference call in the middle of one of these crises.	92	9
201404	535	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I wonder to what extent things like caps and a commitment to lower the rate in the time of crisis would be credible when you’re reading stories in the newspaper about money market mutual funds with people’s savings, et cetera, looking for safety, looking for a place to put their money, while the Federal Reserve has the ability to offer that and it is choosing not to—and in fact it is penalizing people for seeking safety.	92	9
201404	536	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would put us in a very challenging situation at that point in time.	92	9
201404	537	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	92	9
201404	538	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201404	539	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to follow up on President Kocherlakota’s comments.	92	9
201404	540	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There is a rich irony to this discussion.	92	9
201404	541	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	As some of you have heard me point out before, we were founded to provide a monetary instrument for people to use when the supply of that instrument was inelastic—when they wanted to get their deposits out and have hand-to-hand currency to carry around.	92	9
201404	542	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It was well known at the time that there were structural, legal impediments to the elastic supply of currency under the National Bank Act.	92	9
201404	543	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We were founded to provide that elastic supply of currency to people panicking who were taking their money out of banks.	92	9
201404	544	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So I agree with President Kocherlakota that it’s just odd and a bit dissonant to be thinking about limiting that flow.	92	9
201404	545	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thinking about the parallel with our founding caused to spring to my mind a question about why you would restrict a flight to safety.	92	9
201404	546	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The broad philosophy here seems to be that we can help financial stability by taking off the table or limiting the size of one of the array of options that fleers have to flee to.	92	9
201404	547	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They have other options to flee to.	92	9
201404	548	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And I’m wondering what information you have about those other options, and their inferiority to us, that leads you to want them to come in at a certain point.	92	9
201404	549	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m just confused about the analytical framework for these limits being a good response.	92	9
201404	550	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think Antoine set it up quite nicely in the way he described what you were trying to do.	92	9
201404	551	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You weren’t trying to limit the supply of the safe asset over the longer run.	92	9
201404	552	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You were trying to limit, over one to five days, say, a very disruptive effect from people rushing to safe assets.	92	9
201404	553	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s the financial-stability cost that we see if the overnight RRP facility really is a perfectly elastic supply of that safe asset.	92	9
201404	554	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And that’s the way you tried to pose the issue, I think.	92	9
201404	555	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Are there going to be no other assets they could disruptively flee to at the time?	92	9
201404	556	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They could flee to Treasury bills, which are in fixed supply.	92	9
201404	557	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the thought experiments we did was to ask, would we ask the Treasury not to supply more Treasury bills at this time?	92	9
201404	558	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And it’s sort of surprising for them to declare a new Treasury auction.	92	9
201404	559	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This is a standing facility, in theory that they have used, which is available, and one day a big shock might come, and you get a very disruptive funding change from the facility being there, which is based on the genuine desire that we should be providing a safe asset over the longer run.	92	9
201404	560	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Can I tell you how I’m thinking about this?	92	9
201404	561	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I kind of feel your pain.	92	9
201404	562	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	In the traditional world, we would, in effect, lend against risky assets that banks have—provide them with currency, say, that they would then satisfy depositors with.	92	9
201404	563	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We could do something similar in today’s financial sector—it’s a much more complicated financial sector—by basically intermediating money markets across our balance sheet.	92	9
201404	564	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	People want safe assets; we give them safe assets with the overnight RRPs.	92	9
201404	565	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But this disintermediates a bunch of borrowers, and we could use tools—the TSLF, PDCF, CPFF, whatever—to provide the funding.	92	9
201404	566	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Again, we would be taking, in some sense, risky collateral and providing a safe asset.	92	9
201404	567	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s the equivalent of the traditional procedure of providing currency to banks during a crisis.	92	9
201404	568	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The problem is actually getting the funds out to the appropriate parties quickly and efficiently.	92	9
201404	569	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And actually doing that, because the Congress has said through the Dodd-Frank Act that it is not that happy with us doing that anyway, seems like something that the Committee may not want to do.	92	9
201404	570	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So you may not want to set up a structure for implementing monetary policy that would require you to intermediate a bunch of money markets across our balance sheet in a way that requires these tools you may not be comfortable with.	92	9
201404	571	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	You’re combining two things.	92	9
201404	572	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	You’re combining credit and money policy.	92	9
201404	573	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We could do this across Treasuries, right—holding Treasuries?	92	9
201404	574	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So if there had been a huge supply of Treasuries outstanding in 1914, we could have increased the supply of money elastically without holding private assets.	92	9
201404	575	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And the assets we took from banks were the safest things they had.	92	9
201404	576	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They weren’t the riskiest things.	92	9
201404	577	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They were the safest things.	92	9
201404	578	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They were risky, but they were the safest things banks had.	92	9
201404	579	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But traditionally the central bank provides liquidity against illiquid assets.	92	9
201404	580	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s the point.	92	9
201404	581	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Well, one can read “tradition” many different ways.	92	9
201404	582	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But at the core we supply liabilities, and when we choose to pick up a private asset when we could have bought a Treasury, we’re doing fiscal policy.	92	9
201404	583	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We’re issuing a Treasury to the market and using the proceeds for a private credit instrument.	92	9
201404	584	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But I separate those two, and I don’t think we have to do them both.	92	9
201404	585	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So you might think that it would be possible in a crisis for us to provide safe assets through the overnight RRP facility and then do RPs to get the reserve balances back out.	92	9
201404	586	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So at the end of the day, Simon goes in and he does a lot of RPs to get the reserves back out again.	92	9
201404	587	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That might work, but I think you’d end up with a lot of would-be borrowers who were unable to get funding because folks came to our overnight RRP facility who didn’t have OMO- eligible collateral.	92	9
201404	588	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Then you’ve got a choice.	92	9
201404	589	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	You can lend against the non-OMO-eligible collateral or not.	92	9
201404	590	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	You’re well aware this is a broad philosophical discussion.	92	9
201404	591	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Lending decisions are difficult in normal times.	92	9
201404	592	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They’re even more difficult in times of stress.	92	9
201404	593	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Absolutely.	92	9
201404	594	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s why we’re trying to avoid that, right?	92	9
201404	595	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s exactly why we’re saying caps or something like that may be necessary, to avoid having to make lending decisions as part of your monetary policy implementation.	92	9
201404	596	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But we didn’t have private-sector instruments in the discussion until you brought them in here.	92	9
201404	597	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We were talking about Treasury securities and a flight to this overnight instrument collateralized by Treasuries.	92	9
201404	598	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But as the memo said and as Fabio said, it’s flight from something.	92	9
201404	599	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There was a time money market funds were funding banks, were funding broker-dealers, were funding, say, Caterpillar Tractor, and now they’re not.	92	9
201404	600	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Now they’re coming to our overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	601	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And so there are those out there who need funding.	92	9
201404	602	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s a classic thing.	92	9
201404	603	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I mean, you’re interposing your judgment about who deserves funding on day 1, day 2, day 3.	92	9
201404	604	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	There are three channels in some sense, right?	92	9
201404	605	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	One is just portfolio reallocation—given the size and shape of the industry, how they would reallocate the existing portfolio.	92	9
201404	606	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	This is an issue of flows out of, say, prime money funds, so the money comes into these government-only funds that face the ON RRP facility.	92	9
201404	607	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	There’s the issue of where they have taken money away from, and this could be when they are funding, they are doing other assets.	92	9
201404	608	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Some of them could be nontraditional collateral, for example, so it would need to require other funding.	92	9
201404	609	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	Another issue has come up with a bunch of market participants, which is that, should a facility become permanent, some asset managers could essentially set up funds that focus entirely, 100 percent, on overnight RRPs.	92	9
201404	610	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	That could be a new tool that would be in their suite of liquidity management for clients.	92	9
201404	611	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	That’s a new channel in which money would move.	92	9
201404	612	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	And I agree that it’s unclear, but the dynamic is different.	92	9
201404	613	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	In some sense, in the dynamic you were describing, in which people go to Treasury securities, the Treasury yield responds, as Antoine was saying.	92	9
201404	614	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	So you get the price action that make the flows into safe assets more costly without any sort of mitigants, either caps or moving the overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201404	615	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	In this case, there is this infinitely elastic supply with a fixed rate that becomes higher than market rates.	92	9
201404	616	2014-04-30	meeting	NATALUCCI	So that will attract even more flows just by differential spreads.	92	9
201404	617	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But I think President Lacker’s point is that we can let the private sector solve that problem, and—is this correct, President Lacker?—our role, if we think it’s welfare- enhancing, is to provide a safe asset.	92	9
201404	618	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The private sector knows it’s there.	92	9
201404	619	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s their problem to solve.	92	9
201404	620	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Is that fair?	92	9
201404	621	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I’m questioning the premise that that wouldn’t work effectively.	92	9
201404	622	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	623	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And I also have questions about the premise that, to the extent that we see that as problematic, depriving people of an option is relevant, because there are so many other ways they can flee from a given fund or a given credit instrument.	92	9
201404	624	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Correct.	92	9
201404	625	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I just don’t see us as being critical to their ability to flee.	92	9
201404	626	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The private-sector participants, when we spoke to them, did think that a perfectly elastic supply in this form did raise this risk more.	92	9
201404	627	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s one of the reasons we focused on it.	92	9
201404	628	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Two-handers.	92	9
201404	629	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201404	630	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Let me give you my take on this, which I hope will clarify things a little bit, at least for me.	92	9
201404	631	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with President Lacker that, if people want safe assets and we provide them with those safe assets, that’s probably utility enhancing as opposed to utility reducing.	92	9
201404	632	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But if we supply them safe assets at a fixed price, what’s going to happen in this new regime is that the prices of risky assets are going to go down, interest rates in the economy are going to go up, and financial conditions are going to tighten as a consequence of this flow.	92	9
201404	633	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The difference between the old regime and this new regime would be that in the old regime yields on risk-free assets fall and those on risky assets go up, but they both move.	92	9
201404	634	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In this new regime, the yield on risk-free assets doesn’t go down, and so the yield on risky assets goes up by more.	92	9
201404	635	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So you get a tightening of financial conditions.	92	9
201404	636	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the financial-stability negative that we have to think about.	92	9
201404	637	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, you could respond to it by living with it.	92	9
201404	638	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You could respond to it by adding reserves through doing repurchase agreements.	92	9
201404	639	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You could respond to it by lowering your interest rate structure.	92	9
201404	640	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think that the initial reaction, relative to the current regime, would be a tightening of financial conditions, and that’s really the consequence on the other side.	92	9
201404	641	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But, Bill, we always cut rates when something like that happens.	92	9
201404	642	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, that would be an option.	92	9
201404	643	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And besides, Treasury rates are going to be strong anyway.	92	9
201404	644	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Open market rates on Treasury securities are going to be strong.	92	9
201404	645	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I actually agree.	92	9
201404	646	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the financial-stability issues are really quite complicated because there’s a good, in the sense that you’re offering an asset that they want to hold, which is utility enhancing, but there’s a bad—there’s a temporary tightening of financial conditions that you would be concerned about.	92	9
201404	647	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And the question is, what’s the best way to address that?	92	9
201404	648	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And particularly over one or two days, you don’t want to magnify some of these flows that people don’t understand.	92	9
201404	649	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s what we’re trying to avoid with the capping.	92	9
201404	650	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201404	651	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	For two-handers, President Kocherlakota, then President Fisher, then Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201404	652	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to restate the point I was making earlier in the hope of being clearer.	92	9
201404	653	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I understand the financial-stability concern that Vice Chairman Dudley outlined.	92	9
201404	654	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s good to put mitigants in place that are perceived, at least ex ante, as defraying that risk.	92	9
201404	655	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think it’s useful to war game it.	92	9
201404	656	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Think it through, and if we’re actually in this situation, will we live with these caps?	92	9
201404	657	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Will we live with having to lower the rates on these facilities to possibly minus 5 or 10 percent in order to deter investors from seeking that safety?	92	9
201404	658	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it will be very tempting for us to try to rescue the money market mutual funds in that situation by providing that safety and then to save the institutions that are being disintermediated through other facilities that we used to great effect in 2008.	92	9
201404	659	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we just have to war-game it in our minds and realize that these mitigants might—in this room right now, in the calm that we’re sitting in right now—sound very attractive, but I doubt their credibility and effectiveness in the time of crisis.	92	9
201404	660	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, two-hander.	92	9
201404	661	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I want to address Jeff’s point.	92	9
201404	662	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Whatever we do, obviously we don’t want to heighten financial-stability concerns.	92	9
201404	663	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Forgive me, Jeff, but you’re a fundamentalist.	92	9
201404	664	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You can take that as a compliment.	92	9
201404	665	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	666	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	When the System was created, we were the credit system.	92	9
201404	667	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Banks were the credit system.	92	9
201404	668	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Today, banks and depository institutions are 25 percent of the credit system.	92	9
201404	669	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, Madam Chair, forgive me, but this gets to the whole root of our franchise, how we proceed along this path.	92	9
201404	670	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	If we operate through traditional tools, working with just depository institutions, we represent one-fourth of the credit system.	92	9
201404	671	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	In 1914, it wasn’t like that.	92	9
201404	672	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So part of this discussion is about the adaptation of our franchise and I think we have to continue to bear that in mind.	92	9
201404	673	2014-04-30	meeting	SEVERAL	That’s true.	92	9
201404	674	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	92	9
201404	675	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Richard, I think you meant “originalist.”	92	9
201404	676	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	677	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I come from a Baptist part of the country.	92	9
201404	678	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m not an originalist.	92	9
201404	679	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You are one of a kind.	92	9
201404	680	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I try to be original.	92	9
201404	681	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	You’re faithful to our franchise.	92	9
201404	682	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201404	683	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	684	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’m asking a question, but maybe I’m making a comment as to how much of the past 15 minutes of what I found to be a very interesting discussion is actually critical to resolve before making the decisions on what we’re doing between now and September.	92	9
201404	685	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think there is going to be a theme that is going to continue in this and subsequent discussions, which is that, as President Fisher suggests, it is hard not to have an eye to what we think we may prefer as the indefinite monetary policy regime.	92	9
201404	686	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think it unlikely that this group is going to come to a consensus on that before September.	92	9
201404	687	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So it’s pretty important that we, wherever we can, try to figure out a bit more rigorously what we need to decide in order to enable the Chair to go out in September or sometime later and explain what it is that we’re doing.	92	9
201404	688	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The only other comment I’d make, and this is consistent with what Richard just said, is that one way or another the financial-stability dynamic that Vice Chairman Dudley explained a minute ago is going to be with us.	92	9
201404	689	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	One of the things I think that people are taking into account— that everybody sitting on the other side of the table from us took into account—is that we are increasingly mindful of financial-stability concerns, and this potential reorientation of the monetary policy regime might help to address them.	92	9
201404	690	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But, one way or another, some combination of the Board’s regulatory authority, other US government agencies’ regulatory authority, and the FOMC are going to have to address them for exactly the reason that President Fisher cited— that so much of the activity of short-term intermediation is not running through the commercial banking system anymore.	92	9
201404	691	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	692	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	693	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	92	9
201404	694	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Now I’m going back to the original list of questions, and I have Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201404	695	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I had a question for Antoine.	92	9
201404	696	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe it’s more of an observation.	92	9
201404	697	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that individual caps have one important difference from aggregate caps.	92	9
201404	698	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With aggregate caps you presumably would have to have a submission of a schedule of what your demand curve was and what your prices were, while if you had a system of individual caps it would just be a quantity-based system.	92	9
201404	699	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So my question is, it doesn’t seem like the individual-cap-based system has the benefit of being operationally a lot simpler.	92	9
201404	700	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a leading question, obviously.	92	9
201404	701	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	702	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	I think the individual cap is simpler for the participant, but more complicated for us to implement, and Josh might have something to say about that.	92	9
201404	703	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The aggregate cap is going to require a little bit more thinking on the part of the participants.	92	9
201404	704	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	I think it’s easier for us to put into place.	92	9
201404	705	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	That’s right.	92	9
201404	706	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	In today’s world, we could implement individual caps tomorrow if we needed to, but to do it in a robust, automated fashion would take us a fair amount of time.	92	9
201404	707	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And let me just add something in terms of why the sum of the individual caps might be less tight than an aggregate cap.	92	9
201404	708	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	There are a couple of things.	92	9
201404	709	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	First, we have a number of participants that just don’t use the facility very much.	92	9
201404	710	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	They would likely have a de minimis amount.	92	9
201404	711	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I understand that.	92	9
201404	712	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It just seems to me, though, that people are going to have to submit a schedule of what they want at different prices, which seems like a much more complicated process to do every day than just saying, “I want this much.”	92	9
201404	713	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It does have the advantage that then the overnight RRP is allocated across participants more efficiently, whereas if you have an aggregate cap and some way of allocating through an auction or something, as Jeremy was talking about earlier, it’s a more efficient system.	92	9
201404	714	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But it also seems to me a question of how often you think that this cap is actually going to be binding.	92	9
201404	715	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you thought it was once every five years, you probably don’t want to have them submitting all these prices for the once-in-five-years event.	92	9
201404	716	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think it’s going to be binding every quarter, then maybe—	92	9
201404	717	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	It also means if they believe it never binds or almost never binds, and if we have a rule that says whenever the cap is not binding everybody gets the maximum bid rate, then they really don’t need to make any of these complicated decisions.	92	9
201404	718	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	They would just say, “We’re just going to bid the amount we want because in all likelihood it’s not binding.”	92	9
201404	719	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So the complicated part really comes about when they think it is going to hit, but that’s precisely when we want them to think about how much they need that liquidity.	92	9
201404	720	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201404	721	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Just because I heard the term “caps,” and I’m curious about whether the caps are likely to be important from option 1 all the way to option 4?	92	9
201404	722	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m thinking of Governor Tarullo’s question about whether we need to have this discussion about caps in order to get to a September agreement, but the overnight RRP facility is in options 1 through 4.	92	9
201404	723	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So I think we need a point of view on this.	92	9
201404	724	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It depends on how important the financial-stability issue is.	92	9
201404	725	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So in option 4, is it important?	92	9
201404	726	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Because there, presumably, the funds rate is more important, and it’s a smaller ON RRP.	92	9
201404	727	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	No, it would still have the same issue.	92	9
201404	728	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So caps are always important.	92	9
201404	729	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Also, in option 5, if you have the term RRP, and you just happen to be auctioning on that day, depending on how you do it, it would still be a problem.	92	9
201404	730	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	I think you want to think of the caps as being able to adjust over time.	92	9
201404	731	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So that, again, in normal times, even if we tied them to the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates, it would still not likely bind.	92	9
201404	732	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In all normal situations, you would have these caps in place; and, in all likelihood, they wouldn’t bind.	92	9
201404	733	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In that sense, all these options have them in place, but they are not affecting the way you implement monetary policy, except in times of acute stress.	92	9
201404	734	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Let me restate, perhaps, Governor Tarullo’s question on a different topic.	92	9
201404	735	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	It strikes me that caps and so many of the subjects here have a greater level of complexity by an order of magnitude compared with so many of the other monetary policy institutions or things that we talk about.	92	9
201404	736	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Are we going to have to sort through that level of complexity by a September timeframe?	92	9
201404	737	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s the question.	92	9
201404	738	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think that’s quite right.	92	9
201404	739	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We have caps in place right now.	92	9
201404	740	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The two countries that run floor systems basically have caps.	92	9
201404	741	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And if you go above that cap, you get a lower rate.	92	9
201404	742	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The choices we have here are engineering-type choices that would be pretty easy for us to work on over the next three months.	92	9
201404	743	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Operationally, it might be difficult to make it completely robust in three months, but we have a lot of capacity to get it rolling quite quickly.	92	9
201404	744	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The deeper issues regarding financial stability and how you should interact with the nonbank sector—it would be surprising if you solved those matters in three months.	92	9
201404	745	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see, we are back to further questions, and I think I see President Lacker on the list.	92	9
201404	746	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	92	9
201404	747	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	748	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I have questions for Josh and Jane.	92	9
201404	749	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	In your presentation, Jane, exhibit 1 says that rates “probably” won’t go up one-for-one when we raise the IOER rate, but you said “potentially.”	92	9
201404	750	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And then, Josh, when you were talking about these regulatory balance sheet costs—the FDIC charge and Basel III—I thought you said that they’d make them unprofitable, but I assume you meant unprofitable at certain rates, and there would be rates at which they were profitable.	92	9
201404	751	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So for the federal funds rate–IOER arbitrage, do you have a sense of what the magnitude of those costs amounts to for a bank?	92	9
201404	752	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	What would a typical large commercial bank find to be a breakeven spread?	92	9
201404	753	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	I think what we’ve heard from some of the foreign banks that are not subject to the FDIC fee has been about 5 basis points.	92	9
201404	754	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	So if you factor in an average FDIC assessment charge, which, I think, for the past few quarters has been 7 to 10 basis points for most of the larger banks—	92	9
201404	755	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So you get 12 to 15.	92	9
201404	756	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Yes, 12, 15, something like that.	92	9
201404	757	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And then you have to add in how the leverage ratio might affect some of the large banks within the United States.	92	9
201404	758	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That was discussed in the cover memo in which we reissued the framework discussion from last year.	92	9
201404	759	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And that, you know, could be quite large when you talk to some of the banks.	92	9
201404	760	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They view that as a pretty big constraint.	92	9
201404	761	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It could just be the banks talking to us in the way they tend to when there are new regulations.	92	9
201404	762	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Right, right.	92	9
201404	763	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But it is also possible that, if it’s binding for a large bank, it will be quite expensive, at the ratios that we’re talking about.	92	9
201404	764	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So here is the question.	92	9
201404	765	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Those costs would drive a wedge between the funds rate and the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	766	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It doesn’t seem to me like they are going to vary when we raise the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	767	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Does it?	92	9
201404	768	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Do you think they would?	92	9
201404	769	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Would they go up, or would that be just a constant, you know, X number of basis points wedge?	92	9
201404	770	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	That could be the case, that it’s just a constant spread.	92	9
201404	771	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	And so if you’re happy with that spread, then you could increase the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	772	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	You might not actually have to drain very much, even in option 5.	92	9
201404	773	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	But the point is, we just don’t know.	92	9
201404	774	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	You don’t know of any reason why those wedges would widen, right?	92	9
201404	775	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I mean, the FDIC thing, that doesn’t widen when the rate goes up, right?	92	9
201404	776	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Well, if you look over, say, even the past year, the IOER–federal funds rate spread does vary from day to day.	92	9
201404	777	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	So I don’t want to say the spread is going to be a constant as of what it is today.	92	9
201404	778	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	Over the past year, I think the average spread has been 15 basis points, but it has moved up and down.	92	9
201404	779	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And the year before the spread was much lower.	92	9
201404	780	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So it has varied quite a lot.	92	9
201404	781	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	92	9
201404	782	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But to be fair, as you say, we don’t know for sure.	92	9
201404	783	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There are a lot of things that we don’t know for sure here, and it could be that raising the IOER rate would be sufficient to raise the funds rate more or less along with the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	784	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It would be a brave decision by the Committee to do that, I think, because if you announced, “Okay—we’re tightening, everybody; here it goes; we’re raising the IOER rate to 50 basis points,” and you raised the IOER rate to 50 basis points, and the funds rate went up much less than 25 basis points, that would be a problem.	92	9
201404	785	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I understand that the future is uncertain, but the arbitrage is a reason we have to believe that the spread might remain constant.	92	9
201404	786	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Yes.	92	9
201404	787	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And I was just probing to see if there was any reason to believe it might not, besides the general uncertainty that clouds all of us when we think about the future.	92	9
201404	788	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Well, because it has varied quite a lot.	92	9
201404	789	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The funds rate varied quite a lot, too, from day to day.	92	9
201404	790	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	No, I’m talking about just the average level over a certain period of time.	92	9
201404	791	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That seems to vary in a way.	92	9
201404	792	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It is possible that this would be a pretty predictable relationship, and I think all the staff think that you could raise rates by raising the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	793	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It just won’t be as controlled as using some of these other tools.	92	9
201404	794	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	To add to that, you know, you don’t have to specify a federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	795	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	You could specify a federal funds range.	92	9
201404	796	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Right, you could maintain a range.	92	9
201404	797	2014-04-30	meeting	IHRIG	And so the range can help you with that worry.	92	9
201404	798	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201404	799	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Wow.	92	9
201404	800	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I just put that question in.	92	9
201404	801	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	The list is short.	92	9
201404	802	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	803	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I have a sort of longer-term-perspective question.	92	9
201404	804	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	If we have a vibrant overnight reverse repo program, if money funds develop these special short-term safe investment funds, and if they draw in funding on a large scale there, I’m assuming that, alternatively, those funds were going to go somewhere else.	92	9
201404	805	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Somebody else isn’t going to have a fund available for that, and that fund is providing some funding for certain types of activities.	92	9
201404	806	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	What types of activities are going to be diminished by this?	92	9
201404	807	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Is there a sense in which credit intermediation to nonfinancial enterprises might be affected adversely?	92	9
201404	808	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I would hope not.	92	9
201404	809	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That would be a big issue.	92	9
201404	810	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Is the shadow banking system going to somehow look smaller if we have something like that?	92	9
201404	811	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Or will it be unchanged?	92	9
201404	812	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	More broadly, who are the losers in a development like that?	92	9
201404	813	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	How loudly will they be talking to other people—vested interests, political lobbies—about that?	92	9
201404	814	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Can you paint a little bit more of a picture of what that looks like?	92	9
201404	815	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This would be with a reasonably large take-up of the overnight RRP facility?	92	9
201404	816	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	92	9
201404	817	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Let’s go that far.	92	9
201404	818	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The first-order effect will be that fewer reserves will be held overnight by the banking system with the Fed.	92	9
201404	819	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So it will change the composition of the liabilities of the Fed, and the Fed might have a view about that.	92	9
201404	820	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it should have a direct effect on credit formation.	92	9
201404	821	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The first-order effect will have to do with which rates you are setting around here on credit formation.	92	9
201404	822	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There are versions of option 1 in which it’s a little bit mysterious to us exactly what would happen in the financial system, because instead of having $300 billion to $400 billion of reserves move into the overnight RRP facility, you could have trillions of reserves move into the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	823	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That might have some effect on banks, in the short run, definitely, as they deal with deposits that leave them.	92	9
201404	824	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And that could be a structure that makes it harder for them to provide credit in the short run.	92	9
201404	825	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I just wanted to clarify something, President Evans.	92	9
201404	826	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first-order effect, leaving aside all sorts of other stuff, would be as follows: What you have now is depositors holding deposits at a bank and the bank holding reserves with us.	92	9
201404	827	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And what you’ll have instead is depositors putting funds with a money market fund, which is holding overnight RRPs with us.	92	9
201404	828	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	There is no necessary implication for flows of funding to other folks in that structure.	92	9
201404	829	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As long as it happens smoothly—as long as it happens in a way that isn’t disruptive—	92	9
201404	830	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think there is a reason to think that there are big losers.	92	9
201404	831	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I mean, there are losers because rates are higher, and people who used to issue CP at 20 basis points are now issuing CP at 50 basis points or something.	92	9
201404	832	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The FBOs could lose out, depending on if they’re making arbitrage trades.	92	9
201404	833	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Fair enough.	92	9
201404	834	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The person that was getting IOER is not going to be getting IOER anymore.	92	9
201404	835	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Fair enough.	92	9
201404	836	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s right.	92	9
201404	837	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201404	838	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that, because I can’t say I have a great picture of exactly how simple or complicated this is.	92	9
201404	839	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	And so if it’s actually a rather trivial type of thing and there isn’t really a scenario in which there could be some kind of dislocation of funding or something like that, then maybe it’s easy.	92	9
201404	840	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But you might think that for a new innovation proposal of this sort of magnitude you normally would have some type of reports or hearings—I don’t know the right term—to hear from people who are affected, and you’d get some comments or something to help understand it better.	92	9
201404	841	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	About 54 percent of the reserves are held by foreign banking organizations.	92	9
201404	842	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And large banking organizations outside of those hold the vast majority of the rest of the reserves.	92	9
201404	843	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And they are holding them in a particular way.	92	9
201404	844	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t view that as a particularly powerful interest group that would object to some of this, but it’s possible that they could.	92	9
201404	845	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	92	9
201404	846	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92	9
201404	847	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have a two-hander.	92	9
201404	848	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92	9
201404	849	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201404	850	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’d like to follow up, because I think I have a similar question to what President Evans was asking.	92	9
201404	851	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I had asked Simon, I think at the previous meeting, if where we saw a lot of the volume in these overnight markets, we were just replacing other traders in some of the volume.	92	9
201404	852	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Just a little bit.	92	9
201404	853	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But what I’m worried about is, as President Evans suggested, as this gets to be a very big program—if this is the way it goes—what are the potential unintended consequences for market structure, how the money markets are working, who the players are, and where the trades are going to be coming from?	92	9
201404	854	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Are some people going to be exiting from this business of supplying overnight funds of various kinds?	92	9
201404	855	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And will we just be replacing a market with what we do?	92	9
201404	856	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t quite understand how this is going to work.	92	9
201404	857	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m a little bit nervous because I think going into the discussion of IOER and the funds rate we thought the IOER rate would provide a pretty solid floor for the funds rate.	92	9
201404	858	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It turned out it didn’t, and we now understand better why.	92	9
201404	859	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And now we’re talking about something that is much more complicated, and the ripple effects, in terms of unintended consequences on the market structure, are something I don’t feel like I understand, and it makes me a little nervous.	92	9
201404	860	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m not sure it’s much more complicated.	92	9
201404	861	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Well, it seems to me it’s much more complicated.	92	9
201404	862	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But that’s just me.	92	9
201404	863	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I would say that the testing—and I’ll talk about this later—has given us more confidence that it is forming a floor.	92	9
201404	864	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It would have been nice to have done some testing with interest on excess reserves in advance.	92	9
201404	865	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think we could have come out with a slightly different version of that.	92	9
201404	866	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It is helping functioning in repo markets right now, and I will also talk about that later.	92	9
201404	867	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In terms of the unintended consequences, I think one of the consequences that we understand is in the federal funds market, in which 90 percent of these trades are from the FHLBs to the foreign banking organizations.	92	9
201404	868	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Under certain options—I think option 1 and option 2—we’re not sure whether that trade would survive.	92	9
201404	869	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But I think if you chose option 1 or option 2, you would be intending something like that to happen.	92	9
201404	870	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s harder to see in option 3—what we’ve said there is we would basically use the margin of adjusting the overnight RRP rate to make sure that the federal funds rate survived in the current form, in which this arbitrage activity was a large part of the market.	92	9
201404	871	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And we feel that that would give us control over the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	872	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That could have some strange consequences, because it’s a good way to get control over the federal funds rate, but it looks a little bit strange to be using the foreign banking organizations—effectively, their relationship with the FHLBs—to do that.	92	9
201404	873	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There could be other unintended consequences.	92	9
201404	874	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think we did a pretty good job of trying to think through some—the issue of the perfectly elastic supply of the safe asset is one we spent, I think, the past six or seven weeks trying to understand really carefully, and we’re still working on that.	92	9
201404	875	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And there might be other things we find, but the memo tried to cover that for you.	92	9
201404	876	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If I could add just one thing—I think it’s correct that we should be worried about unintended consequences, and at least in my mind the risk of the unintended consequences is larger, the larger the use of the overnight RRP program is.	92	9
201404	877	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So in option 3 or in option 4, in which we’re keeping a bigger spread, and in which we’re in some sense intentionally setting things up to have a smaller footprint in the nonbank financial sector, one would hope those unintended consequences would be less likely or would be smaller.	92	9
201404	878	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	In option 1, in which you’ve potentially got a very, very large overnight RRP program, we can’t think of something in particular that would go wrong, but the risk of unintended consequences is presumably larger.	92	9
201404	879	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201404	880	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	881	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a question that I think follows on what President Lacker was asking about in terms of the arbitrage, but I’m going to pose a hypothetical scenario in which the arbitrage doesn’t work very effectively, and then I want to know what that means for the effectiveness of monetary policy.	92	9
201404	882	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Suppose the interest rate on excess reserves is 200 basis points at the end of 2016, but the overall level of short-term rates is considerably lower—say, only 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	883	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How do we think that gap is going to be influencing our macroeconomic objectives, the unemployment rate and inflation?	92	9
201404	884	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Should I be thinking that I’ve got the IOER rate at 200 basis points, but actually the unemployment rate is going to be somewhat lower and inflation is going to be somewhat higher than what I would get out of the FRB/US model if I just plugged in that 200 basis points?	92	9
201404	885	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess the point of my question is, there are lots of spreads in the world.	92	9
201404	886	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Monetary policy is a blunt tool that has lots of differential effects—savers remind me about this all the time when I’m speaking—and we don’t worry about that.	92	9
201404	887	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our objective is to fulfill our goals in terms of unemployment and inflation.	92	9
201404	888	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And if these spreads aren’t material for our ability to achieve our goals, then it’s harder for me to get worked up about them.	92	9
201404	889	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	One point that Jamie McAndrews has made, which was very useful for me in thinking through this, is that it used to be the case that the fed funds rate was both the hurdle rate for banks to make loans and their cost of funding.	92	9
201404	890	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That’s no longer the case.	92	9
201404	891	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Right now, the hurdle rate for banks is the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	892	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The cost of funding is the market rate.	92	9
201404	893	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And so you might be worried about that spread because banks are going to be looking at the IOER rate when they’re thinking about making loans, and their funding cost is going to be closer to market rates.	92	9
201404	894	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That is just a very different situation from the one we used to be in, and you have to think through what the effect of that is.	92	9
201404	895	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what will be the effect of that situation on unemployment and inflation?	92	9
201404	896	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You are not going to have the most efficient set of overnight rates there.	92	9
201404	897	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s going to be confusing to price term rates as well in that world, because people will be trying to understand, is that wedge going to stay at 100 basis points?	92	9
201404	898	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Is it going to move to 50?	92	9
201404	899	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Is it going to go to 25?	92	9
201404	900	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So the effect you’ll have in trying to explain what future policy will be like will also be weak.	92	9
201404	901	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Overnight rates at 100 basis points is a significant gap in instruments that should be trading pretty close to each other, and that would suggest that we had messed up in some pretty big way, I’d say.	92	9
201404	902	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s 100 basis points for an overnight rate on something that, in normal times, should be pretty close to a perfect substitute—that’s a big wedge we put in the financial system.	92	9
201404	903	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Clearly, we haven’t modeled this at all, but I would have thought one way to think about this is that market rates—the commercial paper market, bond markets, Treasury markets, and so on—would basically be coming off short-term market rates, which in your example were around 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	904	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So those sorts of effects would operate more or less as usual.	92	9
201404	905	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It would be as if monetary policy were just targeting a rate of 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	906	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	However, I think then—to bring in the point that Antoine made—banks may be feeling a little differently than if they were facing a short-term funding cost of 100 basis points, because they can get IOER at 200 basis points.	92	9
201404	907	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So you have to worry a little bit more about what banks are doing, what bank lending behavior is relative to what’s going on in markets, and try to somehow map that into what it means in terms of modeling for output, for inflation, and the things we care about.	92	9
201404	908	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess I’m confused.	92	9
201404	909	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not following this.	92	9
201404	910	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How is it that the banks have access to this 100 basis point funding, and they have a 200 basis point investment opportunity and they’re not taking advantage of it?	92	9
201404	911	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The way I think of it is that if you’re a bank and now you’re trying to think, are you going to make this loan?	92	9
201404	912	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And what you’re comparing it with is the fact that you could just hold the reserves and earn the 200 basis points.	92	9
201404	913	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And so your threshold for making a loan is much higher.	92	9
201404	914	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sure.	92	9
201404	915	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And that means that we would be worried about banks not making as many loans as they would, given that funding rates are so low.	92	9
201404	916	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That sounds like the IOER rate is a relevant rate.	92	9
201404	917	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what makes the short-term rate the relevant rate?	92	9
201404	918	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Well, that’s what you can fund at.	92	9
201404	919	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So you can attract deposits or wholesale funding.	92	9
201404	920	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Who is “you” in this?	92	9
201404	921	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s the bank.	92	9
201404	922	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s trying to attract funds to expand its balance sheet, and it can attract at 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	923	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would seem like it would want to attract even more funds at 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	924	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	—to put it into the 200 basis points.	92	9
201404	925	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But presumably there’s some limit to that arbitrage because of the leverage ratio or whatever regulatory issues they face.	92	9
201404	926	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Then its cost of funds isn’t 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	927	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The argument you’re making is—you were just trying to close the wedge by saying the arbitrage had to close that wedge.	92	9
201404	928	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If it doesn’t close, there’s either a cost or some other imperfection in the financial system.	92	9
201404	929	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And 100 basis points is still a really big overnight wedge.	92	9
201404	930	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll let Governor Stein explain what I’m to say more clearly than I was planning to.	92	9
201404	931	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think in your example you’ve just strongly segmented the market.	92	9
201404	932	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	933	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are going to be some players, nonbanks, who are funding at 100 basis points.	92	9
201404	934	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are going to be banks for whom, given that they’ve used up their leverage ratio constraint, they’re funding at 200 basis points.	92	9
201404	935	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	None of this means that you can’t achieve your macroeconomic objectives.	92	9
201404	936	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s just about which way you achieve your macroeconomic objectives with the minimum of microeconomic distortion.	92	9
201404	937	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are many, many ways we can get rates up and slow the economy if we need to.	92	9
201404	938	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There’s no shortage of those.	92	9
201404	939	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s just that some of them will have less good microeconomic properties—I think we’re trying to optimize on the microeconomic dimension, not the meeting-our-mandate dimension.	92	9
201404	940	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We have ample degrees of freedom to do that.	92	9
201404	941	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have to think about the losses that I’m suffering as a monetary policymaker.	92	9
201404	942	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I mean there are many microeconomic distortions in the world, and I want to be able to somehow quantify the losses associated with these gaps in terms of my objectives for unemployment and inflation.	92	9
201404	943	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m having a hard time seeing how that would be material.	92	9
201404	944	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ve talked about the consequences for financial stability—those could be material.	92	9
201404	945	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think I agree with you, but I agree with Governor Stein’s description of what I would see as the market.	92	9
201404	946	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s really a segmented market, and the banks are in one segment and the nonbanks are in another.	92	9
201404	947	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	What will tend to happen as the balance sheet gets smaller is that that friction will start to change the effect, and people will have to think through, if the wedge is that big, how is that going to affect where rates will be?	92	9
201404	948	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They’ll have to understand two things.	92	9
201404	949	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We will have to think through what we’re going to do as that wedge changes.	92	9
201404	950	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That is quite complicated, to transmit your policy intent over the next one to two years.	92	9
201404	951	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You’re going to have to be thinking about who’s hitting the leverage ratio as the market will become less segmented over time.	92	9
201404	952	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It would seem to me a difficult situation for the transmission of policy in terms of your intent.	92	9
201404	953	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	In this discussion we’re talking about macro and micro, and just to remind at least myself, the context of why we’ll be raising rates is that we think the economy is doing better.	92	9
201404	954	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Inflation might be a risk taking off.	92	9
201404	955	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We want to be adjusting that.	92	9
201404	956	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So if this wedge is larger, and it’s disrupting how a bank thinks about making good loans in an environment in which the economy is doing well, that’s already something of a headwind.	92	9
201404	957	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Does that suggest that, depending on the size of the wedge, we might not need to raise rates as much because there’s already something clogging things up?	92	9
201404	958	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	959	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That was Governor Stein’s point.	92	9
201404	960	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Oh, is that what you said?	92	9
201404	961	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Oh, my gosh, I thought he said “micro stuff.”	92	9
201404	962	2014-04-30	meeting		[Laughter]	92	9
201404	963	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Or we could make regulatory changes to make the wedge smaller, too.	92	9
201404	964	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not like we have to just accept the wedge for what it is.	92	9
201404	965	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We could change the regime to make the arbitrage more efficient.	92	9
201404	966	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	967	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So this is a one-hander.	92	9
201404	968	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Am I on the one-hander list or the two- hander list?	92	9
201404	969	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	One finger.	92	9
201404	970	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	971	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I just wanted to go back to financial stability for a minute, because I thought it was a very good discussion.	92	9
201404	972	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But as I think about the reverse repo facility, we have an administered rate, and we have administered caps, whereas in the segregated balance accounts you have more market-determined rates and more market-determined caps.	92	9
201404	973	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If our concern gravitates on the financial-stability side, the segregated balance accounts do have more flexibility because the banks presumably would be lowering rates as we get into this situation.	92	9
201404	974	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if we were to go down the road of being really worried about this, it seems like there’s a stronger argument for the segregated balance accounts.	92	9
201404	975	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	But could you just perhaps describe thinking about the reverse repo facility and the segregated balance accounts, both from a financial-stability standpoint and with regard to other things we should be thinking about in terms of the tradeoff between those two options?	92	9
201404	976	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We discussed the segregated balance accounts at some length at a previous meeting, but they got a little less attention so far in these memos.	92	9
201404	977	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They were called reserve collateral accounts at that time, but we changed the name of them.	92	9
201404	978	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You might just want to describe quickly what they are, Antoine.	92	9
201404	979	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Right.	92	9
201404	980	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	A segregated balance account is a specific kind of account that can be created between a bank and essentially any counterparty, pending a legal opinion by the Board’s General Counsel.	92	9
201404	981	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	This allows the investor to lend to that bank, and the reserves that correspond to that loan are segregated in a way that the bank cannot use them, and it protects the investor’s loan so there’s no counterparty risk  And automatically the next day the loan is sent back so that the investor gets his funds back.	92	9
201404	982	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	The intent of that construct is to eliminate counterparty risk so as to create more competition.	92	9
201404	983	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	That way current investors who are only looking to lend to FBOs and large domestic banks would be more willing to lend to a wide variety of banks.	92	9
201404	984	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	And it does, as you suggested, create a competitive rate because banks are competing with each other in order to offer these accounts, and we would expect that to lower the wedge between market rates and the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	985	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	We haven’t completely thought through all of the financial-stability implications.	92	9
201404	986	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	In many ways, at a high enough level, they look a lot like an overnight RRP construct, but we would not be direct counterparties, and the rate would not be set administratively.	92	9
201404	987	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	So I think you’re right to suggest that banks would want to lower the rates in times of crisis.	92	9
201404	988	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	We might also want to think about whether there are possibilities, or it’s desirable, to have other mitigants, like caps, to avoid surges.	92	9
201404	989	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	But these would be private-sector arrangements, so banks and their investors would decide, maybe constrained by some limits we impose on them, how much you can increase your investment in a segregated balance account from one day to the next, or some of these considerations.	92	9
201404	990	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we would avoid some of the problems that President Kocherlakota was worried about in that earlier discussion, in that it would not look like we were limiting the ability of people to move into an account.	92	9
201404	991	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Really, the cap becomes the amount of excess reserves at any one institution and that institution’s ability to find a counterparty.	92	9
201404	992	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	Right.	92	9
201404	993	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	We need to think more about this because we didn’t get a chance in this set of memos to really investigate the segregated balance accounts.	92	9
201404	994	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	It would be worth doing.	92	9
201404	995	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	It would eliminate the concern that policymakers have to make these decisions.	92	9
201404	996	2014-04-30	meeting	MARTIN	If you are worried about very rapid increases in take-up, you would want to think through what private- sector institutions would do and whether there would be appropriate brakes on a run to SBAs in a way that there are on a run to an overnight RRP facility, but presumably there are similar ways to address these issues, and certainly it would eliminate a lot of the political-economy concerns about policymakers having to make these decisions.	92	9
201404	997	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, a two-hander.	92	9
201404	998	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	You had a footnote in the short-term policy memo that wasn’t clear to me.	92	9
201404	999	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Were you asking for permission from the FOMC to develop this concept?	92	9
201404	1000	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As I recall, you were saying it would take about 6 to 12 months or whatever to understand the infrastructure.	92	9
201404	1001	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Are we taking this tool off the table?	92	9
201404	1002	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Are you asking us to put it back on the table?	92	9
201404	1003	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think that was just a description of what the tool was and how it might deal with this particular issue.	92	9
201404	1004	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s definitely one of the tools that you could think about over the next few weeks.	92	9
201404	1005	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As I recall, the footnote said, “if the FOMC instructs us to proceed.”	92	9
201404	1006	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	1007	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So are you asking for that, or not yet?	92	9
201404	1008	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think anyone asked for it just yet.	92	9
201404	1009	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That would depend on everyone at the table here.	92	9
201404	1010	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If that’s something they wanted to invest in, it would definitely be good to know early rather than late, because there’s a lead time for that.	92	9
201404	1011	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201404	1012	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Last question—oh, President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201404	1013	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, I was going to follow up with President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	1014	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I appreciate the point you’re making.	92	9
201404	1015	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that the SBAs would offer some safety against some of the risks that I was mentioning earlier.	92	9
201404	1016	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the same time, we might worry that the private sector in these instances might not fully internalize all the costs associated with having a run at one institution.	92	9
201404	1017	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That might have contingent effects across the whole system in a way that may not be fully internalized by that given institution.	92	9
201404	1018	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I agree with you, though, that this offers some mitigants against some of the risks I was pointing to.	92	9
201404	1019	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201404	1020	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1021	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I have a narrow question about some of the other interest rates that were suggested in the staff memo on the target for the federal funds rate, but actually I invite the staff, if they want, to at the same time offer more comments on the need more generally to fix the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1022	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	You note the volatility of Eurodollar transactions— the standard deviation is about 40 percent higher than for the current effective federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1023	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I am looking at chart 2 in what I labeled as memo 5, “The Target for the Federal Funds Rate and Alternatives.”	92	9
201404	1024	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I note the rather substantial spikes in both directions.	92	9
201404	1025	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Are those spikes that vary from the federal funds rate more a function of something technical in Eurodollar markets that’s equivalent to a shortage of certain runs of Treasuries in the Treasury GC market, or is it something about the character of some of the participants in Eurodollar markets who don’t participate in the federal funds market, or something else?	92	9
201404	1026	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’re all looking at you, Josh.	92	9
201404	1027	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So have a go.	92	9
201404	1028	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Yes.	92	9
201404	1029	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Thanks.	92	9
201404	1030	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1031	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	I think there is definitely a quarterly pattern, but is your question why the volatility is sometimes more pronounced in Eurodollars than in fed funds and other times vice versa?	92	9
201404	1032	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	There’s definitely a calendar effect.	92	9
201404	1033	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, there seems to be, although this is a pretty big scale.	92	9
201404	1034	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So I really couldn’t tell exactly where these spikes were concentrated.	92	9
201404	1035	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think at the last year-end the effect was really big.	92	9
201404	1036	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I can’t remember—	92	9
201404	1037	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Eurodollars went negative, didn’t they, or something weird?	92	9
201404	1038	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Something like that, because the banks were trying to change what their balance sheets looked like.	92	9
201404	1039	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So there’s some effect from the holders of the Eurodollars that might be part of this, but, overall, I think that in terms of the effective rate, these are pretty close over the period that we show.	92	9
201404	1040	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They did definitely diverge more in 2007–2009 because of the funding issues of some of the foreign banks.	92	9
201404	1041	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	That’s what I wanted to ask, Simon—is that period of divergence of particular relevance in thinking about incorporating this into our targeted rate?	92	9
201404	1042	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The thing we don’t know is whether the Desk would have operated in a different way if it had been targeting, say, a blended Eurodollar–fed funds rate, and that could have had some effect on some of these wedges that we saw.	92	9
201404	1043	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It seems unlikely because of the timing issue that Bill faced when he was the manager.	92	9
201404	1044	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We lost a little bit of control over the federal funds rate in the crisis.	92	9
201404	1045	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t know if the Eurodollar–fed funds distinction would have created much more difficulty.	92	9
201404	1046	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But it would have had more weight on the trades that were difficult for us to push against—the ones that were early in the morning—which were causing the problem.	92	9
201404	1047	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s an issue of the operating regime we’re in, at which times we would operate, and how we could measure what was happening at the end of the day.	92	9
201404	1048	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And to try to continue on the theme of specifying what it is that we would need to address in the shorter term, are the six of you essentially of the view that even in the short-to-medium term—unless we were to, for example, go with option 1, which I don’t think we would—some addressing of the federal funds rate is an important part of what we do over the next few months?	92	9
201404	1049	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s a pretty general question.	92	9
201404	1050	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Well, no, it’s not.	92	9
201404	1051	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	It’s meant to be quite specific—which is to say, as we go forward with whatever plan, under some avatar of one of these options, we eventually hit on, is it in your view an important part of that plan that we do something about the current federal funds rate, which seems to elicit a fair amount of concern because of the degree to which it has been narrowed?	92	9
201404	1052	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think there are some tradeoffs.	92	9
201404	1053	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Under some of the options you’d be more confident that the fed funds market as it is today would stay in place.	92	9
201404	1054	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	However, you’d have more focus on the fed funds market.	92	9
201404	1055	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That means that you’d have a risk if anything goes wrong in using that as your policy rate.	92	9
201404	1056	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So that would argue for making it more robust against those risks.	92	9
201404	1057	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Under the options in which the federal funds rate is less of a focus, I think you’d still want to have some solutions in there, because it’s a relevant rate—is it about $11 trillion in contracts, OIS plus the futures?	92	9
201404	1058	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And we wouldn’t want to give the impression that we were indifferent to how the federal funds market was reacting, given that people have already entered those contracts.	92	9
201404	1059	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So there would be two sets of reasons why you would want to “robustify” it, and Bill, I think, is going to say this, but one of the things that we think is a reasonable thing to come out of this meeting is to think about robustifying among all of these options.	92	9
201404	1060	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Yes, I was going to say that.	92	9
201404	1061	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that, particularly for the options in which we’d continue to target the funds rate, it would be sufficiently awkward later on to say, “Oops, we can’t target that.	92	9
201404	1062	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We have to target something else,” that I’d be inclined to make a change sooner rather than later to make the rate more robust.	92	9
201404	1063	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Everything raises communications issues and is complicated, but I think it would not be that complicated to say that we’re going to continue to target overnight bank funding rates, we’re just going to use a broader overnight bank funding rate, which would be a mix of the fed funds and Eurodollar rates.	92	9
201404	1064	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We think from the broker data that the Eurodollar transactions are three times what the fed funds trades are.	92	9
201404	1065	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That gives you a fair amount of trades to use for calculating the rate that you would target.	92	9
201404	1066	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As you can see in the chart that you pointed us to, aside from quarter-end, these things track very closely together.	92	9
201404	1067	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Look at the scale on the right-hand side— this is 1 basis point or something, other than at quarter-end.	92	9
201404	1068	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So really it’s not changing things in a big way.	92	9
201404	1069	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We’d be targeting, in effect, something very similar to what we targeted before, but it would just be more robust as we normalize, and I find that pretty appealing.	92	9
201404	1070	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1071	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And really quickly, Josh, could you talk to us about the contractual aspects of it?	92	9
201404	1072	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	If we went to the format Bill mentioned, can that deal with our contractual obligations—the $11 trillion in contractual obligations?	92	9
201404	1073	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Right.	92	9
201404	1074	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Just to clarify—	92	9
201404	1075	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’re not lawyers.	92	9
201404	1076	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Yes, that’s a good caveat to start with.	92	9
201404	1077	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Not being a lawyer, let me ask you the question.	92	9
201404	1078	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	So I think we don’t have any contractual obligation.	92	9
201404	1079	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	We, the Fed, have no contractual obligation.	92	9
201404	1080	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	No, no, but they exist in the marketplace.	92	9
201404	1081	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	In terms of the market contracts, I think it really depends on the scope of the change.	92	9
201404	1082	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Generally speaking, the smaller the change, the safer it is.	92	9
201404	1083	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	I think the conclusion that the staff came to was that including transactions that were quite similar in nature— something like Eurodollars and the fed funds rate—or changing the source of the fed funds rate from brokered data to the FR 2420, this new data collection we’ve started, are generally seen as being on the safer side of change.	92	9
201404	1084	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This is partly because the contracts aren’t well constructed.	92	9
201404	1085	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The main source for the federal funds effective rate is the rates posted on the New York Fed website, and then it appears in the H.5, and we are not very clear about where that comes from.	92	9
201404	1086	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s just put up there, and it says the ones printed, I think.	92	9
201404	1087	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Governor Stein has been dealing with this issue on the reference rates.	92	9
201404	1088	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There’s a lot of work that needs to be done to make reference rates more robust.	92	9
201404	1089	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We have a little bit of a margin in this world, because it wasn’t that clear what the effective federal funds rate is.	92	9
201404	1090	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	With that said, let me fall back to saying that we’re not lawyers.	92	9
201404	1091	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we would want to think more about this—	92	9
201404	1092	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But Governor Tarullo is a lawyer.	92	9
201404	1093	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1094	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	—with our legal colleagues.	92	9
201404	1095	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	One possibility, for example, is that we could continue to publish the old fed funds rate on the old basis.	92	9
201404	1096	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It might become noisy for a while, but there would still be a rate that contracts could point to, and people could settle on that basis.	92	9
201404	1097	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternatively, maybe we could get away with making this change as Josh suggested.	92	9
201404	1098	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we’d want to think hard about that choice: what the legal issues are, what are the policy issues are, and what we want to do.	92	9
201404	1099	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But I think we could, if the Committee wanted to, target a broader overnight bank funding rate, and we could sort out one way or another how we would handle the existing outstanding contracts.	92	9
201404	1100	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1101	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	92	9
201404	1102	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve got two-handers.	92	9
201404	1103	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	1104	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just a quick follow-up to Governor Tarullo’s question.	92	9
201404	1105	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As long as the fed funds is 90 percent driven by the Federal Home Loan Banks, it seems like an odd market to be very focused on.	92	9
201404	1106	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it seems like if we’re going to include the federal funds market as an important component, it would be contingent on coming up with a strategy in which there was a very different composition of who was trading in the federal funds market.	92	9
201404	1107	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Clearly for option 1 and option 2—but when I get between option 2 and option 3, it’s not clear to me how broad the fed funds market becomes.	92	9
201404	1108	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	There will be some trades, but if this light blue is still predominantly coming from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the rate is not indicative of anything other than Home Loan Bank borrowing demand.	92	9
201404	1109	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And that seems like a very odd thing to target in monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1110	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s the FBOs’ part.	92	9
201404	1111	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s the arbitrage by the FBOs.	92	9
201404	1112	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Because FBOs can pick up funds anywhere to arbitrage into IOER, it moves very closely with other short-term funding rates.	92	9
201404	1113	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s not as if it has become idiosyncratic.	92	9
201404	1114	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It has not.	92	9
201404	1115	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s still moving closely with other short-term funding rates.	92	9
201404	1116	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	These trades are curious trades, and as Josh described, there are situations in which these trades might become much less frequent and the rate could become much more idiosyncratic.	92	9
201404	1117	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But, for example, if you moved to a broader overnight bank funding rate that included Eurodollar transactions and these fed funds transactions, I don’t think that mix of transactions would look particularly peculiar.	92	9
201404	1118	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if you generalize it, I agree, but if you were to just use the fed funds rate as what you were focused on, I’m worried it could be very idiosyncratic in a number of instances, and I question whether we want to be highlighting an idiosyncratic rate until we’re more confident about how it’s going to move relative to other rates in the various regimes.	92	9
201404	1119	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So that’s the reason to move to the more robust rate.	92	9
201404	1120	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	92	9
201404	1121	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The interest on excess reserves rate is really what’s driving this, and that’s why it’s got a tight relationship to the other rates.	92	9
201404	1122	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s not because of the target we have for the federal funds rate, obviously, because the Desk hasn’t done any operations for 5½ years.	92	9
201404	1123	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201404	1124	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1125	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	On this issue of the $11 trillion in contracts tied to the fed funds rate, would it be possible to say, or to hazard a guess—if we decide to deemphasize the federal funds rate and we advise people that maybe you shouldn’t be tying your contracts to the federal funds rate, even though we’re going to continue to print it for a while— about how long would it take for those contracts to run off and start being tied to something else?	92	9
201404	1126	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The longest OIS contracts are pretty long.	92	9
201404	1127	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	They’re long?	92	9
201404	1128	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They’re clearing contracts out 30 years.	92	9
201404	1129	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Isn’t there such a thing as renegotiation?	92	9
201404	1130	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They could renegotiate, I agree, but the existing contracts are not short.	92	9
201404	1131	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The futures could be shorter, but that’s a pretty active market.	92	9
201404	1132	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a natural thing that, in the past, because the FOMC has focused on this rate, contracts were tied to this rate.	92	9
201404	1133	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But now we’d be saying that we’re going to phase this out.	92	9
201404	1134	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And then, naturally, the private sector is going to react, and they’re going to tie it to a different rate.	92	9
201404	1135	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	That would be a fine way to go, and it wouldn’t happen immediately, but it would happen over time.	92	9
201404	1136	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Is that a reasonable way to think about it?	92	9
201404	1137	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Otherwise, you’ve got to keep this market alive.	92	9
201404	1138	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	Certainly new contracts would likely migrate to something else, but on the legacy contract issue, your point is well taken.	92	9
201404	1139	2014-04-30	meeting	FROST	There would be renegotiations taking place, but I think that’s where the devil is in the details—how those renegotiations happen.	92	9
201404	1140	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And this is a case in which the long-term framework is reasonably important.	92	9
201404	1141	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Making people migrate contracts to a rate that we then switch from would probably not look too good, if it made them switch twice.	92	9
201404	1142	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	92	9
201404	1143	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Just one more follow-up on this:  We have examples of other central banks that have switched their target rate.	92	9
201404	1144	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So they must have also had this situation in which there were existing contracts based on their previous target rate, and then they switched to repo or something else.	92	9
201404	1145	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	That must have caused a lot of renegotiation in all these contracts.	92	9
201404	1146	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The euro area is an example, in the LIBOR cases we look at.	92	9
201404	1147	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There clearly you had to switch because you went from, let’s say, 18 different countries to one rate, and there they would post the old rates if they were market rates.	92	9
201404	1148	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	You could definitely do that.	92	9
201404	1149	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I do think that other countries are probably less important than the Federal Reserve in their effect on financial markets.	92	9
201404	1150	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, did you have a two-hander?	92	9
201404	1151	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Just a small comment.	92	9
201404	1152	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	In the briefing documents, I learned some of the institutional details about the construction of the effective federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1153	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	No matter what we do, we need to do some work to bring that up to speed with regard to transparency and the relationship we have with the brokers, which I understand is purely voluntary.	92	9
201404	1154	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We don’t have any agreement with them.	92	9
201404	1155	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Over the past year and a half, we’ve been trying to improve that so it will be closer to an IOSCO-compliant rate.	92	9
201404	1156	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’re not there yet.	92	9
201404	1157	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’ve made significant progress.	92	9
201404	1158	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We do have backup data from the FHLBs, as you saw in the fed funds memo.	92	9
201404	1159	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But you’re correct.	92	9
201404	1160	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That is one of the things that we would definitely have to robustify.	92	9
201404	1161	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The FR 2420, which we started collecting at the start of the month, over the next year or so will provide us a pretty good way of producing a more robust overnight rate.	92	9
201404	1162	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Would you switch entirely to that?	92	9
201404	1163	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s still to be decided.	92	9
201404	1164	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think there’s a lot of attractions in doing that because of how the data is collected.	92	9
201404	1165	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So the other path you described that’s taken a year, are there impediments you’ve had?	92	9
201404	1166	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	92	9
201404	1167	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s a voluntary submission by the brokers.	92	9
201404	1168	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We don’t regulate the brokers.	92	9
201404	1169	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If you look through how you make a rate IOSCO compliant, it’s definitely anchored in actual transactions, which is good.	92	9
201404	1170	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But for some of the other governance aspects of how you get oversight in the process and check that what the brokers are sending us is the correct data, it’s going to be harder for us to put that framework in place.	92	9
201404	1171	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I see.	92	9
201404	1172	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So what you’re saying is that you’d have to ask them voluntarily to submit to an oversight regime, and you’re not sure you want to do that?	92	9
201404	1173	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Or you’ve asked and they’ve said “no”?	92	9
201404	1174	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the concerns we had at the time, particularly when this came up last year in regard to LIBOR, is that they might want not to produce the data because of the legal risks they might face.	92	9
201404	1175	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Have you discussed it with them?	92	9
201404	1176	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Have you gotten to that point?	92	9
201404	1177	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We have codified with them in writing what they’re sending to us, and we feel more confident right now that this is going on the right path to be more robust.	92	9
201404	1178	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201404	1179	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’re at the end of the list of questions.	92	9
201404	1180	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would suggest at this point that we take a break for lunch for 25 minutes or half an hour and then come back to begin our round of discussion with respect to the questions.	92	9
201404	1181	2014-04-30	meeting		[Lunch break]	92	9
201404	1182	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we now begin our go-round, and I’d like to start with Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201404	1183	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As the last SOMA manager to miss the target, I thought I’d start.	92	9
201404	1184	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1185	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The staff has done a great deal of really high-quality work.	92	9
201404	1186	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it was very balanced, and I really do appreciate that you got it out in a timely way, so we actually had some time to digest this.	92	9
201404	1187	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	What I want to do is to summarize my own thinking after digesting all of this material.	92	9
201404	1188	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	These remarks are going to be tentative, and I emphasize the word “tentative” for two reasons.	92	9
201404	1189	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	One, I think we’re going to learn a lot more as we continue with the testing program and as we start to go down this path, and, two, I don’t think I have all of this figured out.	92	9
201404	1190	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As the discussion earlier today made clear, there are a lot of complicated tradeoffs here, and deciding exactly where you strike the balance, I think, is very difficult.	92	9
201404	1191	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I also want to hear what all of you say because I’m sure there are things that I haven’t thought of that you’re going to point out to me, and that are going to change my own thinking about where that balance should be struck.	92	9
201404	1192	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In thinking about the appropriate monetary policy framework over the next few years, I think it’s important to start with what our key objectives are and then look at the potential tradeoffs between those objectives.	92	9
201404	1193	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Once you have the objectives well specified, then it’s easier to see how one formulation might be better or worse relative to achieving the objectives or how you could make adjustments to minimize the cost of those potential tradeoffs.	92	9
201404	1194	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, I would frame the issue slightly differently than the staff in the sense that I think there’s one main goal and then there are four subsidiary goals.	92	9
201404	1195	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The staff, I think, had six goals overall.	92	9
201404	1196	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I only have five.	92	9
201404	1197	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I combined two of theirs into one of mine.	92	9
201404	1198	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The main goal—and this is the thing that I think we really want to stress as we go through this discussion—has to be good control over money market rates, both in fact and in terms of market participants’ expectations.	92	9
201404	1199	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I add that second piece about expectations because the expectations that our proposal will work well might be important in the early stages to keep inflation expectations well anchored before we actually demonstrate that we do have control in fact.	92	9
201404	1200	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s important that it’s not only good control in fact, but also expectations of good control as we’re rolling this out.	92	9
201404	1201	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, control over money market rates has to be the most important objective because it’s most directly relevant to how monetary policy can be used most efficiently to achieve our dual- mandate objectives.	92	9
201404	1202	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So the focus should be on how we achieve the tightest linkage between our policy instruments onward to financial conditions and the ultimate outcomes that we seek in the real economy.	92	9
201404	1203	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Greater control implies less volatility and risk, and that should be consistent with a more efficient system of financial intermediation.	92	9
201404	1204	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think we have to be very careful not to lose sight of the fact that the instruments of monetary policy and the monetary policy framework itself are means to an end, generating a desired set of financial conditions to achieve our dual-mandate objectives, rather than the ends in themselves.	92	9
201404	1205	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Beyond this main goal of control, I think there are a number of other subsidiary considerations, and I may not have thought of all of them, but the ones that strike me as the most important are:  First of all, we want a regime that’s most consistent with financial stability.	92	9
201404	1206	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that, in this respect, reliance on the overnight RRP facility is tricky.	92	9
201404	1207	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Does it add to financial stability, or does it diminish financial stability?	92	9
201404	1208	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We already had a discussion on this, President Lacker and I and others.	92	9
201404	1209	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, it would seem useful to have an elastic facility that would provide safe assets in the time of crisis.	92	9
201404	1210	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This would seem to be utility- enhancing to those who are seeking to increase their holdings of safe assets.	92	9
201404	1211	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s the positive of the overnight reverse repo agreements in terms of financial stability.	92	9
201404	1212	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, though, availability of such an asset might during times of crisis tend to tighten financial conditions as money flowed into the RRP facility from less-safe short-term assets.	92	9
201404	1213	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As we discussed, this could be ameliorated by cutting the target interest rate or adding liquidity by other means.	92	9
201404	1214	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, we could address how elastic the RRP facility is in times of crisis by putting caps on usage, which we also discussed earlier.	92	9
201404	1215	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second subsidiary concern, I think, is minimizing changes to market structure and practices.	92	9
201404	1216	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason to put weight on this goal is that there are transition costs to any new institutional framework, and these costs are likely to be higher if the transition is deemed likely to be temporary rather than permanent, because then there will be two transitions rather than one.	92	9
201404	1217	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	One important aspect in terms of the issue of changes to market structure and practices is the question of the federal funds rate as the FOMC’s target.	92	9
201404	1218	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If the FOMC placed a heavy reliance on the overnight RRP facility, this might further undermine the stability and reliability of the federal funds rate, and that’s a potential cost that needs to be considered and evaluated.	92	9
201404	1219	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	A third consideration is minimizing the interest costs to the Fed to achieve a given set of financial conditions.	92	9
201404	1220	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We didn’t really discuss that up to this point.	92	9
201404	1221	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, if the term deposit facilities and the term RRP facility drive up the Fed’s interest expense compared with the expense under an overnight RRP facility, this argues for relying more on the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	1222	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s say the RRP facility is 10 basis points cheaper than term deposits.	92	9
201404	1223	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That doesn’t sound like very much, but we have $3 trillion of reserves outstanding.	92	9
201404	1224	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s $1 billion dollars per 10 basis points per trillion.	92	9
201404	1225	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	A billion dollars a year is real money.	92	9
201404	1226	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we should put at least some weight on that goal.	92	9
201404	1227	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t want to go to the Congress and explain why we didn’t care about $1 billion in our decision.	92	9
201404	1228	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth issue is minimizing the amount of disintermediation activity that occurs outside the core banking system.	92	9
201404	1229	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there’s a residual discomfort with encouraging a lot of disintermediation flows.	92	9
201404	1230	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I have to say I’m not really sure how much weight I want to put on this goal, but I do accept that, everything else equal, I probably prefer the money coming from the banks to us rather than through money market funds to us.	92	9
201404	1231	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s just hard to know why I feel that way, exactly, and how high a cost I put on that.	92	9
201404	1232	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the case for eliminating these flows through the money market funds is also enhanced if you expect to move back to a system with a smaller balance sheet, so that these flows from money market funds would turn out to be temporary rather than permanent.	92	9
201404	1233	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Say we make the overnight RRP facility with a very narrow spread, so we got a lot of take-up, but then we knew we were going to go back to a much smaller balance sheet in the future—it seems to me we would be generating a set of institutional changes for a few years that we were then going to ultimately undo in the longer term.	92	9
201404	1234	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And so that might be relevant to how we think about this.	92	9
201404	1235	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So how do I balance out all of these objectives, which often conflict?	92	9
201404	1236	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	On balance, my initial bias is to rely on the overnight RRP facility, subject to there being no big surprises from our testing, to set a floor under money market rates, and then to take steps to lessen the negative subsidiary cost from relying on the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	1237	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I favor relying on the overnight RRP facility because I think that’s the best tool to maximize our control over money market rates at the lowest cost.	92	9
201404	1238	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So far the tests have shown that this facility puts a firm but not ironclad floor under money market rates, and that it saves money relative to the IOER because it’s set at a lower level.	92	9
201404	1239	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, for term deposits and term RP, we would pay up more, but it’s not obvious to me what the benefit of us paying more is.	92	9
201404	1240	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re locking up reserves for longer periods of time at higher rates—that doesn’t have any value to us.	92	9
201404	1241	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the only benefit from a term deposit facility is that we get to show that there are fewer excess reserves in the banking system.	92	9
201404	1242	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But this seems to me mostly an accounting convention rather than substantive, because term deposits and overnight reserves must be very close substitutes.	92	9
201404	1243	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If they’re not close substitutes, then we have to really pay up to generate them moving from one to the other.	92	9
201404	1244	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The other advantage, of course, of the overnight RRP facility is that the governance would lie clearly within the province of the FOMC, and that may be a consideration for some.	92	9
201404	1245	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So what about the costs associated with relying on the overnight RRP facility?	92	9
201404	1246	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think these can be addressed in a number of ways.	92	9
201404	1247	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	First, if one’s worried about the potential degree of disintermediation out of the banking system, then the overnight RRP rate can be offered at a spread below the IOER rate, with the spread set at the level that best trades off control against the amount of desired disintermediation.	92	9
201404	1248	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, with a spread between the overnight RRP and IOER rates, existing money market rates would tend to trade mainly between the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate, and I think this has the advantage of being consistent with how we’ve been conducting policy to date—with the money market rates trading generally between 0 and 25 basis points—so this would reduce the communications difficulties associated with liftoff.	92	9
201404	1249	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If the overnight RRP rate were set equal to the IOER rate, then the federal funds rate would likely trade above the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1250	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would be hard to communicate that shift.	92	9
201404	1251	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So what would the spread be?	92	9
201404	1252	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There was a lot of discussion earlier about what the right spread is.	92	9
201404	1253	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think we know what the right spread is today.	92	9
201404	1254	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This is something that we could decide after gaining more experience with this tool.	92	9
201404	1255	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably it would be somewhat narrower than the current spread of 20 basis points, because the current spread results in a very low take- up of the overnight RRP—at only about the $180 billion mark that you cited as the high point for non-quarter-end and non-year-end periods.	92	9
201404	1256	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s about 7 or 8 percent of the total reserves outstanding.	92	9
201404	1257	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So you would probably want it at a somewhat narrower spread than that.	92	9
201404	1258	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But the current spread could work just fine if we want to place more weight on not having a large amount of disintermediation.	92	9
201404	1259	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s really a question of whether we think we would have adequate control at a 20 basis point spread between the RRP rate and the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1260	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My view is that we shouldn’t decide today what the spread should be.	92	9
201404	1261	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We should be deciding what kind of outcome we want in terms of the amount of disintermediation and the amount of control, and then we should set the spread most consistent with that set of objectives, because we don’t really know the answer a priori.	92	9
201404	1262	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I would prefer that the discussion be about what outcomes we want, and then we find the rates that generate those outcomes, rather than that we discuss today what spread we want, not knowing what outcomes that spread would actually generate.	92	9
201404	1263	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, if one’s worried about the financial-stability risk of an overnight RRP facility, I think the staff has made it very clear that one could address this by imposing a cap.	92	9
201404	1264	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The cap wouldn’t be binding during normal periods but would limit the volume of inflows during periods of market turbulence and stress.	92	9
201404	1265	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this cap could be an aggregate cap or it could be per counterparty.	92	9
201404	1266	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I am a little bit biased toward the limit on the counterparty because I think it means that you don’t have to submit a schedule of rates that you’re willing to take.	92	9
201404	1267	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You just say, “This is how much I want and this is how much I get.”	92	9
201404	1268	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It also allows the counterparties to plan.	92	9
201404	1269	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	They’d know exactly how much capacity they would get in a crisis situation.	92	9
201404	1270	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t feel strongly about that choice.	92	9
201404	1271	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The third thing I would say is that I would not rule out any option on the basis of transition costs, especially as there are steps that we could take to minimize those costs.	92	9
201404	1272	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So take the federal funds rate as an example.	92	9
201404	1273	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We have two issues with the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1274	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first issue is, if our decisions on the monetary policy framework impair the federal funds rate, what happens to all the outstanding contracts that reference the effective federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1275	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And the second question we have is whether the federal funds rate is the right rate for monetary policy to target.	92	9
201404	1276	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I think the staff has made it pretty clear that the federal funds rate right now is pretty fragile.	92	9
201404	1277	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The federal funds market is not very big, and it’s not very deep.	92	9
201404	1278	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The calculated rates rest mainly on the activity of the Federal Home Loan Banks.	92	9
201404	1279	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So my own view is that it would be better to address the federal funds rate problem independent of the decisions we make on the monetary policy framework, rather than hold the monetary policy framework decision hostage trying to keep the sickly federal funds rate market alive.	92	9
201404	1280	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So my preference would be to assess whether we could fix the federal funds rate by redefining the federal funds rate as representing banks’ overnight wholesale borrowing, including overnight Eurodollar transactions.	92	9
201404	1281	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Initially we could do this by relying on the broker data—there are broker data for both overnight Eurodollar transactions and the federal funds rate—if we needed to do this quickly, and then over the longer run we could use the FR 2420 data to do this.	92	9
201404	1282	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My understanding is that if we defined the federal funds rate as this rate, it would be very close to the current federal funds rate—within less than 1 basis point over the past few years—and I think that the risk of contract frustration in this case would be de minimis.	92	9
201404	1283	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The rate would almost be the same rate.	92	9
201404	1284	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The changes that have happened to the federal funds market over the past few years would be far greater than what this change would represent in terms of what rates people would actually be receiving and paying.	92	9
201404	1285	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to what should be the target rate in the new regime, I think you could either switch to an overnight RRP–IOER corridor or you could continue to target the new, improved federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1286	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Targeting the old, sickly federal funds rate is not something that I would suggest is appropriate.	92	9
201404	1287	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as the federal funds rate does not behave idiosyncratically and erratically, I think it would be okay to target the federal funds rate in this formulation.	92	9
201404	1288	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Then the overnight RRP facility would just be a tool to manage the federal funds rate objective.	92	9
201404	1289	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the federal funds rate turned out to be idiosyncratic—jumping around, into and out of the range— then I think you’d want to reexamine that conclusion because you don’t really want to be moving the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate around to capture wherever the federal funds rate is moving if the funds rate is moving independent of other money market rates.	92	9
201404	1290	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	For the longer term, I don’t see the decisions we make about our monetary policy framework over the next six months as ruling anything in or out.	92	9
201404	1291	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is we’re going to have to conduct monetary policy with a very large balance sheet for quite a while.	92	9
201404	1292	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So my view is, why not pick the most effective regime for that period, learn by doing, and have that drive the ultimate decision about the long-term framework—a decision that won’t be made until much later and probably by very few, if any, of the people in this room.	92	9
201404	1293	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I admit that I do see the attractions of a floor system for the longer term because it’s easier to implement.	92	9
201404	1294	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s no need to add or drain reserves each day.	92	9
201404	1295	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Shifts in money demand show up in quantities, not price, so there’s less short-term interest rate volatility.	92	9
201404	1296	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And a floor system may, by supplying more safe liabilities to the financial system, add grease to the payment system and enhance liquidity.	92	9
201404	1297	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’m completely happy to defer discussion about where we’re going to go in the longer term to future Committees.	92	9
201404	1298	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I am confident that if we did use the overnight RRP–IOER rate corridor for several years, it would still be relatively easy to move back to an old corridor-style system with limited reserves.	92	9
201404	1299	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As the balance sheet normalized, the overnight-RRP-to-IOER spread could be allowed to widen, where the cap on RRP usage could be lowered, and as you did that you could just gradually move back to a corridor regime.	92	9
201404	1300	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Summing up, how does this translate into the seven questions posed by the staff?	92	9
201404	1301	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The first question was, should the Committee continue to target the federal funds rate?	92	9
201404	1302	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m agnostic about whether the funds rate should be targeted or not as long as the funds rate is stable and not idiosyncratic.	92	9
201404	1303	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If it’s idiosyncratic, I don’t want to target the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1304	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the important decision is that we need to fix the federal funds rate so that it’s robust to whatever decisions we make with respect to monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1305	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So the second question is, if we shifted away from the federal funds rate, what would I prefer?	92	9
201404	1306	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I strongly prefer to fix the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1307	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what I’m for.	92	9
201404	1308	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, what do I think about relying on the overnight RRP facility?	92	9
201404	1309	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, as I made pretty clear, I think the overnight RRP and the IOER rates in tandem, with a spread, is an attractive option, and how wide that spread is depends on how much take-up we want for the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	1310	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth question was, how much divergence do we think would be acceptable between the targeted rate and the IOER rate, and how much volatility would be acceptable?	92	9
201404	1311	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the issue is so much about divergence.	92	9
201404	1312	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really about control and volatility.	92	9
201404	1313	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you told me that the divergence was 20 basis points but it was really stable at 20 basis points, I would find that completely acceptable.	92	9
201404	1314	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really more of a question of how much you’re moving around, because if you’re moving around a lot, then you’re probably losing control over financial market conditions.	92	9
201404	1315	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as volatility is contained within a range, that’s certainly adequate control in my opinion.	92	9
201404	1316	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think you need much greater control than, say, 10 basis points because, you know, look at how monetary policy has been conducted for a long time.	92	9
201404	1317	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We move the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments.	92	9
201404	1318	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s sort of hard to argue why you need greater control than 10 basis points.	92	9
201404	1319	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You change the monetary policy setting in much greater increments.	92	9
201404	1320	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The question on higher net interest expense, I think it’s a definite negative.	92	9
201404	1321	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think if you’re going to spend more, you’ve got to justify what you’re getting in exchange for that additional expense.	92	9
201404	1322	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So if we’re spending $1 billion more per year, I want to know what I’m getting for that.	92	9
201404	1323	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The sixth question was, given the testing that’s been done to date, what should we eliminate?	92	9
201404	1324	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I would eliminate options 1 and 5, probably 4 as well.	92	9
201404	1325	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Right now, I sort of land between 2 and 3.	92	9
201404	1326	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do support further testing.	92	9
201404	1327	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	While we’re still buying assets, I think we can test with very low risk that market participants will misconstrue this as foreshadowing liftoff.	92	9
201404	1328	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Seven, I don’t really favor using the term deposit accounts and term RRPs as draining tools, but I’m perfectly happy to do the test to see how they work and to see how much the take- up is for the term deposit accounts—the elasticity of demand with respect to changes in interest rates.	92	9
201404	1329	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1330	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1331	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201404	1332	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1333	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Let me begin by thanking the staff for a marvelous set of memos.	92	9
201404	1334	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They were very informative about the mechanics of controlling short- term interest rates.	92	9
201404	1335	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I particularly like memo 4, on alternative interest rate targets.	92	9
201404	1336	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It reminds us that in the past the FOMC implemented policy by managing “the general level of interest rates,” and that no particular interest rate is etched in stone as the only appropriate target instrument.	92	9
201404	1337	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It also shows how the process by which we came to adopt the effective federal funds rate was an evolutionary one.	92	9
201404	1338	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Sometime in the 1980s, it just evolved as the conduct of policy evolved.	92	9
201404	1339	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, the FOMC over that period managed successfully to set monetary policy on a course that led to a long period of low and stable inflation.	92	9
201404	1340	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The memo lays out a number of overnight interest rates the Committee might target, recognizing that each is subject to its own shocks.	92	9
201404	1341	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But, nevertheless, it is striking how closely the various overnight interest rates track each other over time.	92	9
201404	1342	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The memo also notes that monetary policy arguably works best not through overnight rates directly, but through their effect on medium-term interest rates, and I think this is important to keep in view as we discuss these issues.	92	9
201404	1343	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So the expected path of overnight rates over an intermediate horizon is more important than the level of overnight interest rates on any given day.	92	9
201404	1344	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And because of this, in the past we have conducted policy in a way that has tried to make the federal funds rate target persistent and changes persistent and predictable, even though the effective rate could be volatile, to a great degree, from one day to another.	92	9
201404	1345	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So with this as background, my working hypothesis is that day-to-day variation in the spreads between various overnight interest rates is of secondary importance for the conduct of monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1346	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This is consistent with our experience prior to the crisis, when the spread between the effective federal funds rate and the overnight repo rate was quite volatile.	92	9
201404	1347	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For example, from 1991 to 2006, the spread was below negative 19 basis points 10 percent of the time and above positive 15 basis points 10 percent of the time.	92	9
201404	1348	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And that did not appear to cause any problems for the implementation of monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1349	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t recall it being remarked upon at the time or the Committee considering any steps to try to address that issue.	92	9
201404	1350	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, when we raised the federal funds rate target under our previous operating regime, we were very confident that a wide array of short-term market interest rates would fall in line.	92	9
201404	1351	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That confidence rested on experience, but it also rested importantly on the logic of arbitrage by market participants.	92	9
201404	1352	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So the question is, can we have confidence that arbitrage will similarly limit variation in spreads between overnight money market rates in our current regime?	92	9
201404	1353	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	My sense now is that we can.	92	9
201404	1354	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Many large domestic banks are ideally positioned to carry out this arbitrage.	92	9
201404	1355	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They have substantial portfolios of unencumbered, high-quality assets.	92	9
201404	1356	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They can use these as collateral to borrow in the RP market and leave the proceeds on deposit with their friendly local Reserve Bank.	92	9
201404	1357	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For sure, there are incremental costs associated with this arbitrage—for example, the FDIC insurance premium and the shadow cost associated with the leverage ratio.	92	9
201404	1358	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But these are finite and relatively well defined.	92	9
201404	1359	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They don’t seem likely to vary with the level of interest rates, and so it doesn’t strike me as likely those spreads are going to widen as we raise interest rates.	92	9
201404	1360	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I think they are likely to remain stable, and I think they are likely to be what pins down the general relationship between market rates and the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1361	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Conversations my examiner staff had with a large bank in our District indicate that, for them, there is a breakeven spread between the overnight RP rate and the interest rate on excess reserves, and it’s about 15 basis points.	92	9
201404	1362	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So at a repo rate of less than 10 basis points, this large bank would find it very profitable to borrow in the RP market in order to earn the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1363	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It turns out they used to do this trade in large amounts, but they don’t anymore, and they don’t because of supervisory pressure.	92	9
201404	1364	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Over the past several years, the System has been discouraging banks from engaging in so-called matched-book repo trades in which they borrow in the overnight RP market and lend, sometimes at term, in the form of reverse RPs to enable their private-sector clients to fund asset positions.	92	9
201404	1365	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	These operations involve counterparty risk and maturity transformation, and, thus, our supervisors rightly discourage them.	92	9
201404	1366	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But this discouragement seems to have been taken by examiners in the field and by the banks themselves as applying more broadly to arbitraging the RP market and the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1367	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, it’s not clear that this makes any sense at all, because counterparty risk on Federal Reserve Bank deposits is, arguably, negligible.	92	9
201404	1368	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And if the bank lost access to RP funding, then its Fed deposit would simply roll off, and that would be the end of it—there wouldn’t be any other damage.	92	9
201404	1369	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m not aware of any serious discussion about this at the System level.	92	9
201404	1370	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There could have been some discussions I wasn’t privy to.	92	9
201404	1371	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But as part of our learning process this summer, I think we should be talking about this, because we might have inadvertently discouraged some arbitrage that would make economic sense and would help us implement monetary policy more effectively.	92	9
201404	1372	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	In any event, absent this supervisory consideration, it looks as if the fundamentals are consistent with a spread in the neighborhood of 15 basis points, and that is something I think we surely could live with.	92	9
201404	1373	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	As Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out, it’s a large spread, historically speaking.	92	9
201404	1374	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But if it doesn’t vary much, I think that that would be a perfectly suitable mechanism to rely on.	92	9
201404	1375	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Because of this, I don’t think we are going to need an overnight reverse RP facility on a routine basis to keep the RP rate moving in line with the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1376	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I just don’t think we are going to need it.	92	9
201404	1377	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So my preferred policy option, as we begin to tighten, would be to rely on the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1378	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We would accompany this by providing a relatively wide target range for interbank rates chosen by the FOMC with the tacit agreement that the Board of Governors would then set the IOER rate at the upper limit of that range.	92	9
201404	1379	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The IOER rate is the most important determinant of the opportunity cost of short-term lending for most banks.	92	9
201404	1380	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We have complete control over it, and I think the policy changes would be easy to communicate in such a framework.	92	9
201404	1381	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I would expect the overnight RP rate to generally trade between 15 and 25 basis points below the IOER rate, depending on how we correct this seemingly perverse supervisory guidance.	92	9
201404	1382	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Movements in short-term interest rates more broadly should closely track movements in the IOER rate, even if there is substantial day-to-day volatility.	92	9
201404	1383	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For influencing the medium- term rates that are important to us, I don’t think that day-to-day volatility is going to cause a problem.	92	9
201404	1384	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, this relies heavily on the expectation that arbitrage of the type I described is going to be effective.	92	9
201404	1385	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I would just point out that we already depend very heavily on the presumption of the forces of arbitrage to keep interest rates on one-month Treasury bills, for example, in line with expected overnight rates, to keep interest rates on two-month Treasury bills in line with expected one-month rates, and so on.	92	9
201404	1386	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So this isn’t some daring foray into mysterious science.	92	9
201404	1387	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This is something that is a part of how we do business around here and have for a long time.	92	9
201404	1388	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And as I’ve tried to probe the staff, I haven’t seen any concrete reason to believe there is going to be an impediment to that arbitrage.	92	9
201404	1389	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Sure, we know about some balance sheet costs that will imply a wedge similar to the wedge between Treasury rates and municipals that people understand, the tax clientele effects.	92	9
201404	1390	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	As President Kocherlakota points out, the financial system is rife with such spreads, but I don’t think they are going to impede our future effectiveness.	92	9
201404	1391	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Now, I can understand that while we all believe arbitrage is important and is likely to keep spreads stable and low, there may be some worrywarts out there with less than 100 percent perfect confidence in this notion.	92	9
201404	1392	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And so we don’t want to be caught flatfooted, if spreads do end up, for some reason we don’t foresee, widening more than we are comfortable with.	92	9
201404	1393	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	One easy way to mitigate that risk would be to maintain the overnight reverse RP facility for a time as a deep backstop—say, 75 to 100 basis points below the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1394	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This would make it analogous to the discount window on the opposite side of the rate.	92	9
201404	1395	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	When we first raise rates, we could keep the overnight RRP rate where it is now and just see what happens.	92	9
201404	1396	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There is a really good chance, I think, market rates are going to rise in tandem with the IOER rate, and we won’t need to intervene actively in the RP market at all.	92	9
201404	1397	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And then we just let that RP facility sit there 75 basis points behind, or whatever it is, and trail.	92	9
201404	1398	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If that doesn’t happen—we should know in a meeting or two, right?	92	9
201404	1399	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It should take a meeting or two to figure this out, and we’ll know whether we have to raise the RP rate or not.	92	9
201404	1400	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And then we can bring this facility into action as an additional tool to manage short-term interest rates.	92	9
201404	1401	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But otherwise, it would be held in reserve as a cheap insurance policy in case of unforeseen developments.	92	9
201404	1402	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So the point here is that we are going to find out pretty quickly whether we need this facility or not.	92	9
201404	1403	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And we don’t need to make a decision now to commit to a permanent, once-and- for-all or for-the-indefinite-period change in our operating procedures.	92	9
201404	1404	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We don’t need to pick the overnight RRP spread to the IOER rate right now, or before we make our first move.	92	9
201404	1405	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We can make a move in the IOER rate and see how it plays out.	92	9
201404	1406	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And if that spread is going to stay under 25 or 30 basis points, we should know in a couple of weeks, but certainly after a meeting or two, and then we could adjust accordingly.	92	9
201404	1407	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Let me emphasize one more thing.	92	9
201404	1408	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If the RP rates become divorced from the IOER rate, the question is whether the IOER rate or the RP rate is in the cul-de-sac.	92	9
201404	1409	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So we wouldn’t need to intervene immediately.	92	9
201404	1410	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If the RP rate became disconnected from the IOER rate and if other market rates rose with the IOER rate, then it’s not clear we should worry about it.	92	9
201404	1411	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s worth keeping in mind.	92	9
201404	1412	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the specific questions posed by the staff, for the first two, I’d support developing a more robustly defined interbank rate along the lines that Vice Chairman Dudley outlined.	92	9
201404	1413	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding question 3, about full allotment, given the IOER rate, I see no need to use the overnight RRP facility on a routine basis.	92	9
201404	1414	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I just don’t think we are going to need it.	92	9
201404	1415	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see a reason now to commit to heavy reliance on it.	92	9
201404	1416	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	When we raise the interest rate on excess reserves, I think we should keep rates where they are now and see how it goes.	92	9
201404	1417	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding question 4, about how large a divergence would be acceptable, I’d be comfortable with a spread that fluctuated as much as 30 or 40 basis points from the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1418	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding question 5, about net interest expense, as long as we have a large balance sheet, I think large interest expenses are inevitable as we raise short-term rates.	92	9
201404	1419	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m uncomfortable with a large balance sheet, for that and many other reasons, but I’m not concerned with the particular form that interest expenses take.	92	9
201404	1420	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding question 6, I would eliminate options that call for a narrow spread between the rate on full-allotment overnight reverse repurchase agreements and IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1421	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I think this would generate large, unpredictable flows back and forth between reserves and overnight RRPs.	92	9
201404	1422	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And the flows might be innocuous, but I don’t think we have a good enough understanding to assert that or rely on it.	92	9
201404	1423	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Regarding question 7, about additional testing, more testing of term deposits seems reasonable, but I’m not hopeful that they are going to prove to be, for reasons Vice Chairman Dudley alluded to, that much different than overnight deposits and, thus, that meaningful a reserve drain.	92	9
201404	1424	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For the overnight reverse repurchase facility, what we really want to know is how the RP–IOER spread behaves in the absence of an active RP facility.	92	9
201404	1425	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s what we really want to learn.	92	9
201404	1426	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I think we’ve learned enough about how this facility works.	92	9
201404	1427	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	What we want to do is find out what happens if we raise the IOER rate and don’t raise this facility rate.	92	9
201404	1428	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t think we need to do any more testing with the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201404	1429	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I would keep the per-counterparty caps unchanged and retain the limit on rates for now.	92	9
201404	1430	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There is some obvious further field research to pursue, and that has to do with whether other large banks that have significant portfolios of unencumbered collateral are positioned to arbitrage RP rates and the IOER rate; what they view as the plausible, breakeven rate at which they would be interested and at which it would be profitable to do that; and whether they feel dissuaded by supervisory guidance relevant to matched-book repo trade and the like.	92	9
201404	1431	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s the kind of further research I’d like to see.	92	9
201404	1432	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1433	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1434	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201404	1435	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1436	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As you may remember, I was raised by Robert Roosa, and so I’m steeped, from back in the ’70s, in the evolution of the operating system from Roosa to Volcker and the continuum on to Potter.	92	9
201404	1437	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So I’m not going to answer the 11 questions or 7 questions or whatever they may be.	92	9
201404	1438	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But I want to basically state some principles because I found today’s discussion immensely illuminating.	92	9
201404	1439	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	This was a bit of a document dump to me, and I appreciate very much the memos, but I think the way we illuminated it now with the discussion, we’re all—at least I’m—much better informed.	92	9
201404	1440	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I appreciate very much the tutorial that you have provided us.	92	9
201404	1441	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m not going to rule out anything at this juncture, although I must say, options 1 and 5 seem the least appealing to me, but I’m not going to signal that at this point, and options 2 and 3′ are seemingly preferable.	92	9
201404	1442	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But I think we need to have some basic principles, and I want to list five that I think we should be mindful of here.	92	9
201404	1443	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The first is that the FOMC’s monetary policy influence should not be diluted.	92	9
201404	1444	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I think the FOMC’s decision should be the main policy influence on the level of short-term rates.	92	9
201404	1445	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The operating system should give us—that is, the FOMC—the tightest possible practicable control over the overnight money market rate.	92	9
201404	1446	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The New York Desk should follow our instructions.	92	9
201404	1447	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	At the same time, I must say that I’m a little uncomfortable in trying to micromanage the New York Desk, and I’m not sure how easy it is going to be to find the right balance.	92	9
201404	1448	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s just a personal insecurity on my part.	92	9
201404	1449	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The second is that I think that whatever operating system we choose—and I mentioned this before—has to be consistent with the eventual normalization of policy implementation, and with the size and composition of the SOMA balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1450	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	By the way, I don’t think we’re going to go back to a small balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1451	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As Mr Lacker said, I wasn’t in favor of one this large, but I think the dynamics have changed in the marketplace and we’re not going to go back to the $900 billion balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1452	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re going to have a substantially larger balance sheet, and, therefore, it is germane that we are focusing on the operating system.	92	9
201404	1453	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	A broader principle is that we need to be sure that the operating system does not heighten financial-stability concerns.	92	9
201404	1454	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The idea of caps on the ON RRP was discussed.	92	9
201404	1455	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, as I said earlier, I think we have to constantly be mindful of the fact that we’re about one-fourth of the short-term funding market.	92	9
201404	1456	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We have to keep that in mind, and we have to make sure we don’t exacerbate any financial instability instincts of the marketplace.	92	9
201404	1457	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And then two very broad principles that are probably obvious to everybody else, but that I feel very strongly about.	92	9
201404	1458	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Narayana, in a way, raised this; I’m going to rephrase it.	92	9
201404	1459	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The operating system should not benefit the few—the FBOs, for example.	92	9
201404	1460	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It always has to be the handmaiden to this Committee’s obligation to work for the benefit of the people and to keep in mind our dual objectives.	92	9
201404	1461	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That may be an obvious point, but I think we have to always bear it in mind, which leads to my last point of principle:  However we handle this, we need to manage the political risk here.	92	9
201404	1462	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	This is why it’s important that we vet this fully during the summer—by the way, I would be in favor of additional discussions, not just at this table, so that we all fully understand where we’re going.	92	9
201404	1463	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Whenever you go through a transition, you raise questions, and it wasn’t very long ago that we were in the Klieg lights and our independence was seriously threatened.	92	9
201404	1464	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t want to raise that risk again.	92	9
201404	1465	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it’s completely settled out of the system, and while no one has mentioned this yet, I think we need to be deeply mindful of the fact that there is political risk here just because we’re changing and we’re evolving.	92	9
201404	1466	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And there’s nothing wrong with evolving.	92	9
201404	1467	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So I would like us to have further discussion on the subject.	92	9
201404	1468	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, coming from a markets background, I’m good at being stale.	92	9
201404	1469	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I did find these memos interesting reading, but until today’s discussion, there were a lot of questions I had that I think needed to be filled in.	92	9
201404	1470	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it would hurt us at all to have some intermediate sessions and tutorials on this subject matter.	92	9
201404	1471	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We have to be absolutely confident in what we’re going to do because we’re going to put you on a stage in September, and I’m serious.	92	9
201404	1472	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	This is a serious matter.	92	9
201404	1473	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Those are my basic principles, and again, I’m leaning toward variations of options 2 or 3, but right now I think we ought to keep as much on the table as we possibly can.	92	9
201404	1474	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1475	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Fisher.	92	9
201404	1476	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201404	1477	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1478	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you very much to the staff for all the memos that you provided.	92	9
201404	1479	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	It certainly has been thought-provoking, and I think this morning’s discussion as well as the memos have probably answered some of our questions and then raised a few more, but thank you very much for that.	92	9
201404	1480	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like Vice Chairman Dudley and President Fisher, I’m starting with some guiding principles and then I’ll answer the questions.	92	9
201404	1481	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first principle, I think, is very similar to theirs.	92	9
201404	1482	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should choose an option in which we are highly confident we’ll be able to raise short-term rates when we view that as appropriate.	92	9
201404	1483	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The reputational risk to the Federal Reserve from adopting a new instrument that does not have the desired relationship with short-term rates would greatly complicate exit strategies.	92	9
201404	1484	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The second one that President Kocherlakota kind of alluded to, which I don’t think was as emphasized in the memos, is that we should remain focused on achieving the appropriate macroeconomic outcomes.	92	9
201404	1485	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	When we choose to tighten policy, we should choose our policy instruments in large part with an eye toward how effectively they influence the broader financial conditions we care most about.	92	9
201404	1486	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, we should realize that we will still be learning by doing, because we have never before had such a large balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1487	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would argue for a cautious approach when we initiate the first tightening, recognizing that the size of the take-up of the reverse repo facility, the volatility of that take-up, and the market reaction to our action are all quite uncertain.	92	9
201404	1488	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I was ready to cross that out if I had gotten a different answer to my question, but it stayed in.	92	9
201404	1489	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The fourth one is that we should remain open to changing our tactics as we learn more about operating with a large balance sheet as the balance sheet evolves.	92	9
201404	1490	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our previous exit principles evolved significantly as our strategies evolved.	92	9
201404	1491	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, an important part of the exit strategy should be an acknowledgment that it may change, not only as economic situations change, but also as we learn from implementing the new policies.	92	9
201404	1492	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fifth, we have used the size and composition of the balance sheet as important tools for generating appropriate macroeconomic outcomes.	92	9
201404	1493	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should maintain the flexibility to continue to use these tools.	92	9
201404	1494	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, sixth, whether or not the federal funds market is robust in the short run seems less important than our ability to effectively influence short-term rates more generally.	92	9
201404	1495	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the questions that were addressed to the Committee—first question, during the period of normalization, I would focus on how effectively our policies raise short-term rates generally rather than focus on the federal funds market.	92	9
201404	1496	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As long as we have a sizable balance sheet, the federal funds market is likely to be somewhat idiosyncratic, and the behavior of the federal funds market will likely be sensitive to the size of the reverse repo facility, which will be quite uncertain with an open allotment.	92	9
201404	1497	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For question two, I would initially focus our discussion on the interest rates we control, the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo rate.	92	9
201404	1498	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because these are new tools, there’s a high degree of uncertainty about how market rates will respond to our setting of these administered rates.	92	9
201404	1499	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once we have some experience with how market rates respond, we should revisit this issue.	92	9
201404	1500	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	On the third question, we should have an open mind about how we utilize the fixed-rate, open-allotment, reverse repo facility in the long run.	92	9
201404	1501	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We may find it to be an effective and important permanent tool depending on what our experience is through the normalization.	92	9
201404	1502	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And for question four, I would initially begin with a very large spread between the reverse repo rate and the interest rate on excess reserves, similar to the spreads we currently see between short-term rates and the interest rate on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1503	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we develop a better understanding of how the size and volatility of the take-up is affected by the spread, we may want to narrow the spread over time.	92	9
201404	1504	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would want to keep the spread large enough to minimize the likelihood of hitting the caps we are likely to need when we set the program.	92	9
201404	1505	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we gain experience with how the size of the take-up is related to risk-on periods and the term structure of interest rates, we’ll be able to determine the appropriate spread.	92	9
201404	1506	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Regarding question five, our focus should remain solidly on achieving appropriate macroeconomic outcomes.	92	9
201404	1507	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Concerns about the financial costs of the various options in terms of the interest cost for the Federal Reserve should remain secondary to concerns about our ability to influence key short-term rates that are linked to households’ and firms’ economic decisions and, thus, to our ability to achieve our fundamental macroeconomic objectives.	92	9
201404	1508	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sixth, while I have an open mind, my preferred options would not be options 1, 4, or 5 during the normalization period.	92	9
201404	1509	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I currently prefer an option somewhat between options 2 and 3, though I could obviously change that preference as we learn more through the next year.	92	9
201404	1510	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I said a moment ago, I would keep an open mind as to the appropriate operating procedure in the long run and wait to make any long-term decisions until we have a better understanding of the normalization process.	92	9
201404	1511	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, for question seven, while it is essential that we do some testing of the reverse repo facility to better understand its effects on short-term interest rates, I would wait to do large- scale testing of the facility until we have finished the taper.	92	9
201404	1512	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	My concern is that such a large-scale testing could be interpreted by market participants as signaling a tightening before we intend to do so.	92	9
201404	1513	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I suggest that at the end of the taper, we gradually raise the reverse repo rate above the current level of the federal funds rate, but still below the IOER rate, possibly up to 10 basis points, to obtain a better understanding of how the facility works.	92	9
201404	1514	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	After that, we might want the first restrictive rate increase to be small.	92	9
201404	1515	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, we could move the interest on excess reserves to 35 basis points, leaving the reverse repo rate at 10 basis points, to obtain a better understanding of the relationship between the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repurchase facility.	92	9
201404	1516	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I would start off pretty tentative, get a better understanding of some of the uncertainties that we still have, and once we learn from doing that, then I would proceed depending on what we learned from that exercise.	92	9
201404	1517	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1518	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201404	1519	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201404	1520	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1521	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, over the intermeeting period it seemed that winter finally arrived on the West Coast in the form of a blizzard of memos.	92	9
201404	1522	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1523	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, I, too, really appreciate the staff’s hard work on these important issues, and I’m actually going to give a principle-free discussion of this topic, and I’m going to answer the questions as part of my discussion.	92	9
201404	1524	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So Simon, you’re going to have to take careful notes.	92	9
201404	1525	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have two bottom-line takeaways.	92	9
201404	1526	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The first is that we should continue to target the federal funds rate, appropriately modified to include the broader set of transactions in the overnight interbank lending market during normalization.	92	9
201404	1527	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the second is that we need a much better understanding of the issues before committing to a longer-run operating framework.	92	9
201404	1528	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think I’ve already heard this said many times.	92	9
201404	1529	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that implies that we should not take any near-term action that forecloses options in the future.	92	9
201404	1530	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to elaborate on each point.	92	9
201404	1531	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, by continuing to use the federal funds rate as our headline policy instrument, we will greatly facilitate policy communication during the normalization period.	92	9
201404	1532	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The federal funds rate may not be perfect and isn’t perfect, but it is familiar, and before we can consider safely shifting to a new instrument, we need further experimentation and a greater understanding of the consequences, both intended and unintended.	92	9
201404	1533	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, the discussion today has made it clear that although we’ve made substantial progress in testing alternative tools, there are still many important unresolved issues.	92	9
201404	1534	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The overnight reverse repo facility has worked fairly well at putting a floor under short-term money market rates, and I support further testing, particularly with an eye toward learning how the reverse repo facility affects the functioning of the interbank lending market.	92	9
201404	1535	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is some worry that the fed funds rate will decouple from other short-term interest rates, potentially in a nonlinear fashion as the reverse repo rate rises toward the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1536	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	That would pose a potential risk to our communications strategy.	92	9
201404	1537	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	More experience with testing that tool can help clarify this risk.	92	9
201404	1538	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	While I’m in favor of additional reverse repo tests, with the goal of using this tool actively during the transition period, I’m inclined to put the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repos on the back burner.	92	9
201404	1539	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repo facility will give us plenty of control over short rates for implementing monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1540	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The term tool should only be needed as a backup to be called upon if our other tools fall short.	92	9
201404	1541	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead over the next couple of years, I’m confident that we will quickly learn to fine-tune our approach once it’s implemented.	92	9
201404	1542	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The control of interest rates will rapidly improve as we gain experience with adjusting interest rates in the context of a large balance sheet and learn to calibrate our procedures appropriately.	92	9
201404	1543	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	One practical path forward would be to continue to set a target range for the fed funds rate using the overnight reverse repo and IOER rates as implementation tools.	92	9
201404	1544	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The calculation of the fed funds rate could obviously be modified to include Eurodollar rates to reduce the sensitivity to idiosyncratic factors, as described in the memo.	92	9
201404	1545	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	With experience, we’ll learn the best procedure for setting the overnight reverse repo and IOER rates or spreads to keep the new, improved fed funds rate near the center of the target range.	92	9
201404	1546	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over time, as our understanding of this new approach improves, we could narrow the target range for the federal funds rate or move back to a single value for the target rate.	92	9
201404	1547	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	My second point is that we don’t need to commit to a long-term operating framework today.	92	9
201404	1548	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The corridor system has served us well in the past.	92	9
201404	1549	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	All short-term interest rates have moved together very closely, especially if you look at them on a monthly-average basis, which is enough for effective policy control.	92	9
201404	1550	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s possible that the floor system could work even better at some point in the fairly distant future, but both the political and financial-stability risks could be sizable.	92	9
201404	1551	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, we’ll be able to gather some useful information on these issues during the transition period over the next several years.	92	9
201404	1552	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, as I said at the start, because we’ll be learning over time, we should not take any near-term action that closes off our options in the future.	92	9
201404	1553	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	To my mind, this rules out the adoption of option 1 and perhaps option 2 because they could irrevocably damage the federal funds market.	92	9
201404	1554	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1555	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1556	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201404	1557	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1558	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Like everyone else, my thanks to the staff for a very impressive spectrum of memos that were very helpful.	92	9
201404	1559	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I thought you framed the discussion well as a starting point in a process of refining the Committee’s approach, laid out the considerations and the tradeoffs, and pointed out the need for further testing, all of which I agree with.	92	9
201404	1560	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Due to the preliminary nature of today’s discussion, I am not going to present hard-and- fast conclusions on the questions raised.	92	9
201404	1561	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Rather, I would like to share how I’m framing my thinking and how I’m leaning on the key tradeoffs.	92	9
201404	1562	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In effect, what I’ll present are my priors ahead of the Q&A discussion that just took place.	92	9
201404	1563	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In reaction to the material in the staff memos, I am organizing my thinking by applying three tests to the five policy implementation approaches.	92	9
201404	1564	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The tests are control of overnight and short-term interest rates, communication ease and effectiveness, and serviceability of the approach over time.	92	9
201404	1565	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me flesh these out a little bit.	92	9
201404	1566	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I favor approaches that seem to convey a high certainty of control over the policy rate and establish a relatively hard floor, especially in the first stages of normalization.	92	9
201404	1567	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The underlying principle is:  Don’t take a lot of risk with FOMC and policy credibility in the beginning.	92	9
201404	1568	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	With regard to communication, I favor approaches that I can envision explaining without excessive contortions, both as an approach and in the particulars of Committee decisions, to both financial practitioners and the general public.	92	9
201404	1569	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	With regard to serviceability over time, the chosen approach should be durable to the extent possible.	92	9
201404	1570	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we can probably preserve needed tactical flexibility or optionality within a scheme that varies the emphasis on tools, as contingencies dictate or conditions change, including the scale of the balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1571	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In that respect, I think it’s important to communicate at the outset that we’re not changing the theoretical framework of policy implementation and that our approach continues the focus on the usual transmission mechanism of influence over a broad array of market rates through direct influence on short-term rates.	92	9
201404	1572	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s possible that the federal funds market might become more viable as a monetary control mechanism as the balance sheet shrinks.	92	9
201404	1573	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It might make sense, in my thinking, to de-emphasize the federal funds rate at the outset, for reasons that are well described in the staff memo, but to try to preserve its functioning with the idea of returning it to a more central role later on.	92	9
201404	1574	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I don’t envision us holding to the centrality of the fed funds rate target in the early stages of normalization.	92	9
201404	1575	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, to get a little bit more specific regarding the options, I lean toward options 1, 2, and 3, versus options 4 and 5.	92	9
201404	1576	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s advisable to establish a hard floor through emphasis on administered-rate setting through the IOER rate and the overnight reverse repo rate.	92	9
201404	1577	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I think there is something to be said for the simplicity of option 1 with the IOER and reverse repo rates equal, as they are basically equivalent assets, but I don’t dismiss the concerns about financial stability.	92	9
201404	1578	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I am inclined to think that some sort of allotment-cap approach might reasonably address this concern.	92	9
201404	1579	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I would like to see further work done on the financial-stability concerns before we decide the very important question of differentiated or equivalent IOER and reverse repo rates.	92	9
201404	1580	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The balance sheet may stay quite large for quite some time, so I’m skeptical about the effectiveness of the term draining tools as a way to exert complete enough direct monetary control.	92	9
201404	1581	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	As I read them, with their reliance on draining operations, options 4 and 5 may present challenges.	92	9
201404	1582	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Longer term, a viable federal funds market that provides a daily market signal of demand for reserves seems to me to be worth preserving.	92	9
201404	1583	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In that sense, option 3 is attractive.	92	9
201404	1584	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The viability of the funds market is a still-open and pivotal question, in my view.	92	9
201404	1585	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	What are the control risks inherent in running a policy with emphasis on a small federal funds market dominated, at least in the beginning, by the Home Loan Banks?	92	9
201404	1586	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Would a policy change by the Home Loan Banks throw a wrench into option 3?	92	9
201404	1587	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Is the control risk associated with trying to maintain the fed funds rate as having a central role worth accepting?	92	9
201404	1588	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I would appreciate more staff work and discussion on these subjects.	92	9
201404	1589	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It does seem to me that the staff has tried to set out distinct options for the sake of discussion, but combinations that involve mixes and matches are feasible.	92	9
201404	1590	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It is not clear to me that some use of the term draining tools could not be in the mix while implementing something like options 1, 2, or 3.	92	9
201404	1591	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	So I do not object to further testing of the Term Deposit Facility.	92	9
201404	1592	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, in response to the exercises presented, I settle mostly on option 2, maybe option 3, with more confidence that the fed funds rate won’t behave idiosyncratically.	92	9
201404	1593	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1594	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1595	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201404	1596	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1597	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to divide my comments into two parts.	92	9
201404	1598	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The first part will be about how the exit strategy is related to the tactical issues discussed in the staff memos, and the second part will be to walk through the questions posed and give my perspective on those questions.	92	9
201404	1599	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s start with relation to the exit strategy.	92	9
201404	1600	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I have advocated in the past a different exit strategy than the one that is outlined in the Committee’s statement of exit principles.	92	9
201404	1601	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, I have suggested that a LIFO exit strategy may be preferable for the Committee.	92	9
201404	1602	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	LIFO means last in, first out.	92	9
201404	1603	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I suggested that the Committee’s more controversial and experimental policies could be reversed first, as they were attempts by the Committee to provide accommodation after the zero lower bound was encountered in December of 2008.	92	9
201404	1604	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, the balance sheet should first be allowed to shrink, but at a carefully controlled pace, and the pace of balance sheet reduction would become, for a time, the primary tool of the Committee, just as the pace of balance sheet expansion is at the present time.	92	9
201404	1605	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Even before revising the size of the balance sheet, LIFO would call for the reversal of the Operation Twist program put in place by the Committee in 2011.	92	9
201404	1606	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The LIFO policy would have the great advantage that the Committee could take action to remove accommodation without raising the policy rate.	92	9
201404	1607	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate could stay much lower for much longer.	92	9
201404	1608	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	At some point in the distant future, under a LIFO approach, the balance sheet would approach a more normal size and further removal of accommodation would have to come from increases in the policy rate.	92	9
201404	1609	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	However, with the balance sheet back to a normal size, the Committee would then be able to resume targeting the federal funds rate, if it so desired, or it could turn to targeting another short-term interest rate, such as the repo rate.	92	9
201404	1610	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But the complications of trying to maintain the large balance sheet and still influence the federal funds rate would be eliminated.	92	9
201404	1611	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	An open question, then, about what we’re talking about today, is what are we doing with balance sheet policy as we are thinking about raising the fed funds rate?	92	9
201404	1612	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Is the balance sheet staying constant, or is it being reduced?	92	9
201404	1613	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If it’s being reduced, isn’t that tightening policy?	92	9
201404	1614	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If it’s not tightening policy, then was balance sheet expansion not easing policy?	92	9
201404	1615	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think there are some logical difficulties with some of what we’re thinking about here in trying to deal with the policy rate issue separately from the balance sheet question.	92	9
201404	1616	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee may wish to reconsider some aspects of the LIFO exit strategy in light of the discussion in the staff memos concerning normalization of a large balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1617	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In general, the LIFO exit strategy has much to commend it in view of the many technical issues the Committee now faces in trying to eventually raise the level of short-term nominal interest rates in the United States.	92	9
201404	1618	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The logic of first returning to our original pre-crisis, pre-unconventional policy situation before eventually attempting policy rate liftoff seems quite compelling to me.	92	9
201404	1619	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If we wish to remain with the current strategy, which calls for attempting to raise the policy rate before any balance sheet reduction has been attempted, then the long list of questions posed at the end of the first staff memo becomes relevant.	92	9
201404	1620	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn to those questions.	92	9
201404	1621	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As a general remark, I think that the questions posed refer to issues that are of only second-order importance relative to the principal macroeconomic issue, which is control or substantial influence over short-term interest rates in the US economy.	92	9
201404	1622	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As the staff memo states, “Policymakers can be confident that they will be able to raise money market rates when the time to do so arrives, and that they will subsequently be able to exercise reasonable control over rates.”	92	9
201404	1623	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	There is, however, one issue that may be of first-order importance, which is the financial- stability question, and I will refer to this question in just a moment.	92	9
201404	1624	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to question 1:  Should the Committee continue to target the federal funds rate during the period of normalization?	92	9
201404	1625	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	With a large balance sheet, I do not think the federal funds rate is a practical option as a target policy rate.	92	9
201404	1626	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds market is essentially meaningless as it exists today.	92	9
201404	1627	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Nor is it likely to gain economic meaning in the medium term.	92	9
201404	1628	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I see it as somewhat detrimental to the Committee’s credibility to claim that it is this particular short-term nominal interest rate that we are most concerned about.	92	9
201404	1629	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I have also been influenced by the arguments that the Committee should try to influence a short-term nominal interest rate with more economic meaning, such as repo, which is decided in a thicker market with many more players trading.	92	9
201404	1630	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I like the following analogy.	92	9
201404	1631	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Suppose we are trying to influence the general price of fruit by intervening in the market for apples.	92	9
201404	1632	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	One way to do this would be to buy apples from, or sell apples to, a particular grocery store at a particular location in the country until the desired level of general fruit prices was obtained.	92	9
201404	1633	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Given the way economic theory works, in principle, by arbitrage this would work to achieve the objective.	92	9
201404	1634	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But in practice, I think it would work much, much better to trade apples with a wide variety of grocery stores across the country.	92	9
201404	1635	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Something similar is going on with repo rates versus the federal funds rate, and to some extent with respect to the interest on excess reserves, which applies only to a limited set of institutions itself.	92	9
201404	1636	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 2.	92	9
201404	1637	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In shifting away from the federal funds rate, would you support the development of a more robust measure of the overnight, unsecured bank funding rate to serve as a target?	92	9
201404	1638	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this may be a difficult road to go down.	92	9
201404	1639	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Suppose we wanted to create an index of three different rates.	92	9
201404	1640	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If the three different rates move in lockstep due to a robust arbitrage environment, there would be nothing to gain from aggregating the three rates.	92	9
201404	1641	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But if the strength of arbitrage were variable among the three rates, then the changes in the strength of arbitrage would show up as variability in the index, creating an undesirable barometer of the stance of policy.	92	9
201404	1642	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The index may move because the strength of arbitrage has changed and not because the policy stance has changed.	92	9
201404	1643	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	For these reasons, I think that the creation of such an index may be problematic.	92	9
201404	1644	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	On the sub-question of “an administered rate versus a market rate,” my staff questioned the meaning of these terms.	92	9
201404	1645	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	We should be thinking in terms of the policy rule associated with a particular rate—that is, how the rate will be adjusted in reaction to economic developments—not whether we can label a particular rule as a market rate or as an administered rate.	92	9
201404	1646	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	My staff said that a Taylor rule is really an administered rate—or is it a market rate?—because you are setting the target in reaction to developments in the economy, and that is informing the equilibrium of the economy.	92	9
201404	1647	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So they found this distinction to be moot.	92	9
201404	1648	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 3.	92	9
201404	1649	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Are you supportive of a fixed-rate, full-allotment, overnight RRP facility?	92	9
201404	1650	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m generally supportive, although I’m anxious to hear the views of others on the Committee.	92	9
201404	1651	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I like the arguments about broader coverage, as I just mentioned.	92	9
201404	1652	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I see the IOER as covering an increasingly narrow segment of the US financial intermediation sector, as President Fisher was talking about earlier today.	92	9
201404	1653	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I will consider arguments about the appropriate spread, but in general, I think the spread of zero would be a good place to start.	92	9
201404	1654	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	That would be option 1.	92	9
201404	1655	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And then we could use caps if we are concerned about the uptake issue.	92	9
201404	1656	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I think if repo came to be seen as the main focus of policy, FOMC communication would be sharp and effective.	92	9
201404	1657	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	There would be little doubt in the markets about where the FOMC stands.	92	9
201404	1658	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 4.	92	9
201404	1659	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	How much of a divergence between the IOER rate and the federal funds rate should be allowed?	92	9
201404	1660	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I saw this as a second-order issue if the federal funds rate is not a meaningful rate.	92	9
201404	1661	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	We should be thinking in terms of reducing focus on the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1662	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 5.	92	9
201404	1663	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Large net interest expense may be associated with some options.	92	9
201404	1664	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	How comfortable are you with this?	92	9
201404	1665	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I’m definitely not comfortable with the expense aspect of several of the options.	92	9
201404	1666	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I would like sharper estimates of these costs.	92	9
201404	1667	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Because I am willing to simply sell assets, if necessary, I question the idea of incurring substantial costs in order to be able to keep the large balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1668	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If it is expensive to keep the large balance sheet, why keep it?	92	9
201404	1669	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Question 6.	92	9
201404	1670	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If all approaches work equally well, which would you prefer?	92	9
201404	1671	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If they all work equally well, one differentiator between the various approaches may be the financial- stability issue.	92	9
201404	1672	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I have already mentioned that this is a first-order concern for the Committee.	92	9
201404	1673	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I certainly agree that we do not want to be encouraging or exacerbating financial instability through the adoption of an operating regime during the normalization process for monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1674	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	However, I see existing theories and ideas on this matter as insufficiently developed to give us clear guidance as to whether a particular operating regime during the normalization process is likely to enhance or reduce the probability of entering into a financial crisis in the future.	92	9
201404	1675	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In such theories, much would depend on other actions the Federal Reserve might take to reduce the probability of a crisis or to mitigate a crisis once one develops, quite apart from the choice of a temporary operating regime itself.	92	9
201404	1676	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is that we should not make choices on operating regimes based on the possible implications for financial stability, even though this is a first-order concern for the Committee generally.	92	9
201404	1677	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And finally, on question 7, additional testing.	92	9
201404	1678	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In general, I am comfortable with additional testing as suggested in the memos.	92	9
201404	1679	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1680	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Bullard.	92	9
201404	1681	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201404	1682	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1683	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Like everyone else, I want to thank the staff for the outstanding memos.	92	9
201404	1684	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It was a lot of reading, but they were very informative and useful.	92	9
201404	1685	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And thanks to you, Madam Chair, for our discussion this morning; I thought it was a great opportunity to have people talk about a lot of different things.	92	9
201404	1686	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I thought it was very helpful and a productive session.	92	9
201404	1687	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	As I said last meeting, my gut reaction tells me that it’s very hard to talk about tactical adjustments when we don’t know where we’re going.	92	9
201404	1688	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I used the phrase “Yogi Berra” last time, when I said that you’ve got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going because you might end up somewhere else.	92	9
201404	1689	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think we have to be careful about that, but, unfortunately, it’s pretty clear that the Committee isn’t ready to make that kind of long-run decision about where we end up, and I understand that.	92	9
201404	1690	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So that means my guiding principle in the meantime, much as I think Vice Chairman Dudley suggested, is that as we decide among these options on the table, we don’t want to pick options for the near-term tactical decisions that would preclude our options in the future.	92	9
201404	1691	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So we need to keep our options available to us.	92	9
201404	1692	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think our goal today should be to try to eliminate some of the options that have limited support, so we can focus more exclusively on those that are feasible and perhaps promising and do more study on those.	92	9
201404	1693	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I will give my own preference for the long run.	92	9
201404	1694	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My own long-run preference is for us to return to something that looks like a corridor operating framework, with some market or interbank interest rate as our target in the corridor, and with the Federal Reserve holding a relatively small portfolio comprised mostly of short-term Treasuries.	92	9
201404	1695	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	This framework is consistent with the exit strategy principles we laid out in June 2011.	92	9
201404	1696	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I don’t really favor any option in the short run that would preclude us getting to that as our long-run operating arrangement, because as I said, that sort of corridor system worked well for us in the past.	92	9
201404	1697	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes, during the crisis and with our large balance sheet, things have changed.	92	9
201404	1698	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But there is no reason that that system couldn’t work well for us in the future as the balance sheet shrinks.	92	9
201404	1699	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the other thing to keep in mind is that, as President Lacker made clear, monetary policy is more than just control over the precision of the short-term interest rate.	92	9
201404	1700	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Monetary policy decisions tend to look like a path of interest rates, and so we could become too obsessed with movements in the short-run rate, if we’re not careful, and let that guide our decision.	92	9
201404	1701	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to keep that in mind; that was a good caution on his part.	92	9
201404	1702	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	With these caveats in mind, my own assessment is that I rule out option 1, which involves a full-allotment, overnight reverse repo facility rate that equals the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1703	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Even if we choose to rule out option 1 now as a tactical step in the short run, it doesn’t preclude us moving back to that sometime later if we decide that some of our options that we do pursue turn out to be less attractive for one reason or another.	92	9
201404	1704	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet if we adopt option 1 now, we may eviscerate the interbank lending markets, whether it be the federal funds market or other interbank lending markets, to the point that it would be hard to go back to them once we started targeting an administered rate.	92	9
201404	1705	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It would be hard to go back to a market rate.	92	9
201404	1706	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think going with option 1 now does not preserve our options in an attractive way to me.	92	9
201404	1707	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I am concerned about some of the financial-stability issues that were raised about option 1 and the implications that facility might have.	92	9
201404	1708	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	During a period of financial stress, a run of investors in the market to this facility seems like a real possibility that could create serious funding issues for some borrowers.	92	9
201404	1709	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	More generally, I am not entirely convinced that the Federal Reserve should be the market’s primary supplier, maybe even its sole supplier, of risk-free overnight assets other than currency.	92	9
201404	1710	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That is a big step, from supplying currency, to every other sort of risk-free asset that might be created.	92	9
201404	1711	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And to make that argument simply on financial-stability grounds—that it makes it easier, as President Kocherlakota said, to do some things—I think we’d probably do those things anyway, and we’d figure out other ways to supply liquidity if we needed to.	92	9
201404	1712	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The other thing that worries me a little bit in some of our discussions is some of the political risk, given the sizable expansion of our dealings with non-bank institutions that is required in these markets, such as money market mutual funds.	92	9
201404	1713	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’d like to understand the consequences of that more broadly.	92	9
201404	1714	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m concerned about the implicit scale of these operations in a full-allotment system and the potential unintended consequences on the plumbing for the short- term money market.	92	9
201404	1715	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think there are just a lot of ramifications we probably don’t understand as of yet.	92	9
201404	1716	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have similar concerns about option 2, which is a lot like option 1, except with a very narrow spread below the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1717	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I kind of rule out option 2.	92	9
201404	1718	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That leaves me with options 3, 4, and 5.	92	9
201404	1719	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Options 3 and 4 set an overnight rate of reverse repos far enough below the IOER rate to preserve the federal funds market or perhaps another interbank market of some kind.	92	9
201404	1720	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that’s something reasonable to explore.	92	9
201404	1721	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Option 4 adds term deposits and term reverse repos.	92	9
201404	1722	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Option 5 relies on other term tools as well.	92	9
201404	1723	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I have to confess, I’m a little nervous with the term instruments.	92	9
201404	1724	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I would really prefer to stick with a market rate in overnight interbank markets or a reverse repo type-rate.	92	9
201404	1725	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Therefore, I have a little more attraction to options 3 and 4 than to 5.	92	9
201404	1726	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	As I said, I am open to redefining the federal funds rate or how we define the interbank market rate.	92	9
201404	1727	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m open to different ways of thinking about that, whether it be Eurodollars or some other construct.	92	9
201404	1728	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But I’d like to know more about the types of traders in this market.	92	9
201404	1729	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What’s the scale of it?	92	9
201404	1730	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	How much would we have to intervene?	92	9
201404	1731	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What would the size of our balance sheet have to be in order to effectively function in that market?	92	9
201404	1732	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Can we identify trades by different types of traders?	92	9
201404	1733	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The staff acknowledges that there are some legal ramifications here to redefining the fed funds rate.	92	9
201404	1734	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We talked about those.	92	9
201404	1735	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we can get over those in a reasonable manner.	92	9
201404	1736	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The Federal Reserve and other regulators have raised serious concerns about money market mutual funds.	92	9
201404	1737	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And yet, as we broaden our definition of the market rate or administered rate and the counterparties we have to deal with, we are beginning to rely on money market mutual funds as the primary transmission mechanism of monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1738	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Can we square our two views of regulation of money market mutual funds with using them as our primary transmission mechanism?	92	9
201404	1739	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t know the answer to that, but I think it’s something we should give some thought.	92	9
201404	1740	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	More generally, I’d like to know more about the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet under each of these options, in terms of its size and its composition in terms of short-term versus long-term assets that would be implied.	92	9
201404	1741	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What would be the path of remittances?	92	9
201404	1742	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I do have concerns about the Federal Reserve’s exposure to interest rate risk under some of these options and what it entails for our remittances.	92	9
201404	1743	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think we could be exposing ourselves to considerable political risk in this process.	92	9
201404	1744	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, I found all the memos a bit strange in that the reason we are engaged in this activity is that we have created a very large balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1745	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I mean, we did it, and so we are dealing with those issues, and in all of these memos we didn’t talk about what’s happening to the balance sheet and how it would be affected and how we want to manage that.	92	9
201404	1746	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think President Fisher alluded to this, and President Bullard alluded to this.	92	9
201404	1747	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thinking about our short-term strategies, without thinking about how we are going to manage the balance sheet in the future, seems to be breaking this up in different pieces that may not be very productive.	92	9
201404	1748	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to think about our balance sheet more.	92	9
201404	1749	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to think about how we envision shrinking it.	92	9
201404	1750	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And, by the way, as the balance sheet shrinks, the kind of problems we are dealing with become less of an issue.	92	9
201404	1751	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So that is another way to deal with these issues.	92	9
201404	1752	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Regardless of which of these options are adopted, we need to start thinking about how to reduce the size of our balance sheet and how we can return it to a more normal size, sooner rather than later.	92	9
201404	1753	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Does that mean doing things like beginning to either slow or eliminate reinvestment policies?	92	9
201404	1754	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I suggested at an earlier meeting that, when we get to that stage, maybe one of the things we do is reinvest in short-term Treasuries rather than MBS and long-term Treasuries, as a way to create a more flexible structure of the balance sheet in terms of its composition, which might be helpful as well.	92	9
201404	1755	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So we need to think about some of those things in conjunction with our operating framework.	92	9
201404	1756	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, before I get to the quick answers to the questions, I am open to setting a range for the fed funds target.	92	9
201404	1757	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think in the near term—several people have mentioned this—we can stick with a range; the markets have kind of gotten used to that for the time being.	92	9
201404	1758	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Let’s experiment with how big the spread becomes as we raise the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1759	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Do we need reverse RRPs to set a firmer floor under the lower part of that range?	92	9
201404	1760	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think those are interesting things that we can learn in the short term as we begin to move forward.	92	9
201404	1761	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We may find that we don’t need to do it.	92	9
201404	1762	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Maybe the spread doesn’t widen as the IOER rate goes up.	92	9
201404	1763	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t know the answer to that.	92	9
201404	1764	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think those are things that are important to get a better handle on, and I think proceeding in that direction might be very, very helpful.	92	9
201404	1765	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’ve answered most of the questions, but I’ll give a quick summary of the answers to the questions.	92	9
201404	1766	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	As to the fed funds market versus a more robust interbank market rate, I’m all for exploring different definitions of a robust interbank market rate as a market rate that we could target.	92	9
201404	1767	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that’s something worth exploring.	92	9
201404	1768	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I am not in favor of going to the full-allotment overnight RRP facility at this point.	92	9
201404	1769	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we can always revert to that later on, but once we revert to that it’s going to be very hard to move back to anything else.	92	9
201404	1770	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think I still have just too many questions and concerns that.	92	9
201404	1771	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The fourth question.	92	9
201404	1772	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What’s the spread that is tolerable?	92	9
201404	1773	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t have a real strong view about that.	92	9
201404	1774	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that, as I pointed out earlier—and as I think President Lacker pointed out— what is really important for monetary policy is not what the size of that spread might be, but whether it is a useful signal for the path of monetary policy and whether other market rates are moving more or less in tandem with that.	92	9
201404	1775	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding net interest expense issues and remittances, I think the stuff talked about in the memos are sort of peanuts compared with the fact that we’ve got this huge balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1776	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We’ve got $3 trillion of reserves.	92	9
201404	1777	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We get the IOER rate up to 200 basis points, and that’s $60 billion we are giving to banks, not giving to the US government in some accounting sense.	92	9
201404	1778	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Whether or not we are using an RRP facility versus the Term Deposit Facility is going to be peanuts compared with that number.	92	9
201404	1779	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That is where our political risk arises, I think, not in the different methods we’re talking about here.	92	9
201404	1780	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s really all about our balance sheet, and nothing in these memos really talks about that.	92	9
201404	1781	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to think more about the balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1782	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	With regard to further testing and the different spreads, I’m all fine for options 6 and 7, which is more testing.	92	9
201404	1783	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I do not want to go to the full-allotment test.	92	9
201404	1784	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think that’s called for at this point; I think that’s something that we reserve.	92	9
201404	1785	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	If other things don’t work out, that’s something we may want to consider, but I wouldn’t want to go there yet.	92	9
201404	1786	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1787	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Plosser.	92	9
201404	1788	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201404	1789	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1790	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	And thanks to the staff for a lot of hard work on the memos.	92	9
201404	1791	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We have known for some time that our eventual policy normalization would be challenging.	92	9
201404	1792	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	As our discussion revealed just now, there are several ways to proceed.	92	9
201404	1793	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I expect that we will continue to narrow our proposals over the next several meetings until we arrive at a workable and effective consensus approach.	92	9
201404	1794	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I have just a couple of comments at this point.	92	9
201404	1795	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I think our monetary policy task is relatively straightforward.	92	9
201404	1796	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We want to preserve our ability to adjust a short-term policy rate when it comes time to impose more restrictive financial conditions.	92	9
201404	1797	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	As Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned, this is really the most important objective, and I think most everybody around the table has echoed that.	92	9
201404	1798	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I personally believe that the time for tightening is not near.	92	9
201404	1799	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	My submission for the March Summary of Economic Projections had the first policy rate liftoff in the first quarter of 2016—if anybody didn’t already know that.	92	9
201404	1800	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But of course, we do need to plan.	92	9
201404	1801	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We have a variety of interest rates that we could employ:  the IOER rate, the overnight reverse repo rate, the fed funds rate or its next generation, the GC repo rate, and others.	92	9
201404	1802	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	As long as these candidate rates remain relevant for the pricing of other market interest rates in the US credit and intermediation process, any of them might work as the primary focus of our policy actions, it seems to me.	92	9
201404	1803	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I agree with President Lacker’s comment that the volatility of the funds rate and of the other rates are really of secondary importance relative to our policy objectives.	92	9
201404	1804	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So until we have more discriminating evidence on the relative efficacy of the various approaches on the table, I remain relatively open-minded as to the best way to proceed on this front.	92	9
201404	1805	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Now, that said, I found the briefing documents helpful for pointing out that some of these new tools could have a bearing on altering financial instability risk for the US economy.	92	9
201404	1806	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Although the creation of overnight reverse repo assets—can we find a shorter way to describe that, please?—has some appealing properties for supplying much sought-after short-term safe- instrument assets, these new financial products may change the industry landscape, and maybe by a lot.	92	9
201404	1807	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m quite sympathetic to President Plosser’s point that we need to be thinking about the endpoint—others have said that, too—of where we want to be.	92	9
201404	1808	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	And once I started thinking about what the long-term landscape of the financial industry might be because of the introduction of these nice, safe assets, I couldn’t stop thinking about it, really.	92	9
201404	1809	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	And I don’t know how to disengage from that or finesse it.	92	9
201404	1810	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I mean, maybe we don’t need to have a firm opinion about that just to make a decision in September.	92	9
201404	1811	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But I think we have to have that endpoint in mind.	92	9
201404	1812	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s not clear to me how this will work.	92	9
201404	1813	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	For example, how would money market mutual funds that specialize in overnight reverse repo assets affect other money market fund assets and the credit instruments that are associated with them?	92	9
201404	1814	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Maybe this is trivial and negligible.	92	9
201404	1815	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That was sort of the commentary I got from the questions that I tried to pose.	92	9
201404	1816	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But I was focusing on the longer term; I’m not sure we engaged on that quite enough.	92	9
201404	1817	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I would want strong assurances that no unintended credit crunch could emerge for any important nonfinancial enterprise.	92	9
201404	1818	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I think that as we try to normalize policy, we are going to want to make sure that we don’t somehow create some kind of mistake that affects the credit process.	92	9
201404	1819	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I’m also not sure how I feel about the possibility that our choice of monetary policy tools could significantly alter a large financial services industry segment.	92	9
201404	1820	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Perhaps this industry evolution is inevitable, but it does seem a bit far removed from our normal monetary policymaking considerations, as well as the more immediate task at hand of ensuring our ability to raise short-term interest rates when the time comes.	92	9
201404	1821	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	There is a lot we need to understand about these choices.	92	9
201404	1822	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But, again, I remain open-minded on the use of overnight reverse repo assets as an important element of our policy toolkit.	92	9
201404	1823	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Now, regarding the seven questions, I am extremely pleased to say that I am in complete agreement with President Fisher.	92	9
201404	1824	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I don’t really intend to answer those questions.	92	9
201404	1825	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1826	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I am open-minded.	92	9
201404	1827	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I will say that I don’t think we should pay too much attention to the interest expenses that we are going to incur with these different programs.	92	9
201404	1828	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s just not something that we normally think about when making tough monetary policy decisions, and I don’t think we should start doing that now.	92	9
201404	1829	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I am sensing from other commentary so far that option 3 seems to be at the intersection of many participant views expressed already, and that could be fine with me.	92	9
201404	1830	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Although I have to say very seriously that I’m not sure I could pick option 3 out of a police lineup.	92	9
201404	1831	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter].	92	9
201404	1832	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1833	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Evans.	92	9
201404	1834	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	92	9
201404	1835	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1836	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	I was hoping that my last FOMC meeting would be fairly straightforward and would be on the shorter side.	92	9
201404	1837	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	But once I started to receive the staff memos and the agenda, I realized that wasn’t going to be the case.	92	9
201404	1838	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Indeed, this may end up being one of the longest meetings I will have attended.	92	9
201404	1839	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	But, on a positive note, I have benefited from the learning gained by reading the excellent memos that were prepared by the staff and listening to today’s rich discussion, and the longer meeting gives me the opportunity to spend more quality time with my FOMC colleagues.	92	9
201404	1840	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1841	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	On a more serious note, the number and length of the excellent background memos circulated to the Committee and today’s discussion make it clear that the issues surrounding the normalization of monetary policy are among the most complex the Committee has addressed in my 11 years of service.	92	9
201404	1842	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As an aside, only Chair Yellen, President Lacker, and I were here the last time the FOMC began policy normalization, back in June of 2004 when we raised the fed funds rate, and it was a lot simpler back then.	92	9
201404	1843	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	But at the time, it didn’t seem very simple.	92	9
201404	1844	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	I know that today’s discussion is just a first step in a sequence of discussions that will be needed to eventually decide on a framework and to implement it.	92	9
201404	1845	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	And because these discussions and decisions will rest with all of you, and with my successor, Loretta Mester, who will be sitting at this seat at the next meeting, I am going to be brief in my comments today.	92	9
201404	1846	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Rather than trying to give direct answers to the detailed questions put to the Committee, I will instead offer a few high-level comments that I hope will be of help to you when the time comes for the Committee to make some decisions.	92	9
201404	1847	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	There are two principles that I find to be helpful in evaluating the options for policy normalization.	92	9
201404	1848	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	First, I believe that in the long run the policy instrument should be the federal funds rate, or an augmented federal funds rate or a similar market rate should the federal funds rate not prove to be viable.	92	9
201404	1849	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	In my view, I think that the policy instrument should be one that is set by this Committee rather than just by the Board of Governors.	92	9
201404	1850	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	We have discussed the related governance issues before, and I continue to believe that they are important.	92	9
201404	1851	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Basing policy on a rate like the federal funds rate clearly puts the responsibility where it is supposed to be, and that is with the FOMC.	92	9
201404	1852	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	And such a framework helps with public accountability and transparency.	92	9
201404	1853	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Now, this doesn’t mean that the longer-run framework cannot use rates that are administered by the Board of Governors to support a target for the Committee’s policy instrument.	92	9
201404	1854	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The second principle that I find helpful is that the best course of action will be one that does preserve a high degree of flexibility, as others have commented today.	92	9
201404	1855	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As the staff memos point out, there are many uncertainties surrounding normalization.	92	9
201404	1856	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As one example, we don’t know if the market behavior we observe in the small-scale testing of some of our tools will change in larger-scale implementation.	92	9
201404	1857	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Broadly stated, the Federal Reserve has never been in these circumstances before, and preserving the ability to adjust tools and approaches is likely to prove important.	92	9
201404	1858	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	So using these two principles, I have just a few comments to make on normalization.	92	9
201404	1859	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	For one, during policy normalization, I believe that the Committee should continue to target the fed funds rate or a similar market rate.	92	9
201404	1860	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	If that rate is going to have a role in the longer-run operating framework, I think that it should have a role in the normalization period.	92	9
201404	1861	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As the background memos describe, normalization approaches that make little or no use of the federal funds rate could kill off trading in the federal funds market, which would likely make it difficult to revive the market in the future.	92	9
201404	1862	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	My second comment is that it is desirable to draw on a range of tools during normalization to support the target for the federal funds rate, including overnight RRPs, the IOER rate, and the reserve draining tools.	92	9
201404	1863	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The memos make it clear that each tool has limitations, but a combination of these tools should be useful when the time comes.	92	9
201404	1864	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	And finally, I would recommend proceeding with caution.	92	9
201404	1865	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Over time, the staff has been able to develop a range of tools, and careful, gradual testing has taught us much about the efficacy of the tools.	92	9
201404	1866	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The Federal Reserve will need to continue with cautious testing of both reverse repos and the Term Deposit Facility, while at the same time clearly communicating that testing does not bear on the likely timing of policy tightening.	92	9
201404	1867	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1868	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1869	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201404	1870	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1871	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, want to thank the staff for setting up today’s discussion.	92	9
201404	1872	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I found it very helpful this morning as we did the Q&A.	92	9
201404	1873	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	And I, too, am going to answer the seven questions in summary fashion and be brief, given the discussion we have had already.	92	9
201404	1874	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	From a practical standpoint, the elevated size of our balance sheet is likely going to preclude targeting the fed funds rate in the early stages of policy normalization, so I agree that we should be prepared to lean on the overnight RRP during this phase of the process.	92	9
201404	1875	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	That said, at this stage, I would prefer not to abandon the federal funds target completely in a long-run strategy for steering short-term rates, because my own preference is for gradually returning the balance sheet to a more normal level.	92	9
201404	1876	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	At this point, however, I am open to enhanced testing across a range of tools to provide optionality with respect to our framework.	92	9
201404	1877	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I would also be interested in testing strategies for facilities that could support highly competitive money markets by encouraging a broad range of depositories, including smaller banks, to transact in short-term money markets along the lines of the segregated balance accounts.	92	9
201404	1878	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Testing a number of these tools may also provide some insight into how they interact with one another and affect short-term money markets.	92	9
201404	1879	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	My preferred approach right now is to eliminate, as others have noted, the extremes presented in the memos, as we will likely need to do some learning as we undertake normalization.	92	9
201404	1880	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	So, like others, I would focus primarily on options 2 and 3 at this stage.	92	9
201404	1881	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the spread on the overnight RRPs during the normalization process, I would prefer to take an approach that maintains a wide spread to the IOER rate and move cautiously toward full allotment, and continue to utilize counterparty caps for the time being.	92	9
201404	1882	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I would support taking steps toward moving the overnight RRP toward 15 basis points by the end of the year, simply to ensure we have a reasonably well-developed sense of how well it acts as a floor.	92	9
201404	1883	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	And after liftoff, I could also see even a wider spread between the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate, perhaps as much as 25 basis points, to assess how well this rate acts as a floor.	92	9
201404	1884	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	If it’s effective, then we can possibly continue targeting the federal funds rate via a floor system.	92	9
201404	1885	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	If, however, it fails to act as a floor because of idiosyncratic reasons within the funds market, then we may want to consider expanding the use of term tools or reassess the use of the federal funds rate for implementing monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1886	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1887	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201404	1888	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1889	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Like others, I want to thank the staff for their hard work and thoughtful analysis on the various memos.	92	9
201404	1890	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought this morning’s discussion was very enlightening for me, and I’ll echo President Fisher: I think that I, at least, would benefit from having further, possibly intermeeting, conversations about these issues as we move forward to a decision point, I guess in September.	92	9
201404	1891	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before I launch into my prepared remarks, I just want to make one comment that there has been a lot of talk about learning by doing and learning as we go along.	92	9
201404	1892	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think this is, of course, going to be really important whatever we end up doing in terms of exit.	92	9
201404	1893	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I do think we have to have a framework for thinking about exit that is robust enough to deal with the possibility that inflation risks might arise that would require us to raise rates relatively rapidly.	92	9
201404	1894	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And whatever we end up doing, whatever framework we set up should be robust enough to deal with that possibility.	92	9
201404	1895	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not saying that we are there right now, but I think the idea of just groping along might not be possible given the macroeconomic objectives that we are trying to achieve.	92	9
201404	1896	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to begin by making three high-level comments about the deliberations and communications.	92	9
201404	1897	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These first three high-level comments are relatively firm, and then I’m going to be a little more speculative and tentative in suggesting a way forward.	92	9
201404	1898	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I haven’t said this for a while, but it’s a pleasure to be able to say it.	92	9
201404	1899	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A lot of my comments are going to agree with much that President Lacker had to say.	92	9
201404	1900	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s a pleasure to be able to say that after a long time.	92	9
201404	1901	2014-04-30	meeting		[Laughter]	92	9
201404	1902	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of my high-level comments, the first comment relates to the 2011 exit-strategy principles.	92	9
201404	1903	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In June 2011, the FOMC enunciated a set of exit-strategy principles with the support of all but one FOMC participant.	92	9
201404	1904	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those principles emphasize the role of the federal funds rate target during exit, the likely role of asset sales during exit, the FOMC’s desire for a small long- run balance sheet, and the FOMC’s desire for an all-Treasury long-run balance sheet.	92	9
201404	1905	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do think that when we communicate about our desired operational framework and, really, as we talk about it, we should be more connected back to those June 2011 principles.	92	9
201404	1906	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think our new communications about exit are less likely to be viewed as credible if we are not able to provide a convincing or compelling rationalization for why we are deviating from the June 2011 principles.	92	9
201404	1907	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is my first comment.	92	9
201404	1908	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My second high-level comment is about communication, more generally, and monetary policy is fundamentally about expectations management.	92	9
201404	1909	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that the FOMC needs to be able to communicate effectively about the likely evolution of its policy stance.	92	9
201404	1910	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think effective communication should be viewed as an important criterion for our choice of operational framework.	92	9
201404	1911	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think we should be thinking about this as let’s get the operational framework that will do the best job of reducing, say, the volatility of money market interest rates.	92	9
201404	1912	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think, really, we should be thinking about what is going to be the best framework that will allow us to be able to communicate effectively about the future arc of policy.	92	9
201404	1913	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A complicated framework with multiple administrative rates and targets may well hinder that effective communication.	92	9
201404	1914	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And my final high-level comment is about the possible risk to financial stability.	92	9
201404	1915	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I mentioned in some of my questions this morning, I found the memos to be especially useful in my thinking and highlighting how an overnight RRP facility could increase the probability and severity of a financial panic.	92	9
201404	1916	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is true that there is some upside with this facility as well, potentially mitigating these risks.	92	9
201404	1917	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I see it as very asymmetrical.	92	9
201404	1918	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the Federal Reserve’s creation of a new overnight facility was seen as being responsible for fostering a financial panic in any way, I think that, first of all, that would be bad from a policymaking point of view, but it would also, of course, be bad from a reputational point of view.	92	9
201404	1919	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before we were to go forward with implementing such a facility, I would like to have in place very strong safeguards to mitigate adverse side effects of financial instability.	92	9
201404	1920	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I hinted at this morning in my questions, I am not convinced, at this stage at least, that the caps alone represent such a strong safeguard.	92	9
201404	1921	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are my three high-level, relatively firm comments.	92	9
201404	1922	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be tying our discussions and communications about exit back to what we said in June 2011.	92	9
201404	1923	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should be ensuring that our new operational framework is carefully designed to facilitate effective communication about the evolution of policy.	92	9
201404	1924	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we should not adopt an overnight facility unless we have a great deal of confidence that we are not fostering the risk of financial instability.	92	9
201404	1925	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now I am going to be more tentative and turn to a suggested approach to exit and, as I said earlier, it is going to be similar to what President Lacker had to say.	92	9
201404	1926	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s a relatively simple version of option 5:  The FOMC specifies our interest rate target; the Board sets the interest rate on excess reserves equal to that target, and the Desk makes transactions in the federal funds market only to ensure the federal funds rate does not exceed the target set by the FOMC; and we don’t use draining of any kind to ensure that the federal funds rate does not fall below the target.	92	9
201404	1927	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s the approach, and I’ll state it again in a second.	92	9
201404	1928	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But why is this appropriate?	92	9
201404	1929	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My starting point is that the FOMC achieves its goals of maximum employment and price stability by influencing the incentives of banks to make loans.	92	9
201404	1930	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Operationally, before 2008, the FOMC shaped banks’ incentives to make loans by varying a specified target for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1931	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The crux of my argument is going to be that, given that we can pay IOER, the operational equivalent is now for the FOMC to specify a target for the maximum of the federal funds rate and interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1932	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, we are always about shaping banks’ incentives, and there are always gaps that emerged.	92	9
201404	1933	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you look at the data, and President Lacker did a good job of talking about this, there are always gaps that emerged between our target rate and what was going on in money markets.	92	9
201404	1934	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those gaps moved around, but it didn’t get in the way of our ability to influence aggregate demand, which is ultimately what we’re about.	92	9
201404	1935	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why is it the right thing to be doing, the operational equivalent now, to specify a target for the maximum of the federal funds rate and the interest of excess reserves?	92	9
201404	1936	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, right now, at any point in time, banks have a choice among selling federal funds to other banks, holding reserves, and making loans.	92	9
201404	1937	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That means that the bank will only make a loan if its return is higher than both the fed funds rate and the interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1938	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before 2008, the interest on excess reserves was zero, so you didn’t have to worry about it.	92	9
201404	1939	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The only relevant alternative for the bank was the federal funds rate, and that’s why you could shape banks’ incentive to make loans by changing the target for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	1940	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	After 2008, the Federal Reserve was allowed to set the interest on excess reserves to be above zero.	92	9
201404	1941	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, there are two rates that can be relevant:  the federal funds rate or the interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201404	1942	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The key point is when the interest on excess reserves is higher than the federal funds rate, as it is now, banks then decide whether to make a loan by comparing the loan’s return with the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1943	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The federal funds rate is irrelevant because it’s dominated by the interest rate on reserves.	92	9
201404	1944	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I want to be clear about one thing here.	92	9
201404	1945	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We do see banks borrowing at rates that are lower than IOER, but that’s their average borrowing cost.	92	9
201404	1946	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the margin, their financing costs are going to be equal to the IOER rate, because otherwise they would have an incentive to make that marginal increase in their borrowing to invest in the high IOER.	92	9
201404	1947	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the margin, they have to be indifferent between how they’re financing and IOER.	92	9
201404	1948	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There might be other borrowers that are able to get that low money market rate, but the banks themselves are marginally indifferent.	92	9
201404	1949	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what I see as a very simple exit strategy for the FOMC.	92	9
201404	1950	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At each meeting, the Committee should specify our desired target interest rate.	92	9
201404	1951	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Board of Governors should set the IOER rate equal to that target interest rate, and then the Desk should conduct operations in the fed funds market, if necessary, to ensure that the fed funds rate does not exceed that target interest rate.	92	9
201404	1952	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is no draining in this approach.	92	9
201404	1953	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Basically, when the federal funds rate is lower than the IOER rate, it is just not influencing banks’ decisionmaking, so we can ignore it.	92	9
201404	1954	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are going to be gaps that are going to emerge between various short-term interest rates under this approach to monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1955	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now, the low federal funds rate means that the Federal Home Loan Banks are earning a very low overnight return on their investments relative to the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1956	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More generally, not all loans in the economy come from banks.	92	9
201404	1957	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Borrowers who have access to the commercial paper market may well be able to obtain loans at more favorable terms than those offered by banks.	92	9
201404	1958	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, as President Lacker pointed out, arbitrage considerations will limit such gaps.	92	9
201404	1959	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will add that we do not have a theory to indicate to us whether such gaps are efficient or inefficient.	92	9
201404	1960	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, finally, whether we did or not, that’s not the job of monetary policy.	92	9
201404	1961	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is not to eliminate all gaps between short-term interest rates.	92	9
201404	1962	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The job of monetary policy is to shape aggregate demand by influencing the overall tightness of credit conditions, and we can, I believe, do that in an effective fashion by influencing banks’ incentives to make loans.	92	9
201404	1963	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am proposing a change to the June 2011 exit principles, which emphasize the role of the federal funds rate target.	92	9
201404	1964	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we can rationalize reorienting to the IOER rate by pointing out, as I have, that the federal funds rate is essentially irrelevant for bank decisionmaking when it is as low as it currently is.	92	9
201404	1965	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And so the relevant margin is the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1966	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1967	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	1968	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201404	1969	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	1970	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	A number of people have characterized their remarks as tentative, and I will go a step further and say that mine are very tentative, particularly with respect to the final shape of an intermediate strategy.	92	9
201404	1971	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll begin with a process point in which I actually have considerably greater confidence, and in some ways this picks up on a couple of President Kocherlakota’s introductory remarks.	92	9
201404	1972	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I guess because of the desire that most people have to maintain optionality, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the fact that we all acknowledge there’s incomplete knowledge of a lot of what might happen as we begin to exit, I would suggest that for the next iteration of this exercise, as the staff generates materials for us, they try to generate them in a pretty concrete fashion that gives us a timeline in the following respects.	92	9
201404	1973	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	One, what we would expect the Chair to say in September or shortly thereafter, which is both a matter of communication, as President Kocherlakota was suggesting, and an indication of what we have to decide by then.	92	9
201404	1974	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Two, an understanding of what kinds of decisions we would subsequently need to make before we’re in a position to raise whatever the target interest rate would be at that time.	92	9
201404	1975	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The reason I suggest doing it in that concrete way is that it will both let us see how the optionality and incomplete knowledge issues play out over time and test whether we feel comfortable going forward, or do we need to think this through more first.	92	9
201404	1976	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	It might also allow us to agree that we can put off some decisions that are interesting and otherwise might divert us along the way.	92	9
201404	1977	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Now, having just made that suggestion, I will—mindful of what Richard suggested earlier, which I think is absolutely right that we should bear in mind where we each think we may want to go—make a couple of comments about that potential final destination, particularly as it affects these intermediate decisions.	92	9
201404	1978	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I guess I would note first what some of you have alluded to, which is that the Federal Reserve has shifted its monetary policy regime a number of times over the course of its history—largely, presumably, in response to the changing circumstances of the financial system and the economy.	92	9
201404	1979	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	One would think that a particularly appropriate time for doing so again would be in reaction to a major financial crisis and a huge recession that followed, that were themselves connected, I think, to shortcomings in the combination of monetary and regulatory policies that existed in the period preceding the crisis.	92	9
201404	1980	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, it does seem to me that the public policy framework had never taken account, ultimately, of the increasing integration of capital markets with conventional lending that occurred in the roughly 30 years preceding the crisis.	92	9
201404	1981	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, echoing something President Fisher said earlier, the decreased amount of intermediation by banks meant both that there were questions about the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission, but, quite apart from that, that it was possible to build up substantial risks to financial stability in a fashion that was outside the embrace either of monetary policy as then pursued or regulatory supervisory policy as then pursued.	92	9
201404	1982	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	As we sit here today, we’ve changed some of those circumstances, but not all.	92	9
201404	1983	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Unless one has enormous confidence in the ability and authority to develop time-varying macroprudential instruments that could fully compensate for a lot of the shortcomings of the pre- crisis period, I think we do want to consider, at least intellectually, the possibility of a shift to a monetary policy regime that takes account of that increasing integration of capital markets and traditional lending and that gives us another option in connection with financial stability.	92	9
201404	1984	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I’m thinking of the fact that as we have talked about financial stability from time to time over the last year or so, a number of people have made the very salient comment that they don’t want to be put into a situation of tightening when there’s such a macroeconomic problem, and so they’ve sort of raised the threshold for the amount of financial-stability risk that they want to see before doing so.	92	9
201404	1985	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me that if we can develop a monetary policy regime that allows for a more nuanced reaction to financial-stability concerns without a general tightening of interest rates that we will have progressed substantially beyond where we were a decade ago when, as President Pianalto mentioned, the FOMC was engaged in its last exit.	92	9
201404	1986	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	That leads me to the overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201404	1987	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I have to say it seems to me that it’s highly desirable to have that tool and to continue to develop it and use it in the normalization process.	92	9
201404	1988	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I guess one could do without it, but it seems to me kind of clunky to try to proceed very far without using it.	92	9
201404	1989	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that it has some potential—and this was most obvious in the memo that Governor Stein helped the staff with, or the staff helped Governor Stein with, one way or another [laughter], a collective process—and there are a lot of questions around the net impact on financial stability of the particular approach to the use of the facility and the idea of creating a huge amount of safe assets.	92	9
201404	1990	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think those are the kinds of questions that we need to tackle, and we have to think about things like the effect of our actions on risk premiums, particularly term premiums, and whether there is some way of pursuing a monetary policy that can, in a calibrated fashion, affect, for example, term premiums without resulting in just increases in short-term rates.	92	9
201404	1991	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	In a moment I will—notwithstanding the tentativeness—try to give a few provisional preferences on instruments or ideas that are or are not worth pursuing.	92	9
201404	1992	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I did want to say something, though, in response to President Lacker’s comments on supervision and matched books.	92	9
201404	1993	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	It is the case that we’ve been pursuing a set of regulatory and supervisory initiatives designed to constrain the development and maintenance of very large matched books with private actors on all sides because of the potential for runs that then result in cutting off funding to the other side of your book.	92	9
201404	1994	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I am unaware of—unless the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond is doing something they’re not telling us about—any supervisory decisions within the LISCC to discourage the use of arbitrage with the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	1995	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I will say I think the fact that the FBOs are doing it and the domestic banks are not is kind of a good real-world experiment because the FBOs don’t have either the leverage ratio or the FDIC fee.	92	9
201404	1996	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The FBOs do have our supervisors, and particularly the Federal Reserve Bank of New York supervisors, crawling all over them on the liquidity problems and liquidity issues that have existed.	92	9
201404	1997	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think the explanation that the memo suggested is probably more likely to be correct.	92	9
201404	1998	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	In concluding, as I said, I don’t have a good sense at all, even a structure of a sense, of what our plan should be, but—I think this is probably what Bill English is looking for—in the interest of being able to say that some things are less worth pursuing and others more, I’ll at least state a couple of preferences.	92	9
201404	1999	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I have already talked about the overnight reverse repo.	92	9
201404	2000	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Like many other people, I think we should try to fix the federal funds rate, and I’d echo what President Pianalto and others have said along the way.	92	9
201404	2001	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	In terms of options, it doesn’t feel to me as though either option 1 or option 5 are really viable, but I do want to be tentative on that.	92	9
201404	2002	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Like Vice Chairman Dudley and President Lockhart, I’ve been having trouble seeing the utility of the Term Deposit Facility.	92	9
201404	2003	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I don’t want to say I’d rule anything out, but that’s one that I find to be a less productive path to follow.	92	9
201404	2004	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I think I have already exceeded the number of useful things I have to say now, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	2005	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201404	2006	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	92	9
201404	2007	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	2008	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Let me also thank the staff not only for the memos but for the many, many helpful conversations that we’ve had in the run-up to this.	92	9
201404	2009	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I won’t try to answer all the questions.	92	9
201404	2010	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I’ll just try to venture some general thoughts.	92	9
201404	2011	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I also kind of had the same reaction that President Fisher did, which is I know we don’t need to be trying to answer the long-run question now.	92	9
201404	2012	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Nevertheless, I found it useful to start by thinking about the long-run question.	92	9
201404	2013	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	To me, the long-run question boils down to this:  In the long run, what kind of money do we see ourselves being the provider of?	92	9
201404	2014	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think there are basically two possible responses.	92	9
201404	2015	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	One is, we go back to the old world in which we saw our franchise as providing currency and reserves.	92	9
201404	2016	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That’s it.	92	9
201404	2017	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Alternatively, there’s a world in which we see our job as providing not only currency and reserves, but also some kind of safe asset that’s conceptually like Treasury bills— namely, our RRPs.	92	9
201404	2018	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	These are two pretty different mission statements, and they involve potentially different balance sheet sizes, obviously quite a bit larger in the case in which you take on this other thing.	92	9
201404	2019	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Let me start by just trying to think about the pros and cons of these two different tasks for the Fed.	92	9
201404	2020	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I actually think there’s a good argument to be made—obviously provisional at this point—for broadening the way we see doing our job, and it’s quite close to what Dan articulated in terms of financial stability.	92	9
201404	2021	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Think about our efforts on the regulatory side with the leverage ratio, we thought about the idea of doing capital surcharges for short-term wholesale funding, and so forth.	92	9
201404	2022	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We’re basically, in various ways, trying to lean against the private sector’s efforts to create very, very short-term money-like claims, which they do when they basically hold long- term assets and fund them with repos.	92	9
201404	2023	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We sort of don’t like guys doing that.	92	9
201404	2024	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Well, you might want to step back in all of this regulatory effort and say, “Why in the world are they doing it?”	92	9
201404	2025	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Well, they’re doing it because it’s cheap.	92	9
201404	2026	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s cheap to fund at the very, very short end of the yield curve.	92	9
201404	2027	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Why is it cheap?	92	9
201404	2028	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Because somehow the world has not supplied enough of the sort of assets that money funds like:  very, very safe short-term money-like assets.	92	9
201404	2029	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So they trade at a premium in price or, let’s say, they have very, very low yields.	92	9
201404	2030	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	If we don’t do it, the private sector will.	92	9
201404	2031	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We can fight that with regulation, but, as Governor Tarullo says, doing it all with regulation is a heavy lift.	92	9
201404	2032	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	An alternative is to try to crowd it out by providing more of that stuff ourselves, and there’s some empirical evidence that in fact when, for example, the supply of Treasury bills goes up, the specialness premium goes down—that is to say, the yields go up and the private sector backs away and does less of that maturity transformation stuff.	92	9
201404	2033	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The big, big picture here would be if we provide more repo-like stuff to the world, that eliminates some of the scarcity.	92	9
201404	2034	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We’re saying to the private sector, we’re going to do some of the maturity transformation and you’re going to do less.	92	9
201404	2035	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Now, is this a radical thing to do?	92	9
201404	2036	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Is this a radical way to think about what we’re doing?	92	9
201404	2037	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I sort of thought about it like you guys did, like both President Fisher and Governor Tarullo did.	92	9
201404	2038	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The world is really changing, and it’s more of a capital markets world, and so what is money has changed in some fundamental sense, and that would be the theory of the case.	92	9
201404	2039	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	President Lacker pointed out—we had a conversation offline about this—that, back in the day, we didn’t provide currency.	92	9
201404	2040	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The private banks provided bank notes, and at some point the decision was made that that wasn’t all that good for financial stability, so we took that job away from the private sector.	92	9
201404	2041	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	This, in some ways, would be a bit of a modern-day analogue to that.	92	9
201404	2042	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That would be sort of the big pitch for doing this at some point.	92	9
201404	2043	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Obviously, there are a bunch of cons.	92	9
201404	2044	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s a serious expansion of what we do.	92	9
201404	2045	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are political issues.	92	9
201404	2046	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are all of the issues that we had earlier in the discussion about expanding the role of money funds, which I think are serious.	92	9
201404	2047	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I do think this idea of restricting our participation to purely Treasury-only or repo-only money funds changes the calculus somewhat.	92	9
201404	2048	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	While I would be averse to expanding our footprint in the conventional money fund sector, I might be less averse to doing it this way.	92	9
201404	2049	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	By the way, I’ve always been kind of fond of the segregated balance accounts, and actually doing this thing with the riskless money funds is just another, and maybe a more elegant, legally and kind of operationally, way to do it.	92	9
201404	2050	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I mean, think about it from the perspective of a corporate cash manager.	92	9
201404	2051	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We’re just trying to find something that corporate cash managers who are dying to have a safe asset can put their money into without having a subsidy.	92	9
201404	2052	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	If they put it into Citibank, we worry that there’s some kind of a subsidy there.	92	9
201404	2053	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	If they put it into a money fund that’s commingling risky and riskless stuff, we worry there’s a subsidy there.	92	9
201404	2054	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But if they put it into something that’s really riskless, maybe that’s actually not a bad outcome.	92	9
201404	2055	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There’s the financial-stability flip side.	92	9
201404	2056	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Ex ante, it’s good to take maturity transformation away.	92	9
201404	2057	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Ex post, if you are really the elastic provider at a fixed rate, there’s this run risk, which seems like a very serious thing.	92	9
201404	2058	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But I think that seems tractable.	92	9
201404	2059	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I mean, you basically cap it.	92	9
201404	2060	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There are many ways to cap it, but then it’s back to just being like a world with more Treasury bills.	92	9
201404	2061	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	At any point in time if there’s a run, the price goes up, the yield goes down, and you have the same mechanism that you have normally.	92	9
201404	2062	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Anyway, this is all long-run stuff.	92	9
201404	2063	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Based on what I know now, which is pretty limited, I would be sympathetic to thinking about this.	92	9
201404	2064	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There’s no reason to try to do anything that particularly marches in this direction right now.	92	9
201404	2065	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I just would hate to see it fall off the table as well.	92	9
201404	2066	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think we want to preserve optionality.	92	9
201404	2067	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t think that optionality goes away as long as the balance sheet is big, because as long as the balance sheet is as big as it is, we’re very likely to be doing some repo funding and learning about how that works, learning about how our counterparties behave and all of that.	92	9
201404	2068	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We only really get to a fork in the road when the asset side starts wanting to go down, and we could go back to a world in which basically we don’t need the repo funding.	92	9
201404	2069	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But, I think, for the next few years, there’s really no choice on this dimension.	92	9
201404	2070	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	In terms of short-run stuff, let me start by just pruning the tree a little bit, and I think very much in the same spirit that many others have said.	92	9
201404	2071	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t see any reason to go to option 1 in the short run.	92	9
201404	2072	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Maybe in the long run, this view takes you somewhere close to option 1, but we don’t know enough now to want to set this.	92	9
201404	2073	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That would be a pretty aggressive thing to do.	92	9
201404	2074	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We don’t have any idea of how much quantity we would get by putting the RRP rate all the way up with the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	2075	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t see why you’d want to do that.	92	9
201404	2076	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t particularly see why you’d do option 5 or even really option 4.	92	9
201404	2077	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think Vice Chairman Dudley and a number of others have made this point.	92	9
201404	2078	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I’m not a fan, based on what I understand about the Term Deposit Facility.	92	9
201404	2079	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I do think this sort of maxim that we should try to fund ourselves cheap is not because we care per se.	92	9
201404	2080	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s because it’s the Friedman rule.	92	9
201404	2081	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Funding yourself cheap often is associated with good, normative properties.	92	9
201404	2082	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think the TDF is a leading example.	92	9
201404	2083	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We would fund ourselves expensive to the extent that we get traction over the fed funds rate by doing it with a TDF.	92	9
201404	2084	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	My instinct is, it’s because we’ve made the federal funds rate some really odd thing; we’ve managed to make them get rid of all their short-term overnight reserves by putting it in the TDF.	92	9
201404	2085	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Then some poor bank did too much of that, and they’re scrambling for reserves at the end of the day.	92	9
201404	2086	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	You manage to print the high funds rate, but fine, we’ve got the funds rate up, but it’s now a rate that’s pretty divorced from other market rates.	92	9
201404	2087	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t see the appeal of that.	92	9
201404	2088	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	What does that leave us with?	92	9
201404	2089	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Actually—and this is very much to Dan’s question—what do we actually need to do between now and September?	92	9
201404	2090	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think we’re likely to be doing something quite a bit like what we’re doing now, but just a little bit more—in other words, probably raising incrementally the rate on the RRP, increasing the quantity, tightening up the link.	92	9
201404	2091	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	At some point we could be doing this literally between now and September or between now and liftoff.	92	9
201404	2092	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	We’ll start seeing that the range is whatever we think is an acceptable range, and at that point there will be some comfort in going out and talking about the range.	92	9
201404	2093	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I actually think the biggest decision that needs to be made by September is not a decision about how it’s going to operate but how we talk about it.	92	9
201404	2094	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	In other words, here there’s a fork in the road.	92	9
201404	2095	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	You can say one of two things.	92	9
201404	2096	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	One thing you can say once we’ve gotten enough tightness in the relationship is, “The Committee today in the statement announces the following target range for the federal funds rate.”	92	9
201404	2097	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That’s what goes in the statement; that’s what gets talked about.	92	9
201404	2098	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Behind the curtain, Simon and New York are moving around the repo rate to make it tight enough, but that doesn’t have to be talked about so much as a central policy thing.	92	9
201404	2099	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	An alternative option, if we feel less comfortable focusing on the funds rate, would be to make the statement about, “Here’s the IOER rate.	92	9
201404	2100	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Here’s the repo rate.”	92	9
201404	2101	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	That’s what we’ll communicate.	92	9
201404	2102	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I don’t have a strong view yet as to those.	92	9
201404	2103	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I understand there’s sort of a conservative appeal in the former.	92	9
201404	2104	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Maybe I will lean in the most gentle of ways at this point toward the former, but I think that’s the kind of decision that does not have to be made now.	92	9
201404	2105	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And, finally, I just would strongly endorse, whichever of those two one does, the virtue of robustifying the funds rate is an “unalloyed good” irrespective of those, and I think that’s certainly something worth pursuing.	92	9
201404	2106	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you.	92	9
201404	2107	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	2108	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201404	2109	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201404	2110	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	2111	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	First of all, let me say, I did not know until today that “robustify” was actually a word.	92	9
201404	2112	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	It is not, it’s a neologism.	92	9
201404	2113	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	92	9
201404	2114	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So, a great set of memos, very interesting discussion, and thanks for that.	92	9
201404	2115	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	My answers to the questions are buried in my remarks, and I’m going to start with, really, the practical short-term alternatives, and then come back a little bit to the more interesting longer-term issues in the end.	92	9
201404	2116	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The practical need is to announce after the September meeting a plan for the mechanics of liftoff and for the foreseeable future, during which the balance sheet will be very large.	92	9
201404	2117	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And for that period, there are two approaches that seem to me to be pretty workable.	92	9
201404	2118	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	First, I do find some attraction in a floor system in which the Committee uses the IOER rate and RRP rate to set a rough floor for short-term rates and doesn’t set a specific policy rate.	92	9
201404	2119	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	That is our option number 2.	92	9
201404	2120	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	A floor system would give the Committee the best control over short-term rates at the lowest cost.	92	9
201404	2121	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	We are going to be in a de facto floor system anyway for a while, due to the high level of reserves.	92	9
201404	2122	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	What this approach does is it just kind of accepts that reality and doesn’t complicate matters by adding a target rate.	92	9
201404	2123	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	For now, I would want to size that RRP facility at the lowest level that would achieve a reasonably tight floor and enable a clean liftoff.	92	9
201404	2124	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Part of that, I have to admit, is the cognitive dissonance that Charlie Plosser mentioned—simultaneously noting that money market funds are a grave threat to financial stability as well as a principal conduit for our monetary policy.	92	9
201404	2125	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Now, the idea of limiting our contacts to government money funds does have the attraction of addressing that problem.	92	9
201404	2126	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	How large would that be?	92	9
201404	2127	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I’m not sure, but for me, at the beginning, it would be in the hundreds of billions, not the trillions.	92	9
201404	2128	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And what I would do is gradually move the RRP up closer to the IOER rate to achieve the desired size.	92	9
201404	2129	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	What would that spread be?	92	9
201404	2130	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know.	92	9
201404	2131	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It would be narrower than the current 20 basis points.	92	9
201404	2132	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I am not inclined to move to a full-allotment RRP, which would be a promise to supply a new risk-free asset to the world.	92	9
201404	2133	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	There is little doubt in my mind that the world would take us up on that in a crisis.	92	9
201404	2134	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would, as we discussed earlier, experiment with size caps and with using the price mechanism—for example, by switching to a single-price auction if demand exceeds the quantity limit.	92	9
201404	2135	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	These would be appropriate subjects for testing.	92	9
201404	2136	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I see two main objections to this explicit floor system during normalization.	92	9
201404	2137	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The first is that the federal funds market, already highly idiosyncratic, would lose further liquidity under a floor system and maybe cease to be a useful benchmark.	92	9
201404	2138	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	There would be problems of contract frustration, and it might be difficult down the road, it is said, to return to a corridor system based on the federal funds rate.	92	9
201404	2139	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It seems to me that we could meet the first set of issues by broadening the federal funds rate to include Eurodollar rates, maybe other unsecured interbank borrowing rates.	92	9
201404	2140	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It also seems to me that if a future Committee wanted to return in the longer term to a market-based target, like the federal funds rate or the broader overnight bank funding rate, or, for that matter, to a secured rate like GC repo, I believe it would be straightforward to do so.	92	9
201404	2141	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So I’m not too worried about preserving options down the road.	92	9
201404	2142	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I think that they are going to be there for us if we want to use them.	92	9
201404	2143	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Actually, the more difficult objection for me is that the size of the balance sheet is a matter of choice under a floor system.	92	9
201404	2144	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It’s not that I’m particularly in a rush to shrink the balance sheet now, but I’m just not yet comfortable with the idea today that we should permanently and massively enlarge the balance sheet.	92	9
201404	2145	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, I don’t think we’re making that decision now.	92	9
201404	2146	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see the use of a floor system during this interim period as implying a longer-term choice to do so.	92	9
201404	2147	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would be comfortable with this explicit floor approach during normalization.	92	9
201404	2148	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Second, during liftoff and normalization, I could also get comfortable with a corridor system in which RRP sets the floor, the IOER rate sets the ceiling, and the Committee targets something in between, either the federal funds or overnight bank funding rate.	92	9
201404	2149	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	There would be perhaps less-precise control, which I don’t see at all as a fatal flaw.	92	9
201404	2150	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	This would be a natural extension of the current practice, as Governor Stein just noted, and more familiar to the markets.	92	9
201404	2151	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It probably represents the easiest, least risky, least surprising thing to do, and that actually recommends it quite a lot to me.	92	9
201404	2152	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	If this system is to work, there would need to be a fix to the federal funds rate, and there would be some mechanics to work out, but there is just about enough time to do that.	92	9
201404	2153	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I have to admit, this approach seems slightly less elegant to me and less well-linked to the evolution of the credit markets.	92	9
201404	2154	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Intermediation is moving outside of the banking system, and it is moving to secured rates.	92	9
201404	2155	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	There is a feeling that we would be going back in time to a comfortable old system rather than allowing our policy framework to evolve to suit the markets of the future.	92	9
201404	2156	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The second approach is also more expensive.	92	9
201404	2157	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	If the spread remains about 15 basis points on $3 trillion in reserves, that is $4½ billion per year in unnecessary cash payments, mainly to large foreign banks that hold one-half of the reserves and growing.	92	9
201404	2158	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So I am concerned about the remittances, and I would really want to see the best estimates we can come up with to talk about this.	92	9
201404	2159	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It could be significant, and it could actually make it more likely at the margin that we have a period of zero remittances, which would not be a positive thing.	92	9
201404	2160	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	But I think either of those two approaches could work pretty well.	92	9
201404	2161	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would leave the other tools on the table without emphasizing them.	92	9
201404	2162	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The idea of testing term deposit facilities seems okay.	92	9
201404	2163	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I also don’t look at the draining tools, as such, as particularly useful or important.	92	9
201404	2164	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I see them as expensive and principally cosmetic at this point, when we have $3 trillion in reserves.	92	9
201404	2165	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t have any urge to use them.	92	9
201404	2166	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I guess I would use them if I had to, which would take me into option 4, if the repo floor turns out to be too leaky.	92	9
201404	2167	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Finally, let me turn to the longer-term issues.	92	9
201404	2168	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And, again, these are not things we need to decide today, but they’re on the list of questions, so I’ll go ahead and talk about them.	92	9
201404	2169	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And I would include in this group such questions as, what is the ideal system?	92	9
201404	2170	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Floor system, corridor system?	92	9
201404	2171	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Should we target a large balance sheet or a small one?	92	9
201404	2172	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	What kind of rate?	92	9
201404	2173	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	How will we handle the governance questions around IOER at the end of the day?	92	9
201404	2174	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And, finally, should we be using the policy framework to do things other than implement traditional monetary policy in a narrow sense, specifically to improve financial stability?	92	9
201404	2175	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	On the first, I do think that over the longer term, in our financial system, an administered floor approach may be simpler and cheaper than a corridor with a market rate.	92	9
201404	2176	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	At the same time, I kind of think that a large balance sheet might prove to be a magnet for trouble over time, and those two considerations pull me in opposite directions, I admit.	92	9
201404	2177	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So I tentatively land on a floor system with the smallest possible balance sheet.	92	9
201404	2178	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	But that brings you to the really interesting question, I think, that Governor Tarullo and Governor Stein were all over, and that is the use of the balance sheet for financial-stability purposes.	92	9
201404	2179	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Very, very interesting questions, and I don’t have a lot to add on them here today, but I think those are the things we are going to be talking about for years to come.	92	9
201404	2180	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201404	2181	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you, Governor Powell, and thank you to everyone.	92	9
201404	2182	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a great discussion of this.	92	9
201404	2183	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We have really dug into the issues.	92	9
201404	2184	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not going to try to provide a summary, but, listening to the go-round, I will work with the staff to try to see if we have found some common ground here.	92	9
201404	2185	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	While I know a wide range of views were expressed, I think I can begin to see where some common ground lies.	92	9
201404	2186	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We will think about how best to structure the presentations and decisions at our next meeting in June, when we can hopefully move further in a practical direction of finding a way forward.	92	9
201404	2187	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But I think for today we have had a great discussion.	92	9
201404	2188	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me also note at this point that the Board meeting, which was operating simultaneously with the FOMC meeting, now concludes.	92	9
201404	2189	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a 10- or 15-minute break, grab some coffee, and we’ll come back and proceed with Simon’s regular report.	2	2
201404	2190	2014-04-30	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201404	2191	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Simon, do you want to begin the financial developments briefing?	61	6
201404	2192	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Okay.	61	6
201404	2193	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201404	2194	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Federal Reserve communications and economic data releases led market participants, on net, to expect an earlier liftoff and slightly higher target rate path.	61	6
201404	2195	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, shorter-dated interest rates rose sharply following the March FOMC meeting, as market participants reacted to an unexpected increase in the SEP’s target rate values and to other policy communications.	61	6
201404	2196	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	While the March meeting minutes and some speeches over the period tempered this rise, shorter-dated rates ended the period moderately higher.	61	6
201404	2197	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, the 10-year Treasury yield increased only modestly around the March meeting and moved in a very narrow range over the period.	61	6
201404	2198	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Expectations for a slightly earlier liftoff were also evident in the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys.	61	6
201404	2199	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, averaging across respondents’ probability assessments, each group now places higher odds on liftoff in 2015 and lower odds on liftoff in 2016 or later than they did at the time of the March survey.	61	6
201404	2200	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In addition, the mean of expectations for the level of the target rate over the period from 2015 to 2017 shifted up a bit for both dealers and buy-side participants.	61	6
201404	2201	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As I just noted, the 10-year Treasury yield has been moving in a very narrow range.	61	6
201404	2202	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This stability against a backdrop of rising shorter-dated forward rates was the result of a similar-sized fall in longer-dated forward rates over the period, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201404	2203	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The declines in the five-year, five-year forward nominal and real rates and rates further out on the curve continued a downward trend seen since the December FOMC meeting.	61	6
201404	2204	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated nominal forward rates in other major developed economies have also declined notably since December, and have been highly correlated with corresponding US rates.	61	6
201404	2205	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	To better understand the moves in longer-dated forward rates in the United States, the Desk’s surveys asked respondents to decompose the roughly 75 basis point decline in the five-year, five-year forward nominal Treasury rate that occurred between the end of 2013 and mid-April into three components:  the expected average future real policy rate, expected future inflation, and term premium.	61	6
201404	2206	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, buy-side participants generally cited lower expected average policy rates as accounting for the largest portion of the decline.	61	6
201404	2207	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	A change in the economic outlook, presumably for longer-run growth, was rated the most important factor driving this move on average.	61	6
201404	2208	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The dealers, on average, attributed a greater portion of the decline to the term premium component, and placed a bit more weight on changes in perceptions of the Committee’s reaction function and “market-related factors” such as portfolio reallocation into fixed income at pension funds or safe- haven flows potentially stemming from tensions between Russia and Ukraine.	61	6
201404	2209	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Taken together, the survey responses suggest that a substantial part of the recent declines in forward rates may be due to reduced prospects for economic growth over the medium and longer term, consistent with recent market commentary on the declines in longer- dated forward rates.	61	6
201404	2210	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Alongside the declines in the five-year, five-year forward rates, the corresponding measure of interest rate implied volatility has declined in recent months and, as shown in the bottom-left panel, is back to levels seen just prior to the May 2013 JEC testimony.	61	6
201404	2211	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Other measures of implied volatility on longer-dated interest rates have also fallen.	61	6
201404	2212	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, implied volatility on shorter-dated tenors has increased, which is consistent with the recent slight increase in the expected target rate path.	61	6
201404	2213	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Declines in broad measures of implied volatility have extended beyond US fixed-income and have also been seen in equity and currency markets, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201404	2214	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	All of these implied volatility measures are near their post- crisis lows, with broad fixed-income and currency measures near the lowest levels of their respective histories.	61	6
201404	2215	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In explaining these low levels of implied volatility, market participants have pointed to a range of factors, including low realized volatility over recent months, greater certainty that the eventual normalization of US monetary policy will be gradual, and the belief that global monetary policies will remain accommodative well into the future.	61	6
201404	2216	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Some have also described increased confidence in a moderate growth outlook with limited inflation pressures.	61	6
201404	2217	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Finally, despite the ongoing tensions in Ukraine, others have noted lower so-called tail risks as contributing to the moves, including reduced fears of a euro-area breakup or a hard landing in China.	61	6
201404	2218	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Of course, in the past, periods of low volatility have at times been associated with an accumulation of financial imbalances and subsequent periods of higher volatility.	61	6
201404	2219	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Dan will provide an assessment of vulnerabilities in the financial system in his briefing.	61	6
201404	2220	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that the S&P 500 was little changed over the intermeeting period, though there were continued sharp declines in sectors that had previously outperformed the broader index, including the biotech and Internet sectors.	61	6
201404	2221	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants did not cite a single catalyst for these declines but instead noted stretched valuations and overweight positioning among speculative investors as contributing factors.	61	6
201404	2222	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	US corporate credit continued its recent strong performance, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201404	2223	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attributed the narrowing of investment-grade and high-yield spreads to an environment of subdued market volatility, low levels of actual and expected corporate defaults, and ongoing investor demand for higher- yielding fixed-income assets.	61	6
201404	2224	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Now, shifting abroad, market attention focused on official ECB commentary that discussed ways to address risks of low euro-area inflation for a prolonged period.	61	6
201404	2225	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	At the April ECB meeting, President Draghi noted that the Governing Council was “unanimous in its commitment” to utilize both unconventional and conventional instruments to combat the risks of persistently low inflation, including through quantitative easing.	61	6
201404	2226	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Thus far, this and other ECB commentary does not seem to have materially affected market-based measures of near-dated euro-area inflation compensation, shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201404	2227	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	These measures have been declining over the past year, particularly following the much lower-than-expected October euro-area inflation print.	61	6
201404	2228	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Evidence of increased expectations for further ECB easing is somewhat mixed across other euro-area financial markets.	61	6
201404	2229	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	While increased expectations for ECB asset purchases are consistent with the narrowing of peripheral euro-area sovereign spreads, shown in the middle-right panel, these spreads have been declining for some time amid a reach for yield by investors in a low volatility environment, as well as gradual improvement in the periphery fiscal and banking sector outlook.	61	6
201404	2230	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Partly reflecting these factors, Greece recently reentered international funding markets for the first time since 2010.	61	6
201404	2231	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Emerging market asset prices also increased over the period, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201404	2232	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have noted increased demand for higher- yielding assets and attractive valuations as volatility has receded after the sharp price declines earlier this winter.	61	6
201404	2233	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Incoming economic information appears to explain little of the moves, given that economic growth was uneven across emerging markets and there was deterioration in the fundamentals of some countries whose markets outperformed, especially Brazil.	61	6
201404	2234	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Despite the recent abatement of market pressures, some market participants have cautioned that vulnerabilities remain elevated, heightening the need for broader reforms to reduce imbalances and lift growth prospects.	61	6
201404	2235	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Tensions between Russia and Ukraine remain an additional source of risk.	61	6
201404	2236	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Incoming economic data provided further evidence of a moderation in China’s growth trajectory, which Steve will discuss in greater detail in his briefing.	61	6
201404	2237	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Chinese policymakers responded to this first-quarter growth deceleration through a slight easing of policy.	61	6
201404	2238	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, Chinese money market rates remained below the average level of the past year and authorities lowered reserve requirements for rural commercial banks.	61	6
201404	2239	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In addition, a new small-scale fiscal stimulus package was announced, although authorities downplayed the potential for any larger-scale action.	61	6
201404	2240	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	These statements were interpreted as underscoring Chinese policymakers’ intention to accept slightly lower economic growth without pursuing significant countercyclical measures.	61	6
201404	2241	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The official Chinese exchange rate fixing continued to depreciate and both on- and off-shore renminbi traded at weaker levels in relation to the fixing, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201404	2242	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It is unclear whether the continued depreciation has been driven by official sector intervention aimed at countering the moderation in Chinese growth, which would be consistent with other attempts to ease policy slightly, or if it reflects an abatement of external financial inflows and speculative positioning following increased currency volatility over recent months.	61	6
201404	2243	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Your final two exhibits review Desk operations.	61	6
201404	2244	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Our continued testing provided further evidence that the overnight RRP exercise is acting as a floor for overnight rates.	61	6
201404	2245	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The past few weeks were a useful case study, as Treasury bill supply declined significantly because of seasonal patterns associated with federal tax receipts.	61	6
201404	2246	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In past years, these declines in bill issuance have coincided with notable decreases in GC repo rates.	61	6
201404	2247	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel, the recent decline in bill issuance is larger than it has been in recent years, yet overnight rates have been fairly stable so far, suggesting that the operations may be offsetting some of the downward pressure on market rates.	61	6
201404	2248	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Usage of the operations has picked up during the period of declining Treasury supply, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201404	2249	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	High take-up tended to occur on days that GC repo traded at or below the overnight RRP rate, in line with the prior staff analysis showing that this take-up is sensitive to the spread between the operation fixed-rate and market rates.	61	6
201404	2250	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Usage was also heavy at the end of the first quarter, when take-up reached $242 billion.	61	6
201404	2251	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Despite the downward pressure on market rates from the decline in Treasury supply, in recent weeks more repo trades have occurred at or near the overnight RRP rate than earlier in the testing period, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201404	2252	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	However, we continue to see trades below the overnight RRP rate even for counterparties with access to the overnight RRP.	61	6
201404	2253	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Market participants suggest that one reason firms may choose to invest at a lower rate is to ensure continued access to dealer balance sheets.	61	6
201404	2254	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	On a related note, over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve System began receiving daily transaction data for federal funds, Eurodollar deposits, and CD markets as part of the FR 2420 data collection.	61	6
201404	2255	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The data should help us better understand depository institutions’ unsecured funding activity and may be used to support calculation of the effective fed funds or new reference rates.	61	6
201404	2256	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Initial analysis of the FR 2420 data confirms that the majority of fed funds borrowing is done by foreign banking organizations at overnight tenors.	61	6
201404	2257	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Importantly, the FR 2420 data also provide a more complete sample of federal funds transactions than the brokered data that is currently used in the calculation of the effective fed funds rate.	61	6
201404	2258	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, the effective fed funds rate broadly corresponds with the comparable fed funds rate calculated from FR 2420, and the daily distribution of rates across the two data sets is also similar.	61	6
201404	2259	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Average overnight Eurodollar rates derived from the new data set also generally correspond with rates received from brokers, although the volumes are notably lower as the FR 2420 data exclude many offshore entities that are active in this market.	61	6
201404	2260	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The staff will continue to study the data and assess potential enhancements to the collection in the coming months.	61	6
201404	2261	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Next, I would like to mention a couple of recent developments in the MBS market.	61	6
201404	2262	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	First, option-adjusted spreads on current coupon MBS—shown in the bottom-left panel—have increased only slightly in recent months even as the pace of Federal Reserve asset purchases has declined, consistent with the view that MBS prices are affected by expectations for the total stock of purchases.	61	6
201404	2263	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	However, many market participants think that the daily rate of Federal Reserve purchases also affect MBS spreads.	61	6
201404	2264	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They argue that spreads have remained stable amid declines in the pace of Fed purchases because gross issuance of MBS has continued to decline notably in response to higher mortgage rates since the middle of last year.	61	6
201404	2265	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, some of this decline in gross issuance is expected to reverse in coming months, largely because of seasonal factors, while market participants expect the Committee to continue decreasing the pace of MBS purchases.	61	6
201404	2266	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As a result, the size of Federal Reserve purchases relative to the size of gross issuance is expected to decline significantly, and many market participants believe that spreads may widen some over the remainder of the year in response to this decline in our footprint.	61	6
201404	2267	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, under the Committee’s current policy regarding reinvestments, MBS purchases will likely remain large for some time.	61	6
201404	2268	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, which pools responses across the recent dealer and buy-side surveys, respondents have varied views about the Committee’s likely future reinvestment policy.	61	6
201404	2269	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Dealers’ responses on the likely timing at which some or all reinvestments would end ranged from 9 months before liftoff to 12 months after liftoff, while buy-side views ranged from 9 months prior to liftoff to 30 months following liftoff.	61	6
201404	2270	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Given the projected size of reinvestments, the relative dispersion of views around the timing of any change in policy, and the importance that market participants place on those purchases, many are becoming increasingly focused on the Committee’s communication and intention on its balance sheet policy.	61	6
201404	2271	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the Desk began purchasing MBS on our proprietary FedTrade platform.	61	6
201404	2272	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So far, the operations have gone well:  Systems are working as expected, pricing is competitive relative to market quotes, and dealer participation is strong, as reflected in the high offer-to-cover ratios shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201404	2273	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	While large-scale auctions are not common in the MBS market and it is too soon to determine how the market will respond to a full transition to FedTrade, we are encouraged by the operations to date.	61	6
201404	2274	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In Treasury markets, operations continue to proceed smoothly and are well- subscribed.	61	6
201404	2275	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee chooses to decrease the pace of Treasury purchases at this meeting, the Desk will conduct fewer operations each month, while leaving the maturity distribution of purchases unchanged.	61	6
201404	2276	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If purchases are reduced, we would release a Desk statement at the same time as the Committee statement, the same approach as taken at prior meetings.	61	6
201404	2277	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will have copies of the statement available for review tomorrow.	61	6
201404	2278	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Finally, as explained in the memo that Steve Kamin and I sent to the Committee on April 22, we are requesting votes to renew the liquidity swap lines and NAFA arrangements.	61	6
201404	2279	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the use of liquidity swap lines recently has been minimal, and as communicated in a memo earlier this year, the foreign central banks plan to phase out their auctions of dollar liquidity by the end of July.	61	6
201404	2280	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Even though planned dollar operations could end soon, we believe that the standing arrangements are an important liquidity backstop, helping to maintain stability and confidence in global funding markets.	61	6
201404	2281	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, liquidity swap and NAFA arrangements are tangible and constructive signals of central bank cooperation.	61	6
201404	2282	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201404	2283	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That completes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201404	2284	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201404	2285	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	62	6
201404	2286	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201404	2287	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Simon, on panel 19, how much do we have in the portfolio that actually matures in 2014 and 2015?	62	6
201404	2288	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So how much does it really matter when we stop reinvesting?	62	6
201404	2289	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Lorie has the numbers there, and she can read them out for you.	62	6
201404	2290	2014-04-30	meeting	LOGAN	With alternative B’s planned purchase path, we’ll have $220 billion maturing in two years.	62	6
201404	2291	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s the Treasuries?	62	6
201404	2292	2014-04-30	meeting	LOGAN	That’s for Treasuries.	62	6
201404	2293	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	That’s in 2014?	62	6
201404	2294	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	2015 and 2016.	62	6
201404	2295	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s partly the result of the MEP, because we cleaned out all of them.	62	6
201404	2296	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And then, for the mortgage-backed securities, the red bars here show you what the reinvestments could look like.	62	6
201404	2297	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	What we did here for what the paydowns would look like was split the difference between assuming that you reinvested in 2015 and assuming that you didn’t reinvest.	62	6
201404	2298	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So on the decision of whether you stop reinvesting, the back half of 2015 probably doesn’t have much at all in the way of maturing securities, right?	62	6
201404	2299	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	In the Treasury market.	62	6
201404	2300	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But for the mortgage market, we will get principal paydown.	62	6
201404	2301	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And the current policy is to reinvest those principal paydowns.	62	6
201404	2302	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Also, the agency debt is $30 billion to $40 billion of that.	62	6
201404	2303	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We’ll get some—I think it’s maybe $20 billion of paydowns in that.	62	6
201404	2304	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m sorry.	62	6
201404	2305	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Could you repeat what you think the pace of reinvestments for MBS and Treasuries will be over the coming years?	62	6
201404	2306	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I just didn’t hear the answer.	62	6
201404	2307	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Over the short run the Treasury reinvestments are very small.	62	6
201404	2308	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s under the order of $1 billion this year, and it might go up to $2 billion next year.	62	6
201404	2309	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And then it gets substantially larger, because under the MEP we basically sold everything that was less than 3¼ years.	62	6
201404	2310	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And that ended at the end of 2012, so it takes you into 2015 to get the larger amounts.	62	6
201404	2311	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	For the mortgage-backed securities, it will depend on what the principal paydowns are.	62	6
201404	2312	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Chart 18 shows you one estimate of that.	62	6
201404	2313	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	One of the strange little issues is the paydowns on the portfolio partly depend on what the reinvestment policy is, and you can get different measures.	62	6
201404	2314	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So we took the average of assuming that you reinvested all the way through 2015 with one in which you didn’t reinvest in 2015 to show the paydowns.	62	6
201404	2315	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart is next.	62	6
201404	2316	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My question was answered.	62	6
201404	2317	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	62	6
201404	2318	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	62	6
201404	2319	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question about the uncertainty about the reinvestments.	62	6
201404	2320	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Are we being asked about when we are going to clarify this?	62	6
201404	2321	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Is this something that people are anxious about?	62	6
201404	2322	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Are they clamoring for more information, or are they very comfortable having this uncertainty sort of sit out there?	62	6
201404	2323	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think people in the mortgage market would really like to know, and other people would like to know because it tells them something else about what we might be doing.	62	6
201404	2324	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But definitely, a reason to focus on the mortgage market, if you look at chart 18, is that we haven’t really seen the effect relative to issuance yet.	62	6
201404	2325	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So many of the mortgage traders do believe in the flow effect.	62	6
201404	2326	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It is possible that they are correct, and we will see some increase in the mortgage spreads as we go through the year and the share of the issuance that we are purchasing goes down.	62	6
201404	2327	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	And they are obviously interested whether it’s the case that the reinvestments would end early.	62	6
201404	2328	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a general question for the Committee, then.	62	6
201404	2329	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Is there any reason why we shouldn’t clarify this?	62	6
201404	2330	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It seems like it’s getting to be about time to do it, right?	62	6
201404	2331	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, or certainly you might want to do.	62	6
201404	2332	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we’re going to roll out all of this stuff in September, we might want to also clarify what the total package looks like, including what is happening with the reinvestments.	62	6
201404	2333	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Are you agreeing maybe that’s something we can discuss in the next meeting, next two meetings?	62	6
201404	2334	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201404	2335	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201404	2336	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201404	2337	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I am looking at exhibit 1, items 3 and 4.	62	6
201404	2338	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	How reasonable is that decomposition of the decline in the nominal five-year, five-year forward rate since the December FOMC meeting?	62	6
201404	2339	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Are you going to say that the run-up from the JEC testimony to the FOMC meeting would sort of be the opposite graph of this, in which market players thought that expected average real rates were much higher, expected average inflation rates are much higher, and term premiums were much higher?	62	6
201404	2340	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think if we had asked this question—and we did ask questions like this—the term premiums explanation and uncertainty of the reaction function of the Fed were the leading answers.	62	6
201404	2341	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We did ask that question after the June meeting, and there was a lot of uncertainty over the reaction function of the Fed following the confusion market participants had, particularly with the press conference.	62	6
201404	2342	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	To me, it is unusual to see so little weight put on the term premiums as an explanation.	62	6
201404	2343	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This has not been a very sharp move, which you’d usually associate with the reversal of term premiums that were too low.	62	6
201404	2344	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	This has been just a gradual move, and it has kept the 10-year in this very narrow range for many months now.	62	6
201404	2345	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There are a lot of market participants talking more and more about why this is happening, and they are focusing more on the dark blue type of explanation rather than the red.	62	6
201404	2346	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If you look at the real and nominal, inflation compensation hasn’t changed that much over this period.	62	6
201404	2347	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	When I look at this picture, you’re talking about five-year, five-year forward.	62	6
201404	2348	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So this is five years out from now.	62	6
201404	2349	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I guess the way I’d like to interpret this picture is, there was some steady state before the JEC testimony last May, and then there has been some backing off in the latest quarter or more from the rise that occurred during the summer.	62	6
201404	2350	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	But this is stuff that is supposed to happen five years from now; it’s incredible.	62	6
201404	2351	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The thing that’s interesting is, most people thought that the 10-year would be around 3.25 percent.	62	6
201404	2352	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s around 2.75 percent, and we’re trying to understand, given where short rates have been and the fact that the asset purchases are actually going down, why we haven’t seen the 10-year move up, and it’s interesting that one of the stories people are telling is that long-run growth will be lower.	62	6
201404	2353	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They could definitely be wrong on that.	62	6
201404	2354	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Lower, but evidently not as low as what they thought before the JEC testimony last May.	62	6
201404	2355	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Most of us would think that that was a term premium effect rather than a real growth rate effect.	62	6
201404	2356	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	If you look at the question we asked about the long-run growth rate on the dealer survey, it has been moving down, and it has been moving down with their estimates of what the long-run fed funds rate will be, and that’s happened over the last year or so.	62	6
201404	2357	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That has been going on while we saw between April and July a big repricing of fixed income, when you saw both short and long forwards move in the same direction.	62	6
201404	2358	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So you don’t want me to just interpret this as some kind of backing off of the peak that was hit in December of 2013?	62	6
201404	2359	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That is a very valid way of interpreting it.	62	6
201404	2360	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I was just pointing out it’s quite interesting that the 10-year has been quite becalmed around 2.70 percent despite everything else that’s been going on.	62	6
201404	2361	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201404	2362	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201404	2363	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201404	2364	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63	6
201404	2365	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201404	2366	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We also have a proposal to renew the NAFA swap arrangements with Canada and Mexico, and a proposal to renew the liquidity swap arrangement.	63	6
201404	2367	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me first ask whether there are any comments or questions on these proposals.	63	6
201404	2368	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201404	2369	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I would like to first ask for an FOMC vote on the renewal of the NAFA swap arrangements.	63	6
201404	2370	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor.	63	6
201404	2371	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201404	2372	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201404	2373	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201404	2374	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201404	2375	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	That passes.	63	6
201404	2376	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And, second, I’d like to ask for a vote on liquidity swap arrangements.	63	6
201404	2377	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor.	63	6
201404	2378	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201404	2379	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201404	2380	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201404	2381	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201404	2382	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63	6
201404	2383	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	What we’re going to do is next turn to the economic and financial situation and financial stability.	11	1
201404	2384	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We have a series of briefings, and Bill Wascher is going to kick off the briefings.	11	1
201404	2385	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	3  Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201404	2386	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll be referring to a one-page handout entitled, “Material for Forecast Summary.”	11	1
201404	2387	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	The data on real activity and inflation that we have received since the March Tealbook contained relatively little in the way of material surprises, and thus we made only small revisions to our economic projections in the April Tealbook.	11	1
201404	2388	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the top two panels of your forecast summary exhibit, the incoming spending data resulted in an upward revision to fourth-quarter real GDP growth and a downward revision to the first quarter.	11	1
201404	2389	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	The fourth-quarter surprise was concentrated in consumption services, while the first- quarter surprise was mostly attributable to an unexpected decline in exports.	11	1
201404	2390	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	I would note as an aside that given how low our point estimate now is for first-quarter growth—and taking account of the sizable error band that surrounds even a forecast on the eve of release—it would not be particularly unusual from a statistical point of view if tomorrow’s advance estimate were to show a small decline in first-quarter real GDP.	11	1
201404	2391	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Despite the downward revision to our Q1 estimate, we continue to think that GDP was held down last quarter by several transitory factors, including unusually severe winter weather and the aforementioned decline in exports.	11	1
201404	2392	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Hence, we continue to anticipate that real GDP growth will step up to a 3½ percent pace this quarter.	11	1
201404	2393	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Much of the higher-frequency data that we received during the intermeeting period seems consistent with this near-term picture.	11	1
201404	2394	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In particular, both retail sales and motor vehicle sales picked up sharply in March.	11	1
201404	2395	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Likewise, after a sharp decline in January that was largely weather induced, manufacturing production rebounded in February and rose further in March.	11	1
201404	2396	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	And, after the Tealbook was closed, we received the advance report on durable goods, which showed increases in orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods last month that are broadly consistent with the modest step-up in business investment we are projecting this quarter.	11	1
201404	2397	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	One component of demand that has fallen short of our expectations is residential construction.	11	1
201404	2398	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Specifically, single-family starts last month were softer than we had projected in the March Tealbook; building permit issuance, which we generally view as a better indicator of the underlying pace of construction, also surprised us to the downside and remains noticeably below the levels seen last year.	11	1
201404	2399	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	It is possible that bad weather depressed starts and permits in the early part of the year to a greater degree than we had anticipated.	11	1
201404	2400	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Nevertheless, as shown in the middle-left panel, we took some signal from the incoming data and marked down our forecast for residential investment growth in the first half and, to a lesser extent, for the year as a whole.	11	1
201404	2401	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Our view that there might be more underlying weakness in the housing sector than we had previously thought was reinforced by the softer-than-expected data on March home sales, though here too our uncertainty regarding the effects of bad weather—and the usual month-to-month volatility of some of these measures—make us hesitant to mark down our outlook too drastically at this point.	11	1
201404	2402	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Moreover, given the continued rise in house prices, it seems likely that at least some of the slow pace of sales and construction reflects supply constraints, a hypothesis supported by evidence of rising input costs as well as anecdotes from builders.	11	1
201404	2403	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Taking a broader view, however, we still see the fundamentals for the housing sector as favorable, and thus we continue to project a noticeable acceleration in residential construction as the effects of bad weather unwind, the overall economy improves, and as supply-related constraints gradually diminish.	11	1
201404	2404	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	But we admit to being somewhat nervous about that projection.	11	1
201404	2405	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Turning to the labor market, the March employment report came in about as expected.	11	1
201404	2406	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	On the establishment side, the average pace of job gains for the first quarter as a whole was in line with our March projection, and we continue to anticipate a modest rise in job growth over the near term.	11	1
201404	2407	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	On the household side, the March unemployment rate was one-tenth higher than we had expected, while the labor force participation rate was 0.2 percentage point higher.	11	1
201404	2408	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	For the near term, we have taken on board the small upward surprise to the unemployment rate but are inclined to attribute some of last month’s improvement in the participation rate to noise.	11	1
201404	2409	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Combined, these revisions leave our current assessment of labor market slack about unrevised, with an employment-to-population ratio that is in line with our previous forecast.	11	1
201404	2410	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Our medium-term GDP projection is also little changed from March:  As noted, the incoming data seem consistent with our view that the weakness seen in the first quarter was mostly transitory, and we made only small and offsetting revisions to our conditioning factors this round.	11	1
201404	2411	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	We therefore continue to project that real GDP growth will pick up to an average pace that is just above 3 percent per year as some of the forces that have been restraining growth in recent years—such as federal fiscal policy—start to fade.	11	1
201404	2412	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	With a rate of potential output growth that is expected to average a touch below 2 percent over the next few years, this pace of actual output growth implies a steady reduction in the unemployment rate, to just over 5 percent at the end of 2016.	11	1
201404	2413	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	This path is basically identical to our previous forecast and leaves the unemployment rate at our estimate of its natural rate at the end of the projection period.	11	1
201404	2414	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Finally, the bottom two panels of the exhibit summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201404	2415	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	As shown on the left, we have marked up headline PCE inflation a little through the middle of this year.	11	1
201404	2416	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Our near-term path for the price of crude oil is slightly higher relative to March, as is the level of natural gas prices; both of these factors contribute to a bit more consumer energy price inflation this year.	11	1
201404	2417	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	We have also boosted our near-term forecast for food price inflation, as recent increases in crop and livestock prices appear to be passing through to consumer prices more quickly than we anticipated.	11	1
201404	2418	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In contrast, core inflation (shown on the right) has come in as expected.	11	1
201404	2419	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	With projected slack, inflation expectations, and core import prices all little revised relative to March, we made no change to our core inflation forecast; likewise, our projection for headline inflation is basically unrevised after this year.	11	1
201404	2420	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In particular, we continue to expect a gradual rise in core inflation over the medium term as margins of labor- and product-market slack tighten further, as some of the transitory factors that depressed inflation in 2013 are not repeated, and as core import prices return to a moderate rate of increase following their decline last year.	11	1
201404	2421	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Meanwhile, headline inflation is projected to run a bit lower than core in 2015 and 2016, reflecting the slight downward tilt in crude oil prices in our forecast.	11	1
201404	2422	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Steve will continue our presentation.	11	1
201404	2423	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	I will not be referring to a handout.	11	1
201404	2424	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Like many cars driving on Washington roads following our unusually harsh winter, the foreign economy ran into a pothole early this year.	11	1
201404	2425	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	After averaging 3 percent in the second half of last year, foreign growth slowed to only 2¼ percent in the first quarter, ½ percentage point below what we wrote down in March.	11	1
201404	2426	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Much of the slowdown was concentrated in China and its emerging market neighbors, and importantly reflected a drop-off in exports.	11	1
201404	2427	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	As I’ll discuss shortly, our best guess is that Chinese growth will regain some of its earlier momentum in the next few quarters, while Latin America’s economy, which has also languished of late, will pick up too.	11	1
201404	2428	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we see foreign growth clambering out of the pothole with its hubcaps still on, reaching 3¼ percent by the second half of this year and maintaining that pace for the remainder of the forecast period.	11	1
201404	2429	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Notably, as Bill discussed, the US economy also hit a pothole in the first quarter, in part reflecting the same factor restraining many foreign economies:  contracting trade.	11	1
201404	2430	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	The contribution of net exports to US GDP swung from positive 1 percentage point in the fourth quarter to an estimated negative 1 percentage point in the first, as exports plunged at a 5½ percent rate.	11	1
201404	2431	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Because the export decline chiefly reflected contracting shipments of oil and agricultural products, which had enjoyed outsized gains the quarter before, we are inclined to view it as transitory and project exports to resume growing in the current quarter, erasing the drag on US GDP.	11	1
201404	2432	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	By the same token, the export slowdown in the EMEs, which included a step-down in shipments of high-tech goods, also follows a strong fourth quarter.	11	1
201404	2433	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	This gives us some optimism that trade and economic activity will also pick up in the EMEs, supporting global growth.	11	1
201404	2434	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	However, this outlook for renewed global growth is hardly assured, and China represents the biggest question mark.	11	1
201404	2435	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Based on the GDP data released by the Chinese authorities, we estimate that the pace of expansion dropped from 8 percent in the fourth quarter to only 5½ percent in the first.	11	1
201404	2436	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Industrial production, investment, and exports all weakened significantly.	11	1
201404	2437	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	The causes of the slowdown are murky.	11	1
201404	2438	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Over the past year or so, the authorities had taken actions to rein in credit growth, boost interest rates, and generally rebalance the economy away from investment and exports, and we were expecting some moderation in growth, but nothing this abrupt.	11	1
201404	2439	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, China’s exports appear to have fallen considerably further than those of most other Asian economies, raising questions as to whether some of the reported decline may be due to statistical problems.	11	1
201404	2440	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	All told, our best guess is that at least some of the slowdown was due to transitory factors and Chinese economic growth will move back up to over 7 percent in the second half of this year as exports strengthen and domestic policy turns more supportive.	11	1
201404	2441	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, China’s authorities have been quite outspoken that they are not planning substantial additional stimulus, but they will probably either deliver that stimulus or at least ease off their earlier tightening if economic growth continues to perform much below their current 7½ percent target.	11	1
201404	2442	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	As Chinese growth recovers, it should support a more rapid expansion in other EMEs, especially in Asia, that have also underperformed recently.	11	1
201404	2443	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	This outlook is reasonably benign, and in putting it together, we considered whether we might be seeing the beginnings of a financial crisis in China, with shortfalls in activity eventually triggering sharp downdrafts in property and financial markets.	11	1
201404	2444	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Notwithstanding some isolated corporate defaults and a localized run on a rural bank, however, we’ve seen scant evidence of more generalized disruptions, and we continue to view a significant surge in financial volatility as a downside risk rather than a feature of our baseline outlook.	11	1
201404	2445	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Two other risks bear mention.	11	1
201404	2446	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	First, the situation in Ukraine is deteriorating, and as noted in the Tealbook, a substantial escalation of geopolitical tensions could boost oil prices, depress sentiment, and weigh on US and global growth.	11	1
201404	2447	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Second, as Simon discussed earlier, although financial stresses in EMEs eased further since your last meeting, some EMEs continue to harbor significant vulnerabilities, and a renewal of stresses, perhaps as we and other major central banks start to raise rates, remains a possibility.	11	1
201404	2448	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Assuming these risks do not materialize, our outlook for the advanced foreign economies is also reasonably benign, though hardly ebullient, with economic growth averaging 2¼ percent over the forecast period.	11	1
201404	2449	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	This is a little higher than their estimated potential growth, so resource slack diminishes over time.	11	1
201404	2450	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Economic indicators in the euro area have been reasonably upbeat, and growth looks set to edge up over the forecast period—reaching 2 percent by 2016—on the back of further reductions in financial stresses and fiscal drag.	11	1
201404	2451	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	The Japanese economy will likely contract this quarter as a result of the hike in consumption taxes on April 1, but some offsetting government spending and continued asset purchases should support above- trend growth, on average, even given a second tax hike scheduled for the end of next year.	11	1
201404	2452	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Perhaps reflecting some lack of imagination on our part, by the end of the forecast period, we see the situation in the advanced foreign economies as broadly similar to that in the United States, with output close to its potential level, inflation approaching the 2 percent target, and policy interest rates still well below their likely long-run levels.	11	1
201404	2453	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Although continued monetary policy accommodation abroad seems nearly assured, policy rate paths will likely diverge considerably across the major central banks.	11	1
201404	2454	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	In the United Kingdom, continued brisk GDP growth along with continued weak productivity pushed the unemployment rate down to 6.9 percent, below the 7 percent threshold announced last August.	11	1
201404	2455	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	The Bank of England is expected to start raising its policy rate in the first quarter of 2015, even before the staff’s projection has the FOMC starting to tighten.	11	1
201404	2456	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	At the other end of the spectrum, we see the Bank of Japan continuing its heavy asset purchases through the end of 2015, a year later than specified in the BOJ’s initial announcement of its program last year.	11	1
201404	2457	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	That said, we’ve abandoned our earlier assumption that the BOJ will substantially step up the pace of its purchases, as BOJ officials have signaled greater comfort with the progress of inflation and output, despite the fact that both of them have come in weaker than we’d expected recently.	11	1
201404	2458	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Prospects for monetary policy are especially uncertain in the euro area.	11	1
201404	2459	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	The ECB continues to grapple with whether or not to provide additional stimulus.	11	1
201404	2460	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Although the economy is now in its fifth quarter of recovery, unemployment remains stuck near 12 percent, and 12-month headline inflation has continued to decline recently, falling to 0.5 percent in March.	11	1
201404	2461	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon noted, ECB officials have signaled their interest in various options—ranging from providing further liquidity to lowering interest rates, all the way to purchases of asset-backed securities or government bonds—depending on whether and to what extent the risks of disinflation become more pronounced.	11	1
201404	2462	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	However, beyond relatively modest actions such as providing additional LTROs, more-aggressive measures would all have their drawbacks.	11	1
201404	2463	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we do not see the ECB starting asset purchases unless a significant deterioration of the outlook forces its hand.	11	1
201404	2464	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	At this point, that seems unlikely.	11	1
201404	2465	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Much of the euro area’s recent disinflation has been driven by falling retail energy prices, while core inflation has run higher at almost 1 percent.	11	1
201404	2466	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	For the period ahead, we anticipate that a bottoming out of energy prices and narrowing of output gaps will push inflation up to 1½ percent toward the end of next year, hardly rapid progress, but enough to keep the ECB on hold until 2016, when we expect it to start raising rates.	11	1
201404	2467	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	11	1
201404	2468	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Dan Covitz will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201404	2469	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I’ll be referring to the three exhibits with the cover page entitled, “Material for Financial Stability Assessment.”	11	1
201404	2470	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	My briefing is based on our recent QS Assessment of Financial Stability.	11	1
201404	2471	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As in previous reports, we focus on vulnerabilities, where vulnerabilities are aspects of the financial system that could amplify shocks and in doing so impose negative externalities, such as fire sales and other forms of contagion, on the financial system.	11	1
201404	2472	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Our bottom line is that, overall, vulnerabilities remain moderate, although some appear to be expanding relative to the December assessment.	11	1
201404	2473	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Our overall assessment is predicated, in part, on the aggregate level of maturity transformation we see in the financial system, which appears low relative to pre-crisis levels.	11	1
201404	2474	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As shown in panel 1 of your first exhibit, the ratio of net short-term wholesale funding to gross domestic product has remained at the lower end of its range over the past several years, reflecting, in part, a reduction in total triparty repurchase agreements (not shown).	11	1
201404	2475	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, as illustrated in panel 2, the level of triparty repurchase agreements backed by relatively illiquid collateral, the area above the dark blue region, has changed little over the past several quarters.	11	1
201404	2476	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Moreover, the flow of assets being securitized, charted in panel 3, has picked up only a bit from moribund levels in 2008, driven primarily by increases in CMBS and CLOs.	11	1
201404	2477	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Securitization was the first step in large volumes of maturity transformation chains in the shadow banking system that proved unstable during the financial crisis.	11	1
201404	2478	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, leverage in the financial sector appears relatively low.	11	1
201404	2479	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Panel 4 shows that regulatory capital ratios at bank holding companies are at their highest levels in over a decade.	11	1
201404	2480	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, as outlined in panel 5, all of the domestic systemically important banking firms (G-SIBs) reported they had met their minimum required Basel III Tier I Capital Ratios, including the firm-specific G-SIB surcharge.	11	1
201404	2481	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Further, the Federal Reserve’s Dodd-Frank stress tests showed that all of the 30 largest bank holding companies were projected to exceed their minimum capital requirements under the adverse scenario, which included a large interest rate shock, and all but one of the 30 largest bank holding companies was projected to exceed their minimum capital requirements under the severely adverse economic scenario.	11	1
201404	2482	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Moreover, as shown in panel 6, dealer responses to the most recent Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey indicate the use of leverage at REITs has declined in recent quarters, while the use of leverage at hedge funds has moved sideways, although staff estimates of hedge fund leverage indicate that such leverage is high relative to its range over the past couple of years.	11	1
201404	2483	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Finally, rapidly expanding credit in the nonfinancial sector (not shown)—a typical precursor to financial instability—has been limited.	11	1
201404	2484	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Household borrowing has been held down, in part by uncertainties about risks to making mortgages in the current regulatory environment and the ongoing effects of lending restrictions in the Credit Card Act.	11	1
201404	2485	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Debt growth of the nonfinancial business sector has been robust, but many firms have continued to take advantage of low rates to refinance existing debt and reduce their interest expenses.	11	1
201404	2486	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Now the bad news:  As discussed in your next exhibit, pockets of vulnerabilities have persisted and in some cases appear to be expanding.	11	1
201404	2487	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Beginning with panel 7, valuation ratios—that is, forward P/E ratios—of small capitalization stocks, the red line, remain high by historical standards, notwithstanding the recent sizable correction in biotech and social media stocks.	11	1
201404	2488	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, margin credit on equity investments has increased notably relative to market capitalization.	11	1
201404	2489	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Even so, valuation ratios for larger firms, the black line, continue to appear moderate.	11	1
201404	2490	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Moreover, staff measures of the equity risk premium for S&P 500 firms are still wide by historical standards and so do not suggest, broadly speaking, that the stock market is overvalued.	11	1
201404	2491	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	For Treasury securities, valuation pressures remain evident to some degree.	11	1
201404	2492	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As plotted in panel 8, staff estimates of the term premium on 10-year nominal Treasury securities are at the lower end of their historical range, despite the jump last summer, suggesting that term premiums could move up further.	11	1
201404	2493	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Elsewhere in the fixed- income sector, spreads on corporate bonds have continued to decline, with the high- yield spread, the black line in panel 9, moving toward the bottom of its historical range.	11	1
201404	2494	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Nevertheless, the low level of spreads suggests that potential exists for the price of credit risk to rise; indeed, historically narrow corporate bond spreads are empirically associated with subsequent mark-to-market losses on corporate bonds.	11	1
201404	2495	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In the leveraged loan market, excesses have continued to build since the December QS assessment.	11	1
201404	2496	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As indicated by the combined height of the bars in panel 10, the pace of leveraged loan issuance increased further this year, surpassing the pace in each of the past 10 years.	11	1
201404	2497	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Moreover, most of the increase is attributed to deals with debt exceeding six times EBITDA, the blue bars.	11	1
201404	2498	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, spreads have remained narrow and covenants have reportedly weakened further.	11	1
201404	2499	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Of course, the pressures in the leveraged loan market are not new.	11	1
201404	2500	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Supervisory guidance was issued early last year, followed by letters pointing to Matters Requiring Attention (MRAs) in the fall, to address the evident deterioration in banks’ leveraged loan underwriting practices.	11	1
201404	2501	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	However, we have yet to see a noticeable effect of the guidance or the MRAs on loan volumes, credit terms, or deal structures.	11	1
201404	2502	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	We will know more about the efficacy of the guidance after this summer’s SNC exams.	11	1
201404	2503	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	However, even if the MRAs succeed in curtailing unsound practices at banks, leveraged lending activity could migrate to nonbank lenders such as private equity firms and hedge funds— indeed, some deals reportedly have been done recently without bank participation.	11	1
201404	2504	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	A related vulnerability is the liquidity risk posed by the rapid growth in business debt held by mutual funds over the past few years.	11	1
201404	2505	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As illustrated in panel 11, outstanding assets under management at mutual funds totaled roughly $2½ trillion in 2013.	11	1
201404	2506	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	These funds offer daily liquidity to investors, even though most of the underlying assets are fairly illiquid.	11	1
201404	2507	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	To be sure, bid-asked spreads (not shown) on corporate bonds are not high right now.	11	1
201404	2508	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	However, the role of dealers in providing liquidity to corporate debt markets has diminished.	11	1
201404	2509	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	As shown by the black line in panel 12, the ratio of outstanding corporate debt to dealer holdings, at over 12, is near its highest level in several years, as dealers are reportedly moving toward intermediating trades only when they already have a buyer and a seller lined up.	11	1
201404	2510	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Your final exhibit summarizes an alternative simulation in the April Tealbook, Book A, entitled “Liftoff Tantrum,” which uses the FRB/US model to capture the potential economic effects from triggering some of the pressures that I just highlighted.	11	1
201404	2511	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In that simulation, term premiums are assumed to rise by 120 basis points more than expected over the first half of 2015, and investment-grade corporate bond spreads widen by 70 basis points.	11	1
201404	2512	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	The triggering event is presumed to be a pull- forward by investors of the eventual tightening of conventional monetary policy and the depressing effects on the market values of fixed-income portfolios.	11	1
201404	2513	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In this scenario, the effect on the unemployment rate peaks at 0.3 percentage point in 2016 and moderates to about 0.2 percentage point by 2018, while the effect on the level of GDP peaks at 80 basis points and also ebbs a bit through 2018.	11	1
201404	2514	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In the simulation, households and investors anticipate that the turmoil, while intense, will be transitory, which limits the effects on permanent income.	11	1
201404	2515	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In addition, there is a modest policy offset.	11	1
201404	2516	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	However, it is not unimaginable that the pockets of vulnerabilities in high-yield debt markets could be more disruptive than in the simulation.	11	1
201404	2517	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	For instance, negative returns on high-yield bonds could cause dealers to pull back, and, as a result, the broader corporate bond market could become highly illiquid, perhaps disrupting the primary issuance market as well.	11	1
201404	2518	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Such an event would be more consequential for the real economy, although effects would be mitigated by moderate leverage in both the financial and nonfinancial sectors, and by the subdued amounts of assets funded with short-term debt relative to levels leading up to the financial crisis.	11	1
201404	2519	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I’ll conclude by noting that while financial vulnerabilities remain modest overall, we cannot rule out the possibility that the financial system would become impaired from a large and adverse shock, such as a resurgence of instability in Europe, or a marked deterioration of the situation in Ukraine.	11	1
201404	2520	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201404	2521	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	That concludes our prepared remarks.	11	1
201404	2522	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	11	1
201404	2523	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for any of the presenters.	12	1
201404	2524	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12	1
201404	2525	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to ask a question about the trends in leveraged lending, and I know something but perhaps not enough about this.	12	1
201404	2526	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	But can you put the debt multiples in the context of total transaction valuation?	12	1
201404	2527	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s one thing to say that debt multiples are exceeding six times when there’s a very thin equity layer in the transaction.	12	1
201404	2528	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s another thing to say there is default risk when there’s a cushion of 25 to 35 percent equity in the deal.	12	1
201404	2529	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	So the total evened-out multiple of the transaction is relevant because it tells you about the equity cushion in the deal.	12	1
201404	2530	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Can you talk about those trends, total valuation trends?	12	1
201404	2531	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I don’t know the ratios that you’re talking about, but my understanding is that these are very, very risky deals, particularly the bottom bar in this chart.	12	1
201404	2532	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I think—I’m not sure.	12	1
201404	2533	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Maybe you’re hearing something different than I’m hearing.	12	1
201404	2534	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In the late 1980s, total transaction EBIDTA multiples got to around 11, and with debt exceeding in many cases 9 times or 10, so that the equity slice in the deal was less than 5 percent.	12	1
201404	2535	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s another way of saying leveraged buyout folks were buying companies almost totally with debt.	12	1
201404	2536	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In response to the financial crisis, equity in deals went up to 40 percent of the capital structure, and all I have heard is that they remain around 25 percent.	12	1
201404	2537	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	So you have transactions that are valued at, say, 8 times multiple with 6 times debt.	12	1
201404	2538	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	That leaves quite a significant amount of equity to burn through before you have a potential default.	12	1
201404	2539	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s the thrust of my question, and I just want to make sure we’re not misconstruing the danger associated with slightly over 6 times debt multiples.	12	1
201404	2540	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	President Lockhart, we can come back to you on the full transaction multiples, but these are debt multiples post issuance.	12	1
201404	2541	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So it’s for the whole thing, not the particular transaction.	12	1
201404	2542	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	And then the other piece is that if you look at debt multiples of nonfinancial firms in the universe, like the corporate sector, the 75th percentile on debt multiples usually ranges between like 3 and 4.	12	1
201404	2543	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In nonleveraged deals.	12	1
201404	2544	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	And 75th percentile would be 3 or 4 times cash flow in nonleveraged deals.	12	1
201404	2545	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	In nonleveraged, just firms—not deals, not transactions, but firms.	12	1
201404	2546	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So if you look at the corporate sector, the 75th percentile has fluctuated over the recent years between, say, 3 and 4.	12	1
201404	2547	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So 6 gets you close to a higher tail of the distribution.	12	1
201404	2548	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So it is high.	12	1
201404	2549	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	President Lockhart, I guess even though you don’t have the ratio you’re looking for, presumably the rating agencies when they rate the deals are thinking not just about the amount of debt relative to earnings but also about any equity that’s available to burn through for the corporation.	12	1
201404	2550	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	In this case, what we’re seeing is the share of the deals rated single-B or triple-C has gone up quite a bit in the past several months.	12	1
201404	2551	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	We’re also seeing just a deterioration of the ratings distribution as well.	12	1
201404	2552	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	12	1
201404	2553	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I have two questions.	12	1
201404	2554	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	When you think about financial stability, do you think about financial stability from the perspective of “things happen”?	12	1
201404	2555	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial institutions break, they become impaired, and therefore, credibility in the economy suffers.	12	1
201404	2556	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Or do you also think about financial stability if you have just big movements in asset prices that tighten financial conditions?	12	1
201404	2557	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Do you think about the former or both?	12	1
201404	2558	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s my first question.	12	1
201404	2559	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I think of it mainly as requiring some sort of dysfunction whether it’s institutions or markets.	12	1
201404	2560	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	The simulation that we’ve presented from the FRB/US model is not a financial-stability event.	12	1
201404	2561	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a financial conditions event.	12	1
201404	2562	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Right.	12	1
201404	2563	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s a financial-conditions event.	12	1
201404	2564	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	There’s no dysfunction, and it’s even a particularly narrow financial-conditions event because it’s only affecting one particular market.	12	1
201404	2565	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	That’s one of the reasons why the effects are relatively modest.	12	1
201404	2566	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess my reservation is I just hope we don’t think that if nothing is going to break we shouldn’t worry about it.	12	1
201404	2567	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine a situation in which you can have big movements in financial asset prices with nothing breaking, but it is still actually very hard for us to keep the economy on the trajectory that we want.	12	1
201404	2568	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s just my preference.	12	1
201404	2569	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The second question I have relates to Simon’s chart that showed the volatility numbers for equity, bonds, currency.	12	1
201404	2570	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re basically where they were late 2006, early 2007, and presumably when you’re in a low volatility environment and where we are in the business cycle, inflation is low and the economy is growing, that sort of supports asset valuations that are probably going to be above average.	12	1
201404	2571	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess the question that I have is what happens if something changes that volatility environment?	12	1
201404	2572	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s something that you didn’t really highlight in your briefing per se, but it seems to me like we’re living through this incredibly low volatility environment, which I think could change at any point in time.	12	1
201404	2573	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	How do you think about that?	12	1
201404	2574	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	One way to think of it is, yes, asset prices would likely respond.	12	1
201404	2575	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	When I think of that simulation that we presented, it was kind of a proxy or metaphor for a volatility event.	12	1
201404	2576	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	If you wanted a full volatility event that affected all markets, you could think of that as a risk-aversion shock in FRB/US, and I asked the staff to do that for me—not just shock the spreads in the corporate bond market, but also let that shock to term premiums and spreads feed through the equity market, and you get something like a 35 percent drop in the equity market just in that simulation.	12	1
201404	2577	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I think it’s roughly double the effects on the real economy.	12	1
201404	2578	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Very significant.	12	1
201404	2579	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d love to see something like that at a future briefing.	12	1
201404	2580	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Just what happens if there’s a big shock to volatility and how does that feed through markets and then into equities.	12	1
201404	2581	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think that would be useful for the Committee.	12	1
201404	2582	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Yes, and I think FRB/US is set up well to do that.	12	1
201404	2583	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s not set up well to think about things breaking.	12	1
201404	2584	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12	1
201404	2585	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201404	2586	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12	1
201404	2587	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley’s first question.	12	1
201404	2588	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I was glad he was asking it because I was curious about it as well.	12	1
201404	2589	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Your answer used the word “dysfunction.”	12	1
201404	2590	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think of that as an economic term.	12	1
201404	2591	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	How do you define dysfunction?	12	1
201404	2592	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	The inability to trade at any price or an indiscriminate pullback in risk- taking, in which markets no longer are distinguishing between different types of institutions but are just saying, “I want out completely.”	12	1
201404	2593	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I think I had this conversation with you before, right when the asset-backed commercial paper market fell apart, and we were probably at the same place.	12	1
201404	2594	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	[Laughter]	12	1
201404	2595	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Déjà vu all over again.	12	1
201404	2596	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The obvious observation is that it’s not a terribly crisp point.	12	1
201404	2597	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you and I’ve had this conversation.	12	1
201404	2598	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	12	1
201404	2599	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I think the answer I gave you—it may have been seven years ago—was something like, I don’t view it as anyone being irrational.	12	1
201404	2600	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	And some of the movements we saw in commercial paper spreads and the reaction of investors in the commercial paper market in the financial crisis were not necessarily irrational.	12	1
201404	2601	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	That’s not the way I was describing it.	12	1
201404	2602	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	But I would describe what happened in the asset-backed commercial paper market as dysfunction, because it was wholesale, widespread pulling back, even if the assets being funded were probably just fine.	12	1
201404	2603	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	No, this is a serious question.	12	1
201404	2604	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	You folks are doing great work to help prepare us for things that could happen, and, for my money, I think it would be useful for us to also invest some of our good staff with thinking resources into this question.	12	1
201404	2605	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	What should warrant an intervention and what shouldn’t?	12	1
201404	2606	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I think that your folks’ research on the asset-backed commercial paper market developments of August 2007 was extremely useful and valuable.	12	1
201404	2607	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s, as you acknowledge in your paper, open to alternative interpretations.	12	1
201404	2608	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	Absolutely.	12	1
201404	2609	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	“Dysfunction” is a word, and I always ask you about it because it carries with it this connotation of medical intervention.	12	1
201404	2610	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If you’re sick, you need to go to a doctor, right?.	12	1
201404	2611	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Yet your paper provided evidence that investors were discriminating on the basis of public information about the degree to which various portfolios were exposed to subprime mortgage- backed risk.	12	1
201404	2612	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And your paper has been cited as evidence that, indeed, the asset-backed commercial paper market was functioning pretty well, even though the function it was performing was to inform some issuers of paper that they didn’t deserve credit.	12	1
201404	2613	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I take your point.	12	1
201404	2614	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s a loaded word.	12	1
201404	2615	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll remind you again should you slip [laughter].	12	1
201404	2616	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ll find another, neutral word.	12	1
201404	2617	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	12	1
201404	2618	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	12	1
201404	2619	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201404	2620	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I have just a couple of points.	12	1
201404	2621	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I do think it is helpful to consider that, after talking about all of these various risks that seem to be building in the marketplace—I speak about this a lot, and I’m deeply concerned about it—it’s not enough to point it out.	12	1
201404	2622	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The question is, might it have an impact?	12	1
201404	2623	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I do think it would be helpful to go back and study or adjust the model.	12	1
201404	2624	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We had a correction in 1962 that had almost no effect whatsoever on economic growth.	12	1
201404	2625	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	There have been others—in 1987.	12	1
201404	2626	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So I think that is worth exploring.	12	1
201404	2627	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I’ll make a couple of comments.	12	1
201404	2628	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	First—I’ve mentioned this before, and it’s a very important point—when you talk about low spreads on triple-C or junk credit, bear in mind that it’s a low spread over an extremely low historical nominal yield.	12	1
201404	2629	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And if you’re an investor in those instruments, as I used to be, that’s what you care about—in other words, the payback feature.	12	1
201404	2630	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I think that adds extra tension in the marketplace.	12	1
201404	2631	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Just to talk about the spreads is insufficient.	12	1
201404	2632	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s noteworthy, but it’s insufficient.	12	1
201404	2633	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Second, with regard to your comment on panel 10 and leveraged loans, the way the private equity groups work—and, again, you know more about this than I do—basically, one- fourth of their dry powder now has been erased in the past year.	12	1
201404	2634	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Typically, the mindset is, you have to put it to work within a two-year time frame, or else your clients are going to ask for it back.	12	1
201404	2635	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, that indicates to me that we could have an extension, but there are certain things that they seem to be shying away from—for example, commercial real estate now and some of the buyout activity.	12	1
201404	2636	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	You’re seeing more merger activity because of what is now known as the “Botoxification” of balance sheets.	12	1
201404	2637	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	They’ve taken the wrinkles out.	12	1
201404	2638	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	They all look rather artificially pretty, and they’re going after each other.	12	1
201404	2639	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So I think we just need to bear that in mind.	12	1
201404	2640	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	There’s a time frame here in which money has to be put to work—that’s the mentality of a private equity group.	12	1
201404	2641	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And then getting to the international side, the one thing you didn’t mention was Spain, and the reason I am linking the two is, if you fly first class from London to Madrid, there is the Oaktree section, there is the Blackstone section, and there is the Carlyle section of the airplane.	12	1
201404	2642	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Five-year Spanish credit trades through the United States.	12	1
201404	2643	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And Spain is now viewed as the onshoring of what was occurring in Morocco as the offshoring.	12	1
201404	2644	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As a production center, Europe has had a quick turn.	12	1
201404	2645	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	A lot of this private equity money is now looking not just in the United States, but also elsewhere.	12	1
201404	2646	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That may be a positive thing, or it may be a negative thing, but I think we need to start looking at that as well in terms of whether or not this indicates some potential risk.	12	1
201404	2647	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Or maybe it represents no risk whatsoever, but I just want you to broaden your perspective a little bit here.	12	1
201404	2648	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my suggestion, respectfully made.	12	1
201404	2649	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	I agree.	12	1
201404	2650	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	The $600 billion worth of dry powder in the private equity industry is definitely something to pay attention to.	12	1
201404	2651	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It could extend this period of what I consider significant, if not hypervaluation.	12	1
201404	2652	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So we may still have quite a window.	12	1
201404	2653	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But it comes back to the issue mentioned before by both Vice Chairman Dudley and President Lacker.	12	1
201404	2654	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	What do we do about it?	12	1
201404	2655	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Does it matter, or does it not matter?	12	1
201404	2656	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	You mentioned margin requirements.	12	1
201404	2657	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We do have the power to move that.	12	1
201404	2658	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Should we?	12	1
201404	2659	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Should we touch that tool or not?	12	1
201404	2660	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	When do we touch that tool?	12	1
201404	2661	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We haven’t touched it in a jillion years.	12	1
201404	2662	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	These are the kinds of things I would like to see developed over time.	12	1
201404	2663	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I am concerned, personally, about excesses in the marketplace.	12	1
201404	2664	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s unnatural.	12	1
201404	2665	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Money burns a hole in a CFO’s or a dealmaker’s pocket just as it does in anybody else’s, and we’re seeing some holes being burned in pockets.	12	1
201404	2666	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I want to know what the risks are to the real economy and, by extension, to our mandate.	12	1
201404	2667	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That would be helpful.	12	1
201404	2668	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	12	1
201404	2669	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	May I comment on that?	12	1
201404	2670	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, please.	12	1
201404	2671	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	As you know, as the Federal Reserve has issued guidance on leveraged lending; it’s in train.	12	1
201404	2672	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Maybe it’s taking longer than we would like, but that is in place.	12	1
201404	2673	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	SNC exams will be coming along in the next couple of months.	12	1
201404	2674	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Banks may well be fixing their own processes, and it’s not going to slow down the market as long as investor demand is strong, and therefore, we may want to be thinking about it.	12	1
201404	2675	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We did actually included this in last year’s stress tests so that firms were expected to think through whether, if their leveraged loans were to go bad, they would have adequate capital for that.	12	1
201404	2676	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We obviously can do that again.	12	1
201404	2677	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	I believe we’re starting up the stress tests again—it’s almost a year-round event.	12	1
201404	2678	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We’re starting to think through that.	12	1
201404	2679	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	There’s the thought of a countercyclical capital buffer.	12	1
201404	2680	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Again, you may not be able to slow it down, but you can make your banks stronger in case this happens.	12	1
201404	2681	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	I’ll say a couple of words on margin.	12	1
201404	2682	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Some of the margin credit for equities is old Regulation T.	12	1
201404	2683	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Some of it is these new portfolio-margining debits, which are not in our authority.	12	1
201404	2684	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Regulation T, the 50 percent on equity loans, is our authority.	12	1
201404	2685	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We have not changed it since 1977.	12	1
201404	2686	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We’ve had a view that it’s very easy to circumvent with derivatives—that it wasn’t useful.	12	1
201404	2687	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	The portfolio-margining debits are something for which the SEC or FINRA has the authority.	12	1
201404	2688	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Certainly, it’s something we could raise in the public discussions.	12	1
201404	2689	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	We have raised the issue of small-cap stocks.	12	1
201404	2690	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Because we generally don’t think the broad market equities look that rich, we haven’t raised this broad issue.	12	1
201404	2691	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	These are policies that we have been thinking about but just have not put in the public discussion.	12	1
201404	2692	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Again, I don’t want to beat this horse to death, but it also shows the limitations of our franchise, because the credit system is much broader than the depository institutions.	12	1
201404	2693	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So we do what we can with the depository institutions, but the question is, if you have disruption and infection that comes from the nondepository side, how might it put at risk what we try to do?	12	1
201404	2694	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Absolutely.	12	1
201404	2695	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	12	1
201404	2696	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	As long as we’re talking about private equity, I do keep in reasonably close touch with what’s going on out there.	12	1
201404	2697	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would say that prices are high, leverage is high, and equity is low—in all cases, not as bad as it was in 2007.	12	1
201404	2698	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Prices might be in the mid-9s.	12	1
201404	2699	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	We talked about leverage.	12	1
201404	2700	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Equity contributions are in the low 20s.	12	1
201404	2701	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So, again, not as bad as in 2007, but, in all cases, it’s getting stretched.	12	1
201404	2702	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The difference is that expected returns now are very low by historical standards.	12	1
201404	2703	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	You’re looking at returns in the mid-teens with all of this leverage, and that puts pressure on the size of the equity contribution as well.	12	1
201404	2704	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The other really important difference is that rates are incredibly low.	12	1
201404	2705	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	They swap out a lot of the floating-rate debt anyway at very low rates.	12	1
201404	2706	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	You put all of this into the mix—I’m not at all sure that there’s a big wave of defaults being cooked up here because coverage ratios are pretty good.	12	1
201404	2707	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Certainly, the equity returns are under a lot of threat.	12	1
201404	2708	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	But there are no covenants.	12	1
201404	2709	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It’s going to be really hard to default or fail to pay.	12	1
201404	2710	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So, again, it’s a mixed picture to me.	12	1
201404	2711	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	No dysfunction to worry about.	12	1
201404	2712	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201404	2713	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201404	2714	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201404	2715	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m looking at exhibit 3, “Liftoff Tantrum Simulation,” and I guess I want to get back to this question of, what do we do about this?	12	1
201404	2716	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of us have talked about the need to tighten policy as a way to mitigate potential risks.	12	1
201404	2717	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Vice Chairman Dudley has parsed this more finely than I have, between financial stability and financial events, but this seems like a financial conditions event that is actually being caused by the prospect of tightening.	12	1
201404	2718	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What’s the prescription for this particular illness?	12	1
201404	2719	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	You’re right.	12	1
201404	2720	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It is caused by the prospect of tightening.	12	1
201404	2721	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	And then there is an endogenous response of monetary policy, which, I believe, is to push liftoff back one quarter, but the panic has already happened.	12	1
201404	2722	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s your choice—you could overshoot in the other direction to offset it, but, again, these effects aren’t that big.	12	1
201404	2723	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	If you believe the prescriptions of the inertial Taylor rule, you should just push liftoff back one quarter.	12	1
201404	2724	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	12	1
201404	2725	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess my question was, if we’re thinking about the amplification of this risk that’s described in the fourth bullet—or is that not an amplification of these first three bullets?	12	1
201404	2726	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a separate risk?	12	1
201404	2727	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s separate.	12	1
201404	2728	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s going outside the model and asking whether the shock could actually be bigger in its effects than the FRB/US simulation is telling us.	12	1
201404	2729	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	And I think the answer has to be “yes.”	12	1
201404	2730	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, confronted with this possibility of a large adverse event, what ex ante policy prescription is there, or do we just wait, have the shock materialize, and deal with it ex post?	12	1
201404	2731	2014-04-30	meeting	COVITZ	It’s tough, because if you don’t precipitate the shock, then vulnerability could build and then the shock is ultimately bigger.	12	1
201404	2732	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	12	1
201404	2733	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	If I could add to that, this last bullet point, which is the amplification beyond the term premiums and pulling forward by investors, is the tough part.	12	1
201404	2734	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Part of this is thinking about negative returns to corporate bond investors that are over a horizon of the next year or two, which could amplify this.	12	1
201404	2735	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Our model suggests that high debt growth and big junk shares are predictors of negative excess returns.	12	1
201404	2736	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So our strategy has been that we should be trying to reduce the risky debt growth, and that is a little bit of what is behind our thinking.	12	1
201404	2737	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	That’s one possibility.	12	1
201404	2738	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Another part of this—and this gets to Vice Chairman Dudley’s and President Lacker’s comments—is what I would call negative externalities.	12	1
201404	2739	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Maybe I’ll use those words instead of “dysfunction.”	12	1
201404	2740	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	It might survive.	12	1
201404	2741	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	I’m not sure.	12	1
201404	2742	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	[Laughter]	12	1
201404	2743	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	But those are often generated when a lot of leverage is in the system and a lot of maturity transformation is in the system.	12	1
201404	2744	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	To the extent that we can be tracking leverage so we can take actions to reduce leverage, the result should be that when there is a price decline, it doesn’t force fire sales and it doesn’t force actions on the parts of different investors and institutions, and we limit the effects.	12	1
201404	2745	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	So we are thinking about leverage in the system and the short-term funding in the system.	12	1
201404	2746	2014-04-30	meeting	LIANG	Those are two other channels to consider.	12	1
201404	2747	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, can I follow up?	12	1
201404	2748	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a regulator, I think the questions that President Lacker was discussing with Dan and with you are really challenging ones.	12	1
201404	2749	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a monetary policymaker, I think the issues are a little bit simpler because we have our goals identified for us, which are to keep inflation close to 2 percent and unemployment low.	12	1
201404	2750	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’d want to have ways of mapping potential problems in the financial sector into risks to those goals—and then treatments for those risks, either ex post or ex ante.	12	1
201404	2751	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Ex post is hard, but we know what to do.	12	1
201404	2752	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Ex ante, I think, is more complicated.	12	1
201404	2753	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sometimes it seems as though the right treatment is to raise rates, and sometimes it seems as though the right treatment is to lower rates.	12	1
201404	2754	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So if you start to filter this through the lens of a monetary policymaker, we can get away from the loaded words like “dysfunction,” et cetera.	12	1
201404	2755	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s just about risks to our goals and how you respond to those risks to our goals.	12	1
201404	2756	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	12	1
201404	2757	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If I could follow up on that, I think that’s a good point.	12	1
201404	2758	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Sweden is going through a major dilemma on this because they’ve got a housing expansion in train—I’m not saying “boom.”	12	1
201404	2759	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s arguably an expansion conditioned by market participants’ beliefs about bailouts due to what happened in the early 1990s and the precedent set there.	12	1
201404	2760	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So, arguably, risk-taking is going too far in the housing mortgage market.	12	1
201404	2761	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	As a central bank, what do you do?	12	1
201404	2762	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s a genuine dilemma.	12	1
201404	2763	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12	1
201404	2764	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	A quick observation is that, when you look at our scenarios, they almost never generate negative GDP.	12	1
201404	2765	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, given that recessions occur roughly once every 10 years, it does seem as though we don’t get to the tail of the distribution using our models.	12	1
201404	2766	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As an example of that, thinking of the most severe of the scenarios that you have here, “Escalating Geopolitical Tensions,”	12	1
201404	2767	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I was curious—you mentioned that the unemployment rate in Europe is just under 12 percent.	12	1
201404	2768	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	They’re worried about deflation.	12	1
201404	2769	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In Europe, what kind of unemployment rate and what kind of inflation story do you have?	12	1
201404	2770	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The way I could imagine a scenario that gives you a more negative outcome is, if that unemployment rate gets pretty high and if you have a deflationary economy in Europe, is it really plausible that we get only as mild an outcome globally, including in the United States?	12	1
201404	2771	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	I should mention that for the United States, in this particular scenario, the outcome is “moderately” benign in the sense that GDP falls 2¼ percent below baseline.	12	1
201404	2772	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	So, given that we’re projecting somewhat higher growth, we just avoid that negative GDP that you referred to.	12	1
201404	2773	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	But that’s not true for the other parts of the global economy.	12	1
201404	2774	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Not to put too fine a point on it, the rest of the world’s economy falls around 4 percent relative to their baseline, which, for the EMEs, puts them, again, perhaps just north of the zero line but, for the advanced foreign economies, actually puts them into negative territory.	12	1
201404	2775	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	And, although we don’t have it broken down per se, that’s mainly going to be concentrated in Europe, in part because not only does Europe suffer the usual downdrafts that the rest of the world experiences—declines in sentiment, increases in financial stresses, and the higher oil prices—but it also gets the effect of Russia cutting off natural gas exports.	12	1
201404	2776	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	Basically, this event puts Europe back into a moderately deep recession.	12	1
201404	2777	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	But, again, the United States—we just skate by.	12	1
201404	2778	2014-04-30	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, taking into account the large confidence intervals around these—it’s based on science, but, nevertheless, you could imagine a situation in which this generates, indeed, a recession in the United States.	12	1
201404	2779	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	12	1
201404	2780	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	My question, I think, was answered by Nellie.	12	1
201404	2781	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	It was on how our supervisory guidance is affecting leveraged lending.	12	1
201404	2782	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	So, it’s taking longer than we expected, maybe, but we think that after the SNCs, we’ll have a better sense of that.	12	1
201404	2783	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	12	1
201404	2784	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, now we’ve had a round of questions on the briefings.	12	1
201404	2785	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We also have an opportunity for individuals to comment on financial-stability concerns—not a full go-round by any means.	12	1
201404	2786	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But if there are people who would like to do that, please just indicate it.	12	1
201404	2787	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12	1
201404	2788	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have a quick comment.	12	1
201404	2789	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I found the discussion of the leveraged lending market very interesting, particularly when I think of the scenario that was occurring last spring.	12	1
201404	2790	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We had the tantrum in financial markets, so, according to the 10-year rate, the rates went up very appreciably.	12	1
201404	2791	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We had a bunch of supervisory interventions with the intent of slowing down that market.	12	1
201404	2792	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As was noted in Dan’s briefing, the result was that we actually had more leveraged lending occurring.	12	1
201404	2793	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	And so I think it’s an interesting observation, which is similar to what President Lacker was saying about the Swedish example.	12	1
201404	2794	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we think of the ability of exuberant markets to be slowed down, either with monetary policy or with supervisory policy, at least if you look at that spring as an example, it indicates that relatively large movements in both supervisory policy and monetary policy didn’t do much then.	12	1
201404	2795	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	It might be interesting—not today, obviously, being so late, but at a future FOMC meeting when we have the time—to think a little bit more about this, because some of us have been giving speeches about financial stability.	12	1
201404	2796	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we were in a Swedish example or one of these other kinds of scenarios, what kinds of tradeoffs would there be, and what would be the magnitudes, between using primarily interest rates to try to slow down a section of the economy?	12	1
201404	2797	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Alternatively, what are our options for supervisory and regulatory policy, and do we have sufficient tools to actually address this kind of exuberance with what we have now?	12	1
201404	2798	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	12	1
201404	2799	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Would others like to comment?	12	1
201404	2800	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201404	2801	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	To follow up on President Rosengren’s comment, I was recently in Hong Kong, and practically all anyone talked about was housing prices in Hong Kong.	12	1
201404	2802	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	They’ve tried a lot of things—monetary policy and nonmonetary policy things—to try to stem what looks like a very exuberant housing market in Hong Kong, and it’s not clear that they’re having very much effect.	12	1
201404	2803	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	It is a sobering example of what you just talked about in which they have the power to do other things, they are aware of the problem, and they are trying to do a whole bunch of things, but prices still go up.	12	1
201404	2804	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s very sobering.	12	1
201404	2805	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12	1
201404	2806	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I have one final thought.	12	1
201404	2807	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And it’s to separate concern about what we’ve been discussing—some markets are getting ahead of themselves and maybe expansion going too rapidly in some areas—from the question of what we would do if dysfunction, or whatever we want to call it, emerges and the extent to which we’d get involved programmatically to insulate some creditors from the consequences.	12	1
201404	2808	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We all have different views about that, but I think it’s a separate question from having to take on board the macroeconomic issues.	12	1
201404	2809	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We want to do that in a way that doesn’t imply something about our willingness to backstop private markets that we don’t intend to convey.	12	1
201404	2810	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	12	1
201404	2811	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201404	2812	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	On President Bullard’s comment, I want to say that Hong Kong is a very interesting case, but, of course, they’re importing US monetary policy because they’re pegging to the US dollar.	12	1
201404	2813	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	It’s wholly inappropriate for their own economy, I would say.	12	1
201404	2814	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So they have to do all of these macroprudential tools, like increasing equity in housing and whatnot.	12	1
201404	2815	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s a big challenge.	12	1
201404	2816	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201404	2817	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We have about 25 minutes before we have to break for dinner.	12	1
201404	2818	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So I suggest we begin our economic go-round.	12	1
201404	2819	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We may not be able to get too far, but I think we’ll have plenty of time tomorrow.	12	1
201404	2820	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	You may recall that, in the old days, we actually used to have one-day meetings and do everything in a day, so I think we’ll have plenty of time tomorrow to finish.	12	1
201404	2821	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin the economic go-round and start with President Williams?	13	1
201404	2822	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2823	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The ongoing recovery appears to be back on track, with the severe winter weather that was talked so much about and the accompanying hiccup in economic growth now behind us.	13	1
201404	2824	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, like the Tealbook, I have not materially changed my projections for growth or inflation from what I wrote down at our last meeting.	13	1
201404	2825	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, in the “Forecast Summary,”	13	1
201404	2826	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was struck by how nearly identical the forecast lines for March and April are for unemployment, GDP growth, and inflation.	13	1
201404	2827	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In March, consumer and business spending posted solid gains, and my business contacts are generally optimistic about the rest of the year.	13	1
201404	2828	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even in real estate, which hasn’t yet rebounded from the winter slump, the mood in my part of the country is decidedly upbeat.	13	1
201404	2829	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	A member of our Economic Advisory Council says the San Francisco real estate market is the strongest he’s seen in his entire life.	13	1
201404	2830	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, right after he said that, another member of the council asked, “But is it a bubble?”	13	1
201404	2831	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	He responded, without even pausing, “Of course.”	13	1
201404	2832	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201404	2833	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And a contact in door and window manufacturing is very bullish about remodeling and homebuilding nationwide.	13	1
201404	2834	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of labor market conditions, a wide range of indicators continue to improve.	13	1
201404	2835	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Payroll and household employment have both shown solid gains, and the unemployment rate, though still high, has fallen briskly over the past year.	13	1
201404	2836	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	One important labor market indicator that has yet to show signs of life is wages.	13	1
201404	2837	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I will spend the rest of my time—I’ll just spend the rest of the afternoon [laughter]—discussing why the muted wage growth we’ve seen so far is consistent with a strengthening labor market.	13	1
201404	2838	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In a healthy economy, with inflation near our target, broad measures of nominal compensation—wages, salaries, and benefits—should be rising about 3½ to 4 percent per year to keep up with inflation and productivity growth.	13	1
201404	2839	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, for the past three years, we’ve seen an increase in compensation that has fallen well short of that pace, with most measures centering around 2 percent.	13	1
201404	2840	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Average hourly earnings is one indicator that hints at a desirable acceleration in wages.	13	1
201404	2841	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even there, the rate of increase is still well below normal levels.	13	1
201404	2842	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the slow recovery in wages is confirmed by my contacts.	13	1
201404	2843	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	They report limited pressures to boost compensation, except in a few selected hot markets.	13	1
201404	2844	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	And they expect wage increases to remain modest in the coming year.	13	1
201404	2845	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	How should we interpret the muted pace of wage growth?	13	1
201404	2846	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Namely, is it a sign that the improvement in the labor market may have been more modest than these other indicators suggest?	13	1
201404	2847	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff looked into this question and found that the current pattern of relatively weak wage growth during the early and middle parts of a recovery is not actually unique.	13	1
201404	2848	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, the recoveries in the early 1990s and early 2000s displayed a similar pattern, in which wages lagged the cycle.	13	1
201404	2849	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In those episodes, unemployment gaps, though never as large as in the current episode, narrowed significantly before the pace of wage increases picked up from low levels.	13	1
201404	2850	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	To explain why a pickup in wage growth lags a strengthening labor market, research by my staff emphasizes that wages don’t adjust as quickly as we might think.	13	1
201404	2851	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, they find that nominal wage cuts are very rare.	13	1
201404	2852	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This downward nominal wage rigidity turns out to imply that wage growth remains low until the recovery is pretty well advanced.	13	1
201404	2853	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The constraint on wage cuts was particularly binding after the Great Recession, due to the severity of the economic shocks, along with low inflation.	13	1
201404	2854	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, a very high share of workers reported that they earned the same wage as they had earned a year earlier.	13	1
201404	2855	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Early in the recovery, the share of workers with essentially unchanged wages reached the highest level since the day the series began in 1980, nearing 17 percent in 2011.	13	1
201404	2856	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	That compares with about 11 percent in 2007.	13	1
201404	2857	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This pattern of a rising share of workers with unchanged wages was also seen in the recoveries of the early 1990s and 2000s.	13	1
201404	2858	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Earlier studies—including those by James Tobin, George Akerlof, and others— highlighted the importance of downward nominal wage rigidities.	13	1
201404	2859	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff extended this research to study the response to recessionary shocks.	13	1
201404	2860	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In their DSGE model, many workers should see wage cuts in a downturn but do not, because of the zero lower bound on wage adjustments.	13	1
201404	2861	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	That means that wage growth falls by less during the recession than it would otherwise, and, as a result, once the economy starts to recover, a stock-up of pent-up wage cuts needs to be overcome before the pace of wage increases can return to normal.	13	1
201404	2862	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This occurs only slowly as inflation and productivity growth bring real wages back into balance.	13	1
201404	2863	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The key takeaway is that muted wage growth, both in this model and based on historical experience, is entirely consistent with an improving labor market in a low-inflation environment.	13	1
201404	2864	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the model, wage growth lags the cycle and picks up only as we get closer to full employment.	13	1
201404	2865	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, this theoretical result matches what we saw in the 1990s and 2000s, two other periods in which downward nominal wage rigidity appeared to be binding for many workers.	13	1
201404	2866	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, as we close in on full employment over the next year or two, a return to more normal patterns of wage growth should reemerge.	13	1
201404	2867	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, we are seeing incipient signs of this normalization in the wage process, with the share of workers experiencing zero wage adjustments having already started to come down, albeit only slightly.	13	1
201404	2868	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201404	2869	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	2870	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201404	2871	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2872	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first quarter looks to be a disappointment, with real GDP growing close to 1 percent, much lower than what we’d expected at the time of the December FOMC meeting.	13	1
201404	2873	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Despite the setback, the economy does again seem poised to grow above potential over the course of this year.	13	1
201404	2874	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own forecast is for real GDP growth over the next three quarters to be around 3 percent, a little slower than the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201404	2875	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	One of the key issues in the forecast is the path of the labor force participation rate.	13	1
201404	2876	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	About half of the decline in labor force participation since the onset of the Great Recession is a result of an aging population.	13	1
201404	2877	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	There is an ongoing debate about how much of the other half of the decline—which reflects declines in participation rates within specific age cohorts, including prime-age working cohorts—is bound to be reversed as labor market conditions improve further.	13	1
201404	2878	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work done by the Boston staff has looked at the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, or PSID, which provides longitudinal data on individuals’ work history.	13	1
201404	2879	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	These data can be used to analyze the behavior of individuals who drop out of the labor force during stressful economic times—in particular, whether they’ve later been successful reentering the labor force.	13	1
201404	2880	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The study pooled individuals not in the labor force during the previous recessions and recoveries who had previously worked to try to better understand the extent of reentry by age group.	13	1
201404	2881	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The results indicate that 78 percent of the individuals between the ages of 25 and 44 who left the labor force during periods of economic stress were working again within four years.	13	1
201404	2882	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This drops to 40 percent for individuals in the 45-to-54 age cohort who exit the labor force during periods of economic stress.	13	1
201404	2883	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This indicates that roughly two-thirds of individuals in the 25-to-54 age cohort who historically left the workforce during the stressful economic period later reentered the workforce.	13	1
201404	2884	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Note that there are differences across time periods, and this period could be different than the historical average.	13	1
201404	2885	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, during periods of tight labor markets, such as the late 1990s, the data show significant reentry, even by workers who had previously left the labor force by retiring.	13	1
201404	2886	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	This research highlights that labor force participation is likely to improve as labor markets tighten, as past experience suggests that a substantial portion of the decline in labor force participation within age-specific cohorts during a recession and the early stages of a recovery is temporary.	13	1
201404	2887	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Both my somewhat slower real GDP growth projection compared with the Tealbook and my expectation that there is likely to be reentry into the labor force as labor markets tighten make me somewhat less optimistic than the Tealbook about how quickly we will reach full employment.	13	1
201404	2888	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	With PCE inflation well below our target and many advanced economies also experiencing unusually low inflation rates, we should be particularly attentive to whether incoming data are consistent with our inflation forecast.	13	1
201404	2889	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Low inflation and unusually low compensation growth give us the flexibility to try to more quickly normalize labor markets.	13	1
201404	2890	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2891	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	2892	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201404	2893	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2894	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Our District continues to perform in an unusual fashion.	13	1
201404	2895	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	As you may have seen with the latest releases of our manufacturing survey, service-sector survey, and retail-sector survey—which run through April 23, so they’re as recent as you can be—we’re seeing continued strong employment growth and longer workweeks.	13	1
201404	2896	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I have asked our analysts to look at our unemployment rate, particularly the denominator, because our unemployment rate is 5½ percent—just a little bit less than in the nation as a whole, where the rate is about 100 basis points more.	13	1
201404	2897	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It turns out that the denominator—that is, the availability of employable workers—has grown 10.3 percent since October 2008.	13	1
201404	2898	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So, even though our unemployment rate is high for us, it’s not North Dakota or Minnesota.	13	1
201404	2899	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a good point.	13	1
201404	2900	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But you haven’t had growth in the denominator like we’ve had.	13	1
201404	2901	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Anyway, I found that of interest.	13	1
201404	2902	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So we are seeing—and we reported it in the Beige Book—some labor shortages in energy, IT, construction, auditing—don’t ask me why—and some of the financial services, although they’re good growth sectors for us.	13	1
201404	2903	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We are beginning to see and hear reports anecdotally of some wage-price pressure in those sectors.	13	1
201404	2904	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	And, of course, as we’ve talked about at this table, in almost every District that is experiencing growth, there is a mismatch of skills.	13	1
201404	2905	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It ranges from the IT sector and engineering down to the truck drivers.	13	1
201404	2906	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	In that sense, we’re not unusual.	13	1
201404	2907	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We’re just growing at a strong pace.	13	1
201404	2908	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Just to comment very quickly on my interlocutors, I talked previously about what I call the growth muscle.	13	1
201404	2909	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I am beginning to detect a shift across the board of all of the 50 or so CEOs I’ve talked to around the country—big and small as well as public and private.	13	1
201404	2910	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	The shift is toward changing the mentality of their management to think about growth and not just be in a defensive crouch and worry about their bottom line.	13	1
201404	2911	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	There’s been an enormous emphasis on cost containment during this period, particularly when the tail risks seem rather large.	13	1
201404	2912	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I did note the comment on Ukraine.	13	1
201404	2913	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Among my corporate contacts, there’s almost no concern about Ukraine.	13	1
201404	2914	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	So you’re beginning to detect it, and you see it in some of the reports you’re getting.	13	1
201404	2915	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to draw somewhat from President Evans’s District—his chairman, the CEO of Manpower.	13	1
201404	2916	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	If you looked at their permanent recruitment activity for the first quarter, it was up 9 percent— not insignificant.	13	1
201404	2917	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	If you look at AT&T’s activity in terms of large enterprise, for the first time in almost six years, they’re actually seeing an increase in activity.	13	1
201404	2918	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	They have been reporting small business activity in terms of their connections with those companies since last December.	13	1
201404	2919	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We’ve seen that in the reports from the small business reporting groups.	13	1
201404	2920	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But you’re beginning to see a shift now with large enterprise as well.	13	1
201404	2921	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I do think that a change in mentality is beginning to occur.	13	1
201404	2922	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Before, it was completely cost containment and selling, general, and administrative expense, or SGA, containment.	13	1
201404	2923	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It was really driving margins and thinking about managing their bottom lines.	13	1
201404	2924	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	For the first time, I’m beginning to hear that, in a broad swath of businesses, they’re trying to think now about how they’re going to restructure their management mentality, their teams, and their budgeting—very importantly—toward growth.	13	1
201404	2925	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	It’s just beginning, and I would say one last thing.	13	1
201404	2926	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We talked a great deal about leverage and people using debt, of course, to buy back equity.	13	1
201404	2927	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	My sense is that that has, at least in the high-quality companies, almost run its course.	13	1
201404	2928	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Now, I would have been more firm about that if I hadn’t read into the Apple transaction that just took place, but that’s an odd transaction.	13	1
201404	2929	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Just parenthetically, it’s the first seven-for-one split in 35 years, and he picked the number seven because it’s a lucky number in China.	13	1
201404	2930	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	2931	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201404	2932	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2933	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	If I play my cards right, I’ll get the last word.	13	1
201404	2934	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	It’s possible.	13	1
201404	2935	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201404	2936	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Moral hazard.	13	1
201404	2937	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	March data indicate that the economy has experienced a rebound following the weather-influenced, weaker numbers of December through February, the exception being the housing data.	13	1
201404	2938	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, however, I’m encouraged by early indications of a resumption of activity levels that are consistent with the thesis that the economy will grow at an accelerated pace compared with the close to 2 percent average of the recovery through midyear 2013.	13	1
201404	2939	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	And that accelerated pace would be around 3 percent, as President Rosengren suggested.	13	1
201404	2940	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In our recent District conversations with directors and contacts, we sought anecdotal support for that working assumption—that the first quarter was heavily influenced by weather, and that there is a rebound under way and an outlook assuming a run rate of growth closer to 3 percent is realistic.	13	1
201404	2941	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Most of the feedback received was consistent with this view.	13	1
201404	2942	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Business activity has clearly picked up across my District, and, while better weather has bolstered the near-term outlook of our contacts, sentiment about the balance of 2014 and beyond seems more positive than at the time of the last meeting.	13	1
201404	2943	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	As one contact put it, there seems to be less reluctance to move forward.	13	1
201404	2944	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	According to the country’s largest auto retailer, sales in late March and through April were exceptionally strong, and there is confidence that the current strength of sales can be sustained.	13	1
201404	2945	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	A major utility in the Southeast reported that industrial power usage has picked up across 13 of 15 industry categories.	13	1
201404	2946	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Residential power demand as measured by both consumption and new home hookups has also been rising at a pace that appears to be greater than weather fluctuations would account for.	13	1
201404	2947	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We did hear of constraints to moving forward in some industries.	13	1
201404	2948	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Home construction is facing labor shortages and building materials cost pressures.	13	1
201404	2949	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Developed lots are said to be in short supply in a number of metro areas.	13	1
201404	2950	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The anecdotal inputs on the housing sector were not dire, however.	13	1
201404	2951	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Transportation firms are facing capacity constraints—principally, driver availability.	13	1
201404	2952	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, we did not hear reports that indicate a more generalized experience of growth constraints, wage pressures, or cost pressures.	13	1
201404	2953	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Based on March data and these anecdotal reports, I’m holding to an outlook of medium- term real GDP growth around 3 percent.	13	1
201404	2954	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	This is the same outlook I presented at the last meeting.	13	1
201404	2955	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m expecting this growth to be sufficient to keep net monthly job gains in the neighborhood of 200,000, even as productivity growth improves.	13	1
201404	2956	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook projects unemployment reaching 5¼ percent by the end of 2016 and inflation converging to our 2 percent objective about the same time.	13	1
201404	2957	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	With this baseline scenario, I have liftoff for the fed funds rate occurring late in 2015, followed by a gradual process of normalization of the policy rate.	13	1
201404	2958	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	In its essentials, my outlook doesn’t deviate significantly from that of this meeting’s Tealbook.	13	1
201404	2959	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff has proposed to me a monitoring and validation framework with a number of indicators but three bellwethers in particular:  industrial production growth, demand for capital goods, and consumer spending.	13	1
201404	2960	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Interestingly, we saw improvement in all of these categories in the March data.	13	1
201404	2961	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The main point I want to make in this round is that it will likely be very challenging over the coming months to see clear validation in the data of an assumed outlook of 3 percent economic growth.	13	1
201404	2962	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	We may not know for several quarters whether the economy is on a stronger sustained growth path.	13	1
201404	2963	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Given normal monthly variability of readings, distinguishing between a 3 percent and a 2 percent growth path may take a while.	13	1
201404	2964	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Certainly, there are risks around my outlook that are well captured by the range of alternative scenarios presented in the Tealbook.	13	1
201404	2965	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	The one I find most plausible is the “Weaker Household Demand” scenario.	13	1
201404	2966	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Because of the murkiness we may be dealing with as the data come in, I would counsel caution about projecting a funds rate liftoff too early and running risks in the Committee’s communication of the market pulling forward the date.	13	1
201404	2967	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	2968	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Lockhart.	13	1
201404	2969	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we do one last presentation?	13	1
201404	2970	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13	1
201404	2971	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Sorry to disappoint.	13	1
201404	2972	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve got to talk more slowly.	13	1
201404	2973	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201404	2974	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Knowing I was next?	13	1
201404	2975	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	We’ll be out of here by 10:30.	13	1
201404	2976	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Yes.	13	1
201404	2977	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	You’re between us and dinner.	13	1
201404	2978	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	[Laughter]	13	1
201404	2979	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll cooperate with my friends here.	13	1
201404	2980	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Reports on economic activity in the Fifth District have become more favorable, on balance, in recent weeks.	13	1
201404	2981	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The manufacturing index came in at plus 7 after two straight months of negative readings, and the services measure remained in positive territory.	13	1
201404	2982	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The strongest reports are coming from the Carolinas, where automotive and aerospace companies are expanding operations, particularly BMW and Boeing.	13	1
201404	2983	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Anecdotes from the northern half of the District are less favorable, with much of the difference reflecting restraint in federal spending, it seems.	13	1
201404	2984	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	District housing markets are quite uneven.	13	1
201404	2985	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Some areas are showing a modest rebound; others appear to be languishing.	13	1
201404	2986	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We hear a lot about rising costs of home construction due to the limited availability of lots, the rising cost of inputs, and a scarcity of construction workers, which some attribute in part to tougher enforcement of immigration laws.	13	1
201404	2987	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, retailers attending the High Point Furniture Market, which claims to be the world’s largest annual furniture trade show, reportedly had an upbeat attitude.	13	1
201404	2988	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national scene, the Tealbook made few changes.	13	1
201404	2989	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ve made few changes as well.	13	1
201404	2990	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I think the intermeeting reports haven’t been really informative enough to alter the outlook, so I’m still forecasting fairly tepid growth.	13	1
201404	2991	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll join my colleagues from the 1st and 12th Districts by providing a research report on labor markets.	13	1
201404	2992	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	We’ve often discussed whether the unemployment rate is a reliable measure of resource underutilization.	13	1
201404	2993	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I want to talk about—this is something I mentioned last time—a generalized index of labor underutilization that our folks have constructed.	13	1
201404	2994	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The project starts from the premise that there’s substantial underutilization beyond what’s captured in the standard unemployment rate.	13	1
201404	2995	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s motivated by the significant flows you see from out of the labor force directly to employment rather than spending time in unemployment.	13	1
201404	2996	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There are a lot of differences across nonemployed workers in the rate at which they transition to employment.	13	1
201404	2997	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The index is essentially a weighted average of everybody who’s not employed full time, but the weights have to do with the rate of transition to full-time work.	13	1
201404	2998	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And the differences are pretty significant.	13	1
201404	2999	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Here’s an interesting observation:  The short-term unemployed, those unemployed less than 26 weeks, have the highest probability of transitioning to full-time employment.	13	1
201404	3000	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s about 0.3.	13	1
201404	3001	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For the long-term unemployed, the probability of transitioning to full-time work is roughly half that—about 0.15.	13	1
201404	3002	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The striking feature of the data is that workers who are classified as out of the labor force by the BLS, meaning that they do not report having engaged in active search activities in the past four weeks but say they want a job, have virtually the same probability of transitioning to full- time employment as the long-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3003	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It’s about half the rate of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3004	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s true whether they’ve searched in the past year or not, and it’s true whether they say they’re discouraged by economic conditions or not.	13	1
201404	3005	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This suggests that the traditional distinction between discouraged workers who want a job and workers who aren’t discouraged but say they want a job isn’t as economically meaningful, in my opinion.	13	1
201404	3006	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Workers who tell the BLS they do not want a job have a markedly lower transition rate, as you’d expect, but, nonetheless, some of them just pop into the labor force.	13	1
201404	3007	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Holding aside the retirees and the disabled, who have really low transition rates, if you don’t want a job and you’re not in those groups, it’s about one-fourth of the rate of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3008	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The relative size of these employment probabilities seems pretty consistent over time, and that motivates what my researchers did, which was to take the weighted sum of the different nonemployed groups.	13	1
201404	3009	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The weight is the sample average of the employment probability relative to the sample average employment probability of the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3010	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So the short-term unemployed get a weight of 1, and everyone else gets weights of less than 1.	13	1
201404	3011	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	As you’d expect, the resulting index behaves very much like the unemployment rate, rising in recessions and falling in expansions.	13	1
201404	3012	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But it’s somewhat smoother and more persistent than the unemployment rate.	13	1
201404	3013	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment rate has fallen more rapidly than the nonemployment index since 2009.	13	1
201404	3014	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It turns out, though, that that always happens in recoveries.	13	1
201404	3015	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And it turns out that both rates of decline seem consistent with the past recoveries for which we have data.	13	1
201404	3016	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Plus, if you line up the level of any one nonemployment index—they have four or five versions—it’s about where it was when the unemployment rate last got to where it is now, if you understand what I’m saying.	13	1
201404	3017	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So in the previous expansion, when did the unemployment rate get to where it is now?	13	1
201404	3018	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Well, the nonemployment index is about where it was then.	13	1
201404	3019	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Relative to the unemployment rate, these nonemployment indexes are at about the same level as they were in past expansions.	13	1
201404	3020	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	They even have a version that takes into account part-time employment, although there are some nuances there that they’re still wrestling with.	13	1
201404	3021	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So, yes, there’s substantial underutilization in the labor market, beyond what is captured in the standard unemployment rate, but, at least according to these measures, no more than is usually associated with this level of unemployment.	13	1
201404	3022	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a question?	13	1
201404	3023	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	How does this weigh into the short-term versus long-term unemployment rate distinction?	13	1
201404	3024	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You seem to be saying that the unemployment rate is a pretty good summary statistic.	13	1
201404	3025	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So, by inference, you’d then be saying that this distinction between short-term and long-term unemployed doesn’t have a lot of value.	13	1
201404	3026	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	No—it does.	13	1
201404	3027	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, it does, but adjusting for that—	13	1
201404	3028	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But, in terms of employment probability, being in the labor force and long-term unemployed, you look exactly like a discouraged worker.	13	1
201404	3029	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m asking a slightly different question.	13	1
201404	3030	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re basically saying that the unemployment rate today is a good summary measure of unemployment.	13	1
201404	3031	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Some people are arguing that the unemployment rate today is not a good summary statistic, and that you want to look at the short-term unemployment rate.	13	1
201404	3032	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Oh, that?	13	1
201404	3033	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Ah—gee, I don’t know what it says about that.	13	1
201404	3034	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That’s a good question.	13	1
201404	3035	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But you are saying this—that the unemployment rate is a good summary statistic based on that work?	13	1
201404	3036	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	13	1
201404	3037	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201404	3038	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker’s got the last word.	13	1
201404	3039	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Sorry, President Lockhart.	13	1
201404	3040	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s take a break, have a nice dinner, and see everyone tomorrow at 9:00.	13	1
201404	3041	2014-04-30	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	13	1
201404	3042	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	April 30 Session .	13	1
201404	3043	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201404	3044	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everyone.	13	1
201404	3045	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to start with Bill Wascher.	13	1
201404	3046	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Bill is going to tell us about the GDP figures.	13	1
201404	3047	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3048	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	We received several data releases this morning, and I’ll start with the BEA’s advance estimate of first-quarter GDP growth.	13	1
201404	3049	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	According to that estimate, real GDP edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201404	3050	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was a somewhat weaker reading than the 0.7 percent increase we had projected in the Tealbook.	13	1
201404	3051	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	A good bit of the surprise relative to our forecast was in inventories, which subtracted 0.6 percentage point from GDP growth last quarter.	13	1
201404	3052	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Final sales rose 0.7 percent.	13	1
201404	3053	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was a touch weaker than our forecast of a 0.9 percent increase.	13	1
201404	3054	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Within final sales, consumer spending rose 3 percent.	13	1
201404	3055	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was about ½ percentage point more than we’d forecast.	13	1
201404	3056	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In contrast, business fixed investment fell about 2 percent.	13	1
201404	3057	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was versus our forecast for a 2 percent increase.	13	1
201404	3058	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Residential investment fell 5.7 percent, and we had projected a 2 percent decline—so a bigger decline in residential investment than we’d projected.	13	1
201404	3059	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	As expected, exports fell sharply and net exports subtracted nearly 1 percentage point from GDP growth in the first quarter.	13	1
201404	3060	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	The net export numbers are pretty close to what Steve had reported yesterday.	13	1
201404	3061	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Given that a lot of the miss was in inventories, I don’t think we would take much signal from this report for the trajectory of GDP over the rest of the year.	13	1
201404	3062	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In fact, given that the level of inventory investment was so low in the first quarter, we would probably be inclined to forecast it to step back up over the next few quarters.	13	1
201404	3063	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	So I think that at this point, we would still write down something for GDP growth in the neighborhood of 3½ percent over the rest of the year.	13	1
201404	3064	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	There weren’t any material surprises in the price data.	13	1
201404	3065	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Total PCE prices rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter, while the core PCE index was up 1.3 percent, and both of those were very close to what we were expecting.	13	1
201404	3066	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Regarding other releases, the BLS published the employment cost index this morning.	13	1
201404	3067	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Total compensation for private-industry workers rose at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201404	3068	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was well below our forecast for a 2½ percent increase.	13	1
201404	3069	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Increases in both wages and benefits came in lower than we’d expected.	13	1
201404	3070	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	On a 12-month change basis, compensation costs over the year ending in March were up 1.7 percent; we had about a 2 percent increase over that 12-month period in the Tealbook.	13	1
201404	3071	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Finally, ADP released its estimate of payroll employment for April.	13	1
201404	3072	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Its measure showed an increase of 220,000 in private employment this month after an upward- revised increase of 209,000 in March.	13	1
201404	3073	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Our Tealbook projection assumes that the BLS will report an increase of 215,000 for April when they release the employment report this Friday, so today’s ADP figure is obviously right in line with that.	13	1
201404	3074	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3075	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3076	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Bill?	13	1
201404	3077	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m sorry.	13	1
201404	3078	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What was the ADP number again?	13	1
201404	3079	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	It was 220,000.	13	1
201404	3080	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I just didn’t hear.	13	1
201404	3081	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3082	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t get consumer spending.	13	1
201404	3083	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Consumer spending rose 3 percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201404	3084	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	That was about ½ percentage point stronger than we had forecast.	13	1
201404	3085	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3086	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201404	3087	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we proceed with our go-round?	13	1
201404	3088	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201404	3089	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3090	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Eighth District contacts indicated during the intermeeting period that the economy continued to advance at a modest pace in the first part of 2014.	13	1
201404	3091	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	On net, key District data also suggest modest improvement.	13	1
201404	3092	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The District’s unemployment rate, however, moved up slightly during the quarter and remains above the national rate.	13	1
201404	3093	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	We continue to watch District labor market conditions closely, as the trends in the District have diverged somewhat in recent quarters relative to the nation as a whole.	13	1
201404	3094	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	While national data on housing have been soft in recent reports, District contacts in the housing industry remain optimistic, and, in this respect, my report mirrors that of President Williams.	13	1
201404	3095	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Many real estate professionals in the District cite a low supply of existing homes as a key concern.	13	1
201404	3096	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	They also cite a substantial increase in multifamily housing coming into the market in 2014.	13	1
201404	3097	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	That means actually built and ready to occupy.	13	1
201404	3098	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	They surmise that this is putting downward pressure on rents and may deter new home sales on the margin.	13	1
201404	3099	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	District firms with global presence are reporting strong results from Europe relative to a year ago.	13	1
201404	3100	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Firms seem undeterred by unrest in Ukraine.	13	1
201404	3101	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In this respect, my report mirrors that of President Fisher.	13	1
201404	3102	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	While this event could certainly develop into a more important macroeconomic drag, at this point, I agree with my business contacts that the situation seems too far removed from the center of the European or the US macroeconomy to have a significant effect.	13	1
201404	3103	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	ECB policymakers appear to be much closer to a major step into unconventional monetary policy than they have been at any time since the financial crisis.	13	1
201404	3104	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	This may include a sizable quantitative easing program, depending on how the European economy develops in the coming months.	13	1
201404	3105	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, a significant step by the ECB would dramatically alter the mix of policies among major central banks.	13	1
201404	3106	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	If the ECB does make a move, I believe it will come as a surprise to financial markets, as the ECB has been very reluctant, for good institutional reasons, to cross the line into unconventional policy.	13	1
201404	3107	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I believe the possible ECB action would be a game changer for the global economic outlook should it occur.	13	1
201404	3108	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	For the US economy, I continue to hold the view, notwithstanding today’s GDP report, that the unexpected slowdown in first-quarter GDP growth is a result of unusually severe weather, and that the second quarter is likely to show sharp improvement.	13	1
201404	3109	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In this respect, my outlook is the same as the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201404	3110	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	My District contacts concur with that assessment, and many can cite weekly or daily sales and related data showing marked improvement as temperatures warmed and weather-related events receded.	13	1
201404	3111	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	One logistics company said it had hundreds of tractor-trailers snowbound during the first quarter, far above average for this company, causing a dramatic increase in costs and a deterioration of firm performance.	13	1
201404	3112	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Yet underlying demand measured by volume seemed to remain on track.	13	1
201404	3113	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	In fact, many firms report upwardly revised plans for capital expenditures in 2014, reflecting considerable confidence for the remainder of the year.	13	1
201404	3114	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation continues to run low but has stabilized, and I think it will now turn upward in coming reports.	13	1
201404	3115	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	We need to watch these developments closely.	13	1
201404	3116	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3117	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3118	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	13	1
201404	3119	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3120	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The incoming economic data have been consistent with my prior assumption that most of the first quarter’s softness was due to severe weather.	13	1
201404	3121	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	My staff estimates that weather effects depressed GDP growth by a bit less than 1 percentage point in the first quarter.	13	1
201404	3122	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	My forecast for economic growth for the rest of the year remains near 3 percent, and, while progress on the unemployment rate has stalled in recent months, I continue to expect that unemployment rates should resume their decline in coming months.	13	1
201404	3123	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	While most of the incoming data have been reassuring, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the recent news on the housing market.	13	1
201404	3124	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The data on new and existing homes, permits, and mortgage originations for purchases have all been weaker than expected.	13	1
201404	3125	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Construction bottlenecks; a pullback by potential homebuyers after a run-up in prices over the past few years; and, of course, some weather effects could all be factors that are holding back the housing recovery.	13	1
201404	3126	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Another potential factor that we should not ignore is credit availability.	13	1
201404	3127	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	That is, tight lending standards might still be holding back the housing recovery.	13	1
201404	3128	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Some recent reports suggest that mortgage lending standards have fallen sharply, which might be expected to give the housing recovery a lift.	13	1
201404	3129	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	However, analysis done by my staff indicates that the decline in the average FICO score of mortgage borrowers since the beginning of 2013 has been driven by refinancings.	13	1
201404	3130	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	By contrast, FICO scores for newly originated purchase mortgages through February of this year have essentially been unchanged since mid-2012, and they remain at historically high levels.	13	1
201404	3131	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	I still think that the housing market should see a pickup in growth in coming months, supported by job growth, by demographic demand for housing, and by interest rates that remain historically low.	13	1
201404	3132	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	That said, I believe it’s important for the Committee to keep an eye on the sources of recent weakness in the housing sector.	13	1
201404	3133	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Turning to inflation, unlike the Tealbook, I found the latest price data a little surprising, and, for a change, it was a pleasant surprise.	13	1
201404	3134	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	The headline, core, and median CPI all increased 0.2 percent, month over month, in March—more than I expected.	13	1
201404	3135	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Price gains were notable in the categories of food and shelter, but there was a general move toward higher monthly inflation rates across the distribution of components.	13	1
201404	3136	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Because this is only one data release, it is difficult to distinguish trend from noise, but it does raise the welcome possibility that inflation might be on a firmer trajectory.	13	1
201404	3137	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As a result, I have slightly edged up my forecast path for inflation, and I now anticipate that headline PCE inflation will be approximately 2 percent by the end of 2016.	13	1
201404	3138	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	In general, I see the risks to my projection as being broadly balanced.	13	1
201404	3139	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	A persistent slowdown in housing does pose a downside risk to my outlook for the real economy.	13	1
201404	3140	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	But it is also possible that severe weather has weighed on economic activity more than I estimate, and the economy could be poised for an even larger rebound.	13	1
201404	3141	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Depending on whether future price data are more like the March data or those of the preceding months, there are also upside and downside risks to my inflation forecast.	13	1
201404	3142	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3143	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3144	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201404	3145	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair, and good morning, everyone.	13	1
201404	3146	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District has rebounded from the disruptions caused by the severe winter weather.	13	1
201404	3147	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Returning to a moderate pace of growth, it looks a lot like it did in the last three quarters of 2013.	13	1
201404	3148	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Business contacts are generally quite optimistic.	13	1
201404	3149	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	After contracting in February, our regional manufacturing activity increased in March and improved again in April.	13	1
201404	3150	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Our Business Outlook Survey’s indexes of general activity, new orders, and shipments all showed sizable increases in April.	13	1
201404	3151	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The general activity index, which fell to minus 6.3 in February, moved up to 9 in March and 16.6 in April.	13	1
201404	3152	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	One firm that both manufactures and sells latches and other types of equipment worldwide indicates very strong sales growth around the world—particularly in Europe, which I thought was quite interesting—and a very strong pipeline.	13	1
201404	3153	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It is looking for a very strong year this year.	13	1
201404	3154	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The employment index in the Business Outlook Survey also moved up in April, perhaps signaling that we will see a turnaround in employment for our three states in April.	13	1
201404	3155	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So far, this year’s payroll employment is down slightly in our three states—that is, just since January— falling at an annual pace of 0.1 percent.	13	1
201404	3156	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My staff believes that much of this weakness is weather related.	13	1
201404	3157	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The region’s unemployment rate has fallen 0.2 percentage point.	13	1
201404	3158	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	District retailers, especially auto dealers, saw strong sales growth last month, as consumers apparently emerged from hibernation.	13	1
201404	3159	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Our contact at one firm that sells recreational vehicles said that, in the month of January, he did zero sales—zero.	13	1
201404	3160	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Yet in March, he sold so much that his overall quarter results are back to where he thought they were going to be.	13	1
201404	3161	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Basically, all of the zero sales in January and weak sales in February were made up in the month of March.	13	1
201404	3162	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So he’s, as he says, back on track.	13	1
201404	3163	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Bank lending has actually moved up in recent weeks, particularly in the categories of service activity and other retailers.	13	1
201404	3164	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Bankers have noted somewhat stronger demand for C&I loans, something that’s a pleasant surprise to them, and they’re pleased about that.	13	1
201404	3165	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And the bankers tend to be more optimistic about lending than they have been in several months.	13	1
201404	3166	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Not surprisingly, though, construction has been more mixed—still feeling the effects of the winter, I believe.	13	1
201404	3167	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Local builders continue to report weather-related disruptions to new home sales, but they did say that consumer traffic and contract signings have improved in March, and most expected a strong spring sales season.	13	1
201404	3168	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Commercial real estate contacts said that nonresidential real estate activity has turned around and is now back to normal levels after the rough winter.	13	1
201404	3169	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Indeed, as I’d mentioned last time, several major office building constructions are going to break ground in Center City, Philadelphia, this summer.	13	1
201404	3170	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Overall, spring has sprung in the District, and our contacts are optimistic about the pickup in activity in coming months.	13	1
201404	3171	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My medium-term outlook for the national economy is little changed since our last meeting.	13	1
201404	3172	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The rebound in national economic activity since the severe winter is consistent with my outlook that economic growth will return to a little bit above trend for the rest of this year, around 3 percent, before returning to what I believe is a steady-state growth of about 2.4 percent in 2016.	13	1
201404	3173	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Although the indicators on the housing market were a bit mixed, I believe the bad weather is responsible for much of this recent softness.	13	1
201404	3174	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I expect to see some rebound in coming months, and that’s consistent with our contacts.	13	1
201404	3175	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The labor market continues to improve steadily.	13	1
201404	3176	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Payrolls rose 192,000 in March after an upward revision to February, which now stands at 197,000.	13	1
201404	3177	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The unemployment rate remained at a steady 6.7 percent, partly because the labor force expanded, which I think is probably good news, not bad news.	13	1
201404	3178	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I expect the unemployment rate to decline to 6.2 percent or lower by the end of this year and below 5.8 percent by the end of 2015, which I believe is roughly our natural rate.	13	1
201404	3179	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Inflation remains low, but recent figures, as others have indicated, suggest that it certainly seems to be stabilizing and perhaps drifting up a bit.	13	1
201404	3180	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that’s good news.	13	1
201404	3181	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I continue to forecast that inflation will gradually move back to our target over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201404	3182	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	In my view, economic performance and the outlook indicate that it still is appropriate to continue our pace of reduction in asset purchases into this fall.	13	1
201404	3183	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	However, I do believe we will need to consider raising the federal funds rate sooner than in the Tealbook.	13	1
201404	3184	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My modal policy rate path calls for a slightly more gradual increase in rates than implied by traditional policy rules.	13	1
201404	3185	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	However, the economy has shown itself to be quite resilient, and solid employment gains, coupled with a reduced drag from fiscal policy and improvements in the household balance sheet, make it conceivable that this growth rate may become stronger than we are forecasting.	13	1
201404	3186	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Rates may have to move faster and higher than we are currently anticipating.	13	1
201404	3187	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Our policy discussion yesterday underscores, I think, the challenges that our very large balance sheet poses for normalizing our policy framework.	13	1
201404	3188	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	If our balance sheet provides the type of accommodation that this Committee has repeatedly claimed, then our reluctance to shrink our balance sheet in a timely manner is likely to require rates to rise faster than they otherwise would.	13	1
201404	3189	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But, as I said, there are other reasons to desire shrinking our balance sheet as well, and I’ve talked about those in the past.	13	1
201404	3190	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Therefore, I think it would be prudent to begin shrinking our balance sheet before we start raising rates.	13	1
201404	3191	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	A step in that direction could begin shortly after our LSAP program ends, as we begin to slow the reinvestment process.	13	1
201404	3192	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That should be on the table for us.	13	1
201404	3193	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3194	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3195	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201404	3196	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3197	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	The incoming data on the real economy support the view that the first-quarter weakness in activity was largely transitory.	13	1
201404	3198	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	My business contacts and directors are more upbeat than they have been in quite a while.	13	1
201404	3199	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s in line with my forecast expectations.	13	1
201404	3200	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We’re still looking for economic growth to average 3 percent or so over the remainder of the year.	13	1
201404	3201	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	By the June meeting, we should have a better sense of whether the pickup in activity in the March numbers represents the beginning of a more solid and sustainable step-up in growth or whether it’s just a transitory bounceback from the weather and other factors that depressed January and February activity.	13	1
201404	3202	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	But, with what I know right now, I’m feeling somewhat more confident about growth prospects than I did at our last meeting.	13	1
201404	3203	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	On the inflation front, I continue to be worried that inflation is much too low.	13	1
201404	3204	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Perhaps one could look at the past couple of quarters of core PCE inflation and say that the transitory factors are behind us and inflation is running a bit higher, but the Tealbook’s estimate over the past six months is still just 1.3 percent.	13	1
201404	3205	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	That’s really not much to get excited about.	13	1
201404	3206	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	A 1.3 percent run rate is still well below where inflation ought to be.	13	1
201404	3207	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	My business contacts continue to report no significant pricing pressures.	13	1
201404	3208	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	For example, at a manufacturing roundtable we held a few weeks ago, no one talked about input cost increases.	13	1
201404	3209	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	The steelmakers were grousing about low prices.	13	1
201404	3210	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Manufacturers didn’t seem worried about any cost pressures in the pipeline, either.	13	1
201404	3211	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Some of my auto contacts are concerned about softer pricing.	13	1
201404	3212	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	They’ve seen a buildup in car inventories that’s holding down prices, and they tend to talk about the decline in the yen and the weakness in China as reasons to expect further downside pressure on prices, both on autos and on overall pricing more generally.	13	1
201404	3213	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Finally, no one expects any broad-based wage increases.	13	1
201404	3214	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I guess this morning’s ECI was in line with that thought, wasn’t it?	13	1
201404	3215	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I only hear more of the same talk about shortages of certain kinds of skilled workers that we’ve been hearing for years, which have not shown through into any meaningful pickup in aggregate measures of labor compensation.	13	1
201404	3216	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	In sum, I have not seen any developments since our March meeting that alter my thinking about the macroeconomic backdrop for our policy decision today.	13	1
201404	3217	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We appear to be seeing a welcome and long-overdue pickup in economic growth to a more solid pace—it’s always unfortunate when we get that 0.1 percent, though, on the day that we have this meeting—but this economic growth needs the continued support of highly accommodative policy in order to be sustained.	13	1
201404	3218	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	And there’s nothing new on the inflation front to suggest we’re making anything more than painfully slow progress, at best, back toward our inflation target.	13	1
201404	3219	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3220	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3221	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201404	3222	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3223	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Throughout most of the 10th District, labor market conditions continue to tighten.	13	1
201404	3224	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Four of the seven District states have unemployment rates below 5 percent, and, in our manufacturing survey, the number of firms reporting wage pressures has again reached levels last seen prior to the crisis.	13	1
201404	3225	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Nearly one-half reported some kind of wage pressure, and about two-thirds were reporting labor shortages.	13	1
201404	3226	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Some of the most pronounced labor shortages are in the transportation sector.	13	1
201404	3227	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	One Colorado trucking contact reported that a seasonal upswing has allowed him to name his price in many cases.	13	1
201404	3228	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, spring crop planning is well under way, although drought remains a significant concern in parts of the District.	13	1
201404	3229	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Currently, large swaths of Kansas and Oklahoma are classified as being in severe drought, which could affect agriculture production in the region.	13	1
201404	3230	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, there is evidence that energy activity is providing some offset to the effects of the drought in those areas.	13	1
201404	3231	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national economy, my outlook is little changed compared with January, with a soft first quarter due to swings in inventories and net exports and a stronger second quarter, leaving my overall outlook for 2014 near 2½ percent.	13	1
201404	3232	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, I continue to expect above-trend growth of 3 percent starting in the second quarter and lasting into late 2015.	13	1
201404	3233	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	This is slightly below the Tealbook forecast, though I see the risks to economic growth around my projection as broadly balanced, whereas the Tealbook notes some downside risk.	13	1
201404	3234	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I think the improvement in labor markets and household finances is becoming more apparent.	13	1
201404	3235	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers has increased 0.8 percentage point over the past six months, close to its fastest pace of improvement at any point in the past 15 years.	13	1
201404	3236	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	And the probability that households attach to an increase in personal income in the year ahead, based on the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, reached a post-recession high.	13	1
201404	3237	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, inflation seems poised to move gradually higher and reach 2 percent by the end of 2015.	13	1
201404	3238	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Temporary factors that have been weighing on inflation are subsiding, while other factors, such as food and shelter costs, are strengthening.	13	1
201404	3239	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	The USDA projects the food component of the CPI to rise about 3 percent by the end of this year, compared with its current pace of 1.7 percent, and shelter costs in the CPI are up 2.7 percent on a year-over-year basis, the fastest pace in over five years.	13	1
201404	3240	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	While construction of new single-family homes has been proceeding at only a modest pace, multifamily construction has been more rapid.	13	1
201404	3241	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	And research by my staff has highlighted that the aging of the population is likely to require still substantially more investment in multifamily units as baby boomers downsize.	13	1
201404	3242	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, it seems unlikely that a marked slowing in shelter costs over the forecast horizon will occur from a substantial rise in available housing.	13	1
201404	3243	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Taken together, these factors, along with the continued stable longer-term inflation expectations and diminishing labor market slack, suggest to me that inflation will move higher and likely reach 2 percent by the end of 2015.	13	1
201404	3244	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3245	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3246	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201404	3247	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3248	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll discuss my national economic outlook, I’ll talk about some information from the Ninth District, and I’ll talk about some interesting econometric analysis my staff has done using cross-MSA data.	13	1
201404	3249	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My national economic outlook has changed little since the last meeting.	13	1
201404	3250	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The critical feature of that outlook is that, under the assumptions about monetary policy in the Tealbook, Book A, I see inflation running below target until 2018.	13	1
201404	3251	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The situation in the Ninth District supports that low-inflation outlook.	13	1
201404	3252	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As we talked to local contacts, we spent a considerable amount of time trying to elicit information about wage pressures.	13	1
201404	3253	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate is extremely low in parts of the Ninth District.	13	1
201404	3254	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the Bakken oil counties of eastern Montana and western North Dakota, the unemployment rate is 1.5 percent.	13	1
201404	3255	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the unemployment rate in late 2013 slipped below 3 percent.	13	1
201404	3256	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It should not be surprising that there are signs of noticeable wage pressures in these parts of the District, and there are.	13	1
201404	3257	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, populationwise, these are small pockets.	13	1
201404	3258	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More generally in the District, even though the unemployment rate has fallen to under 5 percent, wage pressures remain subdued.	13	1
201404	3259	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our contacts typically report that current anticipated wage increases lie in the usual tight band between 2 percent and 3 percent.	13	1
201404	3260	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, the conversation that we had yesterday about nominal wage rigidities being responsible for the slow wage growth—President Williams’s remarks yesterday about this—we heard echoed in conversations with our labor contacts earlier this year.	13	1
201404	3261	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They actually came up with this themselves—nothing prompted it.	13	1
201404	3262	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Employers weren’t able to lower wages enough during the downturn, so they’re waiting before increasing wages on the way out.	13	1
201404	3263	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ve mentioned before, one possible reason why wage pressures have remained subdued is that, although the unemployment rate is close to historical norms in the District, a large fraction of the labor force is working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201404	3264	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, even though the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 percent, the fraction of the labor force that’s working part time for economic reasons remains quite high by historical standards.	13	1
201404	3265	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Recently, my staff conducted some empirical work that validated the importance of this metric in assessing inflationary pressures.	13	1
201404	3266	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you may recall, a few meetings ago, I described the results of cross-MSA, Phillips-curve estimates obtained by Minneapolis Fed staff.	13	1
201404	3267	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At that time, they had found a stable and plausible relationship between U-3 and inflation.	13	1
201404	3268	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The more recent work has added an additional variable—the fraction of workers who are part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201404	3269	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This variable entered significantly, in both an economic and statistical sense, when they included it in a Phillips-curve regression with the usual unemployment rate, U-3.	13	1
201404	3270	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be interesting, in terms of President Lacker’s description of the work that’s being done by Richmond Fed staff, to try to do the same kind of analysis with their new measure of labor market underutilization and determine how well that predicts inflation across MSAs.	13	1
201404	3271	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I should emphasize the following point: I see these cross-MSA estimates as being more informative about the true relationship between national unemployment and national inflation than aggregate Phillips curve estimates.	13	1
201404	3272	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why do I say that?	13	1
201404	3273	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Aggregate Phillips-curve estimates are contaminated by the endogenous response of monetary policy to demand shocks.	13	1
201404	3274	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The cross-MSA results are not contaminated by this response.	13	1
201404	3275	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You have a local demand shock in Minneapolis–St Paul.	13	1
201404	3276	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC does not respond to that.	13	1
201404	3277	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Aggregate monetary policy is not responding to MSA-specific shocks.	13	1
201404	3278	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the cross-MSA estimates are actually cleaner estimates of the aggregate Phillips curve than we can get from aggregate data.	13	1
201404	3279	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To sum up, like the Tealbook, I continue to expect PCE inflation to remain below target for the next four years.	13	1
201404	3280	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the Ninth District, wage pressures remain subdued in the face of less than 5 percent unemployment, and Minneapolis Fed empirical work suggests that the high fraction of workers who are part time for economic reasons at the national level will continue to put downward pressure on inflation as the economy improves.	13	1
201404	3281	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3282	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3283	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201404	3284	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3285	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My views on the economic growth outlook, just like everybody else’s, haven’t changed much since the last meeting.	13	1
201404	3286	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I did expect the first quarter to be weaker for a whole variety of reasons, including the weather, but it did turn out to be even weaker than I’d expected.	13	1
201404	3287	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not very disturbed by that, though, given that the March data set shows a rebound in production and retail sales and the apparent steady trend in payroll employment growth.	13	1
201404	3288	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, to build on Charlie Evans’s comments, I do think there is some residual uncertainty.	13	1
201404	3289	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re clearly going to bounce in the second quarter, but to what level?	13	1
201404	3290	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And then what’s the underlying trend after the bounce?	13	1
201404	3291	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s going to take a little time to get that.	13	1
201404	3292	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m with everyone else that the underlying trend is around 3 percent, but I do think there is some uncertainty until we actually see that trend materialize.	13	1
201404	3293	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the economy, the key area that I’m focusing on is business fixed investment because that’s the area that’s been really unusually weak relative to the fundamentals.	13	1
201404	3294	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You have high profit margins, high stock market valuation relative to book value, and healthy balance sheets.	13	1
201404	3295	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet, as we saw in the first quarter, business fixed investment declined.	13	1
201404	3296	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we’re going to get a meaningful pickup in economic growth this year, it seems to me that investment and housing have to be the main sources.	13	1
201404	3297	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The conversations that we’ve had with smaller businesses do suggest greater optimism with respect to investment, but we’ll see if that actually materializes.	13	1
201404	3298	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	My views on inflation haven’t changed much, either.	13	1
201404	3299	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	On the margin, I am becoming more confident that the year-over-year inflation readings will drift up over the remainder of the year, and I think this might happen even faster than in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201404	3300	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Part of this reflects the fact that there were important base effects a year ago in terms of prices for imports excluding petroleum, which were unusually soft last spring and summer.	13	1
201404	3301	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Medical costs were held down by the cut in Medicare disbursements last April, so that will drop out of the year-over-year numbers shortly.	13	1
201404	3302	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But part of it reflects my view that some of the other trends that have held down inflation are reversing, and in that bucket I would put prices for medical goods and services, which were unusually weak for a while, and owners’ equivalent rent.	13	1
201404	3303	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve already seen a flattening out of the core inflation measures on a year-over-year basis.	13	1
201404	3304	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So I expect that the bottom is in and these readings will creep higher, perhaps more rapidly than in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201404	3305	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I have a few thoughts on the recent debate about what drives compensation trends—short-term unemployment versus long-term unemployment.	13	1
201404	3306	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve read a bunch of the papers, and where I come out is described by five points.	13	1
201404	3307	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, one has to be very skeptical about the econometric results when you have two variables that are so collinear, and so it’s very sensitive to the time period you pick.	13	1
201404	3308	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s a great deal of skepticism just because of the collinearity.	13	1
201404	3309	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think it does depend on why one turns out to be long-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3310	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are two possibilities.	13	1
201404	3311	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	One is, you’re long-term unemployed because you don’t have the appropriate job skills.	13	1
201404	3312	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	This is a case of mismatch.	13	1
201404	3313	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s very different from the other reason why you might be long-term unemployed:  You might have lost your job during the deep recession, and there’s a lack of labor demand.	13	1
201404	3314	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So you’re long-term unemployed not because you don’t have the right skills, but just because there’s a lack of labor demand for you.	13	1
201404	3315	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In the first case, you’re not very attached to the labor market, but in the second case, you’re just unlucky.	13	1
201404	3316	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re long-term unemployed due to bad timing.	13	1
201404	3317	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	In the current situation, I would expect that a greater proportion of those who are currently long-term unemployed are in the unlucky category as opposed to not having the appropriate skills.	13	1
201404	3318	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	A third observation is that the impact of the long-term unemployed on wages presumably depends on whether there’s an excess supply of short-term unemployed or not.	13	1
201404	3319	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If there are plenty of short-term unemployed, I think they’ll get the opportunities first, because we see that there’s a clear bias against people who are long-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3320	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as there are plenty of short-term unemployed, this will show up as the long-term unemployed being relatively unattached.	13	1
201404	3321	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But once the pool of short-term unemployed is depleted, the long-term unemployed will become more relevant in terms of labor market supply.	13	1
201404	3322	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So their impact on the labor market and wages will increase as the labor market tightens.	13	1
201404	3323	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s quite as static as some of these reports suggest.	13	1
201404	3324	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Fourth, as is generally the case, I don’t think this is black or white.	13	1
201404	3325	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I can’t believe that, if you’re unemployed beyond 26 weeks, something happens at that point; I think it’s probably a gradient.	13	1
201404	3326	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And I’m pretty comfortable with the idea that, on average, as you become more unemployed for a longer period of time, you become somewhat less attached to the labor market.	13	1
201404	3327	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But the idea that you’re either attached or unattached seems way too simple.	13	1
201404	3328	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Fifth, it seems obvious to me that labor demand is weak, completely apart from this debate.	13	1
201404	3329	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Some people are acting as though this is the way to measure whether the labor market is weak.	13	1
201404	3330	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if you look at the labor market in terms of the transition from unemployment to employment, that’s well below the historical average for all durations of unemployment.	13	1
201404	3331	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So you could set this whole story aside, and you would still reach the conclusion that labor market demand is quite weak.	13	1
201404	3332	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this whole debate has assumed greater significance than, in fact, it probably deserves.	13	1
201404	3333	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3334	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3335	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201404	3336	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3337	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I subscribe to the view that many of you have already stated—that we can expect a bounceback in the economy this quarter—but I would also subscribe to the Evans-Dudley gloss that we need to be watching to see whether this actually gets us back to the track that people were expecting.	13	1
201404	3338	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The only thing I would add to what many of you have said is that I think the major downside risks are now actually external, which, in one sense, is good news, because the US economy, we believe, does have some resilience and is going to have some self-sustaining momentum.	13	1
201404	3339	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	On the other hand, we can’t do much about the external risks.	13	1
201404	3340	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The two that I’ll identify—and this is hardly a surprise—are China, on which views among even the well informed seem to differ considerably right now, and Ukraine–Russia.	13	1
201404	3341	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The latter is obviously geopolitical in origin and just a wildcard that’s not susceptible to prediction by businesspeople or a particularly salient response by economic policymakers.	13	1
201404	3342	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Like many of you—most recently, Bill—I want to return to some of the labor market issues that we’ve been discussing.	13	1
201404	3343	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, these comments, I think, will complement what Vice Chairman Dudley and President Kocherlakota have been saying.	13	1
201404	3344	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	As people will recall, I’ve been suggesting that we should be pretty cautious about drawing too strong a conclusion with respect to current labor market problems based on expectations or extrapolations from past trends.	13	1
201404	3345	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	We have a very different set of circumstances from even the serious recessions of the post–World War II period—most notably, in the persistence of high levels of long-term unemployment.	13	1
201404	3346	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Historically, of course, national rates of short-term unemployment and long- term unemployment pretty much move together, and that has not been the case here.	13	1
201404	3347	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So I continue to be skeptical of arguments such as the one asserting that the detachment of the long- term unemployed from the labor market based on the observation that the Beveridge curve shifts seem to have been driven by long-term unemployment.	13	1
201404	3348	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	If you look at a long-term unemployment Beveridge curve from past recessions, it’s always shifted more than a short-term unemployment curve.	13	1
201404	3349	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	One difference is that in past postwar recessions, we had neither the long- term unemployed nor the persistence of high numbers of long-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3350	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So the looping back occurred fairly quickly.	13	1
201404	3351	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Similarly, it seems a little questionable to rely on the relationship between national unemployment and inflation rates as observed prior to the mid-1990s, when core inflation declined significantly and the Phillips curve appeared to flatten.	13	1
201404	3352	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why I’ve thought that we can’t really draw much from such observations that would give us a particularly good prediction about what’s going to be happening in current circumstances.	13	1
201404	3353	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So I’ve suggested that we need to be practical in our responses.	13	1
201404	3354	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Now, since the last meeting, not much has changed in the labor market, for reasons many of you have already stated.	13	1
201404	3355	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	What has changed, I think—and we already heard some examples of it yesterday afternoon and this morning—is that we’re starting to get some empirical work specifically investigating the question of whether the long-term unemployed constitute an important element of labor market slack in the current, historically atypical circumstance of high levels for an extended period.	13	1
201404	3356	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And I’d just add in passing that I think President Kocherlakota’s focus on the part-time employed for economic reasons probably complements this, because there’s been a pretty strong correlation between the long-term unemployed and the part-time employed for economic reasons over the past five years or so.	13	1
201404	3357	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	A number of researchers have begun to look at state or metropolitan-area data, thereby moving from a single data set to dozens of data sets with varying levels of unemployment and wage movement.	13	1
201404	3358	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	There are at least three examples of this work that I wanted to mention—two from the Board and one external.	13	1
201404	3359	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	First, Michael Kiley’s working paper “An Evaluation of the Inflationary Pressure Associated with Short- and Long-term Unemployment” examines the historical, cross-city, over-time relationships between CPI inflation and both short- and long- term unemployment rates.	13	1
201404	3360	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	And he found that both rates exerted equal pressure on prices.	13	1
201404	3361	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Second, Christopher Smith has been researching cross-state variations in wages and measures of labor slack and has found similar results for wage inflation—that is, that long-term unemployment and short-term unemployment historically exert the same kinds of influence on wages.	13	1
201404	3362	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Christopher’s early results are very robust to a range of wage measures and across various time periods.	13	1
201404	3363	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	This work is not yet in a working paper, because poor Christopher has been stuck in Tealbook hell.	13	1
201404	3364	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But it will likely be available in working paper form over the next couple of weeks.	13	1
201404	3365	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Third, looking at current data, Peter Hooper and his colleagues in the research department at Deutsche Bank have found a negative relationship between long-term unemployment rates and wage growth in states in which short-term unemployment has declined to something close to normal levels.	13	1
201404	3366	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	This is consistent with the intuition that Bill was expressing a minute ago.	13	1
201404	3367	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	An interesting point about this research is that Hooper and his coauthors do not find such a relationship in states in which a short-term unemployment gap remains.	13	1
201404	3368	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	This contrast suggests, again, the intuition Bill just stated—that employers as a group will not move to hire the long- term unemployed in large numbers until the pool of short-term unemployed has become somewhat depleted.	13	1
201404	3369	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	The Hooper finding is also congruent with analysis by the Board’s staff showing that multiple measures of labor slack, including the share of the workforce employed part time for economic reasons and the share of marginally attached or discouraged workers, move toward their pre-recession levels as a state short-term unemployment rate normalizes.	13	1
201404	3370	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I do want to note in passing that the Hooper finding depends on estimates of unemployment gaps, which are, as everyone in this room can attest, subject to debate.	13	1
201404	3371	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So these lines of research are obviously not conclusive on the issue of how much labor market slack remains, and there’s nothing in them to contradict my intuition that there’s been some structural labor market damage.	13	1
201404	3372	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think they provide some empirical support for the position that the long-term unemployed continue to affect labor market conditions, and that there remains considerable labor market slack that could be reduced through higher levels of aggregate demand.	13	1
201404	3373	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3374	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3375	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	13	1
201404	3376	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3377	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	My outlook, like everybody else’s, has not changed much.	13	1
201404	3378	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So, given that, I thought I would just mention a couple of data items that caught my attention recently.	13	1
201404	3379	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	One is the housing market, and a number of you have already spoken about the housing market.	13	1
201404	3380	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Here, the interesting set of facts to be reconciled is that, on the one hand, it seems fair to characterize the data on home sales—both new and existing as well as starts and permits—as being weaker than expected, so quantity measures look soft.	13	1
201404	3381	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	At the same time, price measures look stronger.	13	1
201404	3382	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The Tealbook, I think, characterizes CoreLogic and Case-Shiller as actually being a little bit stronger than expected.	13	1
201404	3383	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s interesting to try to make sense of that.	13	1
201404	3384	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The natural inference to draw is that at least some of the weakness on the quantity side is coming from supply as opposed to demand.	13	1
201404	3385	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	President Lockhart mentioned a few of the specific factors, and I think that feels reasonably compelling and worth thinking about.	13	1
201404	3386	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	At the same time, it’s also good to remember that these price indexes are “baked up,” and they tend to have a bit of inertia in them.	13	1
201404	3387	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So, what the quantity data may be telling us is that we’ve got a little bit of softness in prices yet to come.	13	1
201404	3388	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think it will be interesting to keep an eye on that.	13	1
201404	3389	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The other thing—and this is an oddball thing—is that I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal last week on the market for catastrophe bonds.	13	1
201404	3390	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	If you don’t know what catastrophe bonds are, basically, you give your money over, and if no bad disaster happens—no tornado, hurricane, or earthquake—then a year later or three years later, you get all of your money back with interest.	13	1
201404	3391	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	If there is one, then it’s like a default on your bonds—you lose your principal.	13	1
201404	3392	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	This market has seen a very big surge in issuance and a decline in yields, which was the Wall Street Journal story.	13	1
201404	3393	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I got interested in this.	13	1
201404	3394	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Now, why in the world would you care about this market?	13	1
201404	3395	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s a small market; it’s surely not systemic in any sense of the word.	13	1
201404	3396	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It matters only if you’re into nerdy identification stuff [laughter].	13	1
201404	3397	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Think about the inference problem we face when we look at corporate bond spreads narrowing.	13	1
201404	3398	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Corporate bond spreads have been coming down, and we’re always saying, “Well, it could be that risk premiums are going down, and returns to investors are going to be lower.”	13	1
201404	3399	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But it could be a strengthening economy—right?—with lower defaults in the period ahead.	13	1
201404	3400	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The staff does various things to try to tease these apart—for example, looking at short-term versus long- term credit spreads.	13	1
201404	3401	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And there’s some notion that the short-term stuff is more default informative.	13	1
201404	3402	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think about the beauty of catastrophe bonds.	13	1
201404	3403	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The spreads on those are going to narrow for one of two reasons—either risk appetite, broadly defined, or higher probability of a disaster.	13	1
201404	3404	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But as long as acts of God are not pro-cyclical, they’re totally uninformative about the real economy—that you lose money when there’s a hurricane or something.	13	1
201404	3405	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Here’s the idea:  If you saw catastrophe bond yields and junk bond yields moving very closely together, the only thing that these guys intersect on is the demand, the risk sentiment.	13	1
201404	3406	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So a close co-movement of those two would be an interesting clue about something.	13	1
201404	3407	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So I tried to get the data.	13	1
201404	3408	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Now, there are data, and I didn’t do a very good job of finding them.	13	1
201404	3409	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I just found a handful of data points.	13	1
201404	3410	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But, in the little bit that I saw, it was really quite remarkable the extent to which, over the past two years, the yields on these bonds, which have come down several hundred basis points, seem to be coming down very much in tandem with the yields on corporate credit and others.	13	1
201404	3411	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So I think one could get better data and do a little bit of a study.	13	1
201404	3412	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It seems to me that, as we struggle to try to do this identification, this might be a useful little clue.	13	1
201404	3413	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3414	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3415	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201404	3416	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3417	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I’ll make it unanimous and say that my outlook has changed little since the last meeting, and it is, in fact, in line with the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201404	3418	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	With good intermeeting readings on retail sales, manufacturing, and consumer confidence, I see economic growth rebounding to a level more consistent with the second half of last year.	13	1
201404	3419	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And, for the year, I see growth in the high 2 percent range.	13	1
201404	3420	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	In fact, at this point in the cycle, that starts to feel pretty close to the speed limit to me.	13	1
201404	3421	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I think we need consumption to continue to advance at a decent clip just to produce overall economic growth in the high 2s.	13	1
201404	3422	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Nothing that I see points to a sudden acceleration of business or residential investment.	13	1
201404	3423	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I expect them to increase but not sharply.	13	1
201404	3424	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Fiscal headwinds are going to continue to gradually wane, but there is no upside case there lurking anywhere.	13	1
201404	3425	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Net exports seem likely to continue to be roughly neutral overall and, in the meantime, a highly volatile contributor, as we’ve seen in the past few quarters.	13	1
201404	3426	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So I guess I feel as though the upside case and the base case are in the high 2s, maybe 3 percent, for now.	13	1
201404	3427	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Housing has become a significant disappointment.	13	1
201404	3428	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Governor Stein and others have laid out the basic narrative of longer-term expectations of a return to normal levels of household formation, but, in the short-term, of weak activity and prices going up a lot, which does, of course, suggest—and it makes sense—that there are somehow supply constraints.	13	1
201404	3429	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I confess that I find this still puzzling and somewhat unsatisfying.	13	1
201404	3430	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And I worry that there are other longer-term trends associated with poor job opportunities for younger people and lack of credit availability for weaker households.	13	1
201404	3431	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I guess I would say that I find the price trend somewhat troubling, as it is continuing in the face of weak demand.	13	1
201404	3432	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The labor market report for February was in line with expectations of a return to decent economic growth.	13	1
201404	3433	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would note that the labor force participation rate is now up 04 percentage point since late last year.	13	1
201404	3434	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I know there is some volatility there, but, holding all else equal, that bigger denominator would slow down progress in reducing headline unemployment but would, nonetheless, be a very welcome development.	13	1
201404	3435	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Along with nearly 3 percent economic growth, I expect we’ll continue to see improvement in the labor markets and unemployment declining nearly to 6 percent by year-end.	13	1
201404	3436	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I also expect inflation to move back toward its 2 percent objective.	13	1
201404	3437	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Risk factors are the same as others have mentioned—principally, global factors concerning China and Ukraine.	13	1
201404	3438	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I would also add that I do see financial conditions as a potential risk down the road.	13	1
201404	3439	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	The risk of continued rising froth in fixed-income markets, followed by a correction that could halt progress, is a real one.	13	1
201404	3440	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	If this starts to have the feel of a classic credit cycle, then the level of damage when the cycle turns is hard to predict.	13	1
201404	3441	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It can be small, or it can be large.	13	1
201404	3442	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201404	3443	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201404	3444	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you, everyone, for your comments and observations.	13	1
201404	3445	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	At our last meeting, I tried to summarize some of your comments in terms of how they answer a few key questions that bear on our policy decisions, and I thought that, with your indulgence, I would try to do the same thing again today.	13	1
201404	3446	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	It won’t surprise you that two of the questions are identical to those from last time, and that’s because they pertain to the criteria we have established to continue tapering our asset purchases.	13	1
201404	3447	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	First, is the labor market continuing to improve, and does that improvement appear to be sustainable?	13	1
201404	3448	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And, second, is it reasonable to expect that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over time?	13	1
201404	3449	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, as the labor market continues to improve, we also need to assess how close we have come to our maximum-employment goal.	13	1
201404	3450	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	A final policy-relevant question is, what factors could materially alter our forecast of a gradual return of employment and inflation to mandate-consistent levels, or, put differently, what are some of the notable risks to the outlook?	13	1
201404	3451	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	On the question of labor market improvement, I heard general agreement around the table that the labor market is continuing to improve, and that spending is most likely strong enough to see continued gradual improvement, although certainly a number of people—President Lockhart, Vice Chairman Dudley, President Evans, and Governor Tarullo—all suggested that the jury actually remains out at this point about just how large a pickup we’re likely to see in economic growth.	13	1
201404	3452	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	That said, almost all of you noted that there’s been very little shift in your forecasts, and I interpret them as generally in the same ballpark as the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201404	3453	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	The March employment report and incoming spending and production data—with the exception of housing, which a number of you commented on—are consistent with a diminished risk that the softer data we saw on employment and spending early this year signal any persistent loss of momentum.	13	1
201404	3454	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you—Presidents Fisher, Lockhart, and Plosser as well as others—commented on seeing firms somewhat more growth-oriented and on improved business optimism.	13	1
201404	3455	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Certainly, we are seeing payroll growth move up.	13	1
201404	3456	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	The three-month averages of total and private payroll gains are now around 180,000 a month, whereas at the time of the February report, they were running around 130,000.	13	1
201404	3457	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And, as many of you noted, other metrics pertaining to the labor market—such as the workweek, labor force participation, and the employment-to- population ratio—also point to continued improvement.	13	1
201404	3458	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Now, a number of you commented on the issue of how much slack remains in the labor market, and that is an important issue that will bear on our decision of how long we should wait before beginning to tighten policy.	13	1
201404	3459	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I took note of comments by Presidents Fisher and George, for example; you do hear reports of labor shortages in some sectors and occupations.	13	1
201404	3460	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But, as President Evans and others noted, this is something of a chronic situation—there are areas in which we do persistently see shortages.	13	1
201404	3461	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker described a very interesting piece of research at the Richmond Fed that, if I’m summarizing it properly, involved creating an index of underutilization of labor, with weights reflecting transition rates into employment.	13	1
201404	3462	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And, as I understood the conclusion of this research, it is that, while in some sense there is more slack in the labor market than would be captured by U-3, the behavior of this broader measure of underutilization relative to U-3 is, nevertheless, very similar to that in past business cycles.	13	1
201404	3463	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Therefore, U-3 remains a good single indicator of the state of the labor market.	13	1
201404	3464	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you commented on a topic I was going to discuss, and I will now curtail my comments on this, which pertains to work by Krueger and others about long- and short-term unemployment and their effects on inflation.	13	1
201404	3465	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I can’t hope to adequately summarize the arguments that Vice Chairman Dudley, Governor Tarullo, and others made about this, but I think the bottom line here is that we should be quite skeptical about jumping to the conclusion that it’s only short-term unemployment, which is now down to normal levels, that drives inflation.	13	1
201404	3466	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	There are a number of reasons for being skeptical about that conclusion.	13	1
201404	3467	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I also intended to describe some recent Board work that Governor Tarullo did a much better job of describing than I could.	13	1
201404	3468	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But, as President Kocherlakota also emphasized, we can learn a lot from cross-regional and cross-state comparisons.	13	1
201404	3469	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	There’s been quite a lot of work of that type at the Board—and, obviously, by your staff—and it really casts doubt on that conclusion.	13	1
201404	3470	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	In my own comments, I will briefly come back to the policy implications of this.	13	1
201404	3471	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you—President Kocherlakota and Governor Tarullo—noted that part-time employment also seems very high in comparison with U-3, and that it appears to put pressure on wages in the cross-section work that President Kocherlakota described.	13	1
201404	3472	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I thought President Rosengren also described interesting empirical work that suggests that a lot of individuals out of the labor market, including retirees, are likely to reenter the workforce as the expansion continues.	13	1
201404	3473	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And I think the bottom line of that—I’m not positive—is that there is more slack than what would be captured in U-3.	13	1
201404	3474	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Certainly, if a portion of the decline in labor force participation reflects cyclical factors and that labor force participation is likely to increase, then we may see an outcome in which—and this is similar to what’s in the Tealbook—instead of declining further because of ongoing secular trends, labor force participation could just flatten out.	13	1
201404	3475	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	There was also a lot of interesting discussion about wage growth, which most of you see as quite low with very little indication of acceleration.	13	1
201404	3476	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	That seems consistent with substantial remaining slack, and I guess the ECI data that we received this morning, which Bill described, are consistent with that.	13	1
201404	3477	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I found President Williams’s discussion about downward nominal wage rigidity very interesting.	13	1
201404	3478	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve been fascinated by the topic for a long time.	13	1
201404	3479	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think the story here is that nominal wage growth may be currently held down by the fact that while some firms during the downturn cut wages, many were either unwilling or unable to cut wages as much as they would have liked.	13	1
201404	3480	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	That may, on the one hand, explain why wage growth and inflation didn’t actually fall as much as we might have expected during the downturn, but now it explains why, as the labor market is improving, wage growth isn’t picking up as much as we might expect.	13	1
201404	3481	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I believe President Kocherlakota mentioned some anecdotal information that’s consistent with that.	13	1
201404	3482	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, I think most of you who discussed this topic mentioned that you continue to expect inflation to gradually move up toward our 2 percent objective, and that you saw recent data, particularly the CPI readings, as being consistent with stabilization.	13	1
201404	3483	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George and the Vice Chairman mentioned a number of trends in shelter costs, import costs, and medical prices that could push inflation up over time.	13	1
201404	3484	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But there were cautionary comments as well on the topic of inflation—the fact that inflation, as Presidents Evans and Kocherlakota noted, is running at a very low level.	13	1
201404	3485	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And we’re not seeing any clear signs at this point that it will move up quickly back to our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201404	3486	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to the topic of what could throw our forecast off course, many of you mentioned the main risks that concern you as being external—namely, events in Russia and Ukraine; slowing growth in China and potential risks pertaining to shadow banking and housing markets there; and financial-stability risks in that we’re seeing evidence of reach-for-yield behavior in fixed-income markets, including leveraged loan markets, in which terms and standards are continuing to deteriorate in spite of our guidance.	13	1
201404	3487	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I thought Governor Stein’s suggestion of looking at catastrophe bonds and the fact that their yields have moved with these spreads might lead us to worry a little bit more than we might have if we thought declines in spreads were reflecting greater health in the corporate sector.	13	1
201404	3488	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	This suggests that it is a measure of risk appetite, and we should worry about it because there could come an unwinding at some point or a volatility event that would involve financial-stability risks.	13	1
201404	3489	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, as the time of liftoff draws closer, we could see financial conditions tighten sharply.	13	1
201404	3490	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I have very little to add.	13	1
201404	3491	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with the consensus I heard around the table: Incoming data on the labor market and spending suggest that the labor market is continuing to improve, and that the improvement is likely to be sustainable.	13	1
201404	3492	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	On the related question of just how much slack remains in labor markets, I would say that I have also been spending quite a bit of time thinking about the distinction between long- and short-term unemployment—the work by Krueger and others that Governor Tarullo and Vice Chairman Dudley discussed in detail—and have been reading with interest recent papers on this topic.	13	1
201404	3493	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with their conclusion that this work really casts doubt on the general conclusion that there is a big difference between short- and long-term unemployment and their effects on inflation.	13	1
201404	3494	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I would note, though, that even if it were the case that long-term unemployment has a notably weaker influence on inflation than short-term unemployment, that doesn’t quite settle the question of how long-term unemployment should affect our policy decisions.	13	1
201404	3495	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	The evidence, as I read it, suggests that the long-term unemployed really look no different in terms of their characteristics than the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201404	3496	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	They’re individuals who want to work.	13	1
201404	3497	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	In that sense, they are quite employable, in spite of the fact that employers may have a tendency to pass them over at least until the firms are finding that it’s becoming much harder to find qualified applicants.	13	1
201404	3498	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Until they become reemployed, it could be the case that they do exert less pressure on wages and prices, although I am skeptical of that.	13	1
201404	3499	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But, even if they do, it looks as though more rapid expansion of aggregate demand would certainly help the long-term unemployed get jobs, and the potential cost of that might be higher inflation.	13	1
201404	3500	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, at this point, inflation is running well below our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201404	3501	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So, in pushing aggregate demand to try to bring them back into the labor force and into jobs, it seems to me that we currently face no tradeoff in terms of our dual mandate.	13	1
201404	3502	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	To me, the right policy response is to provide enough accommodation to push down long-term unemployment, along with other manifestations of underutilization, such as the still very low rate of labor force participation and the high share of part-time employment for economic reasons.	13	1
201404	3503	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	If we follow a strategy like that, a day may come when, ultimately, we will face a tradeoff between our objectives.	13	1
201404	3504	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	If that happens, that’s something we will have to address, I presume, using a balanced approach.	13	1
201404	3505	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But we’re not at that point yet.	13	1
201404	3506	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and let’s turn next to the policy go-round.	13	1
201404	3507	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re going to distribute a slightly revised version of the statement that responds to the data from this morning; there are some small proposed revisions.	13	1
201404	3508	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	When that’s done, we’ll turn to Bill for his briefing.	21	2
201404	3509	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As the Chair mentioned, we made some small changes to the alternatives, which are shown in blue in the handout in front of you labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201404	3510	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The top panels of your first exhibit provide information from the Desk’s April surveys.	21	2
201404	3511	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The left panel shows the median of the dealers’ projections for the path of asset purchases, which is unchanged from March.	21	2
201404	3512	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	All of the dealers are virtually certain the Committee will reduce the pace of purchases another $10 billion at this meeting, and almost all expect the program to be wound down by the end of October.	21	2
201404	3513	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown to the right, the median paths for the federal funds rate from the dealer and buy-side surveys were also little changed from March, at least until 2017, and both surveys point to liftoff in the middle of 2015 as most likely.	21	2
201404	3514	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As Simon mentioned yesterday, the mean of the expected paths from the surveys shifted up a bit.	21	2
201404	3515	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	As noted in the middle panel, the relatively small changes to the policy outlook suggest that market participants did not see the new forward guidance issued in March as indicating a change in the Committee’s policy intentions.	21	2
201404	3516	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Even so, the survey respondents remain fairly uncertain about the timing of liftoff as well as the level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2015, consistent with their seeing sizable odds that the Committee would adjust rates more slowly or more quickly, depending on the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.	21	2
201404	3517	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Indeed, a few of the commentaries over the intermeeting period specifically noted this possibility.	21	2
201404	3518	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The bottom panels show the median dealer forecasts for real GDP growth and PCE inflation in the March and April surveys.	21	2
201404	3519	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The dealers, like the staff, made only small downward revisions to their outlook for GDP growth this year, consistent with the view that economic activity in the first quarter was held back by transitory factors.	21	2
201404	3520	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	And, like the staff, the dealers also made few changes to their inflation forecasts; they continue to see inflation returning to 2 percent by the end of 2016.	21	2
201404	3521	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	If you share these views about the economic outlook, you may believe it’s appropriate to reduce the pace of asset purchases by an additional $10 billion and to make no changes to the forward guidance at today’s meeting, as in alternative B, on page 6.	21	2
201404	3522	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	More broadly, alternative B makes only minimal changes to the March statement.	21	2
201404	3523	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph updates the Committee’s summary of recent economic developments, noting that economic activity has picked up recently after having slowed sharply during the winter, and that household spending appears to be rising more quickly, but that business fixed investment edged down and the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.	21	2
201404	3524	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The only other changes to the statement are a reduction in the pace of asset purchases, noted in paragraph 3, and, as in all of the alternatives, the removal of the final paragraph included in the March statement.	21	2
201404	3525	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Market expectations appear to be pretty well aligned with a statement such as that in alternative B.	21	2
201404	3526	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Consequently, it’s unlikely to generate significant reactions in asset prices or yields.	21	2
201404	3527	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, on page 8, may appeal to policymakers who are confident that first- quarter growth was held down almost entirely by transitory factors and that the underlying pace of economic expansion remains sufficient to eliminate labor market slack relatively quickly, who believe that the remaining degree of slack is relatively small, or who are concerned that continuing to expand the balance sheet and keep rates low poses growing risks to inflation expectations or financial stability.	21	2
201404	3528	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Policymakers may therefore want to taper asset purchases more rapidly and, by doing so, signal that liftoff is likely to occur earlier than markets now seem to expect.	21	2
201404	3529	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C begins by noting that the effects of adverse weather and other transitory factors are waning, and that the pace of job growth is solid.	21	2
201404	3530	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The second paragraph emphasizes the Committee’s expectation for a rebound in inflation toward 2 percent.	21	2
201404	3531	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph announces a larger reduction in the pace of asset purchases, while the fourth suggests there could be similarly large reductions in the future.	21	2
201404	3532	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	A decision to reduce the monthly pace of purchases by $20 billion per month would surprise many investors and would likely lead them to pull forward the expected timing of the first rate hike and might lead them to anticipate a steeper subsequent path of the funds rate.	21	2
201404	3533	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer-term interest rates likely would rise, equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201404	3534	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative A, on page 4, may appeal to policymakers who have doubts that transitory factors can explain much of the recent weakness in economic growth, or that inflation will move back toward 2 percent relatively promptly.	21	2
201404	3535	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	They may prefer to wait for additional information before deciding whether to reduce the pace of purchases further, and they may also want to sharpen the forward guidance for the federal funds rate by adding an inflation floor.	21	2
201404	3536	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The first and second paragraphs of alternative A are more tentative about the recent economic news and the outlook for inflation.	21	2
201404	3537	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph refers to the Committee’s reduced confidence about the economic outlook as justification for its decision to maintain the current pace of purchases until more information on the outlook is available.	21	2
201404	3538	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The fifth paragraph adds to the forward guidance by stating that the Committee expects to keep interest rates low not only “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends,” but also “at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”	21	2
201404	3539	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	An announcement along the lines of alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants, who would likely mark up their expectations for total asset purchases, perhaps by a considerable amount, and push back the timing of liftoff.	21	2
201404	3540	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Interest rates would fall, and the dollar could depreciate.	21	2
201404	3541	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Equity prices could rise or fall, depending on the size of the negative signal investors took from the statement about the economic outlook.	21	2
201404	3542	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for these alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201404	3543	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201404	3544	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201404	3545	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201404	3546	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	If I could ask a question, the anticipated action in alternative B has us stepping down asset purchases to $45 billion a month.	22	2
201404	3547	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I know we’re not on a preset course, but if I just project that continuing into the fall and add up what we’re going to be purchasing until the termination of the purchase program, it’s somewhere around $190 billion, depending on the assumptions that you make about that.	22	2
201404	3548	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Now, it got my attention that our testing of the overnight reverse repo program at its maximum, nonweird month amounts to $180 billion.	22	2
201404	3549	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Right, in a day.	22	2
201404	3550	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Right.	22	2
201404	3551	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So we’re about offsetting what we’re expected to be adding now.	22	2
201404	3552	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Is that the right or wrong way to think about it?	22	2
201404	3553	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think that’s the right way to think about it.	22	2
201404	3554	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22	2
201404	3555	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	So here’s my question:  Is anybody talking about the effect of what we’re sterilizing as a premature tightening or hints of anything like that?	22	2
201404	3556	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I haven’t heard anything like that in my conversations with market participants, and I think that if it were suggested to me, I’d push back against it because we’re basically substituting overnight RPs for reserves when we do the overnight RP exercise.	22	2
201404	3557	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	That doesn’t change the amount of duration we’ve taken out of the market.	22	2
201404	3558	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It doesn’t change the amount of prepayment risk we’ve taken out of the market.	22	2
201404	3559	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So it shouldn’t have an effect on the longer-term rates.	22	2
201404	3560	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It shouldn’t undo the effects of the asset purchases that we conducted.	22	2
201404	3561	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	22	2
201404	3562	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201404	3563	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This raises the question I’ve asked before.	22	2
201404	3564	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Some of the data that the Markets Group has provided suggests that the gross amount of triparty repo is unchanged, and so we’re displacing some RP financing that would have taken place anyway.	22	2
201404	3565	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	The question that raises is, what happens to the stuff that used to be financed that we’re now sort of displacing in the RP market?	22	2
201404	3566	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Is that a sensible question?	22	2
201404	3567	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s an excellent question.	22	2
201404	3568	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We have looked at it.	22	2
201404	3569	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Some of this is the interdealer trading, which I don’t think we should be that concerned about.	22	2
201404	3570	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	What do you mean?	22	2
201404	3571	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	But hold on.	22	2
201404	3572	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m not sure I understand you.	22	2
201404	3573	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So this is formerly financed with other dealers that is not being financed now?	22	2
201404	3574	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes, it’s exchanging more toward the end of the day, when they’re trying to line up their funding with the collateral that they have.	22	2
201404	3575	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That interdealer market has come down in volume just a little bit.	22	2
201404	3576	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Some of the activity we see when there’s a large takedown in the overnight RRP is due to the primary dealers coming into the overnight RRP facility.	22	2
201404	3577	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I don’t view that as having a negative or adverse impact on the broader funding environment.	22	2
201404	3578	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	It’s something related to how the internal mechanics of the repo market work.	22	2
201404	3579	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	More recently, what’s happened is the supply of bills has come down.	22	2
201404	3580	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	So what you’ve seen is people investing in the overnight RRP who would have invested in bills.	22	2
201404	3581	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	They would have probably invested in other areas.	22	2
201404	3582	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	For example, some of the larger banks would have attracted some of that cash over this period of time, and then that would have been reflected in the reserves.	22	2
201404	3583	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Reserves have been going down in the banking system as the overnight RRP has gone up.	22	2
201404	3584	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Reserves would have gone up at that point.	22	2
201404	3585	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t understand how the first half of what you said was germane.	22	2
201404	3586	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	If a certain amount of Treasuries held privately is being financed in the RP market and we’re now in the RP market, less of that is being financed.	22	2
201404	3587	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This is just a simple way of thinking about it.	22	2
201404	3588	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Somebody must be holding that or financing it some other way.	22	2
201404	3589	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Now you’re telling me their bills might have rolled off.	22	2
201404	3590	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	No, because the Fed is financing some of its Treasuries in the repo market.	22	2
201404	3591	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Right.	22	2
201404	3592	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	So then the people who used to finance their Treasuries in the RP market aren’t financing them there anymore, and I’m asking who’s financing them now, or are they holding them outright?	22	2
201404	3593	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m asking where do those get financed now?	22	2
201404	3594	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	That was the question.	22	2
201404	3595	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We can look at it some more.	22	2
201404	3596	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I’m trying to understand.	22	2
201404	3597	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This gets to President Evans’s question, really.	22	2
201404	3598	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	We could check whether the holdings of government-only money funds have gone up.	22	2
201404	3599	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That would be one way.	22	2
201404	3600	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	There could be flows into those money funds.	22	2
201404	3601	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	But we’ll look to see if we can determine whether it is displacing funding.	22	2
201404	3602	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I haven’t seen any evidence yet that it’s displacing funding at this level.	22	2
201404	3603	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Well, yet there was a chart in an earlier paper you circulated that had the triparty Treasury overall volume, including us, kind of flat.	22	2
201404	3604	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	22	2
201404	3605	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Which is where I got this stylized fact.	22	2
201404	3606	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Maybe that’s wrong.	22	2
201404	3607	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Maybe that’s too simplistic.	22	2
201404	3608	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	The GCF interdealer trading is where most of that would be absorbed.	22	2
201404	3609	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22	2
201404	3610	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Do you understand the question?	22	2
201404	3611	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	Yes, I understand the question.	22	2
201404	3612	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201404	3613	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201404	3614	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up with Bill on chart 1, “Median Dealer Purchase Expectations.”	22	2
201404	3615	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is on page 1 of 13.	22	2
201404	3616	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This shows that the median dealer expects us to end the purchase program at the October meeting.	22	2
201404	3617	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Could you look at the split among the dealers and you give a little more information?	22	2
201404	3618	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What fraction of the dealers expect us to go to December, and what fraction expect us to end in October?	22	2
201404	3619	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I actually forget.	22	2
201404	3620	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Do you remember that, Simon?	22	2
201404	3621	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think a slight majority of the dealers expect that you’ll be at $15 billion and go to zero, but I don’t think there’s any conviction around that; this is the median.	22	2
201404	3622	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So the split is something like 14 to 8.	22	2
201404	3623	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay, so it’s about two-thirds to one-third.	22	2
201404	3624	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s a little bit more in that direction in the latest survey than in the previous survey.	22	2
201404	3625	2014-04-30	meeting	POTTER	I think we’ve learned that looking just at the median is probably not the best estimate.	22	2
201404	3626	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201404	3627	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Mine is a very picayune question.	22	2
201404	3628	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’ve had two quarters of negative growth in residential investment.	22	2
201404	3629	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the first paragraph, we’re talking about the recovery slowing.	22	2
201404	3630	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I wonder if it might be more accurate just to say “the housing sector has slowed,” which is reflecting the fact that we now have two quarters in a row of negative residential investment.	22	2
201404	3631	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we wanted to say “the recovery in the housing sector remained slow,” the thought being that a broader set of indicators suggested we still had some underlying sense of recovery in the housing sector.	22	2
201404	3632	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Things are better than they were.	22	2
201404	3633	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	But you’re right.	22	2
201404	3634	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The residential investment number in the NIPA has been negative now for two quarters in a row.	22	2
201404	3635	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Is that right, Bill?	22	2
201404	3636	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Yes, that’s right.	22	2
201404	3637	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	One question would be whether you want to look at March or you want to look at the first quarter as a whole.	22	2
201404	3638	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Housing starts did pick up in March.	22	2
201404	3639	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Permits were about flat.	22	2
201404	3640	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	So there wasn’t a further deterioration in March.	22	2
201404	3641	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s just that you have quarters that are adding up that are negative.	22	2
201404	3642	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The word “recovery” doesn’t seem as consistent as just saying “the housing sector has slowed,”	22	2
201404	3643	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	But it has been recovering.	22	2
201404	3644	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	I think it’s a close call.	22	2
201404	3645	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	We actually did discuss this yesterday and thought there was some value to suggesting that the Committee still thought there’s a recovery going on in the housing sector, even though we’ve seen some weak data.	22	2
201404	3646	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	Partly, the first quarter, we think, was weak because of the harsh winter weather.	22	2
201404	3647	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	The latest information from March is a little bit more upbeat.	22	2
201404	3648	2014-04-30	meeting	ENGLISH	So taking out the thought that there is a recovery in the sector seems as though it might send a stronger signal than we wanted to send.	22	2
201404	3649	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	And prices are still going up, which is part of the recovery process.	22	2
201404	3650	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, I agree.	22	2
201404	3651	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Bill?	22	2
201404	3652	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201404	3653	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I apologize.	22	2
201404	3654	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	This is for a different Bill.	22	2
201404	3655	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I totally understand if you blow me off, because this was just released two hours ago, but real disposable personal income at a 1.9 percent rate is 0.8 percentage point below what you had for the first quarter.	22	2
201404	3656	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’m not going to ask you about the implications, but, looking at the line for real disposable personal income in the Tealbook, you had a big acceleration coming in the second quarter.	22	2
201404	3657	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I know it’s too soon to ask you to take on board what the implications are, but what were you thinking about real disposable personal income?	22	2
201404	3658	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	For the consumption outlook, this is important.	22	2
201404	3659	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	We were expecting, with the further improvements in the labor market, that we’d get some additional growth in wages and salaries.	22	2
201404	3660	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	In addition, some of the drag in the first quarter reflects the expiration of the emergency unemployment insurance compensation program, and so that was a temporary drag in the first quarter that wasn’t going to be repeated in the second.	22	2
201404	3661	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	We looked briefly at the data this morning.	22	2
201404	3662	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	Some of the miss in income in the first quarter was in wages and salaries, but I think the biggest chunk was net interest payments, and there was some in nonfarm proprietors’ income as well.	22	2
201404	3663	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	I don’t know what to take from that, but it wasn’t as though the first-quarter wage-income numbers came in a lot lower than we were expecting.	22	2
201404	3664	2014-04-30	meeting	WASCHER	So I think we’d still expect the wage and salary numbers in the second quarter to be okay.	22	2
201404	3665	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22	2
201404	3666	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	22	2
201404	3667	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	22	2
201404	3668	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201404	3669	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin our go-round with President Fisher.	23	2
201404	3670	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	B.	23	2
201404	3671	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3672	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	That’s my “Calvin Coolidge” response.	23	2
201404	3673	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Hear, hear.	23	2
201404	3674	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I support alternative B without amendment.	23	2
201404	3675	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3676	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	I didn’t want to take up too much time.	23	2
201404	3677	2014-04-30	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3678	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3679	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	That sounds fair.	23	2
201404	3680	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201404	3681	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I usually pride myself on being brief, but I can’t match that.	23	2
201404	3682	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3683	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3684	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’ve set a high threshold for altering our slow-taper strategy.	23	2
201404	3685	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	The conditions for deviating from that strategy have not been met.	23	2
201404	3686	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Minimizing the changes in the wording of alternative B effectively conveys that we are continuing on the path we started on in December.	23	2
201404	3687	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	If anything, I believe the risks remain on the downside.	23	2
201404	3688	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I worry that geopolitical risks are uncomfortably high, and, if anything, a bad geopolitical outcome may have more serious consequences than modeled in the Tealbook scenario “Escalating Geopolitical Tensions.”	23	2
201404	3689	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also worry that the corroborating evidence that inflation is trending to our 2 percent target is not yet obvious.	23	2
201404	3690	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, our ability to offset negative shocks with monetary or fiscal policy is limited.	23	2
201404	3691	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given these concerns, we should maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.	23	2
201404	3692	2014-04-30	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3693	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3694	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201404	3695	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3696	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3697	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	The outlook is virtually unchanged since our March meeting, as are financial conditions on balance.	23	2
201404	3698	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Apart from a transitory first-quarter slowdown, caused in part by unusually severe winter weather, I expect the recovery to continue to play out largely as projected when we announced the beginning of the taper.	23	2
201404	3699	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic growth is poised to pick back up as the year proceeds, keeping the economy on a path of sustained moderate expansion.	23	2
201404	3700	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonetheless, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and inflation is below our longer-run target.	23	2
201404	3701	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	These circumstances warrant staying on our current path for policy.	23	2
201404	3702	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	This includes a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, combined with forward guidance that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate.	23	2
201404	3703	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative B delivers that message clearly, with minimal fuss.	23	2
201404	3704	2014-04-30	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3705	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201404	3706	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3707	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	Taking a leaf out of President Fisher’s book, I’ve been wanting to do this for a long time:  I support alternative B, and the statement is fine.	23	2
201404	3708	2014-04-30	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3709	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	23	2
201404	3710	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201404	3711	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3712	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	There isn’t much to say about today’s policy decision.	23	2
201404	3713	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I support alternative B, except for the portion of the statement I was unable to persuade you all to drop last month.	23	2
201404	3714	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’ll pass on the opportunity to restate my case.	23	2
201404	3715	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Looking ahead, I think the issue that looms in my mind is how we should respond if markets push up longer-term rates in response to economic news or other developments over the course of the process when we begin normalization.	23	2
201404	3716	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Unlike simulations, in which you control everything, I think we’re not going to know the causal driving factors with precise certainty.	23	2
201404	3717	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	And it could be difficult to decipher.	23	2
201404	3718	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	It would be worthwhile for us to supplement the preparations we’re undertaking on the operational front for normalization by spending some time thinking through various scenarios for how longer-term rates play out during this normalization process.	23	2
201404	3719	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	My instinct is that we should be cautious about jumping to the conclusion, if rates move pretty sharply, that markets just don’t understand how dovish we truly are and start pushing back on longer-term rates.	23	2
201404	3720	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Markets could be telling us something important.	23	2
201404	3721	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’d point out the box on uncertainty about the longer-term real rate.	23	2
201404	3722	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Others have commented that we don’t know if economic growth is going to 3½ percent or is going to muddle through in the high 2s or low 2s.	23	2
201404	3723	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Those kinds of things can show up in the sensitivity of longer-term rates, and that doesn’t even mention expected inflation.	23	2
201404	3724	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	I’d just point out that, in one of the most successful periods for monetary policy, the ’50s and early ’60s, our operational strategy was bills-only, and the underlying motivation was to allow market determination of longer-term rates to provide us with a sensitive signal and feedback about how policy ought to be guided.	23	2
201404	3725	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Those are my thoughts right now.	23	2
201404	3726	2014-04-30	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3727	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3728	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201404	3729	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3730	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	I also support alternative B for today.	23	2
201404	3731	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The tapering process has, in my judgment, gone well so far, especially considering the volatility that we experienced during the “taper tantrum” of last summer.	23	2
201404	3732	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is that we should continue to taper at this juncture.	23	2
201404	3733	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	This morning’s weak GDP report does give me pause, however, as it surprised me to the downside.	23	2
201404	3734	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	While I’m willing to accept the judgment that economic growth will pick back up in the second quarter, I do think we need to see tangible evidence that that is actually occurring, as Vice Chairman Dudley referred to earlier.	23	2
201404	3735	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Because there is nothing to talk about in alternative B, I thought I would talk about alternatives A and C.	23	2
201404	3736	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3737	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As currently envisioned, the Committee’s strategy is to end the open-ended QE program later in 2014 and, if all goes well, to begin raising the policy rate sometime in 2015.	23	2
201404	3738	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Alternatives A and C are meant to address, at least in part, what the Committee’s options may be in the case that the economy performs either better than expected, alternative C, or worse than expected, alternative A.	23	2
201404	3739	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The phrase “performs better or worse than expected” is a judgment made by the Committee.	23	2
201404	3740	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As currently stated, the response to a better- than-expected economy is to increase the pace of the taper.	23	2
201404	3741	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The response to a weaker-than- expected economy is to pause in the tapering process.	23	2
201404	3742	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The response to a stronger-than-expected economy is to taper at a faster pace and presumably end the purchase program sooner.	23	2
201404	3743	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Given our experience at the June meeting and the September meeting last year, I think that both of these possible policy actions would move expectations of future policy in the desired direction and would have a substantial effect on financial market conditions.	23	2
201404	3744	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	However, conceptually, we are viewing the taper as coming to an end in the second half of 2014—that is, the pace of purchases would hit zero and evidently remain there for a period of time.	23	2
201404	3745	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The size of the balance sheet, given our reinvestment strategy, would remain fixed.	23	2
201404	3746	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Because we are, in essence, approaching a fixed balance sheet, the policy value of choosing A or C is diminishing as we reduce the pace of purchases to smaller and smaller amounts.	23	2
201404	3747	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	This may be leaving the Committee without good responses to adverse developments in either direction during the remainder of 2014.	23	2
201404	3748	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	A possible fix for this would be that alternative A could envision not just a pause in the tapering process, but also maybe even an increase in the pace of purchases, because we’d be at very low levels of purchases in the remainder of this year.	23	2
201404	3749	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Here, rather than $15 billion, you might envision alternative A going to $25 billion or something like that.	23	2
201404	3750	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	And alternative C could envision not just pushing the pace of purchases to zero more quickly, but also, in the event that the economy were actually performing quite robustly, having a so-called negative tapering, or a controlled reduction in the size of the balance sheet.	23	2
201404	3751	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	As options about how to respond to developments in either direction, these would be more effective and maybe should be the way we should think about this as we proceed through the rest of 2014 and before we get to the point in 2015 at which we’d actually be thinking about raising the policy rate.	23	2
201404	3752	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line of my comment is that alternatives A and C, should we need to employ them, may not have a large enough effect as we get to smaller and smaller asset purchase amounts.	23	2
201404	3753	2014-04-30	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3754	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3755	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201404	3756	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3757	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I also support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3758	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	I do think that the low-inflation environment is a concern, and the low wage data today in the ECI are consistent with that.	23	2
201404	3759	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We say we’re monitoring inflation developments, and that’s fine for now, but the time is likely to come when we’ll need to discuss further the progress on that front.	23	2
201404	3760	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We need to be careful.	23	2
201404	3761	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	We need to be accommodative.	23	2
201404	3762	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	For today, alternative B is, and I support it.	23	2
201404	3763	2014-04-30	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3764	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3765	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201404	3766	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3767	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	For today, I can support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3768	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy continues to improve, consistent with our forecast, and I see no reason to deviate from our path of reducing asset purchases by $10 billion per meeting.	23	2
201404	3769	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the description of the labor market in paragraph 1 of alternative C, however, actually aligns better with the data and the comments I heard around the table than the language in alternative B.	23	2
201404	3770	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Rather than saying the labor market data have been mixed—nearly all of the labor market indicators we’ve kept track of in the past several months have actually improved.	23	2
201404	3771	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I’m not quite sure why we want to send a signal that it’s been mixed.	23	2
201404	3772	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Certainly, we do say “the unemployment rate ... remains elevated,” which is obviously a true statement, but all of the other labor market statistics, I think, have improved.	23	2
201404	3773	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I would actually be inclined to think more about describing paragraph 1 with alternative C.	23	2
201404	3774	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I also believe we need to be thinking a little further ahead.	23	2
201404	3775	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	At our last meeting, I discussed some of my reservations about paragraph 6.	23	2
201404	3776	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I still have them.	23	2
201404	3777	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Even if our current anticipation is that rates will rise only very gradually, we should make sure we position our communications so that we can move interest rates up more quickly should that be necessary.	23	2
201404	3778	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Notwithstanding the language in paragraph 5 that says that, in determining the time of liftoff, the Committee is going to assess progress toward meeting our objectives, I’m actually beginning to get concerned that the public is starting to think there will be no change in policy rates until our goals are met.	23	2
201404	3779	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We should be careful, and we need to work on language that will convey more of the concept of our policy reaction function and the factors that determine it as we go forward.	23	2
201404	3780	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also note that, with the exception of the nominal GDP rule, all of the rules reported in the Tealbook, Book B, suggest that we should have liftoff by the third quarter.	23	2
201404	3781	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And that is even recognizing the high unemployment rate and the very low inflation rates.	23	2
201404	3782	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We’ve not yet agreed on why we want to keep interest rates lower for longer, even after we have reached our inflation and employment goals.	23	2
201404	3783	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That was the conflict, it seems to me, in paragraphs 5 and 6.	23	2
201404	3784	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The discussion in the Tealbook, Book A, of a lower long-run natural rate of interest was a very interesting one, and I thought they did a nice job with that.	23	2
201404	3785	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	An equilibrium real rate—I’ll call it r*—that is lower than its longer-run level would be one rationale for anticipating lower nominal interest rates.	23	2
201404	3786	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	It doesn’t appear, though, from the March SEP that many participants have yet lowered that lower-than-normal long-run funds rate.	23	2
201404	3787	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think this is a topic the Committee should continue to discuss, because if we’re going to consider allowing r* to vary over time in the context of our policy rules, this is going to be very hard to communicate, and we’re going to have to be very clear about how we put a discipline around making those decisions.	23	2
201404	3788	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	What theory and what evidence are we going to use to justify that?	23	2
201404	3789	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	The kind of discussion in the Tealbook was a useful beginning to having that discussion.	23	2
201404	3790	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But it’s a very complicated issue, and it’s a very difficult issue for the Committee to face.	23	2
201404	3791	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I would not want us to do this or to become a case of the tail wagging the dog.	23	2
201404	3792	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	That is, we decide for some reason that we want lower interest rates, and then we take down our estimate of r*—that’s not the right way to think about this.	23	2
201404	3793	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We need a more consistent, disciplined way of talking and thinking about this.	23	2
201404	3794	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	We don’t have that yet, and it’s likely to be problematic for us unless we begin to address it.	23	2
201404	3795	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	My own view is that the bar should be quite high for allowing that free parameter to move around, as I think it’ll make our communications quite difficult, because then we’d have to explain why and how and when we change it.	23	2
201404	3796	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	So the bar needs to be very high for moving that around.	23	2
201404	3797	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, I’ll reiterate what I said earlier and yesterday as well.	23	2
201404	3798	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it would be prudent for us to begin thinking about our balance sheet more directly, particularly in the context of the exit principles that we’ve talked about before, integrating a discussion of how we’re going to go about shrinking the balance sheet in the context of the discussion that we had yesterday.	23	2
201404	3799	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I think those two things are linked.	23	2
201404	3800	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	And how we integrate those into our discussion of reducing purchases and then perhaps beginning to reduce reinvestments—maybe that becomes a continuous path.	23	2
201404	3801	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t know.	23	2
201404	3802	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But we need to begin thinking about that, so I encourage us to put that on the table for discussion soon.	23	2
201404	3803	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	But for today, I can support alternative B and the language.	23	2
201404	3804	2014-04-30	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3805	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3806	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Pianalto.	23	2
201404	3807	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3808	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	My final FOMC policy statement will be brief, although not quite as brief as the statement at my first FOMC meeting back in 2003.	23	2
201404	3809	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	My first policy statement consisted of six words:  “I support your recommendation, Mr Chairman.”	23	2
201404	3810	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3811	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Just for the record, I should point out that the statements of most of the Committee participants at that meeting were identical to mine.	23	2
201404	3812	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Of course, times have changed, and now we are in a new equilibrium in which policy statements are expected to be much longer.	23	2
201404	3813	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	So I will more than quintuple the length of my initial policy statement.	23	2
201404	3814	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	With the economy and labor markets continuing to recover and with my forecast that inflation will return to 2 percent by the end of 2016, it is entirely appropriate to stay the course laid out in alternative B.	23	2
201404	3815	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Now, I want to make just a couple of comments.	23	2
201404	3816	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	As I said last night, I hope that the challenges facing this Committee are never as difficult as the ones we faced in the past several years.	23	2
201404	3817	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	I am counting on all of you to successfully pilot us back to maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, and I am confident that you will do so.	23	2
201404	3818	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Again, it has just been an honor and a privilege to serve on this Committee and to contribute to monetary policy that has been effective and has become ever more transparent.	23	2
201404	3819	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	I want to thank all of you for making it an incredibly rewarding experience.	23	2
201404	3820	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3821	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	[Applause]	23	2
201404	3822	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3823	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201404	3824	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3825	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	And all the best to you, President Pianalto.	23	2
201404	3826	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3827	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, support alternative B in terms of a further reduction in our asset purchases.	23	2
201404	3828	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	The economy continues to make meaningful cumulative gains, and inflation is widely expected to gradually move higher after having been held down by a number of temporary factors.	23	2
201404	3829	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	As the economy strengthens, though, I think there are a couple of communication issues worth considering, and both of these happen to be along the lines that President Plosser has already raised—one related to our longer-term forward guidance and the other the reinvestment policy.	23	2
201404	3830	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Notwithstanding my own ongoing concerns about unusually low interest rates for this extended period of time, I do think the effectiveness and credibility of our forward guidance are going to demand some further clarity as the economy strengthens, particularly because paragraph 6 talks about how, “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels,” we expect that “economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below” its long-run level.	23	2
201404	3831	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	This guidance could create some communication challenges.	23	2
201404	3832	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	As President Plosser noted, there have been a range of views as to why a below-normal target might be necessary, and several explanations have emerged around fighting lingering headwinds, following a highly inertial policy rule, or responding to a lower long-term equilibrium funds rate.	23	2
201404	3833	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	If persistent headwinds are the reason for low rates, we should try, over time, to be more specific simply to ensure that we know what we are trying to offset by holding rates low.	23	2
201404	3834	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	The equity risk premium, a low housing share of GDP, and fiscal headwinds are some factors that have been noted in the past as weighing on the recovery.	23	2
201404	3835	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	As these factors move toward more normal levels or not, we can be prepared to reassess the stance of policy.	23	2
201404	3836	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	But if these headwinds are, in fact, subsiding and we’re instead moving our policy rate with considerable inertia or have a view that the longer-run neutral rate has fallen, we should be prepared to explain these other aspects of the policy to our market participants or risk sending confusing signals.	23	2
201404	3837	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	The second issue that I would just note briefly is one that was referenced yesterday around the reinvestment policy and how we talk about that.	23	2
201404	3838	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	I noted from the recent memo that compared the Tealbook assumptions with survey-based measures of market participants that dealer responses varied widely regarding expectations of cessation of reinvestments, from early 2015 to mid-2016.	23	2
201404	3839	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	So the signaling aspect of such cessation will likely be strong, and I think our groundwork that we might lay could help coalesce expectations around our intentions as we go forward.	23	2
201404	3840	2014-04-30	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3841	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3842	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201404	3843	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3844	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m willing to support alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201404	3845	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC adopted a new communications framework in its March statement.	23	2
201404	3846	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I continue to have concerns about this framework, and, as we move forward, I believe that the Committee should strongly consider the kind of forward guidance described by President Rosengren in his recent speeches.	23	2
201404	3847	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, changing the forward guidance one meeting after adopting a new communications framework would present challenges and raise questions about FOMC credibility.	23	2
201404	3848	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So at this meeting, I’m willing to support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3849	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the remainder of my remarks, I’m going to pose three tactical questions about policy that I think would be best for us to attempt to answer in our internal deliberations in the next meeting or two.	23	2
201404	3850	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My first question is, October versus December?	23	2
201404	3851	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In our communication and internal deliberations, we have largely locked down the reduction in asset purchases to be $10 billion per meeting, barring large changes in the outlook.	23	2
201404	3852	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That leaves one last, dangling $5 billion to be the subject of fierce press attention.	23	2
201404	3853	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Do we plan to zero that out in October or wait until December?	23	2
201404	3854	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My second question is, how do we plan to implement and communicate our current, very slow planned rate of increase for the fed funds rate?	23	2
201404	3855	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The SEP suggested that, over the course of 2016, the federal funds rate will rise by considerably less than 25 basis points per meeting.	23	2
201404	3856	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How, exactly, do you prefer to implement that?	23	2
201404	3857	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Will we raise the fed funds rate target by less than 25 basis points per meeting?	23	2
201404	3858	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, of course, we might be changing the federal funds rate target, as we discussed yesterday.	23	2
201404	3859	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The concern I have about that is, even in normal times, having that degree of control over the fed funds rate might be challenging if we were trying to raise it by, say, 10 basis points a meeting.	23	2
201404	3860	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	From the conversation we had yesterday, I came away feeling that that might be even more of an issue as we exit this time around.	23	2
201404	3861	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another approach would be to be chunky—that is, move at some meetings and not others, let’s say at press conference meetings.	23	2
201404	3862	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But that has other challenges associated with it.	23	2
201404	3863	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not saying this is an impossible problem, by any means.	23	2
201404	3864	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s more that we should be thinking ahead about the choice we prefer so that we can develop appropriate communication plans and, if necessary, enhance our technical ability to move whatever target rate we want in smaller-than-usual increments.	23	2
201404	3865	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I suggested yesterday—and I like what President Plosser said here, too—we should also be planning for the contingency—I view this as remote—that we might want to raise our target interest rate very rapidly.	23	2
201404	3866	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of the learning by doing might have to be in a very compressed time frame if that turns out to be true.	23	2
201404	3867	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My third question just follows up on remarks the Vice Chairman made yesterday and Presidents Plosser and George have made today.	23	2
201404	3868	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There remains uncertainty in the markets about our reinvestment policy.	23	2
201404	3869	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve heard about it as well.	23	2
201404	3870	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think it would be useful for us to have a conversation about that and try to achieve that.	23	2
201404	3871	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The three questions, to go over them again, are as follows:  October or December?	23	2
201404	3872	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How are we actually going to achieve our projected slow pace of interest rate increases?	23	2
201404	3873	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And what’s going to be our policy about stopping reinvestments?	23	2
201404	3874	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that, for all of these questions, there’s a temptation to use a “we’ll figure it out when we get there” approach, but my experience on the FOMC is that we get better policy outcomes when we plan proactively for the future.	23	2
201404	3875	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, I thought, Madam Chair, the process we used to get to the communications framework that was announced in March—while I didn’t agree with where we ended up—was exactly the right one.	23	2
201404	3876	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Planning for the future and communicating plans, when we formulate them, to the public help households and businesses form more precise expectations and reduce policy uncertainty, which is a benefit in its own right.	23	2
201404	3877	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’d hope we can resolve these uncertainties in our discussions in the next meeting or two.	23	2
201404	3878	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we can, then I would recommend we communicate our conclusions to the public as well.	23	2
201404	3879	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with both President George and President Plosser about r*.	23	2
201404	3880	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The thinking in markets about how our reaction function works is shaped by a Taylor rule with a fixed intercept.	23	2
201404	3881	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the more guidance we can provide that we can unite behind in a consensus way in this Committee about why exactly we see that r* being low would be very helpful for market participants and the public more generally.	23	2
201404	3882	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I say I’m willing to support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3883	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do have one minor concern, but I’m willing to let it slide:  Alternative B presumes that winter is over.	23	2
201404	3884	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3885	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is not true in all Districts.	23	2
201404	3886	2014-04-30	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3887	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201404	3888	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201404	3889	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3890	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Like everybody else, I support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3891	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I thought Jay made an interesting and important point a little earlier this morning to the effect that the gap between the baseline scenario and upside risk has actually narrowed a good bit.	23	2
201404	3892	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	I noted—and I think a couple of others did as well—that external downside risks probably increased.	23	2
201404	3893	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s very hard to quantify what those external downside risks are, and I don’t believe it would be particularly productive—it might even be counterproductive—to include anything on either in the statement.	23	2
201404	3894	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	So the language should remain as is.	23	2
201404	3895	2014-04-30	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3896	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3897	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Stein.	23	2
201404	3898	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3899	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3900	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I think we’re on a good trajectory.	23	2
201404	3901	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I’m comfortable both with where I believe our collective reaction function to be and with the fact that market-implied estimates seem to line up roughly with that reaction function.	23	2
201404	3902	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	The one thing that gives me a bit of pause—this is something that we talked about a little bit yesterday—is not market expectations in a first-moment sense.	23	2
201404	3903	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Rather, it is market expectations in a second-moment sense—that is to say, implied volatility.	23	2
201404	3904	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	For example, I think Simon mentioned some of the numbers, but, basically, if you look at long-dated swaptions—say, the 3-month option on a 10-year interest rate—they’re pretty close to where they were.	23	2
201404	3905	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	They’re really just a hair away from where they were a year ago, which is in turn just a shade above the all-time historical lows in May 2007.	23	2
201404	3906	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So implied volatility is very low on long-term rates.	23	2
201404	3907	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And, particularly given all of the subjective uncertainties we’ve talked about in terms of headwinds and secular stagnation and all of that, that doesn’t feel as though it’s really naturally justified by the fundamentals.	23	2
201404	3908	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I wouldn’t think you’d want to argue that fundamental uncertainty is historically low.	23	2
201404	3909	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	So I wonder a little bit about what’s going on and what implications that might have for investor behavior.	23	2
201404	3910	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	On the one hand, Madam Chair, I think you struck exactly the right tone in your recent communication.	23	2
201404	3911	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	For example, in your press conference, you emphasized that the path of the dots in 2016 is a forecast and it’s not a precise statement of where we will be.	23	2
201404	3912	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	On the other hand, the volatility numbers make me wonder whether everybody is listening to you or whether, as I think was the case a year ago, there’s a set of market players who’ve taken a different view and think that we’ve made the world safe for a long period of time.	23	2
201404	3913	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	There’s nothing to do about it, particularly.	23	2
201404	3914	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It’s something to keep an eye on.	23	2
201404	3915	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	It doesn’t have any implications for the statement.	23	2
201404	3916	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	I do think that, as we talk about this or as others talk about the outlook and the forecast, it is useful to make the point that the dots and all of that are not a locked-in path but have some element of forecast.	23	2
201404	3917	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	And, in an ideal world, the market comes to recognize that gradually rather than all in a big chunk at some point.	23	2
201404	3918	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	But I think we’re in a basically good place.	23	2
201404	3919	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3920	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3921	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201404	3922	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3923	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I’ll support alternative B as well.	23	2
201404	3924	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I think the reduction in asset purchases is on a path that is well understood by the markets and well in keeping with developments in the economy.	23	2
201404	3925	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I also think that the forward guidance has generally been well received, and it’s well designed to withstand the evolution of events in the economy.	23	2
201404	3926	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	It was, however, necessary after the last meeting to undercut the SEP in order to prevent it from sending a false signal of tighter policy at the last meeting.	23	2
201404	3927	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	While I think that has de-risked the SEP for the time being, it does seem as though, in seven weeks, you’re going to be standing in front of another set of dots, and there will be a lot of pushback in the form of, “Well, why do you show us these dots?” and that kind of thing.	23	2
201404	3928	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So I wonder whether—this is for the intermeeting period—there is something we can do to either kill it off—I suppose not—or modify it in a way that would make it more credible.	23	2
201404	3929	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	I know we’ve talked about a lot of ideas for doing that, and they haven’t had wide support.	23	2
201404	3930	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	But, in any case, it’s something to think about in the intermeeting period.	23	2
201404	3931	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Finally, on reinvestment policy, my takeaway from yesterday’s colloquy was, there isn’t a lot in the decision whether to stop reinvestment at the middle of 2015 or at the end of 2015— except for the signal—because there’s just not that much that’s maturing.	23	2
201404	3932	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And I guess I think that the liftoff decision is probably going to be very, very fraught.	23	2
201404	3933	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	So it would be very wise to take the reinvestment decision off the table in some way now, before we get even close to that.	23	2
201404	3934	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	That’s probably well understood, but that’s what I would do.	23	2
201404	3935	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	And with that, let me conclude by saying I hope that this will be my last meeting as your anchorman.	23	2
201404	3936	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	23	2
201404	3937	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Agreed.	23	2
201404	3938	2014-04-30	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3939	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3940	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201404	3941	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201404	3942	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201404	3943	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Generally, I think the large-scale revisions of the statement that we implemented in March have worked well.	23	2
201404	3944	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The 10-year Treasury yields are little changed over the intermeeting period— maybe a little bit too unchanged over the intermeeting period—and market participants’ expectations appear broadly consistent with our own.	23	2
201404	3945	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So minimal changes to the statement are in order for this meeting.	23	2
201404	3946	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what alternative B does.	23	2
201404	3947	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	But, like others, I do think that we continue to have a dots problem in terms of our SEP submissions.	23	2
201404	3948	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	So we need to do some further work on what could be done to ameliorate that problem.	23	2
201404	3949	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see pulling the dots back as really that practical.	23	2
201404	3950	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we’re preaching transparency, then we have to practice transparency.	23	2
201404	3951	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I’m more inclined to favor even greater transparency, and one thing we could do is to actually mark the dots as Committee members versus nonvoting participants.	23	2
201404	3952	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That would create a bit more clarity about where the weight of the FOMC was in terms of the dots.	23	2
201404	3953	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think another thing we can do, though, is something that the Chair did in her speech at the Economic Club of New York:  She emphasized the uncertainties that surround the forecast and therefore the uncertainties about how monetary policy will evolve as the forecast changes.	23	2
201404	3954	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a theme that we could provide greater emphasis to, because the fact is, the dots of the SEP have this perverse consequence of overemphasizing the modal forecasts in the markets’ minds, and then it feeds back into very low volatility that actually concerns us.	23	2
201404	3955	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	If we can get people away from the modal forecast a little bit so they understand that this is almost certainly not likely to be realized, that would be another way of addressing the dots problem.	23	2
201404	3956	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	As I said yesterday, we’ve got to get the reinvestments issue on the table and resolve that.	23	2
201404	3957	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I’m generally sympathetic with Governor Powell’s view that putting it after the liftoff in terms of short-term rates probably makes the most sense, just because we’re going to be quite nervous about what the liftoff itself is going to do with respect to financial conditions.	23	2
201404	3958	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Separating them by some period of time might be best, but I’m open to discussion on that.	23	2
201404	3959	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, as the Vice Chairman, I want to thank Sandy and Jeremy for all of their work and for being such good colleagues.	23	2
201404	3960	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	The word “collegial” is a word that would apply very, very, very well to both of you.	23	2
201404	3961	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s been a pleasure to work with you both, and I and everyone else on the Committee wish you the best of luck in your new endeavors.	23	2
201404	3962	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201404	3963	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201404	3964	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think this has been a very good discussion, and we’ve heard many valuable suggestions for what we should be doing in coming meetings, particularly in terms of looking at reinvestment policy and how we’re going to communicate that along with our plans for normalization; what to do about the dot plot; and other matters, including possible ways to clarify the logic of the guidance in paragraph 6, which many of you have mentioned.	23	2
201404	3965	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll keep these in mind and try to put these on the agenda for future meetings.	23	2
201404	3966	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	But, with respect to today’s decision, I heard widespread support for alternative B as indicated in the statement.	23	2
201404	3967	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Therefore, I think I’d like to put forward for a vote the statement in alternative B, as given by Bill English, according to the handout this morning.	23	2
201404	3968	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Matt.	23	2
201404	3969	2014-04-30	meeting	LUECKE	As the Chair indicated, the vote will cover alternative B, as described on pages 6 and 7 of Bill’s handout, and the directive on page 12 of Bill’s handout.	23	2
201404	3970	2014-04-30	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes President Fisher Yes President Kocherlakota Yes President Pianalto Yes President Plosser Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Stein Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	23	2
201404	3971	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	23	2
201404	3972	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	1	1
201404	3973	2014-04-30	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a new record.	1	1
201404	3974	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Isn’t it.	1	1
201404	3975	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	So, what do I need to tell you?	1	1
201404	3976	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	There are two things.	1	1
201404	3977	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	The dates of the next meeting are Tuesday and Wednesday, June 17 and 18.	1	1
201404	3978	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	Another point is that the FOMC Secretariat had circulated a schedule of meetings for 2015.	1	1
201404	3979	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	If you do have any concerns about the dates, please let Matt know immediately.	1	1
201404	3980	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	I can tell you that about six minutes from now, at 11:00, lunch will be served in the anteroom.	1	1
201404	3981	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who are able to stay, that would be great.	1	1
201404	3982	2014-04-30	meeting	YELLEN	And let me join in thanking our colleagues President Pianalto and Governor Stein for your contributions, friendship, and collegiality and say again how much we will miss you.	1	1
201404	3983	2014-04-30	meeting	STEIN	Thank you.	1	1
201404	3984	2014-04-30	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you.	1	1
