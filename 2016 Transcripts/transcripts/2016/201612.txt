201612	0	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	50.0	65.0
201612	1	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	50.0	65.0
201612	2	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Today and tomorrow’s meeting is a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201612	3	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	4	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201612	5	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201612	6	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201612	7	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201612	8	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think most of you know that President Lockhart has announced that he plans to step down from his position early next year, and this will be his last FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	9	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Dennis has agreed to come back for a reception in January on the evening of the first day of the FOMC meeting, which will provide us with an opportunity to honor him appropriately and express our best wishes in a more festive setting than an FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201612	10	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But I’d also like to make just a few remarks today.	50.0	65.0
201612	11	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	After a long and varied career in finance and academia here and abroad, Dennis joined the Federal Reserve in March 2007 as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.	50.0	65.0
201612	12	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	That was just months before the Global Financial Crisis.	50.0	65.0
201612	13	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately, we all know that correlation is not causation.	50.0	65.0
201612	14	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	50.0	65.0
201612	15	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	For the past decade, President Lockhart has ably represented the Federal Reserve in the Sixth District.	50.0	65.0
201612	16	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	He has contributed greatly to the System’s work generally, including serving most recently as chairman of the Conference of Presidents.	50.0	65.0
201612	17	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the course of attending 79 FOMC meetings, he has enhanced the Committee’s deliberations on monetary policy through his careful reporting on economic and financial developments in the Atlanta District, his thoughtful analysis of national conditions and the economic outlook, and his balanced approach to our policy decisions.	50.0	65.0
201612	18	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Dennis, we thank you for your service to the Federal Reserve, and we wish you all the best in the next phase of your career.	50.0	65.0
201612	19	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	50.0	88.0
201612	20	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	[Applause]	50.0	88.0
201612	21	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201612	22	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let us turn to our agenda.	67.0	65.0
201612	23	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The first item pertains to “Proposed Revisions to Rules Regarding Availability of Information.”	67.0	65.0
201612	24	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You recently received a staff memorandum that proposes certain revisions to the Committee’s rules regarding the availability of information.	67.0	65.0
201612	25	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	To summarize briefly, legislation passed earlier this year requires federal agencies to implement a number of changes to relevant information availability policies by December 27.	67.0	65.0
201612	26	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Approval of the staff proposal would align the Committee’s FOIA rules with the new statutory requirements and would implement a number of additional changes, all of which are technical.	67.0	65.0
201612	27	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask: Does anybody have any questions for the staff about the proposals?	67.0	65.0
201612	28	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	67.0	65.0
201612	29	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	30	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I suggest that we now have a single vote on the proposal, and I’m going to ask Brian to explain exactly what it is that we will be requested to vote on.	67.0	65.0
201612	31	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	67.0	999.0
201612	32	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will encompass three sets of items.	67.0	999.0
201612	33	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	For your reference, I might note that these items are included on page 2 of the staff memorandum under the heading “Procedural Notes.”	67.0	999.0
201612	34	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	First, the Committee would approve the adoption of the recommended changes to its rules regarding the availability of information.	67.0	999.0
201612	35	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	A tracked-changes version of the rules is attached to the staff memo.	67.0	999.0
201612	36	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Second, the Committee would make two determinations that would allow the revised rules to be published in the Federal Register as an immediately effective interim final rule under the Administrative Procedure Act.	67.0	999.0
201612	37	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	One, the Committee would determine that there is good cause that public notice and comment on these amendments would be “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”	67.0	999.0
201612	38	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Two, the Committee would determine that there is good cause to waive the typical 30-day delay for the effective date of the rule.	67.0	999.0
201612	39	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	The staff believes that these determinations are reasonable because, one, the act requires agencies to implement the necessary changes to the rules in a very short time frame, and, two, the changes beyond those required by the act are technical in nature.	67.0	999.0
201612	40	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Third, the Committee would authorize the Secretary in consultation with the General Counsel to do two things:  one, to take the appropriate steps to reflect these changes in the rules and records of the Committee and submit the appropriate filings to the Federal Register, and, two, to appoint a Federal Reserve employee as the Committee’s FOIA public liaison to fulfill the roles described in the amended rules.	67.0	999.0
201612	41	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	A draft of the Federal Register notice, which includes a detailed description of the changes, was attached as appendix 2 to the staff memo.	67.0	999.0
201612	42	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	That notice is the proposal on which the Committee is being asked to vote.	67.0	999.0
201612	43	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	44	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion to approve the proposal?	67.0	65.0
201612	45	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	67.0	108.0
201612	46	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And a second?	67.0	65.0
201612	47	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	67.0	96.0
201612	48	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	49	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	67.0	65.0
201612	50	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, Brian.	67.0	65.0
201612	51	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you very much.	67.0	999.0
201612	52	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	I just have an additional note.	67.0	999.0
201612	53	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Although the interim final rule will be effective immediately upon publication in the Federal Register, the public will have 60 days to submit any comments.	67.0	999.0
201612	54	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	The staff anticipates that after the public comment period, the Committee will be asked, potentially at the March meeting, to make the rule final either as is or with changes, if warranted by public comment, and to authorize publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.	67.0	999.0
201612	55	2016-12-14	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	67.0	999.0
201612	56	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	67.0	65.0
201612	57	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And let me next call on Simon.	67.0	65.0
201612	58	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It’s a Board meeting as well?	67.0	999.0
201612	59	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, this is a Board meeting as well.	67.0	65.0
201612	60	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve already had a motion and closed the Board meeting.	67.0	65.0
201612	61	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	67.0	999.0
201612	62	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I was just checking.	67.0	999.0
201612	63	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	67.0	65.0
201612	64	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’re now going to go to “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61.0	65.0
201612	65	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201612	66	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The US election outcome produced a significant repricing in financial assets over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	67	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants expect the new Administration to introduce expansionary fiscal policies over the coming years and to implement a shift in tax and regulatory policy that is thought likely to promote economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201612	68	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While there is perceived to be a high degree of uncertainty about the ultimate nature, extent, timing, and effect of these policies, market participants expect the Committee to pursue a somewhat faster pace of policy normalization.	61.0	999.0
201612	69	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield increased more than 60 basis points since the November FOMC meeting, the largest intermeeting increase since 2010.	61.0	999.0
201612	70	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Although this is consistent with expectations of fiscal expansion, some contacts have suggested that nominal and real yields were too low earlier this year in relation to fundamentals.	61.0	999.0
201612	71	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	But market participants were hesitant to put on corresponding positions until the election-related risk event had passed.	61.0	999.0
201612	72	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the dollar jumped, domestic risk assets rallied significantly, and emerging market assets sold off.	61.0	999.0
201612	73	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Ahead of the election, market participants had expected a victory by Mr Trump to cause the opposite domestic market reaction, driven by an increase in perceived economic and political uncertainty.	61.0	999.0
201612	74	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants now argue that the Republican control of both the legislative and executive branches of government and President-elect Trump’s conciliatory comments on election night may have somewhat reduced such concerns.	61.0	999.0
201612	75	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In the most recent Desk surveys, we asked respondents to rate the importance of changes in expectations for various US economic policies in driving the intermeeting change in the 10-year Treasury yield.	61.0	999.0
201612	76	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bubbles in the top-right panel are scaled by the number of responses and, on average, respondents rated changes to tax policy and government spending as the most important drivers.	61.0	999.0
201612	77	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In the case of other economic policies that were rated less important, there was a much wider dispersion of views, potentially suggesting greater uncertainty over the effect of the proposed policies.	61.0	999.0
201612	78	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Respondents generally cited the same drivers as the impetus for dollar strength and higher equity valuations.	61.0	999.0
201612	79	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Alongside the shift in economic policy expectations and the apparent increase in risk appetite, the market-implied probability of an increase in the target federal funds rate at this meeting increased from approximately 60 percent at the time of the November FOMC meeting to 90 percent, as shown by the dark blue line in middle- left panel; this market-implied probability is consistent with responses from Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201612	80	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Economic data and FOMC communications over the period reinforced market expectations for a rate hike in December, and the market-implied probability is now above what was seen just ahead of the December 2015 FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	81	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Beyond this meeting, the market-implied path of the target federal funds rate steepened significantly, as shown by the shift from the light blue to the dark blue line in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	82	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The unconditional survey-implied path, shown by the pink diamonds, also increased, and for the first time in at least the previous two years the market- and survey-implied paths are roughly equal.	61.0	999.0
201612	83	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Despite the substantial re- pricing in the market-implied path, survey respondents generally do not expect the median SEP rate forecasts to change materially at this meeting, with some noting that it may be too soon for FOMC participants to adjust their forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201612	84	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the distribution of respondents’ expected outcomes for the federal funds rate of the year-end 2018, conditional on not moving to the effective lower bound, shifted right, with the average probability ascribed to the rate being at or below 1 percent falling from roughly 20 percent to less than 10 percent.	61.0	999.0
201612	85	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The skewness of the distribution shifted slightly toward higher rates.	61.0	999.0
201612	86	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows the probability individual respondents assigned to a move to the ELB sometime between now and the end of 2019 on each of the previous three Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201612	87	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bubbles are scaled by the percent of respondents, and the average probability, denoted by the blue diamonds, declined to roughly 20 percent in the most recent survey.	61.0	999.0
201612	88	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This level is the lowest this year, and the dispersion of responses also fell a bit.	61.0	999.0
201612	89	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows the relative contributions of each of these factors to the change in the unconditional PDF-implied point estimates for 2018 and 2019.	61.0	999.0
201612	90	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The shift toward higher rates, conditional on not moving to the ELB, accounts for the majority of the increase in the path, the dark blue area, followed by a reduction in the probability of moving to the ELB over the forecast horizon, the red area.	61.0	999.0
201612	91	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will show further supporting evidence on the sources of the increase in the path from Eurodollar options and term structure models.	61.0	999.0
201612	92	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Despite the steepening in the expected path of the policy rate, the median survey respondent expects no change to reinvestments until the second quarter of 2018, roughly unchanged compared with the November surveys, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	93	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That said, 10 respondents cited expected changes to the composition of the FOMC in 2018 as influencing their expectations regarding the timing of a change in reinvestment policy, and, interestingly, all but one of these respondents pulled forward their timing estimates.	61.0	999.0
201612	94	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Average PDF-implied mean expectations for the par value of SOMA at year-end 2019 were little changed.	61.0	999.0
201612	95	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a result, it seems unlikely that changes in expectations for the size of the SOMA portfolio contributed significantly to the rise in 10-year Treasury yields over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	96	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a means of further informing our understanding of the rise in Treasury yields, the Desk surveys asked respondents to decompose the intermeeting period change in the 10-year yield.	61.0	999.0
201612	97	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, respondents, on average, decomposed the move fairly evenly across possible factors.	61.0	999.0
201612	98	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, there was a wide dispersion of views regarding this decomposition, with the exception of inflation risk premiums, which most agreed contributed to about one-fourth of the move in the nominal Treasury yields.	61.0	999.0
201612	99	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	US five-year, five-year forward inflation compensation as measured by inflation swaps increased roughly 30 basis points over the period, shown in in the middle-right panel, to the highest level year-to-date.	61.0	999.0
201612	100	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The Desk’s survey measures of expected inflation also moved up, and the distribution of PCE inflation in 2019 is now assessed as roughly symmetric around 2 percent.	61.0	999.0
201612	101	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The increase in domestic inflation expectations and compensation was part of a global re-pricing.	61.0	999.0
201612	102	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The roughly 15 percent increase in oil prices over the period was an additional contributor.	61.0	999.0
201612	103	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That said, inflation compensation in the euro area and Japan still remains well below the central banks’ respective inflation targets.	61.0	999.0
201612	104	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with higher growth forecasts and an increase in investor confidence, the S&P 500 index jumped by around 7 percent over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	105	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, financials outperformed dramatically.	61.0	999.0
201612	106	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In fact, they outperformed the broader S&P 500 index by the largest intermeeting margin since 2009 and performed better than would have been predicted purely on the basis of the increase in interest rates and the appreciation in the overall stock market.	61.0	999.0
201612	107	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attributed this outperformance to expectations of less stringent financial regulations.	61.0	999.0
201612	108	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, contacts are uncertain about exactly what form these regulatory changes might take, and Desk analysis has not found any differentiation in performance across banking sector shares that might indicate expectations for specific regulatory changes.	61.0	999.0
201612	109	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Bank shares also outperformed markedly in Europe and Japan.	61.0	999.0
201612	110	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The outperformance of industrials and materials sectors was attributed to expectations for increased infrastructure spending, while the stock prices of companies with higher effective tax rates that would benefit the most from potential changes to the corporate tax system also saw outsized gains.	61.0	999.0
201612	111	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in bottom-right panel, the dollar appreciated broadly over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	112	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Supported by wider interest rate differentials, the broad trade-weighted dollar has now strengthened to its highest level in 14 years.	61.0	999.0
201612	113	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Potential changes to US trade and immigration policies reportedly weighed heavily on the Mexican peso, while monetary policy actions in Japan and the euro area served to reinforce depreciation pressures on the yen and the euro.	61.0	999.0
201612	114	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As part of its yield-curve control framework, the Bank of Japan conducted a fixed-rate full allotment purchase operation for the first time, unexpectedly targeting the two- and five-year maturity sectors.	61.0	999.0
201612	115	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with theory, the operations generated no demand but were effective in controlling rates.	61.0	999.0
201612	116	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The JGB yield curve has been relatively stable since the introduction of yield-curve control in September.	61.0	999.0
201612	117	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bar chart in the top-left panel of your next exhibit compares the steepening of sovereign debt curves across the G4 by showing the change in the spread between the 2- and 30-year securities.	61.0	999.0
201612	118	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown by the left bar, the JGB curve steepened by about 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	119	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, this move is small compared with other countries in the developed world.	61.0	999.0
201612	120	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the German yield curve, the right bar, steepened dramatically.	61.0	999.0
201612	121	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The steepening was driven in part by a decline in short-dated rates and an increase in long-dated rates following last week’s ECB meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	122	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The ECB announced an extension of its asset purchase program until at least December 2017, though starting in April the monthly pace of purchases will be trimmed to €60 billion.	61.0	999.0
201612	123	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The ECB also announced some technical changes to the program’s parameters to address a growing scarcity of eligible assets for purchase; most notably, securities trading below the deposit facility rate will be eligible for purchase beginning in January.	61.0	999.0
201612	124	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We estimate that the parameter changes allow the ECB’s asset purchase program to run until at least December 2017.	61.0	999.0
201612	125	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The abrupt re-pricing of longer-term US Treasury securities has had a significant effect on the market value of the SOMA portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201612	126	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, the unrealized profit, measured by the difference between market and book value, has declined by the largest amount since the “taper tantrum.”	61.0	999.0
201612	127	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It is important to note that after many years of QE and a longer period of official-sector dollar reserve accumulation, much of the decrease in market value is registering on central bank balance sheets.	61.0	999.0
201612	128	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Stepping back from the immediate price action and bearing in mind the failure of the market to price any of these moves before the election, market participants have cited several key areas of uncertainty.	61.0	999.0
201612	129	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	First, many market participants say that the nature, extent, and ultimate effect of any fiscal stimulus is quite unknown.	61.0	999.0
201612	130	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Potential changes to US trade and immigration policies are also viewed as key tail risks that have the potential to offset the macroeconomic benefits of other economic policies.	61.0	999.0
201612	131	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, market participants are reportedly concerned about political risk in Europe over the next year or so.	61.0	999.0
201612	132	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-left panel, the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, the red line, has increased notably: The index is at its highest level since the beginning of the time series in 1997.	61.0	999.0
201612	133	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	However, identifying market pricing that reflects these uncertainties is difficult.	61.0	999.0
201612	134	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While some measures of implied volatility have increased a bit, the Desk’s standardized cross-asset implied volatility index, the blue line, is nearly one standard deviation below its historical average.	61.0	999.0
201612	135	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The subdued levels of implied volatility across markets could reflect the difficulty in effectively pricing risk associated with events or policies for which the timing and effect is unknown and potentially might not materialize for some time.	61.0	999.0
201612	136	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	A simpler explanation is that there could be some complacency or overconfidence among investors.	61.0	999.0
201612	137	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	A final and related risk identified by market participants is a further sharp appreciation of the US dollar and the potential challenges it poses for China.	61.0	999.0
201612	138	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-right panel, the onshore renminbi, the red line, depreciated 2 percent against the dollar over the intermeeting period to its weakest level since the financial crisis.	61.0	999.0
201612	139	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The persistent depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar has occurred amid large net capital outflows, the blue bars.	61.0	999.0
201612	140	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Chinese government officials have reportedly responded by enhancing capital controls and by intervening to stem renminbi depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201612	141	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	China’s foreign reserves declined over the intermeeting period and intervention activity is likely at its highest level since early this year.	61.0	999.0
201612	142	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	For now, market participants appear relatively comfortable with these developments concerning China, but if capital outflows increase significantly, global financial market instability may return.	61.0	999.0
201612	143	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Brian will analyze possible reactions of the dollar to various scenarios in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201612	144	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I will now turn to money markets and Desk operations on your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201612	145	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The FX swap basis has widened across major US dollar currency pairs, shown in the top-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	146	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The basis indicates the implied cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the foreign exchange market, above what it would cost to borrow dollars directly at US dollar LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201612	147	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	If covered interest parity held, it would be zero.	61.0	999.0
201612	148	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, the one- and three-month FX swap bases have widened as investors have sought to secure US dollar funding over the year-end date.	61.0	999.0
201612	149	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The reduction in the size of lending by US prime money market funds to banks had already reduced one alternative supply of dollar funding for foreign banks.	61.0	999.0
201612	150	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The most pronounced widening has occurred following the US election, as interest rate differentials between the US dollar and other currencies increased.	61.0	999.0
201612	151	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As yields on US assets become more attractive and this increases cross-border purchases of dollar-denominated assets, demand for hedging in the FX forward market will likely increase, contributing to a further widening of the swap basis.	61.0	999.0
201612	152	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Lastly, emerging market reserve managers reportedly reduced their provision of dollars in the FX swap market since the US election, as they maintained higher levels of liquidity to prepare for possible FX intervention to support their currencies.	61.0	999.0
201612	153	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The further widening of the basis might produce more demand at the dollar auctions run by central banks in the standing swap network, particularly over year-end.	61.0	999.0
201612	154	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In domestic funding markets, we have observed a significant decline in overnight secured rates in recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201612	155	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The average Treasury triparty ex-GCF repo rate, which is the market in which the bulk of money market fund lending in the repo market occurs, has fallen to 28 basis points this cycle, compared with 33 last intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201612	156	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, rates on triparty repo transactions for Treasury collateral have shifted lower since the middle of November and have been largely concentrated at or just above the 25 basis point ON RRP rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	157	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We observed an increase in the number of triparty repo transactions executed below the ON RRP rate, although the overall magnitude of such trades remained relatively small.	61.0	999.0
201612	158	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Cash lenders at these low rates were exclusively non-RRP counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201612	159	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the increase in government money funds seeking investment in Treasury repo driven by money fund reform, some market contacts have noted that the recent rise in rates has reduced the market value of the collateral to fund.	61.0	999.0
201612	160	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The rise in rates has also amplified demand to establish short positions in the Treasury securities market, which has served to increase the amount of securities trading special.	61.0	999.0
201612	161	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	When securities trade special, they are removed from the GC collateral pool, putting further downward pressure on the GC rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	162	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	These factors had an even more pronounced effect on rates for Treasury GCF repo—a smaller market made up largely of transactions between dealers—which averaged 36 basis points this period, compared with 55 basis points last cycle.	61.0	999.0
201612	163	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This effect has compressed the spread between the GCF and GC rates, shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	164	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	This spread represents the compensation required by dealers with large, stable repo funding bases to intermediate between money funds and smaller, less creditworthy dealers.	61.0	999.0
201612	165	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The increase in government money fund AUM and the lower levels of overnight secured rates were both reflected in ON RRP usage over the period.	61.0	999.0
201612	166	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	ON RRP take-up continues to be larger than earlier this year, with government funds making up the large majority of the increase, shown as the dark blue area in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	167	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As a result of the lower level of repo rates, participation by government securities dealers, included in the red area, has also increased modestly, as the 25 basis points offered by the ON RRP facility has at times become attractive to them as an arbitrage activity.	61.0	999.0
201612	168	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Usage of the ON RRP is expected to increase materially as we approach year-end.	61.0	999.0
201612	169	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The Desk recently conducted a survey of money fund counterparties to gauge their expectations for demand around year-end, shown as the gray bars in the panel.	61.0	999.0
201612	170	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While respondents expect the ON RRP facility to see demand of around $500 billion on the year-end date, the expected change from its current level is similar to that seen on previous quarter- and year-ends and smaller compared with year-end 2015.	61.0	999.0
201612	171	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	One consideration with regard to year-end is whether some large government money fund and GSE counterparties may be limited by the $30 billion individual cap on the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201612	172	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows a time series of the number and types of counterparties that have participated in the ON RRP facility at a level equal to or greater than $15 billion, half of the individual cap.	61.0	999.0
201612	173	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	While this has occurred more frequently since the middle of this year as some government money funds have grown in size, the number of counterparties participating at these levels on any given day has remained low.	61.0	999.0
201612	174	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	In contrast to the movement in secured rates this period, the effective federal funds and overnight bank funding rates were unchanged at 41 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201612	175	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	As noted, all respondents in our surveys expect an increase in the federal funds target range at this meeting.	61.0	999.0
201612	176	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Based on responses to the Desk’s recent survey of money market participants, the median expectation is for nearly full pass-through of such a tightening to money market rates, shown in the bottom-right panel as a spread relative to the IOER rate.	61.0	999.0
201612	177	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	These expected rates are generally consistent with forward rates implied by financial markets.	61.0	999.0
201612	178	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	To conclude, we would like to note that in the appendix, in addition to the usual summary of small value test operations that have been conducted by the Desk, you will find a short update pertaining to a memo that was recently circulated describing the Desk’s operational readiness framework.	61.0	999.0
201612	179	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair, that completes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201612	180	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61.0	999.0
201612	181	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201612	182	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	62.0	65.0
201612	183	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201612	184	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I have two or three questions.	62.0	81.0
201612	185	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One is about the SOMA Domestic Portfolio Unrealized Profit and Loss on exhibit 3.	62.0	81.0
201612	186	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	187	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s also a figure in Tealbook B, and, for November 30, I wasn’t sure if they lined up.	62.0	81.0
201612	188	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Is there something conceptually different between those numbers?	62.0	81.0
201612	189	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Because some of us are going to be eager trackers of unrealized capital gains or losses in the months and weeks ahead, I suspect.	62.0	81.0
201612	190	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	That’s very perceptive of you.	62.0	999.0
201612	191	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I also noticed that.	62.0	999.0
201612	192	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So, my reckoning is 80; they’ve got 120 there.	62.0	999.0
201612	193	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	I think there’s a difference in definition and timing involved in that, but you’re right.	62.0	999.0
201612	194	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	There is a bit of a difference.	62.0	999.0
201612	195	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I believe that in Tealbook B we are using our estimates of what we would show in the Quarterly Financial Report.	62.0	999.0
201612	196	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I see.	62.0	81.0
201612	197	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I’m just giving you right up to what the controllers and markets tell us on that day.	62.0	999.0
201612	198	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	62.0	81.0
201612	199	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t expect someone to regurgitate the difference now, but would it be possible to circulate a little write-up of what the difference is?	62.0	81.0
201612	200	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We will do that, yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	201	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It’s a question I raised this morning on the call.	62.0	999.0
201612	202	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Second, I really appreciated the overview of the operational-readiness framework.	62.0	81.0
201612	203	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I’m a longtime supporter of the Desk’s operational readiness and participated in readiness preparations, and I’m really glad to see the Desk taking a systematic approach to ensuring the Desk’s ability to conduct operations that it is currently authorized to conduct.	62.0	81.0
201612	204	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was intrigued, however, by the memo’s reference to the Desk assessing the readiness to conduct operations that it may be asked to conduct, might not have ever conducted, and might not be authorized to conduct now.	62.0	81.0
201612	205	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was really curious about this.	62.0	81.0
201612	206	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	First of all, there’s an appendix that shows 26 operations that have the highest readiness prioritization, and so you engage in regular readiness preparations.	62.0	81.0
201612	207	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And I was really glad to see selling MBS was on that list.	62.0	81.0
201612	208	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I want to commend you for that right off the bat.	62.0	81.0
201612	209	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We are authorized to do those types of open market operations.	62.0	999.0
201612	210	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But you maintain a catalog of 58 operations, and you just told us about 26 of them, and I didn’t see the other 32 listed anywhere.	62.0	81.0
201612	211	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These are things that you folks think you need to be ready to do, but we haven’t talked about them here.	62.0	81.0
201612	212	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know if any of us have even thought about them.	62.0	81.0
201612	213	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So, actually, I’m really curious about them.	62.0	81.0
201612	214	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Does it take many resources to maintain some readiness for these things that we haven’t even thought about doing?	62.0	81.0
201612	215	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Have you assessed the likelihood of use?	62.0	81.0
201612	216	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Have you ever discussed any of these with external parties by way of researching what would be involved in operations in some far-flung market or in other—the imagination runs wild in this circumstance.	62.0	81.0
201612	217	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I was wondering if you could make available the list of 32 to the Committee at some point.	62.0	81.0
201612	218	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	You’re right that the three categories that are listed here are the categories of operations in which we’re currently using resources, and that’s why we focused on the three.	62.0	999.0
201612	219	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	There are about 30 other operations that we didn’t list, and they cover a wide variety of things, including things we did in the crisis.	62.0	999.0
201612	220	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	Agency debt purchases would be one of those; TSLF Schedule 1 would be in that category.	62.0	999.0
201612	221	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	They also include things that we may have done pre- crisis—for example, options on repos that we did during Y2K would be one—and some things that we haven’t done, such as municipal debt.	62.0	999.0
201612	222	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	There may have been things that people asked us about during the crisis, and we may have done a little work on them but didn’t do any real operational work.	62.0	999.0
201612	223	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	They include a wide variety of things, and we can certainly share that.	62.0	999.0
201612	224	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	But we’re not using resources on the things that are in those two categories today, and the purpose of this is to show you the things in which we are.	62.0	999.0
201612	225	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	62.0	81.0
201612	226	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	We will be happy to share the full list.	62.0	999.0
201612	227	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Great.	62.0	81.0
201612	228	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Are they all things that the open market Desk is legally entitled to do?	62.0	81.0
201612	229	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	Yes, everything there is within the Federal Reserve Act.	62.0	999.0
201612	230	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	For example, there are agency debt sales, FX forwards, FX swaps with private counterparties, purchasing spec pools instead of TBAs, or doing repos DVP instead of through the triparty system.	62.0	999.0
201612	231	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I see.	62.0	81.0
201612	232	2016-12-14	meeting	LOGAN	So there are things that have been at this table.	62.0	999.0
201612	233	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	62.0	81.0
201612	234	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	It will be very exciting reading for everyone.	62.0	999.0
201612	235	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62.0	65.0
201612	236	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	62.0	65.0
201612	237	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Is it your sense that the Chinese are selling Treasury securities to meet some of these redemptions?	62.0	110.0
201612	238	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes, as they have been for quite a while.	62.0	999.0
201612	239	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And that’s continuing?	62.0	110.0
201612	240	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201612	241	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And then the second thing.	62.0	110.0
201612	242	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Do you think people are expecting—I know that it’s not explicit—that once the exchange reserves run low enough the Chinese might be thinking about taking some preemptive action to stem these flows, such as a devaluation?	62.0	110.0
201612	243	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I’ll let Steve comment as well.	62.0	999.0
201612	244	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	They still have more than $3 trillion in reserves and a current account surplus.	62.0	999.0
201612	245	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	So I don’t think there’s anything next week.	62.0	999.0
201612	246	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The notion would be if this kept going for another 12 months, then that might show a bigger rundown in the reserves.	62.0	999.0
201612	247	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Part of the fall in exchange reserves is due to the valuation effect, because they hold nondollar assets.	62.0	999.0
201612	248	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	If they’re pricing in dollars, that moves it down.	62.0	999.0
201612	249	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Also, because they previously sold quite a lot of short stuff in the intervention, their portfolio will also have market losses in it, as the rates have gone up and the way they report is that way.	62.0	999.0
201612	250	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Steve.	62.0	999.0
201612	251	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I think they’ve already taken one preemptive action, which is to tighten up capital controls on outflows, and, meanwhile, I think there is actually an active debate within China among different observers and policymakers over whether a preemptive large devaluation would help by delivering the devaluation people are worried about or hinder because once you do one devaluation, a lot of market participants expect more to follow.	62.0	999.0
201612	252	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Right.	62.0	110.0
201612	253	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And history suggests they are correct.	62.0	999.0
201612	254	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, an awful lot of out- of-control depreciations start with a deliberate devaluation.	62.0	999.0
201612	255	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So this is still up in the air.	62.0	999.0
201612	256	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast is for neither a preemptive devaluation nor a very large and continuing depreciation.	62.0	999.0
201612	257	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our view is that a lot of the depreciation of the RMB against the dollar that we’ve seen is, more or less, in line with that of other currency movements and is in line with one of their standard objectives, which is to keep the RMB more or less stable against the basket of currencies, and, in fact, that has continued.	62.0	999.0
201612	258	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So our forecast over the next few years is that they keep the RMB stable against this basket of currencies, more or less, and as a result of that, you get a little bit more depreciation of the RMB against the dollar.	62.0	999.0
201612	259	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	62.0	110.0
201612	260	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62.0	65.0
201612	261	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201612	262	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201612	263	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201612	264	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201612	265	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	A second?	63.0	65.0
201612	266	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	63.0	96.0
201612	267	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201612	268	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201612	269	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along next to our “Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	65.0
201612	270	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Stephanie Aaronson is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201612	271	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201612	272	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I will be referring to the “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	999.0
201612	273	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Your first exhibit summarizes the data received since the October projection, which corroborate that economic activity picked up in the second half of the year, as we’ve been anticipating for some time.	11.0	999.0
201612	274	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown in panel 1, we expect real GDP to rise at about a 2½ percent pace, on average, in the second half of the year, up from a 1 percent pace in the first half.	11.0	999.0
201612	275	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, the BEA’s first estimate of GDI in the third quarter, line 7, which we also find to be a useful signal of the strength of the economy, posted a large increase.	11.0	999.0
201612	276	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The incoming data for the third quarter have been a bit stronger than we expected, but with much of the surprise in volatile categories such as inventory investment and net exports, we now expect a smaller gain in the fourth quarter.	11.0	999.0
201612	277	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown in panel 2, a number of System nowcasts of Q4 call for faster growth than the Board staff projects—suggesting some upside risk to our current-quarter projection.	11.0	999.0
201612	278	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The two employment reports we’ve received since the October Tealbook show that the labor market has continued to tighten.	11.0	999.0
201612	279	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Payroll employment advanced at a solid pace, and the unemployment rate, the black line in panel 3, dropped 0.3 percentage point to 4.6 percent in November.	11.0	999.0
201612	280	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate, the red line, has moved down 0.2 percentage point since September to 62.7 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	281	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Our assessment is that the surprise in the unemployment rate will be only partially unwound—we have penciled in a forecast of 4.7 percent for December and in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201612	282	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	This view is partly informed by the labor flows data.	11.0	999.0
201612	283	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen in panel 4, some of last month’s decline in the unemployment rate reflected an increase in the transition rate from unemployment to employment—a development that we think is likely to persist.	11.0	999.0
201612	284	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In a longer view, the flows data on labor force entry and exit, shown in panel 5, indicate that entry into the labor force, the black line, has slowed over the past year or so, even as labor market conditions have continued to tighten.	11.0	999.0
201612	285	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Nonetheless, exits from the labor force, the red line, have slowed even more, the result of which has been an improvement in participation over the past year.	11.0	999.0
201612	286	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A look at the past few business cycles suggests that it is not unusual for exits to fall faster than entries as the unemployment rate nears the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	287	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	These flows data suggest that workers are becoming more attached to the labor force as the expansion matures, perhaps reflecting better-quality job matches.	11.0	999.0
201612	288	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The first panel on your next exhibit compares the current path of GDP growth, the black line, with the one from a year ago in the December 2015 Tealbook, the red line.	11.0	999.0
201612	289	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen, the data on GDP growth over the past year or so have surprised us to the downside, although our projection is little revised.	11.0	999.0
201612	290	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the GDP gap in panel 2, which takes into account some small revisions to our supply side, shows a bit lower resource utilization this year than in the December 2015 Tealbook, although by the end of 2018 the gap is essentially unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201612	291	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Similarly, the unemployment rate in panel 3 was a touch higher than we anticipated for much of the past year but is little revised for the period ahead.	11.0	999.0
201612	292	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	While GDP growth has been a bit weaker and resource utilization is little revised, the interest rate environment has been much more accommodative than we expected.	11.0	999.0
201612	293	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 4 plots the Treasury yield curve for 2016:Q4 as we projected at the time of the December 2015 Tealbook, the red line, and at present, the black line.	11.0	999.0
201612	294	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Last December we projected the yield on three-month Treasury securities would stand at 1½ percent by now, about 1 percentage point higher than its current value.	11.0	999.0
201612	295	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Meanwhile, the 10- year Treasury yield—despite its recent jump—is about 1¼ percentage points lower.	11.0	999.0
201612	296	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As we have informed you previously, we took some signal from these developments over the past year and marked down our assumption regarding r* in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201612	297	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Taking into account the upward revision we made this round, our estimate of longer-run r* is ¼ percentage point lower than in the December 2015 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	298	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The most important change to our projection this round was that we assumed that an expansionary fiscal policy package would be enacted next year.	11.0	999.0
201612	299	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Obviously, a substantial amount of uncertainty surrounds the ultimate form of any package, so this assumption is meant to serve as a placeholder pending further developments.	11.0	999.0
201612	300	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As is summarized in panel 5, we assume the Congress will pass a personal income tax reduction worth 1 percent of GDP, to begin in the third quarter of next year.	11.0	999.0
201612	301	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We applied a standard marginal propensity to consume out of this income of 0.7 percent, so over the next several years the tax cut boosts GDP by a cumulative 0.7 percent, not including indirect multiplier effects or interest rate offsets.	11.0	999.0
201612	302	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The more stimulative fiscal policy also results in a higher exchange value of the dollar and higher interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201612	303	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 6 provides a summary of the all-in effects of the fiscal assumptions on GDP growth in our projection.	11.0	999.0
201612	304	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As shown by the rose- shaded part of the bar, fiscal policy, which includes both the initial fiscal impetus as well as the multiplier effect, cumulatively boosts spending by 85 basis points between 2017 and 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	305	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	However, the higher interest rates crowd out private spending, and the higher dollar also subtracts from GDP.	11.0	999.0
201612	306	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	On net, we project the fiscal package will boost the level of GDP about 45 basis points by 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	307	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the final bullet of panel 5, as Simon discussed, the nominal 10-year Treasury yield moved up dramatically in the wake of the election, so substantial financial restraint is already in place.	11.0	999.0
201612	308	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	However, we have assumed, based on past experience, that households won’t increase spending in advance of the tax cut—indeed, it takes them three years to build the extra cash flow into their spending habits.	11.0	999.0
201612	309	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201612	310	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen in panels 1 and 2, our projections regarding both headline and core PCE price inflation are little changed from the October Tealbook, as the data have come in close to our expectations, and, in view of how flat we think the Phillips curve is, the modestly higher resource utilization in this projection does not translate into noticeably higher inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	311	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The next two panels parse out the cumulative revisions that we have made to our projections of total and core PCE inflation since December of last year.	11.0	999.0
201612	312	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Total PCE inflation, panel 3, is now estimated to be about 0.3 percentage point higher this year than we projected last December, the black line, as upside surprises to energy prices and to core inflation outweigh the impact of lower-than-expected food prices.	11.0	999.0
201612	313	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The upward surprises to core inflation, parsed in panel 4, cannot be explained by the main factors that we track and so are concentrated in the yellow category with the not-very- illuminating label of “other.”	11.0	999.0
201612	314	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Part of the “other” category reflects the high readings on non-market-based core inflation we have received this year, from which we typically take little signal.	11.0	999.0
201612	315	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 5 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201612	316	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	According to the latest readings, compensation has continued to rise at a moderate pace and is showing some slight signs of acceleration.	11.0	999.0
201612	317	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In exhibit 4, I summarize the FOMC memo that examined episodes in which the unemployment rate undershot its natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	318	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For reference, the shaded regions in panel 1 highlight the domestic episodes of undershooting; I’ve also plotted total PCE price inflation on the chart.	11.0	999.0
201612	319	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In selecting these episodes, we relied on real-time data and current staff estimates of the natural rate, records of FOMC meetings such as transcripts and minutes, contemporaneous Monetary Policy Reports and testimonies, as well as the research literature.	11.0	999.0
201612	320	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The findings are summarized in panel 2.	11.0	999.0
201612	321	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	First, although they are not common, soft landings have occurred.	11.0	999.0
201612	322	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We identified one domestic example, the mid-1990s, and two examples from advanced foreign economies.	11.0	999.0
201612	323	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	We took a very restrictive definition of a “soft landing,” as we required that the unemployment rate stabilize at or below real-time estimates of the natural rate and that no recession occur for a few years once the soft landing was achieved.	11.0	999.0
201612	324	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	This definition ruled out, for example, the moderation in the unemployment rate around 1984, because, at that time, the Committee viewed the unemployment rate as well above their estimate of its natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	325	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And it ruled out the late 1990s and mid-2000s in the United States, as, in both cases, recessions followed within a couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201612	326	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Second, the soft landings share some characteristics.	11.0	999.0
201612	327	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Monetary policy typically began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell significantly below the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	328	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, the achievement of a soft landing depended substantially on the nature of the shocks that hit the economy.	11.0	999.0
201612	329	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For instance, all three soft landings occurred during the mid-1990s or early 2000s, at a time when structural productivity growth was unexpectedly strong.	11.0	999.0
201612	330	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Another finding, unsurprisingly, is that tight labor markets have often been associated with higher inflation, both domestically and in the AFEs.	11.0	999.0
201612	331	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the United States, the most prominent examples occurred in the late 1960s and 1970s.	11.0	999.0
201612	332	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	These episodes shared several features, which are summarized in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201612	333	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	First, the inflation process was different then.	11.0	999.0
201612	334	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Panel 4 displays the coefficients on slack and inflation persistence from 10-year rolling regressions of an inflation equation similar to that used by the staff.	11.0	999.0
201612	335	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As can be seen by the red line, inflation was more sensitive to slack in the 1970s than in subsequent years, and inflation was more persistent (the black line).	11.0	999.0
201612	336	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In panel 3, in many inflationary episodes, the Committee appeared to have underestimated the depth of the undershooting.	11.0	999.0
201612	337	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	For instance, during the 1960s, the Committee thought full employment was consistent with an unemployment rate of 4 percent, below current estimates.	11.0	999.0
201612	338	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Similarly, Athanasios Orphanides has shown that estimates of the output gap during the 1970s based on real-time information show lower levels of resource utilization than estimates based on current vintages of data and revised estimates of potential.	11.0	999.0
201612	339	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A final feature of these inflationary episodes is that, for a variety of reasons, monetary policymakers in the 1960s and 1970s did not always focus on restraining economic activity in order to avoid inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	340	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	As summarized in the last bullet of panel 2, we also sought to determine whether past incidents of undershooting were associated with financial instability and found that while financial imbalances and unemployment undershoots are correlated, causality is difficult to infer.	11.0	999.0
201612	341	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And we examined whether running a “hot economy” has been associated with permanent improvements in the labor market.	11.0	999.0
201612	342	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Again, the results were ambiguous.	11.0	999.0
201612	343	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	On both questions, the research literature is sparse, and more research is warranted.	11.0	999.0
201612	344	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Let me conclude with a few thoughts.	11.0	999.0
201612	345	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Clearly, the historical record is ambiguous regarding the outcome of unemployment undershootings.	11.0	999.0
201612	346	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In the current situation, differences in the inflation process, along with the fact that inflation has been below the Committee’s objective, suggest that a substantial and unwanted move of inflation above the Committee’s objective is less likely than a simple assessment of historical episodes might suggest.	11.0	999.0
201612	347	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In addition, we continue to judge that financial stability vulnerabilities are currently at only a moderate level.	11.0	999.0
201612	348	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That said, some of the factors that increase the risk associated with undershooting remain.	11.0	999.0
201612	349	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In view of the uncertainty surrounding both published data and our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment and potential output, we could be mismeasuring the amount of slack in the economy.	11.0	999.0
201612	350	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Moreover, as panel 4 suggests, the inflation process is not static and could revert such that inflation is more likely to move higher.	11.0	999.0
201612	351	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Finally, the economy remains subject to substantial shocks—and these shocks will certainly have an important effect on the outcome.	11.0	999.0
201612	352	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Brian Doyle will now continue with the international section of our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201612	353	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Thank you, Stephanie.	11.0	999.0
201612	354	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	At this point, you could be forgiven for being sick of hearing about the US election.	11.0	999.0
201612	355	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But after countless months of heated campaigning and more than a month of post-election debate, I hope you will indulge me in talking a little more about its implications for the foreign economies.	11.0	999.0
201612	356	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, an overview of the forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	357	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As seen in panel 1, third-quarter foreign real GDP growth recovered more strongly from its second-quarter doldrums than we had expected in October.	11.0	999.0
201612	358	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	After moderating in the fourth quarter, foreign growth settles around 2½ percent, subdued by historical standards, throughout the remainder of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	359	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As has been the case for some time, this outlook is helped by highly accommodative monetary policy in advanced foreign economies and a recovery— albeit a tepid one—in South America.	11.0	999.0
201612	360	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Expected changes in US policy have two small but noticeable effects on our foreign forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	361	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, tighter financial conditions have left a small negative imprint on the near-term forecast, especially in emerging market economies (EMEs).	11.0	999.0
201612	362	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As Simon has noted, since the US election, longer-term rates, panel 2, have risen in most foreign economies; EME credit spreads, panel 3, have increased; and the dollar has appreciated sharply and broadly.	11.0	999.0
201612	363	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Second, the staff’s assumed additional US fiscal stimulus has a small net positive effect on foreign GDP growth later in the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	364	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will discuss the fiscal stimulus effects first, then return to how we are interpreting the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	365	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To gauge the effects of changes in US fiscal policy on foreign economies, we conduct two simulations using the IF Division’s SIGMA model, shown in panels 4 through 7.	11.0	999.0
201612	366	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The first is an anticipated US tax cut of 1 percent of GDP, the blue lines, beginning in the third quarter of 2017 as assumed in the staff’s baseline forecast, and the second, shown by the red lines, augments this tax cut with another 1 percent of GDP in government spending as in an alternative scenario in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	367	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In both cases the results are just illustrative, but the model is calibrated so that the effect on US GDP is reasonably in line with the staff’s assessment in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	368	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As you can see in panel 4, the boost from the tax cut scenario to foreign GDP is quite modest, less than one-fifth of the effect seen in the United States in the staff forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	369	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	This foreign output response has helped inform what we have built into the foreign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201612	370	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	This effect operates through three channels.	11.0	999.0
201612	371	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	First, foreign exports, panel 5, are boosted as US consumers spend some of the tax cut on foreign goods and, second, as the dollar, panel 6, rises almost 1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	372	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But, third, foreign interest rates also rise, panel 7, in part as foreign monetary policy reacts to stronger economic growth and higher inflation.	11.0	999.0
201612	373	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Thus, domestic demand in the foreign economy is crowded out some.	11.0	999.0
201612	374	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In the alternative scenario in which additional US fiscal spending is added, the foreign growth effects, the red line in panel 4, are somewhat more than doubled, reflecting the larger effects on US GDP from a similarly sized package of government spending.	11.0	999.0
201612	375	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In exhibit 6, the broad dollar, the black line in panel 1, has appreciated more than 3 percent since the election, with more of the move coming against the EMEs and with outsized rises against the Japanese yen in green and the Mexican peso in yellow.	11.0	999.0
201612	376	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Beyond this higher jumping-off point, we continue to expect the dollar to appreciate further over the forecast period, panel 2, reflecting our assessment that market expectations of US monetary policy rates are still below those assumed in the staff forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	377	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Accordingly, as in past forecasts, we project the dollar to rise as markets are surprised by the degree of FOMC tightening.	11.0	999.0
201612	378	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As we have indicated for some time, this dollar path could prove wrong for several reasons.	11.0	999.0
201612	379	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To begin with, the sensitivity of the dollar with respect to surprises in monetary policy is quite uncertain.	11.0	999.0
201612	380	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in the scatterplot in panel 3, our rule of thumb is that the dollar’s value against the AFE currencies rises about 1 percent for roughly every 30 basis point surprise in interest rates.	11.0	999.0
201612	381	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	However, this relationship has varied a lot in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201612	382	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And thus the dollar could be stronger or weaker than we expect.	11.0	999.0
201612	383	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Furthermore, as Simon noted, some of the recent dollar appreciation is likely a response to expectations of more stimulative US fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	384	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	If we take the post- election shift in monetary policy expectations as solely due to changes in fiscal policy expectations, then our rule of thumb suggests that only about half of the appreciation is a result of fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	385	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the red dot in panel 3, over the five days following the election, the AFE index of the dollar rose about 2 percent, whereas our rule of thumb predicted only a 1 percent rise, on the basis of the more than 30 basis point widening of the interest rate differential shown on the horizontal axis.	11.0	999.0
201612	386	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Note that the 1 percent rise from the rule of thumb is about the same as the increase in the dollar shown in our fiscal scenario on the previous slide.	11.0	999.0
201612	387	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	How do we account for the difference between our rule of thumb and the actual move in the dollar?	11.0	999.0
201612	388	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	One possibility is that markets share the staff’s view on the size of the fiscal expansion, but the sensitivity of the dollar with respect to interest rates was higher than our rule of thumb during the period.	11.0	999.0
201612	389	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In this case, assuming the 1-percent-of-GDP fiscal package materializes, the dollar might well evolve as we project in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	390	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But another possibility is that markets are expecting a much larger fiscal package than we are assuming.	11.0	999.0
201612	391	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Indeed, in the alternative scenario with a larger fiscal policy, the dollar appreciates about twice as much.	11.0	999.0
201612	392	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In that case, if the staff assumption for fiscal policy materializes and markets are surprised by how small the fiscal package turns out to be, the dollar might well prove weaker than we are projecting.	11.0	999.0
201612	393	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And a third possibility is that the outsized rise in the dollar reflects other factors besides fiscal expansion.	11.0	999.0
201612	394	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Some of these factors are reviewed in your next exhibit.	11.0	999.0
201612	395	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To begin with, talk about repatriation of foreign profits of US companies could have put upward pressure on the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	396	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That said, the effect of repatriation on the dollar would probably be relatively small.	11.0	999.0
201612	397	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in panel 1, during the previous episode of repatriation, which was announced in June and passed in October of 2004, the dollar declined against AFEs, although it then moved up before the second half of 2005, when we believe most repatriation flows took place.	11.0	999.0
201612	398	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Furthermore, currently, an estimated 70 to 95 percent of the more than $1 trillion in US corporations’ cash held abroad is held in US dollar-denominated accounts, and transferring these funds from foreign subsidiaries to US parents would not affect the value of the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	399	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Another factor that might have led to the recent outsized rise in the dollar was concerns that EMEs would be especially vulnerable to future increases in interest rates and other developments, as highlighted in a Tealbook alternative scenario.	11.0	999.0
201612	400	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	EME capital flows, panel 2, turned sharply negative after the election.	11.0	999.0
201612	401	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And, as shown in the scatterplot in panel 3, the EME currencies that fell the most since the election were those with greater underlying structural and macroeconomic vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201612	402	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	A third factor that may have boosted the dollar recently, or which could influence the dollar in the future, is the risk that the United States will erect trade barriers or tighten immigration policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	403	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The first of these likely explains part of the outsized decline in the Mexican peso, which has a large weight in the broad dollar index.	11.0	999.0
201612	404	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	However, it is unclear whether this consideration explains movements in other currencies.	11.0	999.0
201612	405	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in panel 4, if one excludes Mexico from the scatterplot, the correlation between currency depreciation and the importance of exports to the United States is close to zero.	11.0	999.0
201612	406	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will return to trade policy shortly.	11.0	999.0
201612	407	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Besides the factors that likely contributed to the dollar’s immediate post-election surge, a number of other factors will likely affect the dollar’s path in the future.	11.0	999.0
201612	408	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	One of them is worries about Europe.	11.0	999.0
201612	409	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	To be sure, the failed Italian referendum left only a limited mark on financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201612	410	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But many risks remain, including the fragility of the European banking sector and concerns that the Brexit vote is one more crack in a fracturing European project.	11.0	999.0
201612	411	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And with several key elections scheduled during 2017, as listed in panel 5, worries that an anti-EU group could gain power will likely feed dollar strength for some time.	11.0	999.0
201612	412	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Additionally, China is a perennial risk to the dollar forecast.	11.0	999.0
201612	413	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Even before the election, as Simon noted, private capital outflows from China, the gray bars in panel 6, had reaccelerated, apparently on renewed expectations that the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar is a one-way bet.	11.0	999.0
201612	414	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Indeed, the RMB has continued to depreciate against the dollar over the intermeeting period, falling 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	415	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Authorities have increased their intervention to support the renminbi and more recently imposed additional capital controls.	11.0	999.0
201612	416	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But the accelerated outflows raise the possibility of a more rapid depreciation of the RMB that unsettles markets.	11.0	999.0
201612	417	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In your next exhibit, despite these risks, and as shown in panel 1, looking through the short-term soybean-related wiggles of late, past dollar appreciation as well as that expected to come continues to weigh on the net export contribution to US GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201612	418	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The higher dollar has increased the drag arising from net exports, panel 2, although the direct boost to imports due to US fiscal policy stimulus, panel 3, plays a sizable role as well, especially further out in the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201612	419	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	It bears mentioning that at this point in our business cycle, some drag due to net exports in the next couple of years is not necessarily undesirable—it represents one of the transmission channels of a normalization of monetary policy designed to avert overheating in an environment of full or near-full employment.	11.0	999.0
201612	420	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As noted in panel 4, this baseline forecast of US trade does not include effects of potential trade measures, except to the extent that worries over higher tariffs may have affected the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201612	421	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As discussed in greater depth by my colleague Rob Vigfusson in his pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, the President has broad authority to raise tariffs, and President-elect Trump has discussed several possible actions, including renegotiating or withdrawing from NAFTA and declaring China a currency manipulator.	11.0	999.0
201612	422	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The panels below illustrate the macroeconomic effects of a generic 10 percent rise in tariffs.	11.0	999.0
201612	423	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the blue line in panel 5, in principle, a unilateral and persistent hike in tariffs could raise US output in the short run by shifting foreign production to domestic producers and thus boosting the trade balance, panel 6.	11.0	999.0
201612	424	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But the rise in import costs raises inflation, panel 7, which together with the increase in output will result in monetary policy tightening, not shown, and a higher dollar, panel 8, muting some of the shift in trade.	11.0	999.0
201612	425	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Moreover, higher interest rates and import costs also lower investment, not shown.	11.0	999.0
201612	426	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Outside of the model, it may be difficult to shift production to domestic producers quickly because of specialized production or long-term contracts, and higher trade barriers might disrupt supply chains and, hence, reduce production.	11.0	999.0
201612	427	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Of course, tariffs rarely remain unilateral.	11.0	999.0
201612	428	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As shown by the red lines in panels 5 and 6, when the foreign country reciprocates with matching-percentage tariffs, US output is hurt even in the short run, in part as US exports decline relative to baseline.	11.0	999.0
201612	429	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Over the longer run, while some of these shorter-run issues might work themselves out, higher tariffs are almost always a net negative for aggregate economic growth and welfare, in part by hampering productivity, although the estimated size of the negative effect of tariffs varies in the literature.	11.0	999.0
201612	430	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I will now turn to Don Kim, who will brief on participants’ Summary of Economic Projections submissions.	11.0	999.0
201612	431	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	432	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201612	433	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	To summarize, most of your economic projections are little changed from the September SEP, although the median projected path of the federal funds rate is slightly higher.	11.0	999.0
201612	434	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	However, more of you now see the uncertainty surrounding your economic projections as above historically typical levels, and fewer of you now see the risks to economic growth or inflation as tilted to the downside or the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201612	435	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	436	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections of real GDP growth this year is 1.9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	437	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Most of you project that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and run at or above your estimates of its longer-run rate through 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	438	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2016 is 4.7 percent, slightly below the median of its longer-run normal level.	11.0	999.0
201612	439	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Almost all of you see the unemployment rate falling a bit further next year and expect it to remain below its longer-run normal level through 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	440	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.5 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 and 2019, with several of you projecting a modest overshooting of the 2 percent objective in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	441	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	In the bottom panel, the median of your projections of core inflation also increases gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201612	442	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the September Summary of Economic Projections and with the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	443	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As indicated in the top panel, the medians of your projections of economic growth have edged up since September, and, as shown in the second panel, the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate have edged down.	11.0	999.0
201612	444	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Most of you who revised these projections pointed to forthcoming changes in fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	445	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation this year was revised up moderately, largely reflecting incoming data.	11.0	999.0
201612	446	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Although a majority of you have modestly revised up your projection of core PCE inflation this year, the median of your projections of core inflation this year, shown in the fourth panel, is unchanged.	11.0	999.0
201612	447	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The medians of your projections of headline and core inflation beyond this year are also unchanged.	11.0	999.0
201612	448	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Compared with the December Tealbook, the medians of your projections of real GDP growth are roughly similar, while the medians of your projections of the unemployment rate and of the headline and core inflation rates are generally somewhat higher than those presented in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	449	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	450	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Your projections of the federal funds rate at the end of this year, shown at the left of the upper panel, suggest that all of you assumed a 25 basis point rate hike at this meeting.	11.0	999.0
201612	451	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thereafter, the medians of your projections, marked by horizontal red lines, are 1.38 percent at the end of 2017, 2.13 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.88 percent at the end of 2019, with the median projection for each of these three years 25 basis points higher than in September, shown in the bottom panel.	11.0	999.0
201612	452	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The median of the longer-run federal funds rate rose slightly to 3 percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	453	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As in September, almost all of you anticipated that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 would remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level, but about half of you, considerably more than in September, now project the funds rate to overshoot its longer-run level in 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	454	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes—conditional on your individual projections of core inflation, the unemployment rate gap, and the longer-run federal funds rate— has shifted up since September.	11.0	999.0
201612	455	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The rise in the Taylor rule prescription for the end of this year primarily reflects upward revisions to projected inflation and downward revisions to the unemployment rate, while the higher Taylor rule prescriptions for years beyond 2016 result largely from the downward revisions to the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201612	456	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Almost all of you project levels of the federal funds rate in 2016 to 2018 that are well below the prescriptions derived by using your individual economic outlooks as inputs into the policy rule formula.	11.0	999.0
201612	457	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	The median of your projections for 2019 is also below the median Taylor rule prescription but much closer than for preceding years.	11.0	999.0
201612	458	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 4 provides some detail on your assumptions about fiscal policy and some analysis of the effects on your projections.	11.0	999.0
201612	459	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Based on your written narratives, nine of you incorporated some change in fiscal policy in your baseline projections, with most of this group assuming that the fiscal stimulus would be of the same order of magnitude as in the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201612	460	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Among the eight of you who did not incorporate a change in fiscal policy into your baseline projections, many expressed the view that at this point uncertainty surrounding prospective changes in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is not yet enough information to make a reasonable assumption about the magnitude of the changes.	11.0	999.0
201612	461	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As can be seen in the top and middle sections of the lower panel, the revisions since September in your projections of real GDP growth and the unemployment rate for those of you who have not incorporated a change in fiscal policy are close to zero on average.	11.0	999.0
201612	462	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	In contrast, those of you who incorporated some stimulus from fiscal policy, on average, modestly revised up your projections of real output growth and revised down your projections of the unemployment rate in 2018 and 2019.	11.0	999.0
201612	463	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	A similar breakdown for the changes in your assumptions about appropriate monetary policy compared with September is shown in the bottom section; those of you who incorporated a change in fiscal policy revised up your projections of the federal funds rate in 2018 and 2019 by about 25 to 30 basis points on average, while those of you who did not change your fiscal assumption had little change in your federal funds rate projections on average.	11.0	999.0
201612	464	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you mentioned that the recent tightening in financial conditions, together with a somewhat steeper path of the policy rate, provides a partial offset to the effects of the fiscal stimulus, which may help explain the relatively small size of the revisions to the economic variables, even for those who have incorporated a change in fiscal policy.	11.0	999.0
201612	465	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 5 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201612	466	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As shown in the figures to the left, a majority of you continue to view the uncertainty associated with your projections as broadly similar to the average of the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201612	467	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	However, more of you now see the uncertainty about GDP growth, the unemployment rate, or inflation as higher than in September.	11.0	999.0
201612	468	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you mentioned uncertainty surrounding fiscal, trade, immigration, or regulatory policies, noting that it is difficult to predict the size, timing, and composition of these policy changes.	11.0	999.0
201612	469	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	As illustrated in the figures to the right, fewer of you now see the risks to economic growth and inflation as weighted to the downside and the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside than in September.	11.0	999.0
201612	470	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Many of you noted that the prospect of expansionary fiscal policy had increased the upside risks to output growth and inflation, but many also pointed to factors such as the proximity of short- term nominal interest rates to the effective lower bound, global disinflationary pressures, downside risks in Europe and China, and the possibility of a large jump in financial market volatility in the event that fiscal policy turns out to be less stimulative than expected, as sources of downside risk.	11.0	999.0
201612	471	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	472	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	That concludes our prepared remarks.	11.0	999.0
201612	473	2016-12-14	meeting	KIM	We would be happy to respond to your questions.	11.0	999.0
201612	474	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for any of our presenters?	12.0	65.0
201612	475	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201612	476	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I am sure I should know this, but which are generally more accurate, the SEP forecasts or the Tealbook projections?	12.0	108.0
201612	477	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	For what?	12.0	999.0
201612	478	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	GDP, interest rates, whatever.	12.0	108.0
201612	479	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	The answer is they are both equally bad.	12.0	999.0
201612	480	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	481	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	That’s the best answer.	12.0	999.0
201612	482	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	That was so diplomatic.	12.0	91.0
201612	483	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	They are close enough.	12.0	999.0
201612	484	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	The Tealbook does slightly better on near-term inflation forecasts, but that’s on a very short-run horizon.	12.0	999.0
201612	485	2016-12-14	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But other than that, they are really about the same.	12.0	999.0
201612	486	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Do we need the SEP when we have the Tealbook?	12.0	108.0
201612	487	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we put the SEP into the public domain.	12.0	65.0
201612	488	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Are we going to put the Tealbook out?	12.0	108.0
201612	489	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	12.0	65.0
201612	490	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But we do that with a five-year lag.	12.0	65.0
201612	491	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201612	492	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	12.0	102.0
201612	493	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have two questions for the staff.	12.0	102.0
201612	494	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is a technical one on the simulations you reported this afternoon regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	102.0
201612	495	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those on exhibit 5 were done with the FRB/US model.	12.0	102.0
201612	496	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is that right?	12.0	102.0
201612	497	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No, they were done with the SIGMA model.	12.0	999.0
201612	498	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the Tealbook I thought they were done with the FRB/US model.	12.0	102.0
201612	499	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	500	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	As I noted, we are trying to calibrate the response of US GDP in a model that includes a bigger international sector.	12.0	999.0
201612	501	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201612	502	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	That helped because it is a little confusing.	12.0	102.0
201612	503	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But when I look at the Tealbook assumption about monetary policy in the other advanced foreign economies, except for the United Kingdom, it sounds like you have basically constant, zero, or negative, or whatever interest rates for the next several years.	12.0	102.0
201612	504	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when you did the SIGMA model simulations of a strong fiscal expansion in the United States, did they incorporate these typically very large multipliers for them?	12.0	102.0
201612	505	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	506	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	So in this SIGMA simulation, it’s a three-country model, and the United States of course is one of those countries.	12.0	999.0
201612	507	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The other two countries are split up by those that are at the effective lower bound and those that are not.	12.0	999.0
201612	508	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And those that are not at the effective lower bound, say, for the blue lines, which is the assumed tax cut, get a little bit more than twice the kick because, at the effective lower bound, monetary policy doesn’t respond.	12.0	999.0
201612	509	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And what did you assume about their response?	12.0	102.0
201612	510	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Did you assume that they would just stay at zero for the next few years?	12.0	102.0
201612	511	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	This matters a lot when you do these simulations.	12.0	102.0
201612	512	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	513	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	They don’t respond for a while.	12.0	999.0
201612	514	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201612	515	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the rest of the world, fiscal stimulus in the United States is exactly what the doctor ordered, as they are at the interest-rate lower bound.	12.0	102.0
201612	516	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to make sure that that I had that right.	12.0	102.0
201612	517	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second question was more of a question to the staff.	12.0	102.0
201612	518	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I read Tealbook A, I was surprised.	12.0	102.0
201612	519	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually thought I was reading the September one.	12.0	102.0
201612	520	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, on the risks to the GDP outlook, I was surprised the Tealbook took the stand that the risks were still tilted to the downside.	12.0	102.0
201612	521	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I look at the SEP responses or when I read the Monday morning briefing, which I know had an alternative view aspect, it seems to me there are now a lot of risks to the upside in terms of fiscal policy, at least in the short term.	12.0	102.0
201612	522	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I describe my views, I was “balanced but slightly to the soft side” because of the effective lower bound, but then this shifted me over to “balanced but slightly to the upside” because of the potential for much larger fiscal stimulus than you incorporated.	12.0	102.0
201612	523	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Could you explain your thinking about why overall the risks were still to the downside on GDP and the upside on unemployment?	12.0	102.0
201612	524	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Our views on fiscal policy have changed in the period since the outcome of the election.	12.0	999.0
201612	525	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Previously, our rationale had included a view that fiscal policy was unlikely to be marshaled heavily in opposition to material weakening in cyclical conditions.	12.0	999.0
201612	526	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But it remains the case, in our judgment, that monetary policy, both here and abroad, is probably less well positioned to combat a significant cyclical weakening.	12.0	999.0
201612	527	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Even with the upward tilt, we think that, if it’s long enough until the next recession ensues, monetary policy in the United States, in any event, will be reasonably well positioned to combat that.	12.0	999.0
201612	528	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But at the moment, on the basis of how much reduction in the funds rate the Committee has judged to be appropriate in the face of an average-sized recession and on the basis of how large the balance sheet is already, the capacity for a material monetary policy easing is now less than has been the case historically.	12.0	999.0
201612	529	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, David, that’s exactly what I thought you were thinking.	12.0	102.0
201612	530	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I’m expecting that I am walking into something.	12.0	999.0
201612	531	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	532	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, you are walking into agreement with me, which is probably what you want to run from here.	12.0	102.0
201612	533	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And that makes me—I’ve got my hand on my wallet.	12.0	999.0
201612	534	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But seriously, it sounds like it’s not really a near-term kind of assessment.	12.0	102.0
201612	535	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really more of a medium- or longer-term assessment of where we are in terms of—if I can say this—the steady-state balance of risks, because of the lower bound with a low r* and with the global conditions that you anticipate.	12.0	102.0
201612	536	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reason I point this out is that it’s not just a statement in a way about, well, right now we’re still at a low interest rate, right now core inflation is 1¾ percent, because even with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate and core inflation roughly at our target, in the Tealbook you still see this as a scenario in which the underlying risks are still to the downside.	12.0	102.0
201612	537	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that maybe just trying to make that point is helpful.	12.0	102.0
201612	538	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I thought I was with you, but you indicated the opposite conclusion than what I thought.	12.0	999.0
201612	539	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I thought I heard you just say that our judgment is mainly a medium-term judgment about asymmetric risks, and I would have said the opposite—that my concern predominantly is a recession, if one were to occur.	12.0	999.0
201612	540	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t have one in the baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	541	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But we’re talking about risks here.	12.0	999.0
201612	542	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And a recession in the next year or two, before the level of the funds rate has moved further up in its trajectory, would cause greater concern in terms of the ability of the Committee to fight the effects of the recession.	12.0	999.0
201612	543	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But then some ways, as long as there is a lower bound, isn’t that always the case?	12.0	96.0
201612	544	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	12.0	102.0
201612	545	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s what I’m wondering about.	12.0	102.0
201612	546	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because you have 4.2 percent unemployment, you’re basically at baseline in that situation.	12.0	102.0
201612	547	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Implicit in our projection, I think, is that there are some headwinds and that some normalization of real macroeconomic conditions will occur over the next few years, and that will give the Committee some greater scope to raise the funds rate.	12.0	999.0
201612	548	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, the Laubach and Williams estimates are that the equilibrium real rate is, I think, in the neighborhood of about ¼ percent at the moment.	12.0	999.0
201612	549	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	In the longer run, we now, having incorporated a more expansionary fiscal policy, have it at 1 percent.	12.0	999.0
201612	550	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And so, as that process of increase in the equilibrium short rate unfolds, that will give a little bit greater scope for an easing of the stance of monetary policy in the future, several years down the road, than would be available today.	12.0	999.0
201612	551	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, my concern, obviously, is that that doesn’t occur, right?	12.0	102.0
201612	552	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we reduce our balance sheet and everything, we will find that the equilibrium real rate is actually quite low.	12.0	102.0
201612	553	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, anyway, this is just a topic for further discussion.	12.0	102.0
201612	554	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It certainly is an admissible risk.	12.0	999.0
201612	555	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not what is envisioned in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	556	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201612	557	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I have several questions, but first I wanted to build on what President Williams said.	12.0	96.0
201612	558	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess my view of the risks to the forecast is that you have a modal forecast and then you ask, where is the skew of the distribution?	12.0	96.0
201612	559	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not about where the lower bound lies relative to the funds rate.	12.0	96.0
201612	560	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess I interpret the balance of the risks differently, I think, than you do.	12.0	96.0
201612	561	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to ask about two different things.	12.0	96.0
201612	562	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	First of all, what’s the staff’s thinking about what level of knowledge they have to have before they put something in the Tealbook?	12.0	96.0
201612	563	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, I was really struck by how the FOMC participants handled the fiscal uncertainty in very distinct ways, yet the Tealbook put in 1 percent, starting in the third quarter.	12.0	96.0
201612	564	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s the threshold for deciding to do that relative to deciding to put something in for trade barriers going up or immigration policy being tightened?	12.0	96.0
201612	565	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, how do you think about that?	12.0	96.0
201612	566	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Because we have this very specific fiscal forecast, and when I think about the uncertainty associated with it, it’s just enormous in terms of magnitude, timing, and composition.	12.0	96.0
201612	567	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When does it get over the bar?	12.0	96.0
201612	568	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What is the decision rule?	12.0	96.0
201612	569	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess that’s what I’m asking.	12.0	96.0
201612	570	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	571	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think there are two issues.	12.0	999.0
201612	572	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	One is, how do we make the decision to put something in?	12.0	999.0
201612	573	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And then what do we decide to put in?	12.0	999.0
201612	574	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Because once we decide to do something, it’s a modal forecast, so we need to write down something specific.	12.0	999.0
201612	575	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	In this case we felt that, in view of what had been said during the election campaign and as the Republicans will control the White House and the Congress, there seemed to be some appetite for doing something, and we thought it was likely.	12.0	999.0
201612	576	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	There has long been talk about tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	577	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The Republicans have been in favor of doing that, and it was something that Donald Trump campaigned on.	12.0	999.0
201612	578	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The House Republicans have had a plan that has been circulated, and it is actually pretty similar in magnitude to what we built into the forecast.	12.0	999.0
201612	579	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think that there is clearly a huge range of uncertainty.	12.0	999.0
201612	580	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But a tax cut was under discussion to a sufficient degree that we thought it seemed likely that they would move forward on this.	12.0	999.0
201612	581	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And, actually, this situation is similar to what happened in the early 2000s when, even before the 2000 election, there was some talk about tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	582	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And, actually, once George W.	12.0	999.0
201612	583	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Bush came into office, their implementation moved forward pretty quickly.	12.0	999.0
201612	584	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bar is sort of:  That you’re highly confident of direction.	12.0	96.0
201612	585	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	586	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	If you’re reasonably confident of direction, then you’re going to put something in.	12.0	96.0
201612	587	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a way to think about it?	12.0	96.0
201612	588	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think so.	12.0	999.0
201612	589	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That’s how I was thinking about our having moved in that direction.	12.0	999.0
201612	590	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12.0	96.0
201612	591	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Although it’s worth noting, by comparison, on the trade policy front, we are also moderately confident in direction.	12.0	999.0
201612	592	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	593	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We expect that if there are going to be moves, they will be toward higher barriers of trade.	12.0	999.0
201612	594	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the array of different possible actions that have been floated by the campaign were so disparate, and the magnitude of some of the individual items—reopening NAFTA, declaring China a trade manipulator—were so difficult to gauge that it was very hard even to assess whether there would be actions that would be macroeconomically meaningful, or whether there would just be a series of disparate actions that might have microeconomic effects but not amount to a lot on the macro side.	12.0	999.0
201612	595	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	So, for that reason, we chose not to assume trade policies in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201612	596	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Look, I don’t think there is a perfect choice here.	12.0	96.0
201612	597	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is just really a hard choice.	12.0	96.0
201612	598	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to understand the rationale.	12.0	96.0
201612	599	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I’d just like to elaborate on one other aspect of how we made the decision.	12.0	999.0
201612	600	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Sure.	12.0	96.0
201612	601	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We had to make a decision to do something.	12.0	999.0
201612	602	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	It was clear that financial market participants made a judgment that something is likely to be in the offing.	12.0	999.0
201612	603	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Agreed.	12.0	96.0
201612	604	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I think it would have been reasonable, and, indeed, I contemplated seriously putting in front of the Committee a projection in which we had no fiscal adjustment.	12.0	999.0
201612	605	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	That would have required a more elaborate process of backing out, on the basis of financial market quotes, some allowance for the response that they had built in, in anticipation of a fiscal policy path that we were not putting in.	12.0	999.0
201612	606	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	607	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it really was, more or less, a coincidence, not a design objective, that the fiscal package that our analysts proposed to put in does seem to be in pretty good alignment with what most financial market participants are writing down, and that’s documented in the memo that we sent to the Committee.	12.0	999.0
201612	608	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	We look like we’re in the middle of the pack of the various people who were taking a swing at making some kind of judgment.	12.0	999.0
201612	609	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	So to a degree I think that has eased our analytical burden in constructing a coherent forecast that had one story behind it.	12.0	999.0
201612	610	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	But I would say that to help the Committee in its thinking, we put a couple of alternative scenarios in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section, one with no fiscal package and one that is, roughly speaking, twice as big.	12.0	999.0
201612	611	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	The other percentage point’s worth of GDP comes in the form of government spending rather than tax cuts.	12.0	999.0
201612	612	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I thought it was good to do.	12.0	96.0
201612	613	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to switch gears a little bit.	12.0	96.0
201612	614	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I liked the memos on unemployment-rate undershooting.	12.0	96.0
201612	615	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The one thing they didn’t get into, though, is this empirical regularity, at least for the United States, whose unemployment rate either goes up a little or it goes up a lot, and I think in the memo they talked about different countries’ experiences.	12.0	96.0
201612	616	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there was one country, Canada, for which it did go up 1 percentage point.	12.0	96.0
201612	617	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But why we see this empirical regularity that the unemployment either goes up a trivial amount, or by a lot, is interesting.	12.0	96.0
201612	618	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And I guess I’m still curious about the staff’s views on that, whether that is just a statistical anomaly, because we haven’t had that many business cycles, or if there’s something dynamically going on in the economy when the unemployment rate starts to go up that generates those kinds of outcomes.	12.0	96.0
201612	619	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And the memos were silent on that one question.	12.0	96.0
201612	620	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	621	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	A couple of years ago, the staff actually did send a memo to the Committee on that, documenting that empirical regularity.	12.0	999.0
201612	622	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And what it found was that those episodes in which the unemployment rate did go up a lot were often associated with efforts on the part of the Committee to—	12.0	999.0
201612	623	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Make it so?	12.0	96.0
201612	624	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	—to make it so, to tame inflation.	12.0	999.0
201612	625	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And I will note that there were a couple of episodes—in particular, the mid-1990s—when the unemployment rate did come up a bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	626	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But it came up slowly enough that it didn’t trigger this particular stylized fact that you’re referring to.	12.0	999.0
201612	627	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12.0	96.0
201612	628	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The stylized fact is something along the lines of, say, a three-month moving average of the unemployment rate, because it’s noisy, rises 0.4 percentage point.	12.0	999.0
201612	629	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Or more.	12.0	96.0
201612	630	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes, or more, over the course of a quarter or two.	12.0	999.0
201612	631	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Actually, in the mid-1990s, when we did find one of these soft landings, in fact, it was a soft landing from below, where the unemployment rate, relative to what we thought was the natural rate then, did come up a bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	632	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Clearly, we do think that there are some dynamics, once the economy does start into a recession, that generate these rapid increases in the unemployment rate.	12.0	999.0
201612	633	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But I wouldn’t say that I thought that the memo precluded the possibility of these other rises.	12.0	999.0
201612	634	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Actually, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the period for which we sort of identified the interrupted soft landing, the unemployment rate was gradually drifting up.	12.0	999.0
201612	635	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And we were kind of ambivalent about whether that would have ended in a recession, had not the shock associated with the 1990 invasion of Kuwait occurred.	12.0	999.0
201612	636	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But that’s another case in which there is some evidence of it.	12.0	999.0
201612	637	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So, not to put words in your mouth—would you characterize yourself as believing, agnostic, not believing?	12.0	96.0
201612	638	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Agnostic, is that the way you are on this issue?	12.0	96.0
201612	639	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	About whether the unemployment rate would—	12.0	999.0
201612	640	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Whether there’s something there or just a statistical artifact.	12.0	96.0
201612	641	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think there is something there, in the sense that I think when we enter a recession the unemployment rate goes up quickly, and that’s often when you see it.	12.0	999.0
201612	642	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	But I don’t think that that precludes the possibility that you can have those gradual increases.	12.0	999.0
201612	643	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I think we haven’t seen that many of them because we don’t have that many examples, but when we were looking, there weren’t that many examples we identified in which the Committee actually said that it was trying to achieve a soft landing.	12.0	999.0
201612	644	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	And so I think it’s just a little unclear.	12.0	999.0
201612	645	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	I don’t think the fact that we view this empirical regularity rules out the possibility that it can also go up gradually.	12.0	999.0
201612	646	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So to President Rosengren, don’t despair.	12.0	96.0
201612	647	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	12.0	96.0
201612	648	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And with that, we turn the floor over to President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201612	649	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I want to follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley’s first question and David Wilcox’s response to it.	12.0	90.0
201612	650	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I look at the revisions to the projections broken out by change in fiscal assumption and no change in fiscal assumption, I see that the no change in fiscal assumption for the real GDP is zero, minus 0.01, 0.01, and zero.	12.0	90.0
201612	651	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, no change from the previous time.	12.0	90.0
201612	652	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	But we observe that the 10-year Treasury yield is 70 basis points higher.	12.0	90.0
201612	653	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Either you had to do the exercise that David talked about, which is to back out all the financial market movements in order to be able to come up with that forecast, or you have to be modeling a very severe monetary policy contraction because that would be the reason you don’t have fiscal policy changing—then, presumably, it’s a monetary policy change.	12.0	90.0
201612	654	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In effect, this would be modeling a very substantial monetary policy tightening with no change in GDP.	12.0	90.0
201612	655	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this were to be something that were used in the press conference, I think it would lead to a lot of awkward questioning because you’d have to come up with how people actually backed out their expectation of how much the financial market reaction is due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	90.0
201612	656	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	That could generate a whole host of questions.	12.0	90.0
201612	657	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t know if you were planning on using this in the press conference.	12.0	90.0
201612	658	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I wasn’t planning on using this, but I was planning on, if asked about the SEP, saying that some participants included a fiscal policy change and some didn’t, and that you could note that even when there were assumptions of a fiscal policy change, the changes in the federal funds rate paths were modest.	12.0	65.0
201612	659	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	But then, for those that didn’t, you have to explain how you had a 70 basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield that is not due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.	12.0	90.0
201612	660	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I mean, you do observe that the long rate has gone up a lot.	12.0	90.0
201612	661	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	So how do you explain the way people actually came up with their assumption about no fiscal policy change using actual rates?	12.0	90.0
201612	662	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And you have essentially a 25 basis point increase in the path, which is, as I understand it, similarly to the effect of this fiscal policy package on r*, and a larger, I guess 40 basis point, move in the 10-year Treasury rate.	12.0	65.0
201612	663	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Part of this occurs by term premiums and part by moves in the funds rate.	12.0	65.0
201612	664	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s consistent with the projections that you see here.	12.0	65.0
201612	665	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, there’s a larger market reaction, but there is a lot of uncertainty and we don’t know what assumptions have gone into that—maybe a larger fiscal package than the staff have penciled in here.	12.0	65.0
201612	666	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	President Rosengren, I’m not sure that enough information in the SEP process was collected to answer your question because the 10-year Treasury rate is not specified.	12.0	999.0
201612	667	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	So, in principal, we don’t know how participants handled that.	12.0	999.0
201612	668	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	Also, we didn’t really know why the 10-year Treasury rate was so low.	12.0	999.0
201612	669	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari, then President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201612	670	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Just one quick response—and then I have a question—which is, I didn’t necessarily assume that the market moves are going to be substantial.	12.0	111.0
201612	671	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And when we get more information, the markets may just reverse themselves.	12.0	111.0
201612	672	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	So that wasn’t a factor in my SEP submission.	12.0	111.0
201612	673	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And I put in no fiscal policy change.	12.0	111.0
201612	674	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Onto my question to the staff:  In the alternative scenarios, I was surprised that the banking crisis in Europe was the most negative of all the scenarios.	12.0	111.0
201612	675	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The scenario that I worry about is one in which multiple banks get into trouble at the same time or a bank were to fail.	12.0	111.0
201612	676	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But the scenario you picked was one bank doesn’t fail and goes to resolution.	12.0	111.0
201612	677	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And that alone was enough to trigger a negative scenario for the United States.	12.0	111.0
201612	678	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I wonder if you could expand on that, and explain that mechanism.	12.0	111.0
201612	679	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And then, how worried are you about this, in light of what we’re seeing in Italy and potentially what we’re seeing in Germany?	12.0	111.0
201612	680	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Brian?	12.0	999.0
201612	681	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Unless you’d rather I respond.	12.0	999.0
201612	682	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No, if you want to go ahead, please.	12.0	999.0
201612	683	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201612	684	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll take this one.	12.0	999.0
201612	685	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	First of all, just comparing the two international alternative scenarios, the banking crisis one was, I think, marginally more consequential for US variables than the emerging market turmoil one, but not by a great deal.	12.0	999.0
201612	686	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And, as with most simulations, that reflected in some sense what we put into the simulation, and the inputs included some downward pressure on US confidence and spending and upward pressure on spreads, as the reverberations arising from the banking crisis in Europe spread out through the global economy.	12.0	999.0
201612	687	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We assume that those will be greater in the case of this advanced-economy banking crisis than would be the case in the event of an emerging-market heightened-financial-stress situation.	12.0	999.0
201612	688	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Now, going to the issue of comparing the effect of one bank having a messy resolution with, let’s say, some genuine bankruptcies of some smaller banks, our view was that the scenario in question was one in which if a very large, very systemically important, one of the most systemically important banks in the world located in the northern part of Europe was forced into resolution, and potentially if that resolution was handled in a somewhat messy way, leaving a lot of uncertainty and leading to a sort of reverse-moral-hazard play in which some investors were surprised that they were not bailed out fully, then that situation, due to the highly interconnected nature of the bank, its many counterparties, and its prominence in the global financial system would lead to a lot more contagion and reverberations than, for example, the other very prominent banking situation right now in Europe, which is about Italian banks.	12.0	999.0
201612	689	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Now, you can tell a story in which a resolution in bankruptcy of Monte dei Paschi— which is the current Italian bank that’s the most exposed to problems—with subordinated debt holders being bailed in and with it also being handled poorly so you get queues of people waiting to get their money out, which is seen on nightly television all around Europe, also leads to banking distress.	12.0	999.0
201612	690	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the fact is, right now the resolution of that bank and maybe some other smaller Italian banks is a pretty well-anticipated development.	12.0	999.0
201612	691	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Our sense is that even if that bank gets resolved, which seems to be the most likely situation at present, it would take place without the shock to financial markets and the reverberation through a network of counterparties that would be the case in a messy resolution of a much larger and more systemically important bank.	12.0	999.0
201612	692	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201612	693	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201612	694	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have several questions.	12.0	94.0
201612	695	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, on the net effect of fiscal policy, panel 6 on exhibit 2 shows a net boost to real GDP of 45 basis points.	12.0	94.0
201612	696	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And my question is, is that the total over the three-year period?	12.0	94.0
201612	697	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	The cumulative effect.	12.0	999.0
201612	698	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And I presume this is not statistically significantly different from zero?	12.0	94.0
201612	699	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Given our staff forecast errors, you mean?	12.0	999.0
201612	700	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201612	701	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	702	2016-12-14	meeting	AARONSON	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	703	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s estimated to be a small positive effect, but sort of statistically speaking, you can’t say too much.	12.0	94.0
201612	704	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	705	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Not to mention model uncertainty, which would be gigantic.	12.0	94.0
201612	706	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s correct.	12.0	999.0
201612	707	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	I mean, it has to be correct.	12.0	999.0
201612	708	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, if we were to apply the standard that we would only build in effects that were deemed to be statistically significant, we’d have remarkably little to say.	12.0	999.0
201612	709	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I totally understand.	12.0	94.0
201612	710	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to put in perspective what we can say about future fiscal policy in a realistic sense, in view of model uncertainty and statistical uncertainty, and I think the answer is “not much, but we do the best we can.”	12.0	94.0
201612	711	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On “Understanding Movements in the Dollar,” exhibit 6, if I’m reading the graph on the real dollar—panel 2—correctly, we’re now assuming a bigger appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201612	712	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve talked about this before, and I’ve questioned this before.	12.0	94.0
201612	713	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We’re saying that the dollar is going to appreciate because we’re going to surprise the world with more aggressive monetary policy than it currently expects.	12.0	94.0
201612	714	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And yet when I look at panel 4—“Implied Federal Funds Rate Path”—in Mr Potter’s exhibit 1, I see that the market now expects a much higher federal funds rate path— in fact, much closer to the Committee median—than before.	12.0	94.0
201612	715	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it seems like if anything, on the basis of that, we should be expecting less appreciation of the dollar, not more.	12.0	94.0
201612	716	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In panel 2, if you look at those black solid and black dashed lines of the current and previous forecasts of the broad dollar, most of the difference is the jumping off point—that is, the higher dollar that we’ve already seen.	12.0	999.0
201612	717	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And I realize that it’s almost imperceptible, but if you look at those two lines you’ll actually see that the solid line—the forecasted line—is actually slightly flatter because market expectations and the staff’s implied path of the policy rate have come closer together.	12.0	999.0
201612	718	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	There’s less surprise built in, so this has flattened out the path a little bit.	12.0	999.0
201612	719	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But there’s still some surprise.	12.0	999.0
201612	720	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And that gets you an upward tilt.	12.0	999.0
201612	721	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201612	722	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Look at the implied federal funds rate path.	12.0	94.0
201612	723	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	According to this picture, almost nothing in 2017, very little by the end of 2018—almost all of it is out in 2019.	12.0	94.0
201612	724	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	In Simon’s presentation, what he’s comparing is the market-implied path and the SEP path for September.	12.0	999.0
201612	725	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s changed a little bit.	12.0	94.0
201612	726	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	727	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And what I was referring to was the staff’s assumption regarding policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	728	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And I believe there was a Taylor-rule panel that I feel like I passed through at some point in time.	12.0	999.0
201612	729	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Is it that one right there, Don?	12.0	999.0
201612	730	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s the appreciation of the dollar because the Committee is going to follow the Taylor (1999) rule—as opposed to the SEP path, which tells you what the Committee participants actually think they’re going to do.	12.0	94.0
201612	731	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s what’s implied in the staff projection.	12.0	999.0
201612	732	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Isn’t this a little bit off in comparison with what we should be doing?	12.0	94.0
201612	733	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I mean, you’re projecting increases in the dollar that are affecting the whole milieu of how we’re going to look at the future evolution of the international economy and the US economy.	12.0	94.0
201612	734	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And it’s all based on what you think the Committee is going to do versus what the Taylor rule says the Committee should do.	12.0	94.0
201612	735	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Well, arguably.	12.0	999.0
201612	736	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I mean, let’s put it this way—our job is to present an internally coherent forecast to you.	12.0	999.0
201612	737	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s one in which, basically, market expectations interact with monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	738	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	If we think that markets are going to respond to a monetary policy path that they do not anticipate, that should have implications for the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201612	739	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Those changes in the dollar should feed back to the real economy and, in turn, to monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	740	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	It sounds very circular, and that’s because it is.	12.0	999.0
201612	741	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	No, I understand.	12.0	94.0
201612	742	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that’s why, basically, we need to produce a forecast that takes into account all of the different reactions of the variables to everything else, and what we deliver is what happens after the market has settled down and we’ve converged in our projection to a consistent set of projections.	12.0	999.0
201612	743	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I guess another way to do it would be to take a market-based forecast of the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201612	744	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We could do that.	12.0	999.0
201612	745	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	I think that’s the IMF strategy, in terms of some of its projections.	12.0	999.0
201612	746	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	We can do that.	12.0	999.0
201612	747	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	That would mean that as we think about monetary policies as we go forward and consider changes in those monetary policies and their effect on the economy, then, by assuming a market path for the dollar, which is invariant to our monetary policy, we’re basically shutting down a transmission channel of monetary policy.	12.0	999.0
201612	748	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that should lead, I think, to a less reliable forecast of the economy, or at least one in which you would have to think more about, “This is what the path of the economy will be if the dollar is fixed according to the market path.	12.0	999.0
201612	749	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	What will it be if we think the dollar responds to monetary policy?”	12.0	999.0
201612	750	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	In some sense, it would make your job more complicated in interpreting our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201612	751	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I guess what I’d like to stress to the Committee is that, when we look at these dollar exchange-rate forecasts, they are forecasts made on the basis of the Committee actually following a Taylor (1999) rule.	12.0	94.0
201612	752	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	An inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	12.0	999.0
201612	753	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have one more question on the “Understanding Movements in the Dollar” exhibit, panel 3, “Dollar Response to Monetary Policy Surprises.”	12.0	94.0
201612	754	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Is the staff rule of thumb a fitted regression line or is that just a line?	12.0	94.0
201612	755	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That particular line is just a line.	12.0	999.0
201612	756	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	We have shown the Committee, I think in the chart show in June, what the fitted line has been historically and what it’s been more recently.	12.0	999.0
201612	757	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Since 2010, that line is steeper line.	12.0	999.0
201612	758	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	If you go back historically, the line is shallower.	12.0	999.0
201612	759	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	There’s a lot of uncertainty depending on the time period you choose to look at.	12.0	999.0
201612	760	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	And what we’ve done, I think, over the past year is move that rule of thumb up away from the longer historical period toward a more recent experience.	12.0	999.0
201612	761	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	But the rule of thumb is informed by regressions that we run of exchange rates on changes in interest rates during, before, and after FOMC events.	12.0	999.0
201612	762	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s informed, but it’s not really based on these data.	12.0	94.0
201612	763	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	It actually is based on these data, because these are all the FOMC dates since 2010.	12.0	999.0
201612	764	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201612	765	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	And that, in fact, comprises our sample.	12.0	999.0
201612	766	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So it is a fitted line.	12.0	94.0
201612	767	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201612	768	2016-12-14	meeting	KAMIN	Brian?	12.0	999.0
201612	769	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	No.	12.0	999.0
201612	770	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	Using this period, a fitted line would actually be steeper.	12.0	999.0
201612	771	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	772	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So if it was a fitted regression line, then there would be some confidence bounds surrounding it.	12.0	94.0
201612	773	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It looks to me like the red dot is actually within those bounds.	12.0	94.0
201612	774	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	The red dot is certainly within the confidence bounds.	12.0	999.0
201612	775	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	I mean, the confidence bounds would actually be outside of the presentation.	12.0	999.0
201612	776	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve spent a lot of time in the presentation saying, “Well, this was outsized, looked outsized” or something, but it’s not really.	12.0	94.0
201612	777	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	It’s outsized relative to just the point estimate of the rule of thumb.	12.0	999.0
201612	778	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	But it is true, the confidence bounds are huge.	12.0	999.0
201612	779	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Just look at these blue dots here.	12.0	94.0
201612	780	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got a lot that are just as big as the red dot.	12.0	94.0
201612	781	2016-12-14	meeting	POTTER	The dollar did move a lot, a few days after the election.	12.0	999.0
201612	782	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	No, I understand the dollar moved a lot after the election, but not really that much outside of other events or other surprises that have happened.	12.0	94.0
201612	783	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what this would say.	12.0	94.0
201612	784	2016-12-14	meeting	DOYLE	All right.	12.0	999.0
201612	785	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201612	786	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201612	787	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	788	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201612	789	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201612	790	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201612	791	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Just a brief, partial defense of the staff.	12.0	81.0
201612	792	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Watch your wallet.	12.0	102.0
201612	793	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201612	794	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	This is a man-bites-dog story here.	12.0	97.0
201612	795	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	12.0	97.0
201612	796	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	President Bullard was inviting us to compare the net effect of fiscal policy with the staff’s forecast error.	12.0	81.0
201612	797	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But I think that a part of the staff’s forecast error that’s attributable to shocks that occur in the economy after the forecast is written is irrelevant to the question of the difference between two alternative futures, with and without some assumed intervention.	12.0	81.0
201612	798	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Perhaps some error in that estimation of that difference might be attributable to uncertainty about coefficients, perhaps model uncertainty.	12.0	81.0
201612	799	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But, surely, the forecast error attributable to shocks that are realized is irrelevant to that.	12.0	81.0
201612	800	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think it’s an open question as to whether this is within error bands or outside of them.	12.0	81.0
201612	801	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	What would you say about model uncertainty, President Lacker?	12.0	94.0
201612	802	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Model uncertainty?	12.0	81.0
201612	803	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Models are uncertain.	12.0	81.0
201612	804	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	12.0	81.0
201612	805	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	That’s a blank check, right?	12.0	81.0
201612	806	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I mean, unless you actually calculate it with a certain set of models.	12.0	81.0
201612	807	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And I’m not sure they ever show us those things.	12.0	81.0
201612	808	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	My statement was that we can’t tell with very much accuracy what the improvement would be, and I guess I stand by that.	12.0	94.0
201612	809	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	810	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no more questions, I suggest we begin our economic go-round, have a few presentations, and then take the coffee break later on.	13.0	65.0
201612	811	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201612	812	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201612	813	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	There have been substantial changes in financial markets since our previous meeting.	13.0	90.0
201612	814	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The 10-year Treasury yield has increased more than 60 basis points, the dollar has appreciated, and the stock market has reached new highs.	13.0	90.0
201612	815	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I must admit, however, that despite all the excitement in financial markets since the presidential election, my economic forecast has responded with more restraint, in part reflecting my skepticism that fiscal and regulatory policies are likely to be as transformative as some of the markets seem to be anticipating.	13.0	90.0
201612	816	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, I expect the economy to significantly overshoot full employment.	13.0	90.0
201612	817	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In my forecast, the unemployment rate declines to 4.2 percent by 2019, well below my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 4.7 percent.	13.0	90.0
201612	818	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	This occurs despite my assumption of an increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting and about four more per year over the forecast horizon.	13.0	90.0
201612	819	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If I took literally the fiscal policy as announced by the incoming Administration, it would call for much more monetary policy tightening.	13.0	90.0
201612	820	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, reflecting my skepticism about the speed of adopting new fiscal policies and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of fiscal policies that will actually be passed by the Congress, I continue to assume a relatively gradual increase in the federal funds rate.	13.0	90.0
201612	821	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should my skepticism prove wrong, we will need to tighten more quickly.	13.0	90.0
201612	822	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because of the overshooting of full employment in my forecast, I was quite interested in the staff memos discussing earlier periods of overshooting.	13.0	90.0
201612	823	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own conclusion after reading the memos is that significantly overshooting full employment in the United States almost always results in adverse outcomes.	13.0	90.0
201612	824	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because there is uncertainty about the exact value of the natural rate, there is merit in probing how low the natural rate might be.	13.0	90.0
201612	825	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the same time, it is important to weigh the potential costs of an unemployment rate that falls well below all of our estimates of what is sustainable in the long run.	13.0	90.0
201612	826	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The countervailing costs and benefits are the reason it can be useful to probe the lower natural rate of unemployment, but remaining more than ½ percentage point below our best guess of the natural rate for a prolonged period of time would be more like a plunge than a careful probe.	13.0	90.0
201612	827	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast envisions a very gradual decline in the unemployment rate, reaching 4½ percent by the end of 2017.	13.0	90.0
201612	828	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, with the unemployment rate for November already at 4.6 percent, there is considerable risk that we will overshoot full employment by even more than I forecast by the end of next year.	13.0	90.0
201612	829	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it becomes clearer during the course of the year that this is occurring, I would expect monetary policy to need to tighten more quickly.	13.0	90.0
201612	830	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is worth noting that there is increasing evidence of tight labor markets.	13.0	90.0
201612	831	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The share of the unemployed who have been unemployed for less than 27 weeks is now near historical lows.	13.0	90.0
201612	832	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In contrast, the share of unemployed workers who have been unemployed longer than 27 weeks remains fairly elevated.	13.0	90.0
201612	833	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The general scarcity of workers should encourage employers to hire those who have experienced long-duration unemployment.	13.0	90.0
201612	834	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In support of that notion, we have seen some increase in the probability of reemployment for long-duration workers, although such hires likely come with additional training costs.	13.0	90.0
201612	835	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In view of the general tightening of labor markets, employers are likely to bid more aggressively for those workers with the appropriate skill set.	13.0	90.0
201612	836	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Indeed, there is already evidence— for example, the wage increases apparent in the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker—that labor costs are starting to rise.	13.0	90.0
201612	837	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Anecdotally, employers in our region increasingly complain about a shortage of workers.	13.0	90.0
201612	838	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is certainly consistent with the low unemployment rates in many parts of New England, with the unemployment rate in Massachusetts now at 3.3 percent and in New Hampshire now at 2.8 percent.	13.0	90.0
201612	839	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	These employers increasingly mention a shortage of workers limiting growth opportunities for their firms.	13.0	90.0
201612	840	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Consistent with the perception of tightening labor markets and the data in the Wage Growth Tracker, these firms are increasingly talking about offering higher wages and increasing their budgets for workforce development.	13.0	90.0
201612	841	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	In sum, my forecast involves an assumption of the same withdrawal of stimulus as the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201612	842	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent increase in longer-term rates and the dollar appreciation are already doing some of our work for us.	13.0	90.0
201612	843	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even so, there is a significant risk that fiscal policy will be even more expansionary than I have assumed.	13.0	90.0
201612	844	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a consequence, I see the risks associated with my GDP forecast as weighted to the upside and the unemployment rate weighted to the downside.	13.0	90.0
201612	845	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning fiscal policy, even with an unaltered post-election fiscal policy assumption, my forecast has the unemployment rate falling well below its full-employment rate and inflation somewhat overshooting our inflation target by the end of the forecast, albeit with a very different outlook for longer-term rates and the dollar.	13.0	90.0
201612	846	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201612	847	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	848	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201612	849	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201612	850	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy is on a solid trajectory, the labor market is strong, and the recent employment report suggests that we have achieved or even overshot our full-employment mandate.	13.0	102.0
201612	851	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we continue to make progress toward our inflation objective.	13.0	102.0
201612	852	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, a key development during the intermeeting period was the election and the prospect of increased fiscal stimulus in coming years.	13.0	102.0
201612	853	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Financial markets and many of my contacts expect big changes in taxes, spending, and regulation, but they also stress the enormous uncertainty about the size, scope, and timing of what will eventually be passed.	13.0	102.0
201612	854	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, this can be seen in measures of policy uncertainty, like the Baker, Bloom, and Davis index, which rose notably after the election.	13.0	102.0
201612	855	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	My contacts are divided between those excited by the prospect of lower taxes and less regulation and those concerned about the possibility of large cutbacks in spending on health care and social services, higher tariffs, and labor shortages due to restrictions on immigration.	13.0	102.0
201612	856	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On balance, our conversations with business contacts in my District portray a cautious optimism.	13.0	102.0
201612	857	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In their view, the key uncertainty today is how much new policies will help businesses over the near term.	13.0	102.0
201612	858	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Will it be a modest bump or a large boost?	13.0	102.0
201612	859	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	One summarized this as “positive uncertainty.”	13.0	102.0
201612	860	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But not all of my contacts were so giddy.	13.0	102.0
201612	861	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are identifiable losers in discussions about policy changes.	13.0	102.0
201612	862	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, we have a contact from the health-care sector who complained that having finally paid the substantial costs of implementing and adjusting to the Affordable Care Act, he now has to pay the substantial cost of adjusting away from it.	13.0	102.0
201612	863	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the head of a large medical system reported that they have already reduced capital spending and hiring.	13.0	102.0
201612	864	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	As he put it, “While we’re not yet in a formal hiring freeze, it would be accurate to describe our current stance as a hiring chill.”	13.0	102.0
201612	865	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Representatives of charitable institutions worry that demand for their services will increase even as tax cuts reduce incentives for charitable giving.	13.0	102.0
201612	866	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point, I still view the risks to my projection as balanced but not unusually large relative to the past 20 years.	13.0	102.0
201612	867	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In part, my views reflect the fact that I penciled in fiscal stimulus of similar magnitude to the Tealbook, although a bit more backloaded, reflecting the fact that I anticipate a mix of tax cuts and other changes that may take longer to agree on and then to implement.	13.0	102.0
201612	868	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	If anything, the possibility of an even bigger fiscal stimulus tilts the risk to the outlook for output growth and inflation modestly to the upside.	13.0	102.0
201612	869	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of uncertainty, despite the spike in policy uncertainty that I mentioned, readings from financial markets, such as the VIX, hardly point to elevated uncertainty overall.	13.0	102.0
201612	870	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have not changed my assumptions about the longer-run levels of output growth, the natural rate of unemployment, or r*.	13.0	102.0
201612	871	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast to the Tealbook, I view it as premature to speculate about the potential effects of changes in federal policies on the longer-run level of r* at this time.	13.0	102.0
201612	872	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On this issue, I think it’s not enough just to talk about the change in the deficit—the details matter.	13.0	102.0
201612	873	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Until we have greater clarity on what policies actually get enacted into law, I’ll maintain my current r* assumption of ¾ percent.	13.0	102.0
201612	874	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would add that the level of r* is affected by more than just US policies and US economic developments, and that global forces will continue to put downward pressure on r*.	13.0	102.0
201612	875	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, weighted-average estimates of r* for the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the euro area stand at slightly above zero today.	13.0	102.0
201612	876	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one place in which we do have clarity is the labor market.	13.0	102.0
201612	877	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re already overshooting our goal, and I project even greater overshooting of full employment and some modest overshooting of our inflation target.	13.0	102.0
201612	878	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	To limit the degree of overshooting of our goals and the buildup of risks to the economy, I have penciled in four funds rate increases next year and even more in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201612	879	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like the Tealbook, my forecast also contains some overshooting of the federal funds rate relative to its longer-run equilibrium level in 2018 and 2019.	13.0	102.0
201612	880	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am SEP respondent number 14.	13.0	102.0
201612	881	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me conclude with some additional comments about labor markets.	13.0	102.0
201612	882	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Despite an unemployment rate that is at the lowest level since 2007, there remains concern that we have yet to wring out every pocket of labor market slack.	13.0	102.0
201612	883	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s been extensive effort throughout the Federal Reserve System over the past several years to measure the state of the labor market and assess the degree of slack.	13.0	102.0
201612	884	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent joint work from my staff and colleagues at the Richmond Federal Reserve add to this body of work.	13.0	102.0
201612	885	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Instead of debating whether to include one group or another as part of the labor force, they let the data do the talking.	13.0	102.0
201612	886	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	They developed an alternative metric of labor market slack that scales all members of the population by the historical relative propensity to find employment.	13.0	102.0
201612	887	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	An interesting insight of this work—and President Lacker has talked about this previously—is that if you look at the job-finding rates of the marginally attached to the labor force—people out of the labor force but who would like to work—their job- finding rates are basically the same as the long-term unemployed.	13.0	102.0
201612	888	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve had a lot of debates about what’s the right definition of the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201612	889	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think the right answer to this is there is no right definition of the labor force, because a lot of these groups actually move back and forth between these categories.	13.0	102.0
201612	890	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, what they do is take everybody who’s in the population, and then they don’t make an ex-ante decision about categories—they take everyone in the population and weight them by their chance of landing a job in a given month.	13.0	102.0
201612	891	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	The resulting measure of worker availability provides a theoretically consistent read on the amount of slack in the labor market.	13.0	102.0
201612	892	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, looking at data through October, the nonemployment index that they come up with stands at levels similar to what we saw back in 2005, which I think is a nice benchmark for when the economy was thought to be at full employment.	13.0	102.0
201612	893	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this research provides additional evidence that the unemployment rate today is currently providing a reliable signal of labor market slack and that we’ve reached a full-employment economy.	13.0	102.0
201612	894	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201612	895	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	896	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201612	897	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201612	898	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	According to the markets, this is likely to be the second meeting in eight years at which the FOMC changes the federal funds rate.	13.0	108.0
201612	899	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The market’s logic is clear:  The conditions we have set for raising the federal funds rate have been met; we have, in essence, confirmed that we believe they have been met; and we will therefore go ahead.	13.0	108.0
201612	900	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, market reactions since the election victory of Mr Trump have been remarkably positive and consistent with our moving at this meeting.	13.0	108.0
201612	901	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	This meeting and this interest rate decision may also mark the end of the post–Great Financial Crisis period in which US monetary policy was most heavily influenced by the memories of the 2008–09 financial crisis, among them the fear of having again to operate in a ELB environment.	13.0	108.0
201612	902	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Will the critics and the historians write that we were justified in moving at this time of enormous uncertainty about what awaits us in the coming year?	13.0	108.0
201612	903	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And will they say that this was the real beginning of the normalization of monetary policy after the second largest financial crisis in the history of the Federal Reserve?	13.0	108.0
201612	904	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, there’s a great deal of uncertainty about that, because there’s a great deal of uncertainty about US economic policy in the months and years ahead and, of course, about the shocks that will impinge on the world economy, which includes the economy of the United States.	13.0	108.0
201612	905	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I want to mention briefly the study that was presented by Stephanie of the implications of the unemployment rate undershooting the natural rate or, equivalently, the benefits and costs of running a high-pressure economy.	13.0	108.0
201612	906	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	It was encouraging to read that soft landings can and do happen.	13.0	108.0
201612	907	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	However, the memo notes that in real time, we really don’t know just how tight the economy is.	13.0	108.0
201612	908	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we, of course, don’t know what shocks are awaiting us around the next corner.	13.0	108.0
201612	909	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And if you think that’s not right, just think back a month and a half.	13.0	108.0
201612	910	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Another lesson provided by the memo is that we must stay vigilant on inflation.	13.0	108.0
201612	911	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	History shows that the inflation process, which appears pretty benign at present, can change quickly.	13.0	108.0
201612	912	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, monetary policymakers will remain focused on keeping inflation near its target.	13.0	108.0
201612	913	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Turning now to the recent behavior of the financial markets, market participants’ optimism derives in part from the fundamentally sound state of the US economy after a recovery that has so far lasted 19 months, and for which a significant part of the credit is owed to the Federal Reserve—not only for the unconventional monetary policies it has undertaken in the period since 2008, not only for the steadiness with which it has pursued the goals set out in the dual mandate, but also for its vigorous implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act.	13.0	108.0
201612	914	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But market participants are also, in part, optimistic about equity prices and pessimistic about bond prices, because they believe US nonmonetary economic policies from 2017 on will be more expansionary, and more inflationary, than they had believed a little more than a month ago.	13.0	108.0
201612	915	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, we need to remind ourselves that, at this stage, although we have a general idea of the direction of future US economic policies, there is a great deal of uncertainty about what will be done and when; about the size and direction of fiscal policy changes; about regulatory changes across a broad range of areas, including with regard to financial regulations and labor market policies; about trade policies and the taxation of the foreign earnings of US companies; about NAFTA and other trade agreements; and about events in foreign economies, in China, in the EU, in the process of Brexit, in emerging market and developing economies, in the oil markets, and no doubt in other areas, some of which we can name today, some of which will come as surprises.	13.0	108.0
201612	916	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We will need to note that future economic growth will depend critically on future rates of productivity growth, about which there’s considerable uncertainty and about which questions similar to those about the effect of a high-pressure economy on unemployment are relevant.	13.0	108.0
201612	917	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There will likely also be challenges to the current operating procedures of the Federal Reserve and to its independence.	13.0	108.0
201612	918	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We will be operating, too, in an environment in which many of the assumptions about the role of the United States in global affairs more generally that have held for more than 70 years may need to be adjusted.	13.0	108.0
201612	919	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There must be more uncertainty about economic developments over the next four to five years in the United States and world economies today than there has been since the beginning of the Great Recession, and that means there is a great deal of uncertainty.	13.0	108.0
201612	920	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So what can we say to market participants about future monetary policies?	13.0	108.0
201612	921	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And what can we say about future monetary policies to the general public?	13.0	108.0
201612	922	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And what do we say to ourselves?	13.0	108.0
201612	923	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Now, we’ve been talking about the details of what’s going to happen as if we are still in the normal period.	13.0	108.0
201612	924	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we’re at the beginning of a very different period, and that we’re going to have to think about it.	13.0	108.0
201612	925	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think that what we’ve done today, which is essentially to make a fairly simple assumption about what will change—namely, fiscal policy—and not discuss or not include other changes, is about the only way we could proceed, because there is so much uncertainty about the state of the economy over the next few years.	13.0	108.0
201612	926	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	What we’ll have to do is to emphasize to everyone that our actions will continue to be guided by the dual mandate along with a concern for financial stability.	13.0	108.0
201612	927	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In practice, that most likely means we will not change the interest rate at our end-of-January meeting, for there will be very little reduction in uncertainty by then.	13.0	108.0
201612	928	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There could be a change in the interest rate in mid- March, but even then we will remain extremely uncertain about future economic developments.	13.0	108.0
201612	929	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But whatever happens, it is critical that we behave—and be seen to behave—with the goal of achieving our dual mandate and with a calmness that we have shown in the past.	13.0	108.0
201612	930	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The bottom line is very simple:  We must do our job.	13.0	108.0
201612	931	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Looking back, we have the comfort of knowing that we can rely on one another, on the Chair, and on the excellent staff of the Federal Reserve to do that as best we can.	13.0	108.0
201612	932	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we also know that our best has been remarkably good.	13.0	108.0
201612	933	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201612	934	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	935	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201612	936	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201612	937	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Over the past couple of months, labor markets and the path of inflation have continued to progress pretty much as anticipated in many forecasts, including that of the Tealbook, and I found that fact in and of itself to be significant.	13.0	97.0
201612	938	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, the stabilization of prices in 2016 that was anticipated at the end of last year by many around this table has been realized.	13.0	97.0
201612	939	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As expected, the effects of the big energy price decreases are tailing off, and unlike a number of occasions over the past several years when one factor holding down inflation faded only to be replaced by another, it does not appear that any new disinflationary impulse is currently in play.	13.0	97.0
201612	940	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I’m a little less sure as to whether the effects of a strengthened dollar will also recede, as there seems to me some risk of further strengthening.	13.0	97.0
201612	941	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, even if that happens, I doubt it would be of the magnitude of the earlier episodes.	13.0	97.0
201612	942	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, actually, I now see the risks to inflation as slightly to the upside—with the possibility that the production cuts announced by international oil producers will hold, and with some chance that fiscal policy in the next year or two will become significantly more stimulative.	13.0	97.0
201612	943	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to labor markets, I have found that our focus on slack over the past couple of years—slack that was not reflected in the unemployment rate as such—has served us well and has served the country and the economy well.	13.0	97.0
201612	944	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, as I said at the previous FOMC meeting, I thought we might be getting within sight of the point at which labor market slack had been largely taken up.	13.0	97.0
201612	945	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Data in the intervening two months have reinforced that view.	13.0	97.0
201612	946	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As one of our staff economists nicely put it, “Nearly all labor market indicators are either strengthening or are already strong.”	13.0	97.0
201612	947	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Some of the strong numbers obviously include job creation, which, although at a slightly lower level, continues to be substantially above the number needed to create a net increase in employment relative to the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201612	948	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Job openings continue to be high, and layoffs continue to be low.	13.0	97.0
201612	949	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Some numbers, which are already good, are strengthening even further, such as first-time claims.	13.0	97.0
201612	950	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Now, although wages stalled in the November report, this seems to me the classic case of not wanting to read too much into one data point, particularly against the backdrop of several previous months’ indications of some improvement in wages generally.	13.0	97.0
201612	951	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to indicators of slack, the unemployment rate has finally declined, and obviously it declined by a substantial amount.	13.0	97.0
201612	952	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think the magnitude of this decrease is going to hold fully, as the staff projection has suggested, but some of it is very likely persistent, breaking the year-long streak of significant labor market improvement unaccompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	97.0
201612	953	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Other indicators of slack, such as part-time for economic reasons and the share of the long-term unemployed, have continued their gradual improvement.	13.0	97.0
201612	954	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	The decrease in the labor force participation rate in the November report is consistent with, though certainly doesn’t firmly establish, the possibility I mentioned at the previous meeting that the labor force participation rate has returned to our best estimate of its trend and, at least on the basis of past experience, may thus not be expected to increase above that level in anything but a transitory fashion.	13.0	97.0
201612	955	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, we’ve adjusted our estimates of trend over the past several years and may again, so I don’t want to place too much weight on this factor, but it is something concrete suggesting that slack reduction may be nearly complete.	13.0	97.0
201612	956	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to wages, I’ll just note in passing again that I continue to regard the labor market as a surrogate for output constraints rather than relying on a direct Phillips-curve unemployment–inflation relationship, but I still do find wages to be relevant.	13.0	97.0
201612	957	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Here, I do want to note my uneasiness with explanations of wage increases tied too predominantly, in the short to medium term, to productivity limitations.	13.0	97.0
201612	958	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think that this approach tends to underplay the fact that labor prices, like other prices, are set at the intersection of a demand curve and a supply curve, and although the demand-curve shape is determined in significant part, though not exclusively, by productivity considerations, the supply curve is not.	13.0	97.0
201612	959	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And I think too much focus on productivity also tends to make the causation one way, whereas my sense is that productivity improvements sometimes come precisely because of upward pressure on wages that motivate firms to invest in productivity-enhancing technologies or production techniques.	13.0	97.0
201612	960	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	So as you can tell, in general, my observation for this FOMC meeting is “the shoe that didn’t drop,” which is to say that things have kind of continued as expected.	13.0	97.0
201612	961	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And at least with respect to labor markets, as I suggested last time, I think we’re now well within the point at which the elimination of slack is in view.	13.0	97.0
201612	962	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	The second point I was going to make at some length was the uncertainty attending the outlook, but I’m going to truncate my comments substantially because Governor Fischer made most of those points.	13.0	97.0
201612	963	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	If I can do this for purposes of the minutes, I would just second everything Governor Fischer said about the fiscal situation, the fact that there are other policies being discussed, and how there are upside and downside risks.	13.0	97.0
201612	964	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	It was for that reason, incidentally, that I regard fiscal policy as an upside risk of somewhat indeterminate magnitude, but I did not incorporate any assumed changes into my baseline outlook.	13.0	97.0
201612	965	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And my view is that for purposes of our policymaking, we will have plenty of time over subsequent meetings to incorporate likely effects of a range of policies as they become more concrete.	13.0	97.0
201612	966	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, Madam Chair, to add my two cents’ worth to people’s comments on the Aaronson etal memo, I have to say my interpretation of Stephanie Aaronson’s briefing and the related staff memo was that the strongest conclusion was that the most important factor is luck.	13.0	97.0
201612	967	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	That is to say, if you are in a circumstance in which you are trying to either execute a soft landing or deal with inflation, the strong conclusion was that there’s likely to be some sort of shock that you haven’t anticipated.	13.0	97.0
201612	968	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And then the question is:  Is it a shock taking you in the direction you would want it to take you or is it reinforcing the direction that you’re trying to reverse?	13.0	97.0
201612	969	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know that that actually provides an enormous amount of policy guidance.	13.0	97.0
201612	970	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201612	971	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	972	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201612	973	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201612	974	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The biggest piece of news in the intermeeting period was the reduction of uncertainty regarding the US elections.	13.0	107.0
201612	975	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	With the same party slated to control both houses of the Congress and the presidency, fiscal policy may become considerably more active.	13.0	107.0
201612	976	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At this early stage, however, considerable uncertainty remains about the size, composition, and timing of the policies the new President and the Congress will pursue.	13.0	107.0
201612	977	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although financial conditions have changed since the election in anticipation of these possible policy changes, the intermeeting data on real activity has been little affected by the election.	13.0	107.0
201612	978	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, I’ll first review what the data are telling us about the economy’s current course before turning to the possible implications of fiscal policy changes over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201612	979	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve been heartened to see progress toward both of our goals continuing at a sustainable pace.	13.0	107.0
201612	980	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent reports validate the prudent approach we’ve taken over the course of 2016.	13.0	107.0
201612	981	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Against the backdrop of notable risks associated with developments abroad and with the persistent underperformance of inflation, we were well served by not taking this progress for granted ex ante.	13.0	107.0
201612	982	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, the labor market has continued to improve.	13.0	107.0
201612	983	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past two months, payroll employment gains have averaged 160,000, sufficient for a continued increase in resource utilization.	13.0	107.0
201612	984	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point last month, and it is now 4.6 percent.	13.0	107.0
201612	985	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although this has led some to conclude that the labor market is now beyond full employment such that future increases in resource utilization will be unsustainable, there are a couple of reasons to think it could be somewhat premature to draw this conclusion.	13.0	107.0
201612	986	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	First, last month’s large decline seems out of step with other gauges of labor market activity, such as payroll gains, job openings, and layoffs, which have remained fairly flat.	13.0	107.0
201612	987	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The unemployment rate had also been quite stable over the past year or so, remaining within a range of 4.9 to 5.1 percent between August 2015 and October 2016.	13.0	107.0
201612	988	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	There was only one drop during that time period, and it turned out to be a short-lived aberration.	13.0	107.0
201612	989	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	We cannot rule out the possibility that November’s drop will be viewed as somewhat outsized in retrospect, so we should wait a few months before drawing firm conclusions.	13.0	107.0
201612	990	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, there are signs of remaining slack in the labor market even though the margins are diminishing.	13.0	107.0
201612	991	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most notably, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains 1.4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels, and the number of prime-age Americans who are out of the labor force but want a job today is still elevated—notably elevated—relative to pre- crisis.	13.0	107.0
201612	992	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Related to this, nominal wage growth remains muted.	13.0	107.0
201612	993	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The ECI increased only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, little different from the pace earlier in the recovery, and average hourly earnings increased 2.5 percent over the 12 months ending in November.	13.0	107.0
201612	994	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The still low level of price inflation is consistent with this interpretation.	13.0	107.0
201612	995	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Core PCE inflation has exhibited some welcome improvement in recent months.	13.0	107.0
201612	996	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At 1.7 percent in October, the 12-month change in core prices was 0.4 percentage point above the level a year ago.	13.0	107.0
201612	997	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, inflation has been persistently below our target for eight years, and it remains below our target today.	13.0	107.0
201612	998	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Against this backdrop, I welcome the recent upward movements in measures of inflation compensation.	13.0	107.0
201612	999	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most notably, the 5-year, 5-year-ahead TIPS measure of inflation compensation has increased 40 basis points since October, and median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the Michigan survey moved up in November from a historically low level.	13.0	107.0
201612	1000	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But, even with these recent improvements, these gauges of inflation expectations are still noticeably below historical norms, suggesting that we must continue to be attentive to downside risks if we’re to achieve our target, which is symmetric around 2 percent.	13.0	107.0
201612	1001	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The news on aggregate activity has likewise been encouraging.	13.0	107.0
201612	1002	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent indicators suggest GDP will increase at an annual rate of 2½ percent over the second half, a step-up from the 1.1 percent pace in the first half.	13.0	107.0
201612	1003	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Retail sales rebounded in October, auto sales remained strong in November, and real income gains look to be solid this year despite a leveling-off in energy prices—all good signs for consumers.	13.0	107.0
201612	1004	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, recent data on housing starts and permits suggest an upturn in residential investment this quarter, following two quarters of declines.	13.0	107.0
201612	1005	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, although business investment was flat last quarter after falling in the first half of this year, there are some positive signs.	13.0	107.0
201612	1006	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	These include small upturns in new orders for capital goods and corporate profitability, as well as in drilling rigs, which likely reflect both demand- and supply-side developments in oil markets.	13.0	107.0
201612	1007	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But there are also challenges, most notably the recent rise in the dollar and the foreign outlook.	13.0	107.0
201612	1008	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	After changing little over the middle part of the year, the dollar has increased more than 3 percent since October.	13.0	107.0
201612	1009	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff expects the dollar to appreciate further, by a little more than 1 percent per year over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1010	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But there’s a risk of a larger appreciation if fiscal deficits expand more materially.	13.0	107.0
201612	1011	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	And, although foreign GDP growth looks likely to move up to an annualized pace of 2½ percent over the second half—a welcome improvement—the pace of foreign growth is still considerably lower than earlier in the recovery.	13.0	107.0
201612	1012	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	There are also important fragilities in the international environment.	13.0	107.0
201612	1013	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	A strengthening dollar and rising rates could pose risks to emerging markets that have experienced substantial dollar-denominated borrowing in recent years.	13.0	107.0
201612	1014	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For some, this may be somewhat offset by the prospect of stronger commodity prices, but for others, this may exacerbate strains.	13.0	107.0
201612	1015	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Mexico, in particular, bears watching because of the outsized currency moves it has experienced related to the election and the extensive ties to US financial markets and trade that could be perturbed in the months ahead.	13.0	107.0
201612	1016	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	China continues to pose risks, although as was noted earlier, market participants seem quite complacent compared with the first quarter of this year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1017	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Due to stimulus, GDP growth is likely to meet the government’s stated objective this year, but attainment of this goal comes at the expense of a further increase in already very elevated leverage.	13.0	107.0
201612	1018	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In most economies, the current trajectory of indebtedness would not be sustainable.	13.0	107.0
201612	1019	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It remains to be seen whether China is, indeed, unique in this regard.	13.0	107.0
201612	1020	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, demand for foreign assets by Chinese households and businesses appears to be increasing, despite the Chinese government’s efforts to rein in that demand.	13.0	107.0
201612	1021	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Capital account outflows have picked up after a midyear lull, putting downward pressures on the renminbi, which has fallen about 6 percent against the dollar so far this year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1022	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The Chinese authorities are estimated to have spent nearly $40 billion in foreign exchange reserves last month alone.	13.0	107.0
201612	1023	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems likely that this combination of limited domestic investment opportunities, recent government-induced increases in domestic credit and liquidity, and fears of further depreciation and tightening of exchange controls is driving increased demand for foreign assets, and these pressures could intensify early next year.	13.0	107.0
201612	1024	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The Chinese authorities can continue to tighten controls, but this, in turn, has costs in terms of their desire for more private-sector-led economic growth in order to accomplish gradual deleveraging.	13.0	107.0
201612	1025	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	In Europe, the “no” vote in the December 4 Italian referendum was widely expected, and the reaction was muted.	13.0	107.0
201612	1026	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The ECB retains substantial capacity, as it reaffirmed last week.	13.0	107.0
201612	1027	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But the need to recapitalize Italian banks remains, and a credible plan has not yet been agreed upon.	13.0	107.0
201612	1028	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonperforming loans are quite high, and economic stagnation would continue to add to the level of problem loans on balance sheets.	13.0	107.0
201612	1029	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Broader stagnation also poses risks to Italian sovereign debt, which is currently about 130 percent of GDP.	13.0	107.0
201612	1030	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Some large European banks outside of Italy have also been challenged by low profitability and relatively low capital ratios and remain vulnerable to a slowing of economic growth.	13.0	107.0
201612	1031	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Returning to the United States, we’re now in the eighth year of the expansion, and as we scan the horizon for any increases in risk taking, I found it interesting that, in recent interviews with market participants, all of them highlighted a low level of leverage among investors despite the environment of very low short-term interest rates.	13.0	107.0
201612	1032	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	This suggests that regulatory changes and a renewed sensitivity to risks since the financial crisis have constrained, at least up to this point, undue leverage in the financial sector and have reduced, at least for now, an important source of risk, but this bears close watching.	13.0	107.0
201612	1033	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, the advent of a unified government suggests an increase in upside risks to aggregate demand in the United States.	13.0	107.0
201612	1034	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Financial market participants and the Board’s staff expect deficits to increase into the future.	13.0	107.0
201612	1035	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s too early to evaluate the size of the effect on the economy, in view of substantial uncertainty about the magnitude, the composition, and the effects on aggregate demand and supply, as well as on term premiums.	13.0	107.0
201612	1036	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking at earlier episodes when significant electoral shifts led to greater unity across the legislative and executive branches, we saw very large increases in deficits, on the order of 1½ to 2 percentage points of GDP, that persisted beyond the first term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1037	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Notably, episodes in the early 1980s and 2000s occurred when the economy was further from full employment and there was greater headroom in the national debt.	13.0	107.0
201612	1038	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	A large and persistent expansion of fiscal deficits targeted at high-multiplier segments, such as infrastructure investment or low-income households, could have material effects on GDP growth, as well as on the short- and long-run neutral federal funds rate.	13.0	107.0
201612	1039	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But for a fiscal expansion to be large and sustainable, it would need to have significant positive effects on aggregate supply.	13.0	107.0
201612	1040	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For this to be true, there are a number of very important “ifs” that I won’t review here today.	13.0	107.0
201612	1041	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, an increase in fiscal deficits that does not raise potential economic growth or extend very far into the long term could raise the neutral rate over the medium term, but not as much in the long term.	13.0	107.0
201612	1042	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	If such an expansion is large enough, the resulting tightening in resource constraints and upward pressure on inflation may lead the short-run neutral rate to rise above the longer-term neutral rate by the end of the medium term, with important implications for monetary policy.	13.0	107.0
201612	1043	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, we could see additional strengthening of the exchange rate in anticipation of such changes, as we’ve seen in previous episodes.	13.0	107.0
201612	1044	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	For the moment, it seems prudent to put some probability on a moderate increase in fiscal deficits starting in the second half of the year, and this leads to a relatively modest change to my forecast.	13.0	107.0
201612	1045	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	But the possibility of a more significant expansion has altered the risks to aggregate demand and made them more balanced.	13.0	107.0
201612	1046	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201612	1047	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1048	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break now, grab some coffee, and come back in 20 minutes, at 10 minutes to 4:00.	13.0	65.0
201612	1050	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume.	13.0	65.0
201612	1051	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201612	1052	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201612	1053	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In my remarks today, I’m going to cover pre- and post-election sentiment of District contacts, anecdotal feedback received from contacts on the state of the economy, and my forecast.	13.0	88.0
201612	1054	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My District’s directors and contacts notably changed their tune on economic prospects from pre-election to post-election.	13.0	88.0
201612	1055	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The election’s results seem to have produced a pickup in optimism based on expectations of an unwinding of regulation, lower corporate and individual taxes, and fiscal stimulus.	13.0	88.0
201612	1056	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts confirmed ongoing tightening of labor markets.	13.0	88.0
201612	1057	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Both employers and staffing agencies reported they continue to struggle to fill positions.	13.0	88.0
201612	1058	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard that low-wage workers are increasingly difficult to recruit in certain urban and resort locations because of shortages of affordable housing.	13.0	88.0
201612	1059	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Staffing agency contacts indicated that many employers are willing to take longer to fill positions rather than significantly raise starting wages.	13.0	88.0
201612	1060	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In order to fill vacancies for low-skilled positions, some firms said they have eased job specs and verification requirements such as drug tests.	13.0	88.0
201612	1061	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard opinion to the effect that firms may still be holding the line on starting wages to preserve their salary structures but are, in effect, incurring the costs of labor shortages by way of reduced worker quality and increased training costs.	13.0	88.0
201612	1062	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	A further point on wage pressures: Anecdotal reports indicated that the overall rate of merit programs remained stable in the 2½ to 3 percent range.	13.0	88.0
201612	1063	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker that measures average wage growth of the same individuals accelerated to a pace just under 4 percent in the latest November reading.	13.0	88.0
201612	1064	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This is close to pre-recession readings.	13.0	88.0
201612	1065	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The labor market looks about as tight as it was before the recession.	13.0	88.0
201612	1066	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding my forecast and SEP submission, my real GDP growth forecast is little changed from the previous SEP and from the outlook that I put forward during most of this year.	13.0	88.0
201612	1067	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I had real GDP growing at close to 2 percent per annum over the forecast horizon and for the longer run.	13.0	88.0
201612	1068	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, my risk assessment associated with that outlook has shifted to the upside.	13.0	88.0
201612	1069	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The upside risk I perceive reflects accelerating business fixed investment and does incorporate upside risks resulting from changes in fiscal policy.	13.0	88.0
201612	1070	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Like Governor Tarullo and others, my baseline projection does not incorporate fiscal policy effects.	13.0	88.0
201612	1071	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My thinking is that it’s too early to tell the size, timing, and characteristics of any fiscal package.	13.0	88.0
201612	1072	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	And those details, obviously, matter a lot.	13.0	88.0
201612	1073	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding business fixed investment, my baseline forecast continues to anticipate solid BFI growth over the forecast horizon.	13.0	88.0
201612	1074	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Previously, I was worried about my BFI assumption being too optimistic and, therefore, treated this business fixed investment baseline assumption as carrying downside risk.	13.0	88.0
201612	1075	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	At the time of earlier forecasts, my assumption regarding BFI growth was not much supported by incoming data and was not getting much support in the form of anecdotal inputs received from business contacts.	13.0	88.0
201612	1076	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, in the most recent intermeeting cycle, we heard indications of accelerating capital spending intentions from a number of contacts.	13.0	88.0
201612	1077	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts cited market demand and revenue growth as the drivers of their revisions to cap-ex plans.	13.0	88.0
201612	1078	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In that vein, taking into consideration the likelihood that the economy is arguably near full employment, analysis performed by my staff points out that in earlier periods in which the unemployment rate reached or fell below its natural rate, there has been a sizable pickup in the pace of business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201612	1079	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This evidence buoys my confidence in the view that BFI growth will accelerate.	13.0	88.0
201612	1080	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My baseline forecast also sees headline and core PCE inflation reaching rates consistent with the Committee’s target in 2017 and holding near target thereafter.	13.0	88.0
201612	1081	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Consistent with treating the economic growth effect of fiscal stimulus as an upside risk, I see some upside risk for inflation.	13.0	88.0
201612	1082	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Even though I believe an agnostic view of the economic effect of expected fiscal stimulus is the right position at this time in a baseline forecast, it’s my view that the possibility of fiscal stimulus reduces the need to think about running a high-pressure economy, dependent solely on monetary policy.	13.0	88.0
201612	1083	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	My thought process is that we appear to be very close to meeting our policy objectives, there is not much remaining resource slack, and there is reason to be confident that we will be closing in on our inflation objective relatively soon.	13.0	88.0
201612	1084	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	With a prospect of substantial fiscal stimulus, I am inclined to be somewhat cautious in weighing the degree of monetary accommodation.	13.0	88.0
201612	1085	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I will add that an upside scenario resulting from new fiscal measures could present communications challenges for the Committee, even in the near term, in my opinion.	13.0	88.0
201612	1086	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	And I’ll expand on this thought in the next round.	13.0	88.0
201612	1087	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201612	1088	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1089	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201612	1090	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201612	1091	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Economic conditions in much of the 10th District remain a bit soft as employment growth lags the nation as a whole.	13.0	103.0
201612	1092	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The outlook for the agricultural sector continues to be negative despite the boost in demand from abroad for soybeans, which made an outsized contribution to third-quarter GDP.	13.0	103.0
201612	1093	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Some of the headwinds in other sectors of the regional economy, however, look to be dissipating.	13.0	103.0
201612	1094	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Our manufacturing- and service-sector surveys both show signs of improvement, and District energy firms appear to have adjusted to lower oil prices.	13.0	103.0
201612	1095	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	One report pointed to familiar telltale signs of boom times in the Denver real estate market.	13.0	103.0
201612	1096	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The online Denver Business Journal has resumed a feature called “Crane Watch,” watching the number of cranes across the sky.	13.0	103.0
201612	1097	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In general, our directors and other labor and business contacts noted more optimism as they anticipate and assess the effects of potential fiscal policy changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1098	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	A notable exception was health care and nonprofits, for which our contacts expressed heightened uncertainty and concern about such changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1099	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Unlike the Tealbook, I did not incorporate assumptions about potential fiscal policy changes into my SEP, on account of the considerable uncertainty about the nature and timing of any such changes.	13.0	103.0
201612	1100	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, my outlook for the national economy is little changed and I continue to assume GDP growth near 2 percent over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201612	1101	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, the prospects of tax cuts and more fiscal spending seem likely to pose upside risks to my GDP growth and inflation forecasts over the next few years.	13.0	103.0
201612	1102	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I expect further improvement in the labor market to support household spending and economic activity.	13.0	103.0
201612	1103	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The Kansas City Federal Reserve’s labor market conditions index shows that both the level of activity and the momentum in the labor market increased last month.	13.0	103.0
201612	1104	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Consumer confidence remains high and has continued to increase over the past few weeks.	13.0	103.0
201612	1105	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the personal saving rate remains high by historical standards, even as housing and equity market wealth post near-record highs.	13.0	103.0
201612	1106	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Like others, I appreciated the Board staff memos on overshooting full employment and the various approaches they examined for determining economic slack.	13.0	103.0
201612	1107	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	And I would offer just a couple of observations from their analysis.	13.0	103.0
201612	1108	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	First, in assessing labor market slack, I’d be interested if geography is an important aspect for this discussion.	13.0	103.0
201612	1109	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For example, as I looked at states in my own District, the unemployment rate in New Mexico has never really recovered since the crisis—it’s lower, but only modestly, and still well above pre-crisis levels.	13.0	103.0
201612	1110	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For this particular geography, I see the issues as structural and complex.	13.0	103.0
201612	1111	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	For a state like Oklahoma, the unemployment rate increased a full percentage point over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201612	1112	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The issue here reflects a sectoral shock—namely, to energy—which has resulted in some reallocation in labor and capital.	13.0	103.0
201612	1113	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I see this shock as largely cyclical and unlikely to generate longer-term structural issues.	13.0	103.0
201612	1114	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, Colorado’s unemployment rate remains near historically low levels and likely below its state-specific natural rate of unemployment.	13.0	103.0
201612	1115	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	These three examples highlight the difficulty of gauging overall slack, as each local labor market faces a different set of issues.	13.0	103.0
201612	1116	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	A second observation on these memos goes back to a question from our previous meeting about historical experience in undershooting the natural rate of employment.	13.0	103.0
201612	1117	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Here, I found the staff’s broad conclusions of the memos did not necessarily diminish my own concerns about this strategy.	13.0	103.0
201612	1118	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Namely, it poses risks, it has uncertain benefits, and, even as policy is calibrated to achieve a soft landing, it requires, as Governor Tarullo and the staff noted, a bit of luck.	13.0	103.0
201612	1119	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding inflation, I continue to view current rates of inflation as consistent with our mandate for price stability and with PCE inflation continuing to make progress toward the Committee’s 2 percent objective.	13.0	103.0
201612	1120	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201612	1121	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1122	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201612	1123	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201612	1124	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The economy has made further progress toward our objectives since the November meeting.	13.0	104.0
201612	1125	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Core inflation has ticked up; the headline unemployment rate has declined; and GDP growth has picked up since midyear, which should support continued further tightening in labor markets and progress toward 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1126	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The November jobs report confirms that the labor market continues to tighten, albeit at a slower pace than over the past few years.	13.0	104.0
201612	1127	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has now declined 0.4 percentage point compared with an average annual rate of 0.9 percentage points over the preceding four years, which reflects both a welcome outperformance of labor force participation relative to trend as well as a slower pace of job creation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1128	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	We are seeing rising real wages and improving job prospects.	13.0	104.0
201612	1129	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Surveys indicate that households are finally seeing jobs as plentiful, and firms are finding it harder to fill positions—results that have typically been seen at or above full employment.	13.0	104.0
201612	1130	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate at 4.6 percent is now a bit below most estimates of the natural rate and seems to be on a path to reach the low 4s.	13.0	104.0
201612	1131	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	There is some evidence now of emerging supply-side constraints, particularly in surveys of jobs hard to get and hard to fill.	13.0	104.0
201612	1132	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, wages and compensation more broadly have yet to show more than a gradual halting increase.	13.0	104.0
201612	1133	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The interesting and excellent staff memo on undershooting the natural rate finds limited evidence on the question of whether such an undershooting should be expected to have highly persistent or even permanent positive supply-side effects.	13.0	104.0
201612	1134	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The evidence is limited for one reason:  Because undershoots are rare.	13.0	104.0
201612	1135	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The record, however, is clear that prolonged high unemployment can have adverse supply-side effects as workers lose skills and attachment to the labor force.	13.0	104.0
201612	1136	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	From 2009 through 2013, labor force participation suffered a deep cyclical decline.	13.0	104.0
201612	1137	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The exact levels of the natural rate and the trend participation rate are always uncertain.	13.0	104.0
201612	1138	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That uncertainty is even higher than usual, in view of the unique characteristics of this cycle.	13.0	104.0
201612	1139	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	So, as long as inflation is below target, economic growth is barely above trend, and wage increases are moderate, we have time and space to allow the unemployment rate to decline a bit further without too much risk of getting “behind the curve.”	13.0	104.0
201612	1140	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I assume that this will be happening in a context of a rising policy rate and gradually tightening financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201612	1141	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	There will be time to react if we see upside surprises in economic growth or inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1142	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A modest undershoot will also help ensure that inflation does move up to our 2 percent target.	13.0	104.0
201612	1143	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The section of the undershooting memo addressing the Phillips curve was quite interesting in this regard.	13.0	104.0
201612	1144	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	It does not seem likely to me that the inflation dynamics of the 1970s—with high persistence and a steep Phillips curve—are likely to reemerge unless the Committee manages to convince the public that we are okay with inflation moving well above target and staying there.	13.0	104.0
201612	1145	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	But we have reached the point at which inflation risks are balanced, and I am open to the idea that a sustained period of time well below the natural rate could risk undesirably high inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1146	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That will be a risk to watch.	13.0	104.0
201612	1147	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The recent increase in market-based measures of inflation compensation is a welcome development.	13.0	104.0
201612	1148	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Expectations remain below our target of 2 percent after accounting for the wedge between CPI and PCE inflation.	13.0	104.0
201612	1149	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	In addition, these readings are still below where they were in early 2014 or during a pre-crisis period when inflation was close to our target.	13.0	104.0
201612	1150	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	All told, the move up in inflation compensation supports confidence that inflation expectations are well anchored.	13.0	104.0
201612	1151	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	As hoped, economic growth has picked up during the second half of the year.	13.0	104.0
201612	1152	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	With solid increases in PDFP, real GDP is poised to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	104.0
201612	1153	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Consumption accounts for the lion’s share of the domestic demand growth and will likely post moderate gains, thanks to solid increases in income.	13.0	104.0
201612	1154	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The pace of business investment remains a concern, as nonresidential investment has not increased, on net, in two years, and that weak performance is undoubtedly contributing to the poor productivity outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201612	1155	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Fiscal policy seems set to take a more accommodative turn, and I find the staff’s deployment of a hypothetical tax cut amounting to 1 percent of GDP to be a reasonable placeholder.	13.0	104.0
201612	1156	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A fiscal policy initiative of that nature would, at a minimum, provide a near-term insurance policy against downside risks, including weak economic growth, low inflation, and global risk events.	13.0	104.0
201612	1157	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I did assume such a tax cut in my baseline, but I didn’t take it into real outcomes.	13.0	104.0
201612	1158	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I just took it as an insurance policy or a reason for greater confidence in the baseline.	13.0	104.0
201612	1159	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	In sum, we are essentially at full employment.	13.0	104.0
201612	1160	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The economy is expanding moderately and there is poised to be a more expansionary fiscal stance, which is likely to put upward pressure on output growth, employment, and inflation while also reducing downside risks.	13.0	104.0
201612	1161	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	A somewhat tighter monetary policy is likely to be needed.	13.0	104.0
201612	1162	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201612	1163	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1164	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201612	1165	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201612	1166	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	The past six weeks have been remarkable.	13.0	91.0
201612	1167	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As one of my contacts said, many uncertainties have receded, but others have gone up.	13.0	91.0
201612	1168	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	It’s still early days regarding the plans of the new Administration and the Congress.	13.0	91.0
201612	1169	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	But it does seem pretty clear that more fiscal stimulus is headed our way as well as other major government policy changes.	13.0	91.0
201612	1170	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	At the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, we incorporated a modest fiscal boost into our economic projections, which I will describe in a bit.	13.0	91.0
201612	1171	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	With respect to non-election-related developments, the reports provided by my directors and other business contacts on the current economic landscape were a bit more positive than was the case in the previous round.	13.0	91.0
201612	1172	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Fundamentals for economic growth continue to be solid, with a strong labor market providing a key source of support.	13.0	91.0
201612	1173	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Manufacturers in the aerospace and defense sectors have seen further improvements, while heavy equipment producers and the steel industry still face challenges.	13.0	91.0
201612	1174	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Automotive sales continue to be robust.	13.0	91.0
201612	1175	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Sales, however, are being supported by strong incentives, and the industry currently anticipates that it will need to continue aggressive pricing to maintain this year’s sales pace in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1176	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I continue to hear businesses repeat their long-running refrain:  Many types of skilled workers remain in short supply at going market rates.	13.0	91.0
201612	1177	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This reminds me—a production of Hamilton is playing in Chicago, and I’ve noticed, first hand, that orchestra-level tickets are in short supply at list prices.	13.0	91.0
201612	1178	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	But I can get tickets on StubHub if I’m willing to pay more.	13.0	91.0
201612	1179	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	In any case, nominal wage growth remains relatively subdued, suggesting that labor markets are not all that tight yet.	13.0	91.0
201612	1180	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Looking ahead, a number of my directors and contacts were optimistic about some of the President-elect’s economic proposals.	13.0	91.0
201612	1181	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	For instance, steelmakers and heavy equipment manufacturers are looking forward to more infrastructure spending, and, unsurprisingly, our contacts in the financial sector are almost ringing bells and caroling as they recite their Christmas wish lists for reduced regulatory oversight.	13.0	91.0
201612	1182	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201612	1183	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	On the other hand, one of my directors runs a large health-care delivery system.	13.0	91.0
201612	1184	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	He’s struggling to figure out how major changes to the Affordable Care Act and other new regulatory policies might affect his hospital system and the provision of health care more broadly.	13.0	91.0
201612	1185	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, the optimism surrounding pro-business proposals and fiscal stimulus was tempered by some of my contacts’ concerns regarding the potential adverse effects of trade and immigration proposals.	13.0	91.0
201612	1186	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Regarding the national outlook, recent nonfinancial data have come in about as expected.	13.0	91.0
201612	1187	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	In our opinion, the recent increase in 10-year Treasury rates and the further strengthening of the dollar require some additional economic conditioning assumptions.	13.0	91.0
201612	1188	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, in our forecast, we assume a modest fiscal expansion that increases the primary deficit a little more than 1 percentage point of GDP.	13.0	91.0
201612	1189	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is a similar assumption to that in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201612	1190	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	To be clear, we also did not make any changes to our path of potential output.	13.0	91.0
201612	1191	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	By the way, we’re number eight in the SEP submissions.	13.0	91.0
201612	1192	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	The direct impulse of our fiscal assumption on consumption and government purchases would boost the level of GDP about ½ percentage point by the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1193	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	We, like the Tealbook, interpret much of the recent increase in term premiums and the dollar as arising from these expected policy changes.	13.0	91.0
201612	1194	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	These restraining influences limit the direct policy effect, so the net effect on GDP is only 0.3 percentage point by the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1195	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	All told, this is a relatively modest revision to our outlook, considering the substantial financial market reactions to date.	13.0	91.0
201612	1196	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Putting it all together, we continue to expect that real GDP growth will run moderately above its potential rate over the course of the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201612	1197	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As a result, we expect further tightening in labor markets, with the unemployment rate falling from our projected average of 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter of this year to 4.3 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201612	1198	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is about ¼ percentage point below the 4½ percent natural rate that we expect to prevail in 2020.	13.0	91.0
201612	1199	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Our expectation of increased fiscal stimulus makes me, like many around the room, a bit more optimistic on inflation than in our previous SEP submission.	13.0	91.0
201612	1200	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Financial market developments have included a welcome increase in TIPS inflation compensation—I believe Governor Powell used exactly the same phrasing, “welcome increase”—as well as more balanced inflation tail risks, as measured by swaps pricing.	13.0	91.0
201612	1201	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	We also have seen better incoming data on actual inflation.	13.0	91.0
201612	1202	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As a result, I raised my core PCE inflation forecast slightly, by 0.1 percentage point in each of the next three years.	13.0	91.0
201612	1203	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I now expect we will reach 2 percent by the end of 2019.	13.0	91.0
201612	1204	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	This is the first time in years that my forecast reaches our inflation target within the projection period.	13.0	91.0
201612	1205	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Despite these upward revisions, I still see downside risks to my inflation forecast, stemming primarily from a strong dollar, but, overall, the downside inflation risks are smaller than they were in September.	13.0	91.0
201612	1206	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	My projections are premised on my assumed path of monetary policy.	13.0	91.0
201612	1207	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	That’s the statement that makes comments about monetary policy appropriate, according to Hoyle.	13.0	91.0
201612	1208	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201612	1209	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	My path regarding appropriate policy has the funds rate increasing 25 basis points this year, twice more in 2017, and four times in 2018.	13.0	91.0
201612	1210	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Once we have more clarity from the incoming Administration and the new Congress on their policies, we might have a stronger economic outlook that could well warrant a steeper path of rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201612	1211	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I think we need to see how the economy performs with more financial restraint after the past six weeks and tomorrow’s decision.	13.0	91.0
201612	1212	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in our view, financial conditions and the dollar have already tightened ahead of the direct fiscal stimulus that will likely occur later in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1213	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Some people, I’ve already heard, think it’s going to be a little bit later in terms of the direct influence.	13.0	91.0
201612	1214	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	With the rise of inflation to our 2 percent objective still being just a forecast, albeit a more likely forecast now, I still see a role for caution in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201612	1215	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201612	1216	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1217	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201612	1218	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201612	1219	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	According to some interpretations of the Book of Revelations, when three unusual events occur together, they may be a sign that the apocalypse is near.	13.0	94.0
201612	1220	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s take stock:  The Chicago Cubs have won the World Series, Donald Trump has won the presidency, and Bob Dylan has won a Nobel Prize [laughter].	13.0	94.0
201612	1221	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	At the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, we have a regime-switching model of the apocalypse and currently estimate that we are in the no-apocalypse state.	13.0	94.0
201612	1222	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But we have increased the probability of a switch to the apocalypse state somewhat in response to these recent events.	13.0	94.0
201612	1223	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	In my discussions with Eighth District contacts, indications seem to be consistent with the no- apocalypse state.	13.0	94.0
201612	1224	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Economic growth seems to be plodding along much as it has been in recent years, consistent with our estimates of a 2 percent trend growth rate.	13.0	94.0
201612	1225	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Some sectors, notably agribusiness—and I agree with President George here—remain in a slump, while others, including those related to housing, seem to be maintaining momentum.	13.0	94.0
201612	1226	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Consumer confidence appears to have picked up noticeably, a factor that may have some influence on holiday retail sales activity.	13.0	94.0
201612	1227	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the our Reserve Bank’s news index nowcast, which tends to put more weight on softer data like consumer confidence, is currently suggesting a fourth-quarter annualized growth rate of close to 4 percent for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1228	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is something I’ll be watching closely in the weeks ahead.	13.0	94.0
201612	1229	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, even with the robust fourth quarter, should it occur, the real GDP growth rate for the United States for all of 2016 would still be close to 2 percent, and the St Louis Federal Reserve’s forecast for 2017—and, in fact, for the entire forecast horizon—remains at 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201612	1230	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The question I am getting a lot in recent conversations is:  Does the recent election usher in a regime change with respect to growth prospects for the US economy?	13.0	94.0
201612	1231	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The short answer to this is “maybe,” and we are treating this as an upside risk in our regime-based forecast for the time being.	13.0	94.0
201612	1232	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On this, I agree with President Lockhart and others.	13.0	94.0
201612	1233	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s possible that we will become convinced that true change has occurred for US macroeconomic prospects in the quarters and years ahead, but it’s too early to reach such a conclusion today.	13.0	94.0
201612	1234	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’s regime-based approach has two key components: The low-growth, low-real-rate regime we are currently in is characterized by a low rate of productivity growth and by a high liquidity premium on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201612	1235	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Both of these factors are working to keep safe real interest rates very low and, by extension, the appropriate policy rate very low.	13.0	94.0
201612	1236	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Is either one of these factors likely to switch to a high value during the forecast horizon?	13.0	94.0
201612	1237	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The answer is: “Maybe, but not yet.”	13.0	94.0
201612	1238	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	To organize my thinking, I can divide nonmonetary policy into five very broad areas of change that may occur.	13.0	94.0
201612	1239	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	One is deregulation, broadly defined.	13.0	94.0
201612	1240	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Two is tax changes, especially with respect to business taxes, including repatriation of cash stored overseas and changes in corporate tax rates.	13.0	94.0
201612	1241	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Three, infrastructure spending; four, trade; and, five, immigration.	13.0	94.0
201612	1242	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Of these five categories, in my opinion, the first three executed properly could conceivably affect medium-term productivity and have some effect on the medium-term growth rate of the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1243	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would not conceive of these initiatives as stimulus but, rather, as an attempt to increase the trend growth rate of the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201612	1244	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think an argument can be made for deregulation if you think that the regulatory pendulum has swung too far in recent years.	13.0	94.0
201612	1245	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	However, it’s a broad area.	13.0	94.0
201612	1246	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It would apply across many different types of activity that would affect business, and it’s difficult to gauge.	13.0	94.0
201612	1247	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that tax changes, to the extent that they could influence investment in the United States, might have some effect on medium-term productivity and might have an effect through that channel.	13.0	94.0
201612	1248	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Infrastructure spending tends to take a long time, but in principle you’d like to have the right amount of public capital in place.	13.0	94.0
201612	1249	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This could also improve medium-term productivity.	13.0	94.0
201612	1250	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So these are things that—at least in principle—could affect the longer-term growth rate in the United States.	13.0	94.0
201612	1251	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The final two areas, perhaps more important during the election, are, in my opinion, slow-moving issues:  trade and immigration.	13.0	94.0
201612	1252	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As an example on trade, I would cite the Canada– EU negotiation, which has dragged on for seven years and has still not been approved by the European Union.	13.0	94.0
201612	1253	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would take this as an indication that any attempts to change trade arrangements between countries takes a very, very long time.	13.0	94.0
201612	1254	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, you can impose tariffs and start a trade war.	13.0	94.0
201612	1255	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But you get retaliation from the other side, and it tends to be counterproductive.	13.0	94.0
201612	1256	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Immigration reform, if done correctly, is another area that could be very beneficial to the United States, but, again, even if you change the flow of immigrants into the United States in a way that would improve US productivity, that would take a long time to shape the US labor force and have a real effect.	13.0	94.0
201612	1257	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	For the purposes of monetary policy, I think it is the first three areas that are the most likely to inform discussions in the next several years here around this table.	13.0	94.0
201612	1258	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I think that the effects from any policy changes that may be upcoming are more likely to be seen in 2018 and 2019 and much less in 2017.	13.0	94.0
201612	1259	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Sitting here today at the end of 2016, I would say our near-term outlook has not changed very much.	13.0	94.0
201612	1260	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It is possible that there would be some near-term effects, but I think they’re less likely.	13.0	94.0
201612	1261	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	One thing that people might cite is the equity market rally, which was proceeding apace again this morning when I was watching TV.	13.0	94.0
201612	1262	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t know what happened today.	13.0	94.0
201612	1263	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would interpret the equity market rally as due primarily to the prospect of corporate tax changes, which by themselves would have a large effect on revaluating the US corporate sector and not so much on anticipated economic growth effects from the possible policy changes ahead, even though much of the commentary will talk in terms of higher growth ahead.	13.0	94.0
201612	1264	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s really the tax changes that have a very direct and immediate effect.	13.0	94.0
201612	1265	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that the St Louis Federal Reserve left the baseline outlook essentially unchanged over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201612	1266	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We are acknowledging upside risk as we have previously.	13.0	94.0
201612	1267	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	On the changes in yields since the election, I have a couple of comments.	13.0	94.0
201612	1268	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I agree with President Williams’s comments about global forces.	13.0	94.0
201612	1269	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	You are talking about yields in a global context.	13.0	94.0
201612	1270	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t know if the United States can really break out of the global context all by itself.	13.0	94.0
201612	1271	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Also, roughly half of the increase in the 10-year yield was inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201612	1272	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The other half was a real yield.	13.0	94.0
201612	1273	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Powell and President Evans that the increase in inflation expectations was a welcome development.	13.0	94.0
201612	1274	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	For the Federal Reserve Bank of St.	13.0	94.0
201612	1275	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Louis’s outlook, we haven’t really been acknowledging, at least in recent meetings, that inflation expectations, as measured by the TIPS market, were too low compared with our forecast.	13.0	94.0
201612	1276	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Now that they’ve rebounded back to something more reasonable.	13.0	94.0
201612	1277	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s good from our point of view.	13.0	94.0
201612	1278	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But it does not require an adjustment, because we were assuming that they were going to bounce back anyway.	13.0	94.0
201612	1279	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The increase in the real rate is something that we have taken on board, and we’ve hedged our bets a little bit.	13.0	94.0
201612	1280	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	We think we may need now to have one more increase in the policy rate in 2017 to maintain unemployment and inflation at longer-run levels.	13.0	94.0
201612	1281	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That is a slight change from where we were before, and that’s due to the run-up in real rates that we’ve observed in recent weeks.	13.0	94.0
201612	1282	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Even aside from that, there continues to be upside risk to this projection of the policy rate, should any of the switches to a higher-productivity regime or a lower-liquidity-premium regime occur.	13.0	94.0
201612	1283	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, I think it may be time for the Committee to think about another policy tool, which is to reduce the size of the balance sheet.	13.0	94.0
201612	1284	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This would be an alternative approach to sole reliance on the policy rate normalization path.	13.0	94.0
201612	1285	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And I’ll talk a little bit more about that tomorrow.	13.0	94.0
201612	1286	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201612	1287	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1288	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201612	1289	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201612	1290	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Before the recent OPEC agreement, we had been expecting that global oil production and consumption would get into rough balance by the first half of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1291	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of that analysis, we had expected record excess inventory levels would begin to decline by mid-2017, and we believed that the price of oil, while volatile, would continue to firm.	13.0	110.0
201612	1292	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, the recent OPEC agreement, which called for a cut in crude oil production of approximately 1.2 million barrels per day and would reduce output to approximately 32 million barrels per day during the first half of 2017, will have an effect on our forecast.	13.0	110.0
201612	1293	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	There are also hopes—which look like they’re materializing—for an additional 600,000 barrels a day by non-OPEC countries, half of that coming from Russia.	13.0	110.0
201612	1294	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	If this agreement is actually complied with—something that many doubt—it will accelerate this entire balancing process.	13.0	110.0
201612	1295	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Even before this, the rig count had begun gradually increasing during the past few months, and we believe that with a price of oil between $55 and $65 per barrel, the rig count could increase substantially.	13.0	110.0
201612	1296	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re now on the precipice of that, and you could see substantial cap-ex flowing into this sector.	13.0	110.0
201612	1297	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	If you look ahead, though, over the next three to five years, our view at the Dallas Federal Reserve is that if there’s a price risk in the oil market, it is likely to be to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201612	1298	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	This is primarily because of the lack of new investment and long-lived oil production projects over the past few years.	13.0	110.0
201612	1299	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In the medium term, new supply is going to have to come from increased production from shale, which has a very short decline curve.	13.0	110.0
201612	1300	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Our forecast also incorporates our expectation that global oil demand will continue to grow, on average, to 1.3 million barrels a day in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1301	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the District, due to the stabilization of the oil sector as well as continued diversification of the Texas economy, Texas job growth has improved from less than 1 percent in the first half of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201612	1302	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We now expect job growth in excess of 2 percent in the second half of 2016 and a similar rate of job growth in 2017.	13.0	110.0
201612	1303	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I would note, as many others have, that respondents to our most recent business outlook survey reported a significant uptick in their assessments of current conditions and the outlook, commenting on a more business-friendly environment for taxes and regulation.	13.0	110.0
201612	1304	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	At this point, we would say that risks to the District economic growth forecasts are to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201612	1305	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding the nation, as many of you have discussed, we are making progress toward reaching our full-employment goal.	13.0	110.0
201612	1306	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I find myself increasingly focusing on measures of employment among prime-age workers, which continue to lag.	13.0	110.0
201612	1307	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And I’ve particularly been focusing again on the correlations between employment levels, participation, and levels of educational attainment.	13.0	110.0
201612	1308	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Analysis of levels of educational attainment versus participation and employment make me believe that even with beefed-up focus on vocational training as well as other programs that improve educational attainment levels, the labor force participation rate is likely to decline over the next 10 years to below 61 percent primarily due to demographic trends.	13.0	110.0
201612	1309	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Based on this, I believe that current rates of real GDP growth, though quite sluggish by historical standards, will certainly be sufficient to continue to take any slack out of the labor market and lower the unemployment rate.	13.0	110.0
201612	1310	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll come back to that in a moment.	13.0	110.0
201612	1311	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding inflation, the Dallas the year-over year rate for the trimmed mean has been running steadily at 1.7 percent so far in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201612	1312	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	It has now ticked up to 1.8 percent in the most recent reading, and this trend continues to give me confidence that we’re going to reach our 2 percent objective over the medium term, if not sooner.	13.0	110.0
201612	1313	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	As I’ve talked about many times before, I’m continuing to work with my team to try to understand the effects of aging demographics, increasing levels of technology-enabled disruption, increased globalization, and particularly high ratios of government debt to GDP, which at a minimum appear to me at least not to be sustainable, even before considering new policies that may increase debt-to-GDP.	13.0	110.0
201612	1314	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re certainly going to be highly vigilant in assessing the possible effects of significant potential changes to regulatory, fiscal, structural, and other government policies.	13.0	110.0
201612	1315	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	For the time being, like Governor Powell, I’ve factored in these possibilities as an insurance policy in our forecast.	13.0	110.0
201612	1316	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, in discussions with our business contacts, we continue to see, as I said before, a sharp improvement in the level of optimism.	13.0	110.0
201612	1317	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re going to have to see what is actually implemented in terms of policy, but I do believe that the probability of overshooting our full employment and inflation objectives has increased.	13.0	110.0
201612	1318	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Time will tell, but I’m certainly now much more forward leaning regarding this possibility.	13.0	110.0
201612	1319	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Two final comments. in view of all the discussion about trade and immigration, I thought I’d comment on those issues.	13.0	110.0
201612	1320	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We obviously have a very strong relationship between the Dallas Federal Reserve and the Central Bank of Mexico, as well as with the economic and political leaders of that country, and we do a substantial amount of research on trade and immigration.	13.0	110.0
201612	1321	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me share a couple of thoughts.	13.0	110.0
201612	1322	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	First, on trade, Texas is now the largest exporting state in the United States, and our largest trading partner is Mexico.	13.0	110.0
201612	1323	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We estimate that trade between the United States and Mexico, measured in 2015 dollars, has grown from approximately $159 billion in 1994, which was around the time of NAFTA, to approximately $532 billion in 2015.	13.0	110.0
201612	1324	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I see President Williams looking at me.	13.0	110.0
201612	1325	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We may need some fact checking on this one.	13.0	102.0
201612	1326	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We may debate that, yes.	13.0	110.0
201612	1327	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	[Laughter]	13.0	110.0
201612	1328	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Well, let me get to the other parts of our analysis.	13.0	110.0
201612	1329	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 55 percent of US trade with Mexico is imports to the United States, and approximately 45 percent is exports from the United States to Mexico.	13.0	110.0
201612	1330	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 81 percent of Mexico’s exports, by our measure, went to the United States.	13.0	110.0
201612	1331	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	What is interesting to us and what we particularly focus on is that approximately 40 percent of US imports from Mexico represents content that originates in the United States—that is, it’s the result of production partnerships, integrated logistics, and supply chains.	13.0	110.0
201612	1332	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, these partnerships have improved Texas’s competitiveness, as well as US competitiveness.	13.0	110.0
201612	1333	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe that these arrangements have the effect of increasing employment in Texas as well as in the United States, and if these arrangements did not exist or were disrupted, we would likely lose some of these jobs to other countries, particularly in Asia.	13.0	110.0
201612	1334	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Because this aspect of trade is very critical to US competitiveness, we’ll continue to focus heavily on it.	13.0	110.0
201612	1335	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding immigration, we estimate that the United States is home to more immigrants from Mexico than any other nation, by our count approximately 12 million.	13.0	110.0
201612	1336	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Mexican-born immigrants account for approximately 27 percent of all immigrants living in the United States and 55 percent of immigrants living in Texas.	13.0	110.0
201612	1337	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Our research suggests that over the past two years, net immigration flows to the United States from Mexico have basically been close to zero.	13.0	110.0
201612	1338	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Some people think those estimates are wrong, that they’ve been running negative.	13.0	110.0
201612	1339	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And the reasons for that are improved economic conditions in Mexico, industrial reform, creation of a beefed-up social safety net, and smaller family size.	13.0	110.0
201612	1340	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	We estimate that immigrants generally and their children have made up a substantial portion—in our estimation, more than 50 percent—of the growth in the US labor force over the past 20 years.	13.0	110.0
201612	1341	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me stop there.	13.0	110.0
201612	1342	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201612	1343	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1344	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201612	1345	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1346	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continued to grow slowly but steadily, with employment barely increasing over the three months ending in October.	13.0	999.0
201612	1347	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	This recent behavior represents a significant departure from the region’s 0.7 percent trend growth rate.	13.0	999.0
201612	1348	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	A number of areas, such as Atlantic City, Vineland, and Allentown, have experienced contractions in employment this year, while some areas, such as metro Philadelphia, Altoona, and Ocean City, have seen employment growth rates in excess of 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1349	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	However, the recent slowdown in labor market growth has produced an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent for the region, almost a full percentage point higher than at the beginning of the year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1350	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The increase in the unemployment rate is due to the loss of 90,000 jobs in the household survey, which represents job losses more consistent with the recession and, frankly, is at odds with the continued upward trend in employment reported in the establishment survey.	13.0	999.0
201612	1351	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, the behavior of new claims for unemployment insurance is more consistent with employment growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1352	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The most recent household labor market data are a bit of a puzzle.	13.0	999.0
201612	1353	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Needless to say, we will be monitoring developments in the region’s labor markets quite closely.	13.0	999.0
201612	1354	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Employment aside, other economic indicators point to slow-to-modest economic growth and an optimistic outlook among consumers and firms.	13.0	999.0
201612	1355	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Our manufacturing survey, due out this Thursday morning, remained in positive territory for the fifth straight month.	13.0	999.0
201612	1356	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The current index increased from 7.6 to 21.5, well above its nonrecessionary average of 9.7.	13.0	999.0
201612	1357	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In addition, respondents appear to be quite optimistic, with the future activity index jumping more than 23 points, from 29.3 to 52.6.	13.0	999.0
201612	1358	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	One contact summarized the mood in the business community as one of “awkward optimism”—I love the phrase—reflecting the hopes for a new Administration while recognizing the potential risks due to the presidential transition.	13.0	999.0
201612	1359	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Growth in consumer activity remains modest, and construction spending, both residential and nonresidential, is up on the year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1360	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In our region, multifamily starts are approaching the level of single-family starts, which from a historical perspective is quite unusual and very different from national housing behavior.	13.0	999.0
201612	1361	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Looking ahead, we continue to forecast an acceleration of economic growth for the region in 2017.	13.0	999.0
201612	1362	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	On the nation as a whole, even though I did not incorporate any effects due to a change in fiscal policy, my economic outlook differs little from the staff’s.	13.0	999.0
201612	1363	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The uncertainty surrounding the path of fiscal policy makes forecasting especially challenging.	13.0	999.0
201612	1364	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	I appreciate the staff’s efforts in taking a stand on proposed fiscal stimulus, but my own view is that the uncertainty about what might actually be implemented is high enough that I am not ready to make a major change to my outlook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1365	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	That said, I do think it is more likely than not that some stimulus will be forthcoming, so the risk to my forecast is weighted to the upside.	13.0	999.0
201612	1366	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	My forecast calls for real GDP to grow at 2.3 percent in 2017 and then 2.1 percent in 2018 and ’19.	13.0	999.0
201612	1367	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The labor market continues to strengthen, and the unemployment rate edges down to 4.4 percent by the end of 2017 and then remains close to that level through 2019.	13.0	999.0
201612	1368	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Headline and core PCE inflation move up to the 2 percent target in 2018 but do not really overshoot in 2019.	13.0	999.0
201612	1369	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	The forecasts that I put the most weight on have acceptable outcomes for inflation and unemployment over the medium term together with an underlying policy rate path that calls for a bit less than 100 basis points per year in funds rate increases.	13.0	999.0
201612	1370	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Taking a forecast-targeting approach, my outlook calls for the funds rate to rise 75 basis points in 2017, which is one less rate hike than in my previous submission, and then about 100 basis points in each of the next two years.	13.0	999.0
201612	1371	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	But, like the staff, my modal outlook for real GDP growth is far from robust.	13.0	999.0
201612	1372	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	It appears that both of our forecasts are influenced by a somewhat discouraging view of longer-term growth, and there are fundamental reasons to take this view.	13.0	999.0
201612	1373	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Simply put, we—present company excluded—are getting older.	13.0	999.0
201612	1374	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	It seems that at each successive policy briefing, I learn a different way that demographics are reshaping the economy—their effects on labor force participation, their effects on real interest rates, and their effects on economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1375	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Preliminary work by a member of my staff has pointed out that the decline in labor market fluidity, as measured by the gross job relocation rate, may be an important driver in declining productivity growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1376	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	This decrease in fluidity is largely driven by demographic factors, with both the aging of firms and the aging of workers playing a role.	13.0	999.0
201612	1377	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Indeed, as some recent research at the New York Federal Reserve indicates, the two factors may be related, because with the aging of the workforce and fewer workers entering the labor market, employment costs rise, and it becomes less desirable for new firms to enter.	13.0	999.0
201612	1378	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Because new firms tend to have higher productivity, the aging of the distribution of firms can lead to lower productivity.	13.0	999.0
201612	1379	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Further, Ryan Decker of the Board staff estimates that productivity would be 2 percentage points per year higher in the dynamic high-tech sector if firms had expanded in line with their productivity at the same rate as they did pre-2000.	13.0	999.0
201612	1380	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	If the trending decline in fluidity continues, then we may be in for a period of prolonged low productivity growth that will affect the trajectory of future monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201612	1381	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1382	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1383	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201612	1384	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1385	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Overall, the Fourth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.	13.0	999.0
201612	1386	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	District contacts report largely stable economic conditions at this time.	13.0	999.0
201612	1387	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions moved up from -6 at the time of our previous meeting to 0 and has been hovering around this level since midyear.	13.0	999.0
201612	1388	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Last Thursday we held a joint meeting of the Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Cincinnati boards, and I want to thank Governor Brainard and Eric Belsky for participating in a discussion of outreach efforts at the Cleveland Bank and at the System at large.	13.0	999.0
201612	1389	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We found that to be a very productive discussion.	13.0	999.0
201612	1390	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In the subsequent discussion of economic conditions, many directors expressed uncertainty about the likely effects of the election on their own businesses.	13.0	999.0
201612	1391	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The bankers reported an increase in business sentiment among their customers, but a national labor leader on our Cincinnati Branch board noted that the employers they deal with are now less optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201612	1392	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A national retail space real estate developer expressed some concerns about the large number of CMBS deals that were made in 2007 and are coming up for refinancing.	13.0	999.0
201612	1393	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Many of these deals were significantly leveraged, so some developers may run into trouble refinancing, in light of the new rules on risk retention and tighter underwriting standards by lenders.	13.0	999.0
201612	1394	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	District labor market conditions continue to strengthen.	13.0	999.0
201612	1395	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that year-over-year growth in payrolls has edged down to 0.8 percent in November, but this pace is above their estimate of the District’s trend growth rate of about 0.25 percent, which is well below the trend growth rate of the nation and reflects the region’s low population growth and the aging of its population.	13.0	999.0
201612	1396	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained around 5 percent all year.	13.0	999.0
201612	1397	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Responses from Fourth District contacts to the System’s special questions on hiring and wages were in line with those from the other Districts.	13.0	999.0
201612	1398	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Firms in the region continued to hire with relatively little change in hiring plans since last November’s survey.	13.0	999.0
201612	1399	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Compared with 63 percent in last year’s survey, 70 percent of respondents reported they were increasing wages to attract workers in either most or some job categories.	13.0	999.0
201612	1400	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports indicate that firms are still having trouble hiring workers in several job categories, including construction and information technology.	13.0	999.0
201612	1401	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Inflation pressures in the District appear contained, but some firms report they are increasing prices after several years of stability.	13.0	999.0
201612	1402	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A director who heads a large national paint and coatings company reported that in December, for the first time in four years, the firm increased prices 4 percent to cover rising labor and real estate costs.	13.0	999.0
201612	1403	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	He said there had been no pushback from customers.	13.0	999.0
201612	1404	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the national economy, real GDP growth has picked up in the second half of the year, as anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201612	1405	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions have continued to strengthen, and inflation indicators and several measures of inflation expectations have moved up since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201612	1406	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The prospects for some changes to fiscal and other economic policies—such as infrastructure spending, tax code changes, immigration policy, trade policy, and regulatory change—increased, but the form any policy changes will take, the timing of passage, and the timing and size of the effects are very uncertain at this point.	13.0	999.0
201612	1407	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook baseline assumptions about fiscal stimulus seem plausible to me, but the package could be larger or smaller, and its design will be an important factor in assessing the expected effect on the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1408	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Will fiscal policy changes be formulated in a manner that merely gives a temporary boost to aggregate demand to be financed by deficit spending—a development that would not be beneficial to the economy over the medium to longer run?	13.0	999.0
201612	1409	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Or, instead, will the policy changes aim to increase productivity growth, which would be very beneficial if the policy changes actually achieve that goal?	13.0	999.0
201612	1410	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We have few details at this point, so in putting together my SEP submission, like the Tealbook, I have incorporated a modest increase in output growth and inflation in 2018 due to fiscal policy effects.	13.0	999.0
201612	1411	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Policies that constrain immigration and trade would have negative effects for the US economy over the medium and longer run, but I have not incorporated these into my projections at this point.	13.0	999.0
201612	1412	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So fiscal and other potential economic policies impart both upside and downside risks to my forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1413	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The prospect of a larger fiscal package than I assumed poses upside risks to output growth and inflation, especially if monetary policy does not appropriately respond.	13.0	999.0
201612	1414	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	A smaller package poses some downside risks, especially because financial market participants appear to be anticipating fairly large effects and could be disappointed.	13.0	999.0
201612	1415	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As more details about forthcoming policy changes come in, we will have a better sense of their implications and can adjust our forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1416	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At this point, overall, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run hasn’t changed much since our previous meeting or since our September SEP submission.	13.0	999.0
201612	1417	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I see the fundamentals—including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, improved household balance sheets, the strong labor market, and modestly more stimulative fiscal policy—as supportive of GDP growth over the forecast horizon at a pace at or slightly above its trend pace, which I estimate at 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1418	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This pace is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, which stays below my longer-run rate of 5 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1419	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I anticipate that inflation will move up to 2 percent in early 2018, reflecting stable inflation expectations, continued strengthening of labor market conditions, and ongoing economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201612	1420	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In light of my outlook, I believe it will be appropriate for the federal funds rate to move up over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1421	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My trajectory is a bit steeper than in my September SEP submission, because the funds rate at the end of 2016 will be lower than I projected in September and because, compared with September, I am projecting slightly higher output growth and inflation and a somewhat lower unemployment rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1422	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I now assume that the funds rate will end 2019 at a level slightly higher than my longer-run estimate of 3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201612	1423	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But, admittedly, there is considerable uncertainty regarding this policy rate path, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the types of shocks that will invariably hit the economy over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201612	1424	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	On its external website, the Cleveland Reserve Bank now publishes a set of simple monetary policy rules, the outcomes of these rules across alternative forecasts, and a tool for computing rule outcomes on the basis of the user’s own forecast.	13.0	999.0
201612	1425	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Looking at the rules, one can see there is quite a bit of variation in what the rules prescribe.	13.0	999.0
201612	1426	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But the median path across the rules is steeper than the median path in the SEP.	13.0	999.0
201612	1427	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My policy rate path is similar to the outcome from the inertial Taylor rule from our set of rules.	13.0	999.0
201612	1428	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	My path is a bit steeper than in the Tealbook, in part because I see somewhat greater inflation pressures.	13.0	999.0
201612	1429	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As a result, my policy rate path results in somewhat less undershooting of the unemployment rate of its longer-run estimate compared with the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201612	1430	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I see broadly balanced risks associated with my outlook, but I believe we need to remain very open to the considerable possibility that the economy will evolve differently from what we currently anticipate.	13.0	999.0
201612	1431	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I was struck over the intermeeting period by how sharply financial conditions and consumer and business sentiment changed.	13.0	999.0
201612	1432	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The National Federation of Independent Business survey results, which are embargoed until Tuesday, suggest there was a significant increase in confidence among small businesses since the election.	13.0	999.0
201612	1433	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Apparently, financial market participants and business leaders are expecting very beneficial changes to fiscal and other economic policies.	13.0	999.0
201612	1434	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I found the Board staff’s memo on this to be quite helpful.	13.0	999.0
201612	1435	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It could be that these expectations will be borne out, but at this point they seem to be skewed toward putting too much weight on very positive outcomes and too little weight on poor outcomes, especially as we have few details on the actual proposed policy changes.	13.0	999.0
201612	1436	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, I have always put more weight on fundamentals driving the economy and on these fundamentals driving sentiment.	13.0	999.0
201612	1437	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But maybe I have been underestimating the effect that animal spirits or sentiment can have, independent of fundamentals like policy.	13.0	999.0
201612	1438	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been somewhat puzzled by the low levels of business investment and productivity growth, against the background of the accommodative financial conditions we have had for quite some time.	13.0	999.0
201612	1439	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps now better sentiment will spur renewed investment.	13.0	999.0
201612	1440	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Of course, this possibility also raises the uncomfortable notion that there may be some truth to the skeptics’s argument that keeping interest rates as low as we have for as long as we have has sent a negative signal about the economy, which has hurt business, investor, and consumer confidence, thus creating a negative headwind.	13.0	999.0
201612	1441	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Recent developments suggest we may need to consider this, as well as the implications it would have for both our policy rate path and our communications.	13.0	999.0
201612	1442	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201612	1443	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201612	1444	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201612	1445	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201612	1446	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Our surveys of economic activity in the Fifth District have shown modest firming since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1447	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Our composite manufacturing index was plus 4 in November, a notable increase from the negative numbers posted in the previous three months.	13.0	81.0
201612	1448	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary figures for December—confidential until the 27th, please—show a reading of plus 6.	13.0	81.0
201612	1449	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Service-sector activity also expanded more broadly since the previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1450	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	According to our survey, the revenue index for services was plus 3 in November and plus 8 according to the preliminary December results.	13.0	81.0
201612	1451	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Numerous contacts reported a greater sense of optimism regarding the economic outlook since the election.	13.0	81.0
201612	1452	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Some have used words like “exuberance” and “euphoria.”	13.0	81.0
201612	1453	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	An array of sources cited the prospect of changing or repealing regulations enacted in recent years as one source of optimism.	13.0	81.0
201612	1454	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The new overtime rules were frequently cited, and firms that had gone through implementation reported cases of employees feeling insulted at being reclassified as hourly or just quitting outright.	13.0	81.0
201612	1455	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Prospects for rollback of the ACA and EPA rules and for possible tax reform were also cited as contributing to greater optimism.	13.0	81.0
201612	1456	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Several bank CEOs noted a flurry of borrowing requests.	13.0	81.0
201612	1457	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	They say that many customers had let investment demand build over the past few years and that the election seems to have released pent-up increases in planned capital spending.	13.0	81.0
201612	1458	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Other contacts, however, noted the uncertainty surrounding the contours of upcoming policy changes, and one director called the euphoria “irrational.”	13.0	81.0
201612	1459	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One utility industry executive from West Virginia said that some in the state were positively giddy about the prospect of their coal jobs coming back.	13.0	81.0
201612	1460	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But he emphasized that while some near-term uptick in coal production in response to firming natural gas prices was possible, there was no way coal production was going to return to anything like previous levels.	13.0	81.0
201612	1461	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And one director who’s the CEO of a large urban Goodwill said that clients at their workforce training centers—these are mostly in the hospitality and security occupations—have become more fearful as a result of the election.	13.0	81.0
201612	1462	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Nonetheless, the overall tone of anecdotal comments from directors and roundtable participants was strikingly upbeat.	13.0	81.0
201612	1463	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	At the national level, the natural interpretation of the large increases in equity prices and bond yields since the election seems consistent with the general exuberance we’ve heard from around our District, namely an anticipation of tax reform or reduced regulatory burden.	13.0	81.0
201612	1464	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I find it heartening that markets appear to be more or less discounting adverse economic effects from increased trade barriers, although some of our export-oriented manufacturers have expressed some worries about future trade policy.	13.0	81.0
201612	1465	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, there’s a lot of uncertainty about just what’s coming down the pike by way of policy initiatives, but it seems prudent to build in at least some fiscal stimulus into the baseline forecast at this point, and for simplicity we followed the Tealbook’s approach of assuming a medium-sized personal tax cut in Q3.	13.0	81.0
201612	1466	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Without that assumption, our forecast would have been little changed from our September SEP submission that showed real GDP growth slowing to its trend rate of about 1¾ percent.	13.0	81.0
201612	1467	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	With that assumption, GDP growth is ¼ percentage point higher next year but basically the same thereafter.	13.0	81.0
201612	1468	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I agree with the notion that any productivity enhancements arising from the new policy environment are speculative at this point and likely to show up only over an extended horizon, so I’m not assuming any material supply-side effects for now.	13.0	81.0
201612	1469	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The way things have played out since the election gives me a bit more confidence in the business investment forecast, however.	13.0	81.0
201612	1470	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think President Mester and others commented on this.	13.0	81.0
201612	1471	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Since the beginning of the year, the Tealbook, like many others, myself included, has been projecting an imminent rebound in business fixed investment.	13.0	81.0
201612	1472	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Instead, BFI has been disappointingly sluggish all year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1473	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	If the post- election response represents the release of pent-up business spending plans, then investment spending may have been held down before the election by firms’ apprehension about the election outcome and growing regulatory burdens.	13.0	81.0
201612	1474	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	If the current burst of optimism is to some extent sustained, then we are more likely to get the turnaround in BFI that we’d been hoping for.	13.0	81.0
201612	1475	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	My inflation projections are basically unchanged.	13.0	81.0
201612	1476	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Core and overall inflation rates converge to 2 percent in about a year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1477	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Achieving that outcome—that is, keeping the added fiscal stimulus from driving up inflation—is going to require tighter monetary policy.	13.0	81.0
201612	1478	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I’m projecting the appropriate funds rate to rise more rapidly than I did in September.	13.0	81.0
201612	1479	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	We start from a lower base than I had projected for this month, and the net is the same rate at the end of next year as I wrote down in September, but a higher rate at the end of 2018.	13.0	81.0
201612	1480	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, uncertainty about the economic outlook in the United States is greater than it was at the previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201612	1481	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Even though the direction might be clear, the range of possible fiscal and regulatory policy outcomes is fairly large.	13.0	81.0
201612	1482	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible that outcomes will not be quite as beneficial to economic growth and earnings as the move in equity values would imply.	13.0	81.0
201612	1483	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think it’s worth taking the recent outbreak of exuberance with a few grains of salt.	13.0	81.0
201612	1484	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, inflation risks seem to be moving in the other direction.	13.0	81.0
201612	1485	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, inflation compensation measures have risen significantly, as several have noted, and even more striking is the movement in the Kitsul–Wright probabilities of high and low inflation that are derived from options markets.	13.0	81.0
201612	1486	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Since early October, the estimated probability of 10-year inflation being above 3 percent has risen from about 20 percent to about 40 percent, while the estimated probability of the 10-year inflation being below 1 percent has fallen from about 40 percent to about 20 percent.	13.0	81.0
201612	1487	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	We have also seen the 10-year Treasury security’s term premium move from negative territory to about zero.	13.0	81.0
201612	1488	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This suggests that investors see less value in Treasuries as a hedge against deflation, and they’re becoming more concerned about the exposure of nominal Treasuries to the risk of inflation.	13.0	81.0
201612	1489	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These developments could just reflect a dissipation of downside inflation risks and a return to the normalcy of a more symmetric inflation outlook.	13.0	81.0
201612	1490	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, they could reflect market expectations that policy rates are not going to respond enough to prevent fiscal stimulus from pushing inflation higher.	13.0	81.0
201612	1491	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, this implies we should seriously consider whether rate increases will be only gradual.	13.0	81.0
201612	1492	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Finally, I have some comments about the undershooting memo, which I appreciated.	13.0	81.0
201612	1493	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It’s noteworthy that the only episode identified of a soft landing is 1993–1995.	13.0	81.0
201612	1494	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This episode is identified in narrative accounts of postwar US monetary policy as the first instance of preemptive rate increases since the beginning of the Great Inflation in the mid-’60s.	13.0	81.0
201612	1495	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The FOMC raised the federal funds rate 300 basis points in one year.	13.0	81.0
201612	1496	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I don’t expect we will need 300 basis points next year, but I suspect 50 won’t be enough.	13.0	81.0
201612	1497	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	These accounts give credit to our preemptive approach for stabilizing inflation expectations near 2 percent and ushering in the current era of relatively well-behaved, well-anchored inflation expectations.	13.0	81.0
201612	1498	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This perspective reflects the extent to which our credibility—that is, expectations about monetary policy—is capable of varying over time.	13.0	81.0
201612	1499	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And, in this regard, I wanted to comment on the discussion of the inflation process in the memo.	13.0	81.0
201612	1500	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	One could be forgiven for thinking of it as an exogenous technological phenomenon, but I know the staff appreciates that it’s endogenous.	13.0	81.0
201612	1501	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those parameters embed private-sector expectations about the conduct of policy in the future.	13.0	81.0
201612	1502	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For me, the lesson I take from the undershooting memo is that we need to be careful not to miss the opportunity to be appropriately preemptive.	13.0	81.0
201612	1503	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201612	1504	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1505	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201612	1506	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201612	1507	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Moderate economic growth continues in the Ninth District.	13.0	111.0
201612	1508	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Retail spending and housing construction have been especially strong.	13.0	111.0
201612	1509	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The ag sector in 2016 has seen a record harvest year, and, not surprisingly, farmers are pessimistic about next year.	13.0	111.0
201612	1510	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment continues to grow modestly despite continued poor labor availability.	13.0	111.0
201612	1511	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Twin Cities’ daycare providers said that a lot of new families need daycare because they’re all going back to work.	13.0	111.0
201612	1512	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Wages continue to see pressure, especially on the low end, but price pressures remain subdued.	13.0	111.0
201612	1513	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Contacts point to strong online competition in retail, especially in flat food prices.	13.0	111.0
201612	1514	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	A large online retailer is expanding sharply in the Twin Cities.	13.0	111.0
201612	1515	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Nationally, the moderate pace of expansion continues—solid consumption growth, but, as others have noted, investment remains worryingly weak.	13.0	111.0
201612	1516	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Most important to me is looking at the unemployment situation.	13.0	111.0
201612	1517	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, the big drop in the headline unemployment rate is something I’m paying close attention to.	13.0	111.0
201612	1518	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	That sharp decline coupled with a tick down in labor force participation suggests that the labor market is tightening, and the big question is, “Are we there yet or is there more room to run?”	13.0	111.0
201612	1519	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I think in future months we’ll see.	13.0	111.0
201612	1520	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ll get more data to help determine whether or not this has really run its course.	13.0	111.0
201612	1521	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	There was welcome evidence of some pickup in productivity.	13.0	111.0
201612	1522	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I hope that will continue after Q3.	13.0	111.0
201612	1523	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In terms of inflation, there was no change to core inflation in the intermeeting period.	13.0	111.0
201612	1524	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others noted, 5-to-10-year-ahead TIPS inflation compensation has risen, continuing a rise that started midyear.	13.0	111.0
201612	1525	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But let’s remind ourselves that this is still low by historical standards, as some others have noted.	13.0	111.0
201612	1526	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The markets seem focused on a scenario that fiscal policy becomes more expansionary, which in turn drives up inflation, and oil prices have risen a bit.	13.0	111.0
201612	1527	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	On the other hand, the dollar continues to strengthen, which will hold down import prices.	13.0	111.0
201612	1528	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The trade-weighted index is up more than 25 percent since mid-2014, when the dollar strengthening began.	13.0	111.0
201612	1529	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, the other thing that I think is noteworthy, as others have noted, is financial markets since the election.	13.0	111.0
201612	1530	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Ten-year Treasury yields are up about 60 basis points, and this reflects a fairly even split between higher real rates and higher inflation compensation.	13.0	111.0
201612	1531	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Markets are expecting a faster pace of firming from us.	13.0	111.0
201612	1532	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	My view is that we should pay attention to markets, but not overreact to them.	13.0	111.0
201612	1533	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	They don’t have any better idea of what fiscal policy is going to be than we do.	13.0	111.0
201612	1534	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Markets and pollsters didn’t get Brexit right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1535	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	They didn’t get the election right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1536	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t have any more confidence that they’re going to get fiscal policy right.	13.0	111.0
201612	1537	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	By the way, in terms of timing, we’re not going to know for quite some time what actual fiscal policy will be.	13.0	111.0
201612	1538	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But my guess is that in the first 100 days we’ll at least have markers out from the Administration of what it’s proposing.	13.0	111.0
201612	1539	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	It’ll take longer for those negotiations to take place.	13.0	111.0
201612	1540	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But I think we’ll know a lot more in three or four months than we know now.	13.0	111.0
201612	1541	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Higher rates plus a stronger dollar do imply tighter conditions.	13.0	111.0
201612	1542	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But when I look at the rates going up—I guess I don’t know, President Williams, whether r* can move this quickly—it doesn’t feel like tighter conditions.	13.0	111.0
201612	1543	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	It feels like more optimism, and so it isn’t obvious how much effect that’s going to have.	13.0	111.0
201612	1544	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And, as I said earlier, markets could give back these gains as quickly as they acquired them if negotiations go a different direction.	13.0	111.0
201612	1545	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And then uncertainty, as I just touched on, is currently high, due to the policy uncertainty.	13.0	111.0
201612	1546	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Global uncertainty remains, with Italy, as we talked about; with South Korea now having some turmoil there politically; and with a large bank in Northern Europe, as we talked about earlier.	13.0	111.0
201612	1547	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And uncertainty isn’t necessarily bad news.	13.0	111.0
201612	1548	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	There’s a greater chance of good outcomes but also a greater chance of bad outcomes.	13.0	111.0
201612	1549	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In conclusion, we continue to make welcome progress toward our goals.	13.0	111.0
201612	1550	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	However, I will note in my policy go-round the elevated policy uncertainty.	13.0	111.0
201612	1551	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I struggle with not just tomorrow’s decision, which I think is fairly straightforward, but how do we communicate the likely future path, in view of this huge uncertainty that we face right now?	13.0	111.0
201612	1552	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201612	1553	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201612	1554	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201612	1555	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think where we are and where we’re headed in the near term is relatively clear, and there seems to be pretty good agreement around the table.	13.0	96.0
201612	1556	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s also agreement that further out, 2018 and beyond, is less clear and, as many people have recognized, there is a potential for significant fiscal policy stimulus that could collide with an economy that may be operating at or even somewhat beyond what we would characterize as maximum sustainable employment.	13.0	96.0
201612	1557	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Over the near term, I expect the economy to continue to do what it had been doing, growing at a slightly above-trend pace.	13.0	96.0
201612	1558	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When I assess the economy, I’m pretty optimistic about household spending, which I expect will be bolstered by further job gains and rising wage compensation.	13.0	96.0
201612	1559	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the US consumer does not appear overstretched.	13.0	96.0
201612	1560	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The personal saving rate, at 6 percent in October, actually seems to be a bit high relative to what one might expect on the basis of the historical relationship between household net worth and disposable income.	13.0	96.0
201612	1561	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And household balance sheets are in good shape.	13.0	96.0
201612	1562	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Households did deleverage significantly since the Great Recession, and, over the previous year, household debt has been growing, but it has been growing at a very modest pace.	13.0	96.0
201612	1563	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Business fixed investment is sort of the wild card.	13.0	96.0
201612	1564	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s been the laggard in recent years, but I think it will also do somewhat better.	13.0	96.0
201612	1565	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, we’re probably past the drag due to the plunge in oil and gas drilling activity, but I also think that there was probably some negative consequence from election-year uncertainty.	13.0	96.0
201612	1566	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And, now that that’s passed, that effect will likely fade as well.	13.0	96.0
201612	1567	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Residential investment, I’m not really sure what’s going to happen there.	13.0	96.0
201612	1568	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s been all over the place over the past year and a half, up in 2015, in the first quarter of this year, and then down sharply in Q2 and Q3.	13.0	96.0
201612	1569	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I think that higher mortgage rates will restrain housing demand somewhat, similar to what we saw during the taper tantrum, but against that we have the fact that housing supply still seems to be low relative to job growth and the longer-run pace of household formation.	13.0	96.0
201612	1570	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So we’re not producing houses at a particularly rapid rate right now.	13.0	96.0
201612	1571	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, I do expect the trade sector will be a drag on growth over the next year or so.	13.0	96.0
201612	1572	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The performance during the first three quarters of this year seems to be an anomaly.	13.0	96.0
201612	1573	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I did not expect that trade would contribute positively to GDP growth this year, and it does seem to be due mainly to a weakness in imports, primarily of capital goods, and, of course, the often-cited surge in soybean exports.	13.0	96.0
201612	1574	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Over the next year, I would expect some modest drag on the trade side as these temporary factors lapse and as the recent strength of the dollar starts to become more relevant again.	13.0	96.0
201612	1575	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the implications of the Trump Administration’s goal of better trade deals for the United States are, from my perspective, highly uncertain.	13.0	96.0
201612	1576	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s not just fiscal policy.	13.0	96.0
201612	1577	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Trade deals that are more favorable to US interests, but without any meaningful increase in trade barriers, could evolve in a mostly positive direction, or they could evolve in a very negative one involving higher trade barriers.	13.0	96.0
201612	1578	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, the principle of comparative advantage would be challenged with negative consequences for productivity and, presumably, the prices of internationally traded goods and services.	13.0	96.0
201612	1579	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	As many of us have noted, another source of uncertainty is the likely trajectory of fiscal policy.	13.0	96.0
201612	1580	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	While I agree with the general sentiment that fiscal policy is likely to turn more expansive, I’m one of the people who have not put it into their forecast yet because we don’t know what it is, when it is, or how big it is, and that’s just too many considerations for me to figure out how to parse it into my forecast.	13.0	96.0
201612	1581	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to see more information, and I think we will have a lot more information in the next three or four months.	13.0	96.0
201612	1582	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So by the time we get to the March SEP, I think this will be factoring into my outlook.	13.0	96.0
201612	1583	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In assessing the outlook, one thing that we talked about around the table is, how do you factor in the recent market developments?	13.0	96.0
201612	1584	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Since the election, we’ve had pretty large movements in financial asset prices.	13.0	96.0
201612	1585	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Bond yields are up, equity prices are up, and the dollar has appreciated considerably against many different currencies.	13.0	96.0
201612	1586	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	On balance, if you view it in terms of a financial condition index, it looks to be a tightening of financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201612	1587	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’m not really concerned by this because I do think that this is a tightening that’s different than the tightening, for example, that we saw in early 2016.	13.0	96.0
201612	1588	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That was an increase in risk aversion.	13.0	96.0
201612	1589	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That was an increase in the risk premiums that were embedded in financial asset prices, and I don’t think that’s happening this time.	13.0	96.0
201612	1590	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that the tightening of financial market conditions, to the extent there’s a tightening at all, reflects greater optimism about the outlook, and it’s not even clear to me whether the net effect on real GDP growth is positive or negative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1591	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m pretty agnostic about this, and I certainly am not using it to reduce my GDP growth forecast.	13.0	96.0
201612	1592	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the inflation outlook, I’m more confident that we’re going to make progress toward our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201612	1593	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a number of things that I take as supportive of that.	13.0	96.0
201612	1594	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	One is less downside risk to the economy because I do think it’s not just that US fiscal policy is likely to turn more stimulative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1595	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the global economic outlook has improved somewhat.	13.0	96.0
201612	1596	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, to the extent that US fiscal policy is more stimulative, that’s going to help the rest of the world, too.	13.0	96.0
201612	1597	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	This gives a real chance for Japan and Europe to get out of their very low inflation traps.	13.0	96.0
201612	1598	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	If we have more fiscal policy stimulus—not a reason to do the fiscal policy stimulus, necessarily—it will be helpful, potentially, for them.	13.0	96.0
201612	1599	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Another is the effect of higher energy prices on headline inflation, and I think that’s going to feed into inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201612	1600	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re already starting to see the very beginnings of that.	13.0	96.0
201612	1601	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	However, longer term on inflation, I’m starting to be worried about the risk that inflation overshoots.	13.0	96.0
201612	1602	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	This is tied back to the issue of whether fiscal policy is going to be very stimulative.	13.0	96.0
201612	1603	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not going to put much weight on this risk over the very near term.	13.0	96.0
201612	1604	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In the short run, at least, I don’t feel like it will be a particularly bad outcome if inflation is slightly above 2 percent for a time because that would reinforce the notion that our 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric and not a ceiling.	13.0	96.0
201612	1605	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I do think that we could be looking at a situation two to three years from now where the economy was really getting pushed along by this fiscal stimulus, and if we were late—to President Lacker’s comments—inflation could start to get out of hand.	13.0	96.0
201612	1606	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In that vein, I particularly worry a little bit about how the Tealbook models these kinds of risks, because it always assumes that we’re going to do the right thing, and it assumes that the Phillips curve is very, very flat.	13.0	96.0
201612	1607	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not convinced that we’ll necessarily always do the right thing.	13.0	96.0
201612	1608	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The Federal Reserve has made serial errors in policy, and as you push the unemployment rate down to very low levels, I think there’s enough risk that the Phillips curve becomes steeper.	13.0	96.0
201612	1609	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When I read the Tealbook’s alternative scenarios, I’m always amazed by how big the shocks are relative to the consequences on economic growth and inflation because the results are so damped by the expectations that, in the end, we’ll do the right thing.	13.0	96.0
201612	1610	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Everyone knows we’ll do the right thing and, therefore, nothing really bad happens.	13.0	96.0
201612	1611	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we just have to be a little bit cautious when we think about those alternative scenarios.	13.0	96.0
201612	1612	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in terms of my interest rate projections, which we’ll talk more about tomorrow, I haven’t made any changes yet, two 25 basis point moves in 2017 and three for 2018.	13.0	96.0
201612	1613	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But if we do get the news on fiscal policy that maybe we’ll get before the March meeting, then my forecast of my forecast is that my forecast might move up.	13.0	96.0
201612	1614	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201612	1615	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the outlook and associated risks.	13.0	65.0
201612	1616	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	What I’d like to do is close out the round with a few comments on incoming data and on the possible implications for the outlook of changes in fiscal policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1617	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	To begin:  As we expected and intended, labor market conditions have continued to improve.	13.0	65.0
201612	1618	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Payroll gains have remained solid at about 180,000 per month since late summer and for the year as a whole.	13.0	65.0
201612	1619	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate dropped markedly in November.	13.0	65.0
201612	1620	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Like the staff, I expect this decline to be partially reversed in the next month or two, leaving the unemployment rate very close to my estimate of its sustainable longer-run level.	13.0	65.0
201612	1621	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	The broader U-6 measure of labor utilization, although still somewhat elevated, has fallen more than ½ percentage point since the start of the year.	13.0	65.0
201612	1622	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And the employment-to-population ratio has held steady, despite the downward pressure from demographic trends.	13.0	65.0
201612	1623	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of these and other indicators, I judge that overall utilization in the labor market is more or less back to normal.	13.0	65.0
201612	1624	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I don’t think we’ve fallen “behind the curve.”	13.0	65.0
201612	1625	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Wage gains are still subdued, and inflation remains below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	65.0
201612	1626	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, the elimination of slack does not mean that the economy has reached some tipping point, with any further tightening triggering widespread shortages of workers, a sharp acceleration in costs, or other destabilizing dynamics.	13.0	65.0
201612	1627	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the evidence presented in the two, very nicely done, staff memos, I instead expect that the effects of a further decline in unemployment on inflation or, conceivably, on financial stability will develop only slowly, giving us time to respond if undesirable effects emerge.	13.0	65.0
201612	1628	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, I consider the risk of a marked overheating to be low if we act to remove gradually the modest degree of accommodation that is still in place.	13.0	65.0
201612	1629	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Real GDP has been expanding at a fairly moderate pace for some time.	13.0	65.0
201612	1630	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And in an environment of rising interest rates, I would expect growth to slow further, all else being equal.	13.0	65.0
201612	1631	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	With appropriate adjustments to policy, we should be able to prevent the unemployment rate from undershooting its long-run level to an excessive degree.	13.0	65.0
201612	1632	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve also made good progress on the inflation front, and the data have come in somewhat stronger than I expected a year ago.	13.0	65.0
201612	1633	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On a 12-month basis, headline PCE inflation is now running at close to 1½ percent, compared with only ½ percent last year.	13.0	65.0
201612	1634	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, core PCE inflation is now running at 1¾ percent.	13.0	65.0
201612	1635	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Survey-based measures of expected inflation remain stable, and market-based measures of inflation compensation, although still low, have risen more than 30 basis points since our previous meeting.	13.0	65.0
201612	1636	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	These developments have reinforced my confidence that inflation will be back to 2 percent within a couple of years, aided in part by moderately tight labor market conditions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1637	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Ideally, we will succeed in adjusting the stance of monetary policy over time to achieve the desired soft landing.	13.0	65.0
201612	1638	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As one of the staff memos discussed, history shows that such an outcome is possible, at least as long as we are not hit with a large adverse shock.	13.0	65.0
201612	1639	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Judging the stance of policy that’s most conducive to keeping the economy operating on an even keel is, of course, never easy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1640	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But it is particularly tricky in the current environment, because of our large asset holdings and considerable uncertainty about future fiscal policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1641	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Estimates suggest that the neutral level of the real funds rate is currently near zero, more than 1 percentage point higher than its actual value.	13.0	65.0
201612	1642	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	If so, then achieving a neutral stance would appear to require roughly four 25 basis point hikes in addition to the one that we will presumably announce tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201612	1643	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But in assessing how much and how quickly to raise the funds rate next year, we need to bear in mind that the degree of accommodation provided by our balance sheet is also declining appreciably.	13.0	65.0
201612	1644	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	According to staff estimates, the downward pressure on longer-term yields from our security holdings will diminish by 16 basis points between now and the end of 2017.	13.0	65.0
201612	1645	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Because the restraint imposed by such a shift is roughly equivalent to that associated with two or more hikes in the funds rate, the need to raise the funds rate very quickly may be less than it might appear.	13.0	65.0
201612	1646	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Risk-management concerns related to the effective lower bound provide another reason to proceed gradually.	13.0	65.0
201612	1647	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	At the same time, the neutral value of the real funds rate is likely to rise over time if residential construction continues to recover from its unusually depressed level, capital spending and productivity growth pick up, and economic activity abroad strengthens.	13.0	65.0
201612	1648	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Easier fiscal policy also now appears likely to stimulate real activity over time, thereby placing additional upward pressure on the path of the funds rate consistent with our dual objectives.	13.0	65.0
201612	1649	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, at this point, we don’t know how big a fiscal package may be enacted, let alone the timing or composition of its provisions, so we really can’t judge how much stimulus it might impart.	13.0	65.0
201612	1650	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	In fact, the overall effect of the fiscal proposals under consideration could turn out to be mildly contractionary in 2017 if additional fiscal impetus ends up being delayed until late next year or beyond, as the stronger dollar and the notable increase we have already seen in longer- term yields since the election will likely have a more front-loaded negative effect on economic activity.	13.0	65.0
201612	1651	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons, I think we should be careful not to get too far out ahead of budget developments in assessing what effect fiscal policy is likely to have on our actions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1652	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	It may be many months before the situation clarifies.	13.0	65.0
201612	1653	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I think we should be careful not to overstate the implications of easier fiscal policy for the appropriate stance of monetary policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1654	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Empirical studies of historical movements in federal debt and interest rates suggest that an increase in the deficit by 1 percent of GDP for 10 years raises longer-term interest rates roughly 30 to 40 basis points.	13.0	65.0
201612	1655	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As the staff notes, a portion of this increase likely occurs via a higher term premium.	13.0	65.0
201612	1656	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	This means that the enactment of a package such as that penciled into the Tealbook should only modestly alter the path of the federal funds rate and its longer-term normal level.	13.0	65.0
201612	1657	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As for the medium-term policy implications of easier fiscal policy, those will depend on the timing and composition of the package that’s passed; market reactions to its provisions; and the net effect of the resulting changes in taxes, government spending, and financial conditions on household and business spending.	13.0	65.0
201612	1658	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, unless the Congress passes something radically different than what seems likely at this point, I anticipate that gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate over time will still be appropriate.	13.0	65.0
201612	1659	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	As Don reported in his briefing, roughly half of you incorporated an assumption of greater fiscal stimulus into your SEP submissions this round.	13.0	65.0
201612	1660	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	On the basis of the comments that you provided and Don’s analysis, it appears that anticipated changes in fiscal policy were a factor accounting for some of the revisions to your projected funds rate path.	13.0	65.0
201612	1661	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But overall, the revisions are really quite small.	13.0	65.0
201612	1662	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I do plan to explain that if I’m asked about it at the press conference.	13.0	65.0
201612	1663	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I will also note that many proposals for taxes and spending are currently being discussed, but there is considerable uncertainty about what the Congress may eventually pass, and that we do not intend to act preemptively based on guesses about future policy even though some of us have incorporated such guesses into our SEP submissions.	13.0	65.0
201612	1664	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I will stress that fiscal policy is just one of many factors that influence real activity and inflation and, thus, the course of monetary policy over time.	13.0	65.0
201612	1665	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that an important objective in our communications in the months ahead should be to avoid leaving the public with the impression that we simply intend to act to offset any stimulus that fiscal policy may provide.	13.0	65.0
201612	1666	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Instead, I hope we will stress that we intend to carry out the task that the Congress has assigned to us—the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability—and we’ll adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in response to all of the factors that affect the economic outlook.	13.0	65.0
201612	1667	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, although there may be broad principles pertaining to fiscal policy that we can articulate, such as the need to ensure long-run fiscal sustainability, the potential value of strengthening the automatic stabilizers, or the desirability of policies that would boost productivity growth, I would urge that we avoid commenting on particular tax and spending proposals under discussion, on the grounds that that’s the job of the Congress and the incoming Administration, whereas our job is monetary policy.	13.0	65.0
201612	1668	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201612	1669	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And I think we have time for Thomas to provide his monetary policy briefing.	13.0	65.0
201612	1670	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201612	1671	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201612	1672	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternatives B and C, the Committee would announce that the evidence accumulated since the summer on progress toward the Committee’s employment and inflation objectives now makes a sufficiently strong case for an increase in the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1673	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, with alternative A, the Committee would defer an increase today, while waiting to see further progress on its objectives.	21.0	999.0
201612	1674	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	A decision to maintain the current target range would come as a considerable surprise to financial market participants; over the intermeeting period, both the market-implied probability of a rate hike and the probability reported in the Desk surveys rose to above 90 percent.	21.0	999.0
201612	1675	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	While tomorrow’s decision may be clear, at least to market participants, the outlook for the economy and for monetary policy is now subject to considerable uncertainty stemming from the possibility of greater fiscal stimulus as well as other potential policy changes.	21.0	999.0
201612	1676	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The first four panels in my exhibit summarize how market participants’ expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate and the probability distribution associated with the expected values have changed since your previous meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1677	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the upper-left panel, the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by OIS quotes—the black lines—has steepened noticeably since your November meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1678	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, part of the shift in the OIS forward rate curve could reflect a rise in the term premium, which is assumed to be zero in this calculation.	21.0	999.0
201612	1679	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The red lines show the expected path of the federal funds rate after adjusting it for shifts in the term premium as estimated by the staff’s OIS term structure model that takes the effective lower bound into account.	21.0	999.0
201612	1680	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That path has also revised up over the intermeeting period but by somewhat less than the OIS forward path.	21.0	999.0
201612	1681	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Investors thus generally appear to expect that the Committee will increase rates a bit faster—albeit still at a gradual pace—over the next two years than they thought earlier, and they are not likely to be surprised by the modest upward revision in the median SEP path.	21.0	999.0
201612	1682	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The black line in the panel to the right presents the evolution of the expected pace of tightening over the year starting tomorrow on the basis of market quotes, again not adjusted for term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201612	1683	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Expectations for the pace of tightening turned up noticeably following the elections and now stand just short of 50 basis points.	21.0	999.0
201612	1684	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That roughly matches the pace of tightening over 2016 that markets expected at the time of last December’s meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1685	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Then, as now, expectations are for a gradual pace of tightening over the coming year—two rate hikes—compared with expectations for eight hikes over the year following the initial increase in the funds rate in June 2004.	21.0	999.0
201612	1686	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels offer some perspective on how market participants’ views about potential outcomes for the federal funds rate over the next two years have changed since the time of your November meeting.	21.0	999.0
201612	1687	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As is the case for the responses from the Desk surveys that Simon discussed earlier, the market-based probability distribution for the level of the funds rate at the end of 2017 has shifted to the right.	21.0	999.0
201612	1688	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The red line in the middle-right panel indicates that uncertainty about the level of the federal funds rate further out has increased, suggesting that investors’ views about outcomes for the economy—likely including, but not limited to, fiscal policy outcomes—have become more diffuse.	21.0	999.0
201612	1689	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The responses to the Desk surveys also indicated that market participants’ views about the outlook for fiscal policy cover a wide range of possibilities, and we have only a rough idea of what assumptions about fiscal policy and possibly other policies underlie recent movements in asset prices.	21.0	999.0
201612	1690	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Notwithstanding how speculative any assumption about the fiscal outlook has to be at this point, it is instructive to try to gauge the possible monetary policy implications of the greater fiscal stimulus assumed in the staff baseline projection.	21.0	999.0
201612	1691	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	An alternative scenario in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of Tealbook A provided one perspective on this question.	21.0	999.0
201612	1692	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-left panel looks at the same question through the lens of the optimal control exercises that we presented in Tealbook B.	21.0	999.0
201612	1693	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	There, we showed a range of exercises reflecting monetary policy responses to fiscal scenarios under different policymaker strategies.	21.0	999.0
201612	1694	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In this panel, the solid line plots the path of the federal funds rate under optimal control using the staff baseline assumptions about fiscal policy and a loss function in which policymakers place equal weights on keeping inflation close to 2 percent, keeping the unemployment rate close to the staff’s estimate of the natural rate, and minimizing changes in the funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1695	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This policy calls for a somewhat faster pace of tightening than the staff’s baseline assumption.	21.0	999.0
201612	1696	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	For comparison, the dashed green line plots the optimal control simulation of the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario, which essentially tracks the optimal control simulation using the October staff projection as the baseline.	21.0	999.0
201612	1697	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The distance between the two lines shows the additional tightening that would have the effect of keeping the unemployment rate and inflation on roughly the same paths that we showed in the October baseline forecast.	21.0	999.0
201612	1698	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The federal funds rate in the optimal control simulation using the current staff projection as the baseline is 2½ percent at the end of 2017—36 basis points above the rate in the optimal control simulation based on the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario.	21.0	999.0
201612	1699	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	By 2020, when the funds rate peaks at 5¼ percent, it is about 1 percentage point above the “No Fiscal Stimulus” scenario.	21.0	999.0
201612	1700	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-right panel summarizes a number of important caveats associated with this analysis.	21.0	999.0
201612	1701	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	First, the prescriptions from optimal control are quite sensitive to the timing and other details of any fiscal package; the baseline assumptions are, no doubt, just one of a range of possibilities.	21.0	999.0
201612	1702	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, as we show in Tealbook B, the federal funds rate path depends importantly on which loss function is assumed.	21.0	999.0
201612	1703	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Another consideration is whether financial conditions will respond to fiscal policy changes as assumed in FRB/US.	21.0	999.0
201612	1704	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We can’t be sure what revisions to the economic outlook underlie the adjustments in yields and asset prices since the election.	21.0	999.0
201612	1705	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As the staff noted in the memo to the Committee on the “Market Reactions to the US Election Outcome,” some of the financial market responses seem to be broadly consistent with what we would have expected, in view of the changes to fiscal policy assumed in the staff projection, while others are more difficult to square.	21.0	999.0
201612	1706	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, the optimal control simulations omit risk-management considerations near the effective lower bound, on the one hand, and potential risks associated with a possible nonlinear response to a substantial undershooting of the unemployment rate on the other.	21.0	999.0
201612	1707	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The broader message seems to be that there is heightened uncertainty about the outlook for the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201612	1708	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	In these circumstances, the absence of revisions to paragraphs 2 and 4 in alternative B will likely be understood as the Committee sensibly withholding judgment on how the outlook for monetary policy may be affected.	21.0	999.0
201612	1709	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201612	1710	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201612	1711	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The November statement and the draft alternatives and implementation notes are on pages 2 to 12 of the handout.	21.0	999.0
201612	1712	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201612	1713	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201612	1714	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201612	1715	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at panel 2 here.	22.0	94.0
201612	1716	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’m trying to understand the graph.	22.0	94.0
201612	1717	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This looks like there would be a surprise due to our announcement tomorrow because this suggests that there would be three rate increases, is that right?	22.0	94.0
201612	1718	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Am I reading this correctly?	22.0	94.0
201612	1719	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The first thing I would note is that these are based on—I’ll give the technical term—“risk-neutral probabilities,” that is, there is no term premium adjustment.	22.0	999.0
201612	1720	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So the levels are little hard to interpret.	22.0	999.0
201612	1721	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The point I tried to make is that the expectations obtained using this measure seem to be in a place similar to where they were a year ago.	22.0	999.0
201612	1722	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Well, your comment was that in 2004, at the time of the tightening, they expected 200 basis points, eight moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1723	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, if you take this exactly.	22.0	999.0
201612	1724	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And now they’re expecting 50 basis points, two moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1725	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	According to this metric.	22.0	999.0
201612	1726	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And the SEP says three moves.	22.0	94.0
201612	1727	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201612	1728	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	They haven’t seen the December SEP.	22.0	108.0
201612	1729	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	But, President Bullard, you’re saying it will be a surprise.	22.0	65.0
201612	1730	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It would be a surprise.	22.0	94.0
201612	1731	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what I’m saying.	22.0	94.0
201612	1732	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Last year we showed four, and it stayed at 50, though.	22.0	96.0
201612	1733	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So it wasn’t like they moved.	22.0	96.0
201612	1734	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	And they were surprised; they came down.	22.0	91.0
201612	1735	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I’d like to reemphasize the difficulty about term premiums.	22.0	999.0
201612	1736	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We are looking here at term premiums at the one-year-ahead horizon, basically.	22.0	999.0
201612	1737	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	I think in 2004 we would have probably said these would be small and positive.	22.0	999.0
201612	1738	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	At this point, there is a great deal of uncertainty on this.	22.0	999.0
201612	1739	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, both term structure models and surveys indicate that actually there are negative term premiums, even at short horizons.	22.0	999.0
201612	1740	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	That would mean that if you corrected for that, as I do in the upper-left panel, if you take those estimates at face value, you really would think that what you read here as 50 basis points might well be 75 or more.	22.0	999.0
201612	1741	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So I’d be cautious in interpreting the level as meaning that their expectation is too high.	22.0	999.0
201612	1742	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201612	1743	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I have one other question on the bottom-left panel, “Federal Funds Rate Paths under Optimal Control.”	22.0	94.0
201612	1744	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The black line never goes below the green dotted line.	22.0	94.0
201612	1745	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	If I simulate this out 10 or 15 years, do they eventually cross, so that the effect is eventually neutral?	22.0	94.0
201612	1746	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Or is this just a permanent effect coming from fiscal policy?	22.0	94.0
201612	1747	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Eventually, they would converge.	22.0	999.0
201612	1748	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	They would not reverse the order, so the integral under the black line will be larger than the integral under the green dotted line.	22.0	999.0
201612	1749	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I noted that it takes quite a while.	22.0	94.0
201612	1750	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	True.	22.0	999.0
201612	1751	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This is, again, the FRB/US model, with slow-moving dynamics and a lot of foresight built in.	22.0	999.0
201612	1752	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201612	1753	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22.0	65.0
201612	1754	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thomas, do you calculate what r* is at each point along these paths?	22.0	108.0
201612	1755	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Along which paths?	22.0	999.0
201612	1756	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Let’s look at the bottom left, at the fifth panel.	22.0	108.0
201612	1757	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	We can always take two paths and compute the difference in the real federal funds rate that would keep the output gap closed at a point in time.	22.0	999.0
201612	1758	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, in Tealbook B, we reported this time around that, by that metric, r* has been revised up about 30 basis points from last time.	22.0	999.0
201612	1759	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In this chart?	22.0	108.0
201612	1760	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	This here is a little different because here we are applying optimal control to two different baselines.	22.0	999.0
201612	1761	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	But basically the calculation is very similar, yes.	22.0	999.0
201612	1762	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Along these paths, are we at 2 percent inflation?	22.0	108.0
201612	1763	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The deviation of inflation from baseline under any of these paths is very small—which means that inflation converges to 2 percent in a very similar way to how it does in the baseline.	22.0	999.0
201612	1764	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And we’re at full employment?	22.0	108.0
201612	1765	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Optimal control, as you know, with the equal weights loss function basically allows for much less undershooting of the unemployment rate than the baseline does.	22.0	999.0
201612	1766	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	So that’s what we show in Tealbook B—the standard loss function.	22.0	999.0
201612	1767	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	The reason why these paths are higher than in the Tealbook baseline is that optimal control is, if you want, fighting the unemployment undershooting much more strongly.	22.0	999.0
201612	1768	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	22.0	108.0
201612	1769	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	22.0	108.0
201612	1771	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	52.0	65.0
201612	1772	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201612	1773	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we adjourn and resume our deliberations at 9:00 am December 14 Session .	52.0	65.0
201612	1774	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201612	1775	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Before we start our go-round, I’d first like to call on Thomas to follow up on a point from yesterday.	12.0	65.0
201612	1776	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	999.0
201612	1777	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	President Lacker asked yesterday about the consistency between the staff’s estimate of the unrealized gain position in the SOMA portfolio at the end of November, which was reported on page 57 of Tealbook B as $121 billion, and the data Simon showed in panel 14 of his handout.	12.0	999.0
201612	1778	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	As mentioned in Tealbook B, the number reported there was a preliminary estimate.	12.0	999.0
201612	1779	2016-12-14	meeting	LAUBACH	And, in the period since the Tealbook closed, we have received new data that show that the unrealized gain position at the end of November was $81 billion—$40 billion lower than the preliminary estimate recorded in Tealbook B.	12.0	999.0
201612	1780	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Great.	12.0	81.0
201612	1781	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thanks, I appreciate that.	12.0	81.0
201612	1782	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Let me next call on David Wilcox to discuss data.	11.0	65.0
201612	1783	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201612	1784	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	First, I’d like to call to your attention briefly the sheet of additional labor market statistics that are in front of you.	11.0	999.0
201612	1785	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	Last night, President Kashkari usefully called to my own attention the fact that, through a series of inadvertent circumstances, we hadn’t provided information on a demographic breakdown until now.	11.0	999.0
201612	1786	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to unemployment rates by race or ethnicity, it’s interesting to note that the unemployment rates for blacks, Hispanics, and whites are all back, essentially, where they were in the fourth quarter of 2007.	11.0	999.0
201612	1787	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	However, in level terms, of course, there remain wide differences in unemployment rates across these groups.	11.0	999.0
201612	1788	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to this morning’s retail sales release, our preliminary assessment is that the news is just a little softer than we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201612	1789	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	The portion of retail sales that the BEA uses for estimating real PCE increased 0.2 percent in November, which was one-tenth less than we had expected, and there was a downward revision of one-tenth to this category of sales in October.	11.0	999.0
201612	1790	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	All told, though, this is a small forecast error.	11.0	999.0
201612	1791	2016-12-14	meeting	WILCOX	And, relative to our expectation, we would take about one-tenth off our estimate of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, leaving our estimate of fourth-quarter GDP growth at about 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201612	1792	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201612	1793	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201612	1794	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201612	1795	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Then why don’t we begin our go-round on policy, starting with President Rosengren?	23.0	65.0
201612	1796	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201612	1797	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201612	1798	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	The market fully expects an increase at this meeting, and our statement at the November meeting set the stage for an increase.	23.0	90.0
201612	1799	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Failure to proceed to take action at this meeting would seriously undermine our efforts to communicate clearly our intentions and the rationale for policy action.	23.0	90.0
201612	1800	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I noted yesterday, my SEP submission has four increases in the federal funds rate in 2017, giving a pattern quite similar to the Tealbook’s federal funds rate path for next year.	23.0	90.0
201612	1801	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the unemployment rate falling well below my estimate of full employment and inflation only somewhat below our 2 percent target, we should be indicating that the baseline case for monetary policy will be for normalizing at a gradual but more regular pace.	23.0	90.0
201612	1802	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	At this time, my preferred path would involve tightening at every other meeting.	23.0	90.0
201612	1803	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Indeed, while fiscal stimulus would have been much preferred earlier in the cycle, positive fiscal surprises will likely require us to normalize monetary policy even more quickly.	23.0	90.0
201612	1804	2016-12-14	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201612	1805	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1806	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201612	1807	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201612	1808	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	102.0
201612	1809	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I noted yesterday, it seems likely that greater fiscal stimulus will boost aggregate demand and inflation toward the end of next year and beyond.	23.0	102.0
201612	1810	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there remains a great deal of uncertainty about the size, the composition and timing, and the effects of fiscal stimulus.	23.0	102.0
201612	1811	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, there are potential changes for trade, immigration, and regulatory policies.	23.0	102.0
201612	1812	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	But all of that can be set aside.	23.0	102.0
201612	1813	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Today’s decision stands on its own.	23.0	102.0
201612	1814	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the basis of past progress on our goals and the intermeeting data, there’s already compelling evidence in hand to support this move.	23.0	102.0
201612	1815	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve reached full employment with continued solid momentum, and we’re poised to run a hot labor market for the next couple of years at least.	23.0	102.0
201612	1816	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation has also picked up and is closing in on our target.	23.0	102.0
201612	1817	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Against this background, the rate increase in alternative B is an appropriate small step in the process of removing monetary accommodation.	23.0	102.0
201612	1818	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In light of the uncertainty about future fiscal and other policy actions by the next Congress and the incoming Administration, we should stand pat for the time being in terms of the forward-guidance language in paragraph 4.	23.0	102.0
201612	1819	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	If fiscal policy ends up being appreciably more expansionary, at future meetings, we may need to modify the “only gradual” phrase describing the likely pace of rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201612	1820	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, I found the proposed language in alternative C replacing “only gradual” with “additional gradual” unsatisfactory and potentially confusing, especially since “additional” may sound like a continuation of our practice of one rate hike per year.	23.0	102.0
201612	1821	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	This discussion of how best to modify the language can wait until we have greater clarity on fiscal and other policies next year.	23.0	102.0
201612	1822	2016-12-14	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201612	1823	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1824	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201612	1825	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201612	1826	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I support an increase in the funds rate target and alternative B.	23.0	81.0
201612	1827	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I expect that’ll be the consensus view, so I’m going to talk about the future path of policy.	23.0	81.0
201612	1828	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The current draft of alternative B continues to predict only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.	23.0	81.0
201612	1829	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think there are now good reasons to question whether we should continue to have as much confidence that rate increases will be gradual.	23.0	81.0
201612	1830	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	For some time now, I’ve argued that we should pay heed to the fact that our policy benchmarks are so far above the current level of the funds rate target.	23.0	81.0
201612	1831	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I applaud inclusion of the Taylor rule prescriptions in the handout yesterday and hope we can include Taylor rule calculations, such as appear in the Tealbook, in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress next time we draft that.	23.0	81.0
201612	1832	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those benchmarks continue to rise, and increasing the funds rate target at a pace as gradual as two or three quarter points a year is unlikely to close the gap at a satisfactory rate, in my view.	23.0	81.0
201612	1833	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s little doubt we’re at full employment, and, as a result, I think it’s increasingly important for us to pick up the pace of tightening.	23.0	81.0
201612	1834	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This argument is reinforced by the memo on unemployment-rate undershooting.	23.0	81.0
201612	1835	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	As I noted yesterday, in the only domestic episode featuring a soft landing, the FOMC raised the funds rate 300 basis points.	23.0	81.0
201612	1836	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The four previous undershoots in the historical record resulted in inflation increasing, sometimes quite sharply.	23.0	81.0
201612	1837	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s noteworthy that the 1994 episode has been identified as the first instance of preemptive rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201612	1838	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Another factor establishing our credibility in 1994, arguably, was that the new Administration at the time chose to respect the Fed’s monetary policy independence.	23.0	81.0
201612	1839	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	This was something of a break from the practice of previous Administrations, going back to Lyndon Johnson’s in 1965, of being willing to exert pressure on the Federal Reserve to adopt more stimulative policies.	23.0	81.0
201612	1840	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	I thought Vice Chairman Dudley was right yesterday to point out that our risks are likely to involve compromises to our credibility, and that we’re not really modeling those in a coherent way.	23.0	81.0
201612	1841	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Those are outside our usual modeling practice.	23.0	81.0
201612	1842	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	An Administration that’s willing to discard the 25-year-old precedent of White House respect for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy independence strikes me as capable of contributing to a loss of credibility.	23.0	81.0
201612	1843	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The abrupt shift in circumstances since our November meeting suggests skepticism about gradualism as well.	23.0	81.0
201612	1844	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	While the details of fiscal policy are obviously pretty uncertain, the indications are that fiscal policy will be, if anything, more expansionary, perhaps significantly more than we expected at the November meeting.	23.0	81.0
201612	1845	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There’s no question that greater fiscal stimulus implies higher real interest rates.	23.0	81.0
201612	1846	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	There was some discussion of that yesterday.	23.0	81.0
201612	1847	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, in the Tealbook, the staff has marked up its assumed path of r*.	23.0	81.0
201612	1848	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And if the fiscal policy outlook leads to expected higher real interest rates, which I think are clearly warranted, then our estimates of r* should increase.	23.0	81.0
201612	1849	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	That implies we’ll have an even larger policy gap to close over time, so we will need to move even more rapidly.	23.0	81.0
201612	1850	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	The post-election movement in market readings on future inflation also argues for less gradual rate increases.	23.0	81.0
201612	1851	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Of course, these market reactions aren’t independent of anticipated fiscal policy.	23.0	81.0
201612	1852	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	But our expectation that rate increases would be only gradual was grounded in part on low readings on inflation and inflation expectations and the sense that the downside risks were elevated.	23.0	81.0
201612	1853	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Inflation has moved up over the course of the year, and, since the election, there’s been a significant increase in financial market measures of expected inflation.	23.0	81.0
201612	1854	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	As I noted yesterday, evidence from options and term premiums indicates that investors believe the downside risks to inflation are diminishing and the risks to the upside are becoming more salient.	23.0	81.0
201612	1855	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	It’s as if the inflation outlook is in the process of “coming about,” to use a nautical term.	23.0	81.0
201612	1856	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	So I think a strong case can be made that we may soon need increases in our policy rate that do not qualify as gradual.	23.0	81.0
201612	1857	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	And, if so, I support President Williams’s suggestion that we start thinking about how to back away from the “gradual” language in our statement.	23.0	81.0
201612	1858	2016-12-14	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201612	1859	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1860	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201612	1861	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201612	1862	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I favor alternative B.	23.0	97.0
201612	1863	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As I tried to explain yesterday, my views on labor markets have evolved over the past several months because of what I’ve seen happening in labor markets.	23.0	97.0
201612	1864	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think a number of metrics assessed individually— and, certainly, labor market conditions as a whole—suggest that we’re fairly far along in the process of removing slack.	23.0	97.0
201612	1865	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think some slack probably does remain in the labor market, but, even after today’s rate increase, we will still have an accommodative monetary policy, which I think will appropriately continue to support further increases in jobs and wages.	23.0	97.0
201612	1866	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I’m a little less certain about the inflation target.	23.0	97.0
201612	1867	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	My SEP actually doesn’t get to 2 percent during the course of the next four years.	23.0	97.0
201612	1868	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But, as I indicated yesterday, conditional on that projection, I think the risks are on the upside.	23.0	97.0
201612	1869	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	So I should say that I’m not today going along reluctantly.	23.0	97.0
201612	1870	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I actually am convinced that this is the right policy move.	23.0	97.0
201612	1871	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	As we go forward, I think that, for now, a continued posture of gradualism is the right position for us to take.	23.0	97.0
201612	1872	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Continuing considerations include the fact that we are still relatively close to the effective lower bound.	23.0	97.0
201612	1873	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, as many of us have been saying for some time now, the resulting asymmetry in the tools available to us pushes me a little bit, at least, toward being cautious about rate increases, because anything that would increase the likelihood of a recession seems to me to present more problems.	23.0	97.0
201612	1874	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	On external risks, I think President Williams said yesterday that there are some upside risks internationally, with a prospect of somewhat better economic growth in some countries.	23.0	97.0
201612	1875	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	But those will be pretty incremental upside risks, if they are realized.	23.0	97.0
201612	1876	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I think the downside risks that are out there would be risks of something substantially more negative—whether it be European banking problems, which produce stress in financial markets around the world; China facing significant problems because of its debt overhang; or any number of geopolitical circumstances that could go negative over the course of the next year or so.	23.0	97.0
201612	1877	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Those seem to me to pose negative risks of a magnitude that is substantially greater than the nontrivial likelihood of some upside surprises on underlying economic growth trends.	23.0	97.0
201612	1878	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, as Governor Fischer and others explained in some detail yesterday, the uncertainty on what will happen—not just with fiscal policy, but also with the policies of the incoming Administration and the Congress more generally—seems to me to counsel some patience before we decide that there’s going to be fiscal stimulus and therefore, in an anticipatory fashion, a need to act on it.	23.0	97.0
201612	1879	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the memo by Aaronson and others, I’ll just say again that I think a fair reading of that memo suggests only two strong conclusions: first, it depends a lot on underlying circumstances; and, second, it depends a lot on the luck of the external shock, if I can put it that way.	23.0	97.0
201612	1880	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And I would have loved to have drawn the conclusions that I was leaning toward 6, 8, and 10 months ago.	23.0	97.0
201612	1881	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it fairly supports that.	23.0	97.0
201612	1882	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it supports conclusions in the other direction, either—that the risks of overshooting are high, and that we have to move in a very strong preemptive fashion.	23.0	97.0
201612	1883	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Having said all of that, I do think the decisions we’ll have before us could get more difficult fairly quickly.	23.0	97.0
201612	1884	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	While the lower-bound and external risk considerations may remain, we may see a continued tightening of labor markets and may see some pickup in inflation, which just, in the internal considerations of the economy as we’re currently observing it, might counsel further rate increases.	23.0	97.0
201612	1885	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	And, obviously, if we see some clarification of policy directions that would suggest further stimulus, I do think the effort to balance those two sets of considerations will, for me at least, become more difficult and might—and I underline “might”—require at some point the change in the language that President Williams was referring to.	23.0	97.0
201612	1886	2016-12-14	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201612	1887	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1888	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201612	1889	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201612	1890	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B.	23.0	103.0
201612	1891	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The unemployment rate will likely reach the Committee’s estimate of its longer-run level this quarter, and core PCE inflation has moved up.	23.0	103.0
201612	1892	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	With tightening labor market conditions and rising inflation, achieving a sustainable pace of employment growth and stable prices requires gradually raising the federal funds rate.	23.0	103.0
201612	1893	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Soft landings are uncommon.	23.0	103.0
201612	1894	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In the few successful examples noted by the Board staff’s analysis, monetary policy acted preemptively, beginning to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below the natural level.	23.0	103.0
201612	1895	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Today the unemployment rate has already reached most estimates of the natural rate, with a negative real federal funds rate and extremely gradual moves to normalize monetary policy.	23.0	103.0
201612	1896	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	As we look to our policy choices next year, the risk that a more expansionary fiscal policy could necessitate a faster-than-expected pace of policy tightening warrants consideration in two ways, I think.	23.0	103.0
201612	1897	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	First, thinking about the March SEP, I wonder if we should consider adopting a common assumption for fiscal policy.	23.0	103.0
201612	1898	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	This could help the public interpret the projections and could make it easier to explain changes in the SEP at the press conference.	23.0	103.0
201612	1899	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Along these lines, adding some measure of uncertainty, as the subcommittee on communications discussed in its recent memo, might also be helpful.	23.0	103.0
201612	1900	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Second, we might have to reframe our strategies regarding the balance sheet.	23.0	103.0
201612	1901	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Under current fiscal policy, we project a gradual path of the federal funds rate and have associated it with a large balance sheet.	23.0	103.0
201612	1902	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	However, a higher path would bring forward the time when policy normalization is well under way.	23.0	103.0
201612	1903	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	To better manage expectations, the Committee might clarify what “well under way” means.	23.0	103.0
201612	1904	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	In my view, we will be well under way when the target range of the funds rate reaches between 1 and 1¼ percent.	23.0	103.0
201612	1905	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	The views of other participants could be captured by including a question in the next SEP about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate to cease reinvestments.	23.0	103.0
201612	1906	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	This would be similar to the previous special question about the date at which participants judged that an increase in the funds rate would first become appropriate.	23.0	103.0
201612	1907	2016-12-14	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201612	1908	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1909	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201612	1910	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1911	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting my view that there remains, essentially, no slack in the labor market and the observation that inflation continues to move closer to target, I am very supportive of alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201612	1912	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Financial markets are expecting an increase in rates and have essentially priced in a removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	999.0
201612	1913	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the forward-guidance language, I worry that markets have come to interpret “gradual” as meaning one or perhaps two rate hikes per year.	23.0	999.0
201612	1914	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	A look at the federal funds futures market lends some credence to my concern, and I think it would be useful to start contemplating a different characterization of future policy, as others have said.	23.0	999.0
201612	1915	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	In light of the overall weakness of trend growth that I alluded to yesterday, as well as the increased economic uncertainty, I am in favor of removing accommodation quite gradually.	23.0	999.0
201612	1916	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	But I am worried that our language may suggest that this means fewer rate hikes than many of us view as appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1917	2016-12-14	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1918	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1919	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201612	1920	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201612	1921	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201612	1922	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I think a 25 basis point move today is appropriate in light of the continued gains in labor markets, the modest improvement in the inflation outlook, and our communications that virtually promised a rate increase this year unless there was a clear softening in economic activity.	23.0	91.0
201612	1923	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I also believe it best that we continue to communicate our view that conditions are likely to evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the funds rate.	23.0	91.0
201612	1924	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Paragraph 4, as written, still works for me.	23.0	91.0
201612	1925	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Although I believe the odds of returning to the effective lower bound have diminished somewhat, these risks are still notable and likely to remain so for some time.	23.0	91.0
201612	1926	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	So the zero-lower- bound risk management still argues for a shallow policy rate path and instilling strong confidence that the FOMC will live up to our symmetric inflation objective.	23.0	91.0
201612	1927	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned yesterday, my current appropriate policy rate path has two 25 basis point increases in 2017.	23.0	91.0
201612	1928	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	I hope, as we move through next year, that private-sector fundamentals will remain sound and we will have a better idea about the fiscal policy picture.	23.0	91.0
201612	1929	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	And, down the road, we could see changes in the outlook that would dictate a steeper path of rates that I would readily support, but that’s for future meetings.	23.0	91.0
201612	1930	2016-12-14	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201612	1931	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1932	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201612	1933	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1934	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It’s December, and it’s an FOMC meeting.	23.0	999.0
201612	1935	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Am I the only one who has a sense of déjà vu around the table?	23.0	999.0
201612	1936	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	23.0	999.0
201612	1937	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In light of the progress made toward our goals and the medium-run outlook as well as the risks associated with the outlook, I support a 25 basis point increase of the federal funds rate target at this meeting, and I believe economic developments make a compelling case for this change even apart from a higher likelihood of some fiscal policy stimulus to come.	23.0	999.0
201612	1938	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I can support alternative B as written.	23.0	999.0
201612	1939	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At this point, it seems sensible to make few changes in the statement.	23.0	999.0
201612	1940	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, on that score, I’d make one suggestion.	23.0	999.0
201612	1941	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In the penultimate line in paragraph 1, why not just add the word “considerably” rather than also changing “but remain low” to “but still are low”?	23.0	999.0
201612	1942	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So that part of the sentence would read “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but remain low.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1943	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 3, I am interpreting the change from “further improvement” to “further strengthening” as a change from a normative locution to a positive one.	23.0	999.0
201612	1944	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	That makes sense at this point, with the unemployment rate near, or even below, many estimates of the full-employment rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1945	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This language acknowledges that if the labor market gets too overheated, this shouldn’t be interpreted as an improvement.	23.0	999.0
201612	1946	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	But I do think this change is pretty subtle, so I’m not sure how it’ll be interpreted.	23.0	999.0
201612	1947	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As I said, I understand the argument for making few changes in the statement today, but I do think there are looming policy and communications challenges we’ll need to confront sooner rather than later.	23.0	999.0
201612	1948	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Like some others, I think we do need to find a way to step back from the “gradual path” language.	23.0	999.0
201612	1949	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	As I recall, the language was introduced to signal that, when normalization started, we didn’t anticipate raising rates at each and every meeting, as we did from mid-2004 to mid-2006.	23.0	999.0
201612	1950	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	That’s still true, but I don’t think “gradual” is necessarily being interpreted in the same way anymore.	23.0	999.0
201612	1951	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the issue has been that the market has been anticipating a much shallower path of policy than we are.	23.0	999.0
201612	1952	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	If the public’s new interpretation of “gradual” is one hike per year, as we did for the past two years, then the path we anticipate is no longer gradual.	23.0	999.0
201612	1953	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, there are a number of risks that, if realized, might entail a different policy rate path from that we currently anticipate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1954	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I suspect that over the next two years, we may need to change our forecasts and our anticipated policy rate path more frequently than we’ve done in the past couple of years.	23.0	999.0
201612	1955	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	For one thing, some clarity concerning fiscal and other economic policies will likely be forthcoming.	23.0	999.0
201612	1956	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We will need to incorporate that information into our outlook for the medium run.	23.0	999.0
201612	1957	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We’ll also need to assess what, if any, effect these policy changes might have on longer-run structural aspects of the economy, including productivity growth and the equilibrium interest rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1958	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Like others, I found the Board staff’s memo on soft landings quite interesting.	23.0	999.0
201612	1959	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	They were able to find a couple of examples, but the common characteristics were, one, that monetary policy was preemptive and began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below real-time estimates of the natural rate; and, two, that the shocks that hit the economy once it slowed were either small or beneficial.	23.0	999.0
201612	1960	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate is now below most estimates of the natural rate.	23.0	999.0
201612	1961	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So, arguably, it is difficult to characterize our current policy stance as necessarily preemptive, and I don’t think we can or should count on positive shocks.	23.0	999.0
201612	1962	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This suggests we need to remain vigilant against falling “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1963	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We may need to be less inertial than we’ve been.	23.0	999.0
201612	1964	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	We need to be open to 50 basis point increases if necessary and to ending reinvestments sooner than currently anticipated.	23.0	999.0
201612	1965	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, there are downside risks, too, including the prospect that financial market participants’ expectations could swiftly shift if they’re disappointed by the set of policies coming from the Administration and the Congress, as well as the possibility of increased geopolitical tensions.	23.0	999.0
201612	1966	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	The aim is not to offset fiscal policy.	23.0	999.0
201612	1967	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Instead, the aim is to position monetary policy to achieve our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1968	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This necessarily means taking into account how the economic environment, including fiscal policy, is changing to the extent that those changes affect our ability to achieve our goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1969	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	For us, it seems important to me that we continue to de-emphasize discussion of short-run fluctuations in our communications and emphasize that our policy choices are driven by our assessment of what policy is appropriate to achieve our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	999.0
201612	1970	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	If I’m right that our anticipated policy rate path may need to change more often, then we face a challenge in communicating that these changes are being driven by a systematic assessment of progress relative to our goals and not because we are reacting to short-run fluctuations in the data and behaving in a discretionary manner without a framework, of which we are increasingly being accused.	23.0	999.0
201612	1971	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It’ll be helpful for us to continue to work toward clarifying the degree of uncertainty regarding our current assessment of the likely future path of policy, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the inevitable shocks that will hit the economy.	23.0	999.0
201612	1972	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Now, because I’ve stopped reading and watching the news [laughter]—that happened about a month ago—I have some time on my hands, so I’ve been reading a bit of Federal Reserve history.	23.0	999.0
201612	1973	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Let me continue by pointing out something that former Chairman Alan Greenspan once said about monetary policy:  “There is no alternative to basing actions on forecasts, at least implicitly.	23.0	999.0
201612	1974	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	It means that often we need to tighten or ease before the need for action is evident to the public at large, and that policy may have to reverse course from time to time as the underlying forces acting on the economy shift.	23.0	999.0
201612	1975	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	This process is not easy to get right at all times, and it is often difficult to convey to the American people, whose support is essential to our mission.”	23.0	999.0
201612	1976	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Greenspan made these remarks 20 years ago, almost to the day, and they strike me as just as relevant today as they were then.	23.0	999.0
201612	1977	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201612	1978	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	1979	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201612	1980	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201612	1981	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I believe that it’s appropriate for the Committee to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and I support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201612	1982	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Employment growth continues strong, unemployment is at or below the natural rate, and output is expanding moderately and above potential.	23.0	104.0
201612	1983	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Inflation is gradually increasing a little faster than forecast.	23.0	104.0
201612	1984	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Market-based measures of inflation expectations have moved up, and we haven’t been this close to our dual-mandate target since the mid-2000s and, before that, the mid- 1990s.	23.0	104.0
201612	1985	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I revised up my SEP path of the federal funds target slightly, with three increases next year instead of two.	23.0	104.0
201612	1986	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That seems to me to be justified by the strengthening of the unemployment gap and the performance of inflation.	23.0	104.0
201612	1987	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	The expectation of more accommodative fiscal policy should also support economic growth and ensure against weaker outcomes.	23.0	104.0
201612	1988	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	My SEP path is still a gradual one that accommodates an extended period of unemployment in the mid- and low 4s, a bit below current estimates of the natural rate—what I would call a warm labor market.	23.0	104.0
201612	1989	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	I see this as appropriate, and, in fact, I had hoped that we would get to this point.	23.0	104.0
201612	1990	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	But getting here now means that the risks are two sided.	23.0	104.0
201612	1991	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Depending on their size and other characteristics, fiscal easing measures could put further downward pressure on unemployment and upward pressure on inflation and economic growth.	23.0	104.0
201612	1992	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	We’ve also had extraordinary changes in asset prices and significant improvements in survey measures of business and household confidence, and it may well be that all of these factors come together to make a case for a faster pace of tightening and appropriate language changes in the statement.	23.0	104.0
201612	1993	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	That case is yet to be made, but it’s certainly plausible that it may be made.	23.0	104.0
201612	1994	2016-12-14	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201612	1995	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	1996	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201612	1997	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201612	1998	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy action in alternative B and the suggested statement with its minimal changes in guidance.	23.0	88.0
201612	1999	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In view of uncertainty about the timing of the next step, I think it would be a good idea not to provide much forward guidance at this stage.	23.0	88.0
201612	2000	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Lying low is, in my opinion, the right communications posture coming out of this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201612	2001	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	However, as I prefaced in my comments in the economics go-round, there could be communications dilemmas building.	23.0	88.0
201612	2002	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	At some point over the coming months, the Committee will likely have to consider alternative scenarios along the lines of the “Larger Fiscal Stimulus” scenarios presented in the Tealbook.	23.0	88.0
201612	2003	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	There are, of course, many “what-ifs” at this point, but, with a little more clarity, I’m thinking it would be a good idea to discuss and anticipate how the Committee might respond under various circumstances.	23.0	88.0
201612	2004	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	A steeper path of the policy rate, at least steeper than reflected in this meeting’s SEP, may be called for because of realized or projected fiscal policy effects.	23.0	88.0
201612	2005	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	There is a realistic chance a steeper path of the policy rate will be interpreted, perhaps appropriately, as offsetting fiscal policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2006	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Much could be made of this seemingly adversarial stance of policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2007	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	The Chair commented yesterday on how she plans to deal with questions in the press conference.	23.0	88.0
201612	2008	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	For my part, I think it would be wise to get ahead of this contingency and to make efforts to explain the FOMC’s and monetary policy’s relationship to fiscal policy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2009	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	In light of the difficulty that the Committee has experienced with crafting a statement that adequately captures the consensus thinking about future policy, this anticipatory communication probably would best be done in speeches and the Chair’s subsequent press conferences.	23.0	88.0
201612	2010	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	As I leave the Committee, I’d like to offer one more piece of free advice for your future assessments of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201612	2011	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems to me that a lesson of the recent electoral cycle and the outcome of the election is the public’s differential experiencing of the economy across geography, the urban–rural spectrum, and cohorts defined by educational attainment.	23.0	88.0
201612	2012	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	I applaud the addition of the content in the staff briefing for these meetings that shows employment and unemployment differences by ethnicity, as we got this morning.	23.0	88.0
201612	2013	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	It strikes me that this reporting can go further in order to ensure the Committee has a good grasp of the ground-level effects of its policies in several dimensions.	23.0	88.0
201612	2014	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	This is not to suggest that monetary policy can or should take on distributional questions—it’s just to suggest that knowing more about the texture of economic experience across the population would be constructive.	23.0	88.0
201612	2015	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201612	2016	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2017	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201612	2018	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201612	2019	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	When I started writing this, I was sure it would be two paragraphs, but, unfortunately, it turns out to be much more.	23.0	108.0
201612	2020	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I, too, support alternative B, which I think is the first time I’ve ever said that, because I assumed it was taken for granted each time in the past.	23.0	108.0
201612	2021	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Now, before I start, I’d also like to introduce an almost irrelevant footnote.	23.0	108.0
201612	2022	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Dan emphasized the fact that, when pushing a high-pressure economy succeeded, it was other things that happened that made for the success.	23.0	108.0
201612	2023	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a very famous book among development economists written by Albert Hirschman, who was asked to evaluate projects of the World Bank.	23.0	108.0
201612	2024	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	He was given 10 of their large projects—this was a long time ago—to evaluate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2025	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The result was that a little over half of them were successful.	23.0	108.0
201612	2026	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The other result was that almost none of them went according to plan, and the successes didn’t have much to do with the plan but had to do with the improvisation that happened in the course of the project when it started going off track.	23.0	108.0
201612	2027	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that tells us that you’ve got to be alive to changing circumstances.	23.0	108.0
201612	2028	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So the fact that things happened elsewhere could have led to success or, if they’d been ignored, would probably have led to failure.	23.0	108.0
201612	2029	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That, too, needs attention.	23.0	108.0
201612	2030	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll now turn to this topic.	23.0	108.0
201612	2031	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	If the incoming Administration changes economic policy in several areas as radically as promised during the election campaign, we will, in retrospect, view today’s interest rate decision as the last of an era.	23.0	108.0
201612	2032	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And, if so, we will have to develop an approach to making monetary policy in a setting of much greater nonmonetary policy uncertainty than we’ve had to deal with in recent years.	23.0	108.0
201612	2033	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The decision to raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points is appropriate for the current state of the economy and in light of policy decisions and statements we’ve made in the period leading up to this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201612	2034	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And yesterday’s discussion made a compelling case for implementing the decision that the markets and the public expect.	23.0	108.0
201612	2035	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The argument can be put very simply:  Both inflation and unemployment are very close to their dual-mandate targets.	23.0	108.0
201612	2036	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We may be somewhat overshooting, by which I mean undershooting the natural rate of unemployment, and we expect very gradually to reach our 2 percent PCE inflation target.	23.0	108.0
201612	2037	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Further, it was clear yesterday that most of us believe there is a serious risk we might overshoot both targets, and that the time has therefore come to raise the federal funds rate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2038	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s it with respect to this decision, but we need also to send signals about future FOMC policy.	23.0	108.0
201612	2039	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	At the certainty of repeating myself, the main message we need to send is that our monetary policy decisions will be made with the goal of achieving and maintaining the dual mandate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2040	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that’s easy to say, but it’s not sufficient guidance to spell out the path that we expect the federal funds rate to follow.	23.0	108.0
201612	2041	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Tealbook B gives us a rich choice among alternative policies, so let me highlight a few of the results shown in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook B and ask a few questions.	23.0	108.0
201612	2042	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	First, in terms of the charts on page 2 of Tealbook B, the staff projection shows large changes in interest rates by 2022.	23.0	108.0
201612	2043	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	These changes make much less difference to inflation in the next two years than they do over the longer period—that is, the Phillips curve is very flat.	23.0	108.0
201612	2044	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	There was an appeal yesterday for further work on whether the Phillips curve remains flat even as unemployment falls very low, and that is an important request.	23.0	108.0
201612	2045	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Second, the GDP gap seems quite sensitive to fiscal policy, which also means that the staff projection is very Keynesian.	23.0	108.0
201612	2046	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, that follows from the flat Phillips curve.	23.0	108.0
201612	2047	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The simple policy rule simulations on page 4 show that the different policy rules have a much greater effect on unemployment than they do on inflation, in accordance with the way a Keynesian model works.	23.0	108.0
201612	2048	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Third, we do not, in practice, follow the interest rate paths shown for five years out.	23.0	108.0
201612	2049	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Starting three months from now, we’ll have moved on to a new set of projections.	23.0	108.0
201612	2050	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That means we must be using the staff’s projections mainly for interest rates in the relatively near future.	23.0	108.0
201612	2051	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Or am I wrong, and do the projections five years out make much difference to what we do today?	23.0	108.0
201612	2052	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, I was struck by the box on page 2, which shows the projected medium-term equilibrium real federal funds rate.	23.0	108.0
201612	2053	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	In the second bullet point on page 3, the staff draws attention to the fact that, at 1.16 percent, FRB/US r* is well above the average level of the real federal funds rate in the 12 quarters of the projection that it takes to get the output gap to zero.	23.0	108.0
201612	2054	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	The average level of the real federal funds rate in the 12 quarters is 10 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201612	2055	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That’s quite a large difference, because there are certainly some interest rates on that path that are well below 10 basis points.	23.0	108.0
201612	2056	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	What is the significance of that—that we really aren’t planning on or should plan on moving the real funds rate around a lot more than we think we should?	23.0	108.0
201612	2057	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	A question.	23.0	108.0
201612	2058	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Fifth, the optimal control simulations show just how important are the relative weights we put on inflation and unemployment in the loss function, which leads to my final question for today.	23.0	108.0
201612	2059	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	If the alternative simulations are a basis for choosing policy rates, what should guide that choice?	23.0	108.0
201612	2060	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Is it how much we like the charts?	23.0	108.0
201612	2061	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Or, to put the question differently, do we compute the value of the utility function on each path we examine, which is fairly difficult because we change the utility function among some of the paths?	23.0	108.0
201612	2062	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But if we don’t compute the value of the utility function, why not?	23.0	108.0
201612	2063	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, what should we tell the markets and the public?	23.0	108.0
201612	2064	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Well, early this morning, I was thinking, “Gee, I wonder if I can reproduce what the Chair said yesterday.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2065	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And then the following thought struck me: “Well, there is e-mail, and the Chair reads her e-mail 24 hours a day [laughter], so I’ll send her a note.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2066	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And she agreed that I could quote her.	23.0	108.0
201612	2067	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	So I will conclude by quoting what the Chair said yesterday—with her permission, she says.	23.0	108.0
201612	2068	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201612	2069	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	It’s true.	23.0	65.0
201612	2070	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You have my permission.	23.0	65.0
201612	2071	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	She said, “I will... note that many proposals for taxes and spending are currently being discussed, but there is considerable uncertainty about what the Congress may eventually pass, and that we do not intend to act preemptively based on guesses about future policy....	23.0	108.0
201612	2072	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Moreover, I will stress that fiscal policy is just one of many factors that influence real activity and inflation and, thus, the course of monetary policy over time.	23.0	108.0
201612	2073	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Instead I hope we will stress that we intend to carry out the task that the Congress has assigned to us, the pursuit of maximum employment and price stability, and we’ll adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in response to all of the factors that affect the economic outlook.”	23.0	108.0
201612	2074	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201612	2075	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And thank you.	23.0	108.0
201612	2076	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2077	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, Governor Fischer, regarding the questions that you posed, did you want to have a response?	23.0	65.0
201612	2078	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	I think they’re questions we need to discuss at more length as we think through the policymaking process and what relationship there is between what’s in Tealbook B and what we actually decide.	23.0	108.0
201612	2079	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201612	2080	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201612	2081	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201612	2082	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201612	2083	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	110.0
201612	2084	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I continue to believe that removal of accommodation should be done gradually.	23.0	110.0
201612	2085	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I submitted three increases in the federal funds rate in my SEP submission for 2017.	23.0	110.0
201612	2086	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, I think the risk of undershooting our unemployment objective and overshooting our inflation goals has increased.	23.0	110.0
201612	2087	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	And if this materialized, it’s going to have implications for monetary policy in 2017, including not just the federal funds rate, but also decisions about how we manage our balance sheet.	23.0	110.0
201612	2088	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	As we head into 2017, I intend to be patient and careful not to prejudge what nonmonetary policies might be enacted, instead allowing these policies to unfold and assessing them as the process moves forward.	23.0	110.0
201612	2089	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I am struck by the breadth of the potential policy actions that could happen in the next year—changes to the Affordable Care Act; changes to taxes, both individual and corporate; changes to infrastructure spending policy; regulatory changes; changes in fiscal policy management decisions, including decisions involving potentially terming out Treasury maturities; and changes in trade policy, immigration policy, and foreign policy generally.	23.0	110.0
201612	2090	2016-12-14	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the ultimate mix and timing of these policy actions may lead to some unpredictable and surprising outcomes.	23.0	110.0
201612	2091	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2092	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201612	2093	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2094	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23.0	94.0
201612	2095	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think we met our goals in a statistical sense long ago.	23.0	94.0
201612	2096	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think our policy rate is only slightly below where it needs to be to be consistent with our policy goals.	23.0	94.0
201612	2097	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	There’s not much evidence so far that the recent election will alter the current regime, which is characterized by low productivity growth in the United States and low real rates on government paper globally, the so-called r†.	23.0	94.0
201612	2098	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Several people said they were disappointed in me yesterday because I didn’t mention r†, so I’ve sprinkled it throughout this commentary.	23.0	94.0
201612	2099	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	23.0	94.0
201612	2100	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The fact that we’re not really leaving a regime, at least so far, may mean that the policy rate should remain fairly low over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201612	2101	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	That continues to be our projection, based on the information we have today.	23.0	94.0
201612	2102	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	There has been some change since the election—in particular, a major equity rally.	23.0	94.0
201612	2103	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Many are interpreting that as reflecting expectations of faster economic growth.	23.0	94.0
201612	2104	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s the wrong interpretation.	23.0	94.0
201612	2105	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s reflecting expectations of lower corporate tax rates, which, all by themselves, would lead to revaluation of the US corporate sector.	23.0	94.0
201612	2106	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And if you look at projections of economic growth, a few people have marked them up, but most people have them still around 2 percent, which is what we have for the St Louis Federal Reserve forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2107	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, as of today, I don’t see the equity rally, so far, as reflecting changing fundamentals.	23.0	94.0
201612	2108	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	However, it is possible that a regime change is in the offing.	23.0	94.0
201612	2109	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The list of possible policy changes just rattled off by President Kaplan is astonishing, and it could mean a much different economy in the future.	23.0	94.0
201612	2110	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, obviously, I’ll be watching this very closely.	23.0	94.0
201612	2111	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	To get the regime change, we would need higher medium-term productivity growth.	23.0	94.0
201612	2112	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, as I was saying yesterday, a case could be made that some of the proposed fiscal policies will affect medium-term productivity growth:  possibly deregulation—you could make a case there; possibly tax changes—if they affect investment in the United States, that could change productivity; and possibly infrastructure programs.	23.0	94.0
201612	2113	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	All of these could have an effect.	23.0	94.0
201612	2114	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	All of these also could go the other way and be detrimental.	23.0	94.0
201612	2115	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we just don’t know at this point.	23.0	94.0
201612	2116	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I will say that I think the way a lot of people are talking about fiscal policy around the table is not the way I would think about it.	23.0	94.0
201612	2117	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Temporary increases in real GDP driven by higher government spending, which is backed by future taxes, would be insufficient to change a regime, in my view.	23.0	94.0
201612	2118	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	In a standard New Keynesian model, which often informs a lot of the thinking here, fiscal policy of that type would have no role to play at all.	23.0	94.0
201612	2119	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Those interested in my views on this could check out an essay I wrote a few years ago called “Death of a Theory.”	23.0	94.0
201612	2120	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Another way the regime could be altered would be if the very large liquidity premium on government paper globally was to lessen over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201612	2121	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So-called r† would rise then, and that would rationalize a higher policy rate for this Committee.	23.0	94.0
201612	2122	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, indeed, since the election, the 10-year yield has increased substantially.	23.0	94.0
201612	2123	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Some of this was inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2124	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As I explained yesterday, at the St Louis Bank we were already expecting or maybe hoping for a bounceback in market-based measures of inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2125	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So, seeing that actually happen was gratifying but didn’t change our outlook.	23.0	94.0
201612	2126	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	The rest of the increase in the 10-year has been in the real rate, and we did take some of this on board in our forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2127	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It’s not a regime change, but it is a somewhat higher real rate.	23.0	94.0
201612	2128	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we now have one policy-rate increase in 2017, on top of today’s increase.	23.0	94.0
201612	2129	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And, indeed, that’s the only increase for the forecast horizon as we sit here today, according to the St Louis Federal Reserve forecast.	23.0	94.0
201612	2130	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll make three further comments, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2131	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see today’s decision as likely to be interpreted as hawkish, because the dots are indicating three increases in 2017, whereas markets have that at two.	23.0	94.0
201612	2132	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see it as somewhat above current market expectations.	23.0	94.0
201612	2133	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I am concerned that markets get ahead of themselves and start to think that the Committee is more hawkish than it probably really is.	23.0	94.0
201612	2134	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer to stress that we will react to market circumstances and incoming data.	23.0	94.0
201612	2135	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	If we do raise rates faster, it will be because there’s good news coming in on the US economy and not just because we decided all of a sudden to raise rates faster.	23.0	94.0
201612	2136	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think in the period ahead that’s an important point to emphasize.	23.0	94.0
201612	2137	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I see allowing some minor runoff in the balance sheet as a policy move that we should consider in the near future.	23.0	94.0
201612	2138	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is obviously not reflected in my rate path projection, but this would be another way to make a mild tightening move without altering the policy rate path.	23.0	94.0
201612	2139	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	This is something that has been pushed to the back burner and should come back on the table.	23.0	94.0
201612	2140	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	As some of you remember, I was actually an advocate of allowing runoff of the balance sheet first and then raising the policy rate later.	23.0	94.0
201612	2141	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I now think that we should reconsider a policy move that would go in this direction.	23.0	94.0
201612	2142	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Another possibility would be to reallocate toward shorter-term securities when we reinvest and undo the twist operation that was done several years ago.	23.0	94.0
201612	2143	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s something that we could consider in the near future, possibly during 2017.	23.0	94.0
201612	2144	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, I prefer that we not use the rhetoric about running the economy hot.	23.0	94.0
201612	2145	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe it’s just a sense of how I think about macroeconomics, but, to me, it suggests departing from planned policy or departing from an existing policy rule.	23.0	94.0
201612	2146	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	It sounds discretionary.	23.0	94.0
201612	2147	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	I think we should emphasize that we’re reacting to real data that are coming in on the economy and that we’re setting the policy rate according to that.	23.0	94.0
201612	2148	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	And even if we don’t write a policy rule down, we have a policy rule in mind that might have many more factors in it than the typical policy rules that are studied in the research literature.	23.0	94.0
201612	2149	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	But once you have that rule in mind, you would not arbitrarily depart from that rule to try to achieve some outcome, because the reason you chose the rule in the first place is, you think that’s the optimal policy.	23.0	94.0
201612	2150	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that my preference would be to retire the rhetoric about running hot.	23.0	94.0
201612	2151	2016-12-14	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201612	2152	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2153	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201612	2154	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201612	2155	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The past few months have seen important progress toward our goals.	23.0	107.0
201612	2156	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to strengthen, and maximum employment is in sight.	23.0	107.0
201612	2157	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE prices has moved up noticeably over the past year, to 1.7 percent most recently, as the effects of past dollar appreciation and oil price declines have faded.	23.0	107.0
201612	2158	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Although further progress is needed if our 2 percent target is to remain credible following eight years of falling short, importantly, measures of inflation compensation have also improved of late.	23.0	107.0
201612	2159	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	These are all welcome signs that are consistent with a modest removal of policy accommodation.	23.0	107.0
201612	2160	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Even with a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate, monetary policy will remain accommodative.	23.0	107.0
201612	2161	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	This is appropriate because of how flat the Phillips curve has been and the fact that inflation is still below our target against a backdrop of persistent underperformance, as well as risk-management considerations in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.	23.0	107.0
201612	2162	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	While the neutral rate remains low, the ability of monetary policy to respond to shocks will be asymmetric.	23.0	107.0
201612	2163	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, we need to remain alert to downside risks, such as those I discussed yesterday arising from foreign economies.	23.0	107.0
201612	2164	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The persistent underperformance of inflation, the low neutral rate, the presence of downside risks associated with developments abroad, and risk-management considerations in the vicinity of the lower bound together counsel a gradual approach for the time being.	23.0	107.0
201612	2165	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the advent of unified government could herald a very significant shift in the policy mix.	23.0	107.0
201612	2166	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	While it’s premature to assess with any precision the size, composition, or duration of these fiscal policy changes, it seems prudent to put some probability on a moderate increase in fiscal deficits starting late next year.	23.0	107.0
201612	2167	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	At a minimum, it poses upside risks to aggregate demand and makes the overall risks more balanced.	23.0	107.0
201612	2168	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	The change in the fiscal policy outlook could have important implications for monetary policy, including for reinvestment policy.	23.0	107.0
201612	2169	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, the observed elevated sensitivity of the dollar to any anticipated divergence could reasonably lead us to expect the exchange rate to continue to do some of this work preemptively.	23.0	107.0
201612	2170	2016-12-14	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201612	2171	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2172	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201612	2173	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201612	2174	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201612	2175	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ve been highlighting three metrics that I’ve been focused on in looking at how the economy is unfolding: core PCE inflation, inflation expectations, and the headline unemployment rate.	23.0	111.0
201612	2176	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Since we last met, we’ve seen positive developments in two of those three—some upward movement in market-based inflation expectations and a decline in the headline unemployment rate, signaling a tightening labor market.	23.0	111.0
201612	2177	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In this context, I support raising the federal funds rate today.	23.0	111.0
201612	2178	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I will continue to monitor inflation, inflation expectations, and unemployment closely.	23.0	111.0
201612	2179	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In particular, I’m looking for evidence to see whether the labor force participation story of the past year or so has run its course or whether there’s more “room to run.”	23.0	111.0
201612	2180	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I also want to see the rise in inflation expectations translate into actual higher inflation, because, as Governor Brainard just noted, we are still below our inflation target, and we have a symmetric target, not a ceiling.	23.0	111.0
201612	2181	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	And the strengthening dollar, as the Governor said, is going to make achieving our inflation target a little bit harder.	23.0	111.0
201612	2182	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, as many of us have said, in the future, nonmonetary policy is unusually uncertain.	23.0	111.0
201612	2183	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Dramatic changes seem possible, but we don’t know how they’re going to affect the economy.	23.0	111.0
201612	2184	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	The biggest challenge we have, as I see it, is how we communicate about the future.	23.0	111.0
201612	2185	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have said, I think we should focus on our dual mandate and communicate a rationale that our policy choices are going to come back to achieving those objectives.	23.0	111.0
201612	2186	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	People may not find that very satisfying, because the truth is, we don’t know a lot about how the future is going to unfold.	23.0	111.0
201612	2187	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	But it is what it is.	23.0	111.0
201612	2188	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	We can’t promise something that we don’t have.	23.0	111.0
201612	2189	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	In the new year, we’re going to know a lot more, and that will inform our decisions.	23.0	111.0
201612	2190	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I want to add one comment.	23.0	111.0
201612	2191	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Several folks around the table made a comment about the word “gradual” and whether that word is what markets are anchoring their expectations to.	23.0	111.0
201612	2192	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see it that way, because the SEP has been much more hawkish over the past several years and markets have been basically ignoring that.	23.0	111.0
201612	2193	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I have a hard time seeing them ignoring the SEP but then anchoring to the word “gradual.”	23.0	111.0
201612	2194	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	I think markets are rendering their own judgments about the future path of policy and how they see the economy evolving.	23.0	111.0
201612	2195	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Language obviously matters, but I don’t think that one word, “gradual,” explains the markets’ outlook.	23.0	111.0
201612	2196	2016-12-14	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201612	2197	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201612	2198	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201612	2199	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23.0	96.0
201612	2200	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201612	2201	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	A few months ago, I thought that our first rate hike in a year might be an opportunity for a major “refresh” of the statement.	23.0	96.0
201612	2202	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But I changed my mind about that after the election, because of concerns that a major rewrite might be misconstrued as motivated by the election outcome or taken as a major shift in policy direction.	23.0	96.0
201612	2203	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t want the statement to be viewed in that way, so I think a statement with minimal changes, except for the decision to raise the federal funds rate target, seems appropriate to me.	23.0	96.0
201612	2204	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The major focus coming out of this meeting is going to be how the statement has changed in terms of language and how the SEP numbers have evolved since the September FOMC meeting.	23.0	96.0
201612	2205	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The minimal changes in the statement language should be reassuring to people that the election outcome has not yet provoked a radical rethink of the policy outlook.	23.0	96.0
201612	2206	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the SEP, I expect that market participants will be mainly focused on what happens to the median federal funds rate path.	23.0	96.0
201612	2207	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	The path did show two hikes in 2017 and three hikes in 2018 at the September meeting, and people are generally not expecting the path to move up very much at all at this point.	23.0	96.0
201612	2208	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the fact that the path has moved up slightly may be a slight surprise to people, but I think the movements are small enough that it’s not going to be a big event for market participants.	23.0	96.0
201612	2209	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Before I finish, I had a couple of further thoughts.	23.0	96.0
201612	2210	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to build on this issue of the reinvestment of our Treasury and agency MBS portfolio.	23.0	96.0
201612	2211	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	My thinking for some time has been that the timing of stopping or beginning to taper down our reinvestment should be motivated by the risk of an early return to the effective lower bound.	23.0	96.0
201612	2212	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	That implies that if we were to become more optimistic that that’s less likely, then we might decide to begin this process at a lower federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201612	2213	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, I had two variables in my timing function:  distance from the lower bound—the level of the federal funds rate—and the risk of a near-term economic downturn.	23.0	96.0
201612	2214	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So if we do get significant fiscal stimulus in the years ahead, in my mind, this would bring the reinvestment decision potentially much closer in terms of time, because we might lower the federal funds rate at which we felt comfortable beginning to end reinvestment.	23.0	96.0
201612	2215	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We might get to that given federal funds rate earlier in time.	23.0	96.0
201612	2216	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it really is time for the staff and the Committee to start to do the prep work on how we might actually end reinvestment.	23.0	96.0
201612	2217	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a lot of issues here—tapering versus stopping, how long a taper should be, how to treat MBS versus Treasury securities, et cetera.	23.0	96.0
201612	2218	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think I would very much encourage the staff to get going on this, because I can imagine that, under a feasible set of circumstances, we could be having this conversation maybe by the middle of next year.	23.0	96.0
201612	2219	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I also encourage the staff in this work to give us their views on, how do we match the equivalence of ending reinvestment or tapering reinvestment with federal funds rate changes— say, some sort of notion of equivalency?	23.0	96.0
201612	2220	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I know that’s going to be very difficult to do with any great precision, because it’s not just the decision to change the reinvestment path.	23.0	96.0
201612	2221	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s also the fact that this is viewed as another major regime shift, one similar to the regime shift that we made a year ago.	23.0	96.0
201612	2222	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But we still need to have a rough estimate so we can figure out how we should trade off these two things?	23.0	96.0
201612	2223	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, before I conclude, because we have plenty of time, I’ve been thinking a lot about the election outcome and what we should think about it.	23.0	96.0
201612	2224	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m very much in the camp of thinking that the generally free labor of goods and services in the global economy has been hugely beneficial to hundreds of millions of people, in lifting them out of poverty.	23.0	96.0
201612	2225	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But, at the same time, I think the election result shows that there are a lot of people in the United States that have been left behind by globalization.	23.0	96.0
201612	2226	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had weak productivity growth, so the pie is not growing very fast.	23.0	96.0
201612	2227	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had a decline in the labor share of income over the past 20 or 30 years.	23.0	96.0
201612	2228	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had an increase in the skew of income distribution, and we’ve had poor income mobility.	23.0	96.0
201612	2229	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	When you put those four things together, there are a lot of people who actually haven’t benefited from globalization.	23.0	96.0
201612	2230	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is important, because monetary policy can’t really do that much about this.	23.0	96.0
201612	2231	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	We can try to keep the economy at maximum sustainable employment and price stability, but we really fundamentally can’t do much about these things.	23.0	96.0
201612	2232	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think we need to talk about them a little bit more, because if the country doesn’t make progress in helping more people benefit from globalization, the support for globalization and for trade is going to fracture—maybe it already is starting to fracture—and, with that, we’ll lose a lot, I think, as a country and a society.	23.0	96.0
201612	2233	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s something that we collectively need to talk about.	23.0	96.0
201612	2234	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	In this vein, Raj Chetty and a whole bunch of other authors published a paper last week that I think is really interesting.	23.0	96.0
201612	2235	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Basically, what they did is, they looked at how the year of your birth affects your likelihood of earning more than your parents, based on the income decile of your parents.	23.0	96.0
201612	2236	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	What they found is that if you were born in 1940, your chances of doing better than your parents were really good.	23.0	96.0
201612	2237	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But as you move down the cohorts from 1940, ’50, ’60, ’70, and ’80, the chances of outdoing your parents decline markedly.	23.0	96.0
201612	2238	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	So, for example, if you were born in 1980, it looks like you’re not going to do as well as your parents if your parents were at 50 percent of the income distribution.	23.0	96.0
201612	2239	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I really encourage you to look at this paper.	23.0	96.0
201612	2240	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really very interesting empirical work, but it also underscores a little bit what we just saw in terms of the election outcome.	23.0	96.0
201612	2241	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I just want to bookend the Chair’s comments about our colleague President Lockhart, who’s stepping down.	23.0	96.0
201612	2242	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve been a terrific colleague on this Committee.	23.0	96.0
201612	2243	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It just shows that the diversity of this Committee benefits all of us—your background as a banker and your international experience.	23.0	96.0
201612	2244	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’ve shown great care and skill as a colleague.	23.0	96.0
201612	2245	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re a very collegial person to work with.	23.0	96.0
201612	2246	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to miss you, and I wish you all the best of luck in your new endeavors.	23.0	96.0
201612	2247	2016-12-14	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Bill.	23.0	88.0
201612	2248	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Could I raise a question?	23.0	108.0
201612	2249	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Bill, I think there’s an important question about whether it’s globalization or modernization that lies behind what’s happened to relative incomes.	23.0	108.0
201612	2250	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And I’m not sure that it’s globalization.	23.0	108.0
201612	2251	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are a lot of factors.	23.0	96.0
201612	2252	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m using that as a shorthand, so I don’t disagree that it’s more complicated than that.	23.0	96.0
201612	2253	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	But, clearly, the support for globalization in the United States is really in danger, and I guess that’s why I emphasize the globalization aspect of it.	23.0	96.0
201612	2254	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	And, second, what will be the effect of the signal that we are starting to roll off the portfolio, just by itself?	23.0	108.0
201612	2255	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	We know how much of an addition to the supply of assets that the market has to absorb.	23.0	108.0
201612	2256	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	But we’re also sending a signal, which is, we think the economy is strong enough to enable us to do this.	23.0	108.0
201612	2257	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	That’ll reduce the effect to some extent, won’t it?	23.0	108.0
201612	2258	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the market would take it as a judgment that we’re more confident that the economy has sufficient momentum that we’re not going to go back to the effective lower bound in the very near future.	23.0	96.0
201612	2259	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	Our original motivation for not ending the reinvestment was, we wanted to get a little bit of room away from the lower bound, and we wanted to have some confidence that we weren’t going to go back to the lower bound in the very short run.	23.0	96.0
201612	2260	2016-12-14	meeting	FISCHER	Right.	23.0	108.0
201612	2261	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201612	2262	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I did hear considerable support for alternative B as written, but I also heard a suggestion from President Mester, and I want to put that in front of you and make sure I understood it properly.	24.0	65.0
201612	2263	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	At the end of the first paragraph of alternative B—	24.0	65.0
201612	2264	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester, please correct me if I didn’t get this right—President Mester suggested changing the words where it says “but still are low,” to “but remain low.”	24.0	65.0
201612	2265	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	24.0	999.0
201612	2266	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	And leave the “considerably” in there.	24.0	999.0
201612	2267	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	So, basically, just add a word, as opposed to changing it.	24.0	999.0
201612	2268	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	So, essentially, the sentence would be more black ink than we currently have.	24.0	65.0
201612	2269	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	24.0	999.0
201612	2270	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	You would be taking the old sentence and just adding the word “considerably,” so it would read “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up considerably but remain low.”	24.0	65.0
201612	2271	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think this is a big deal one way or the other, but I guess when I originally thought about this question, I thought that, on the one hand, you’re saying something is moving.	24.0	96.0
201612	2272	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, you’re saying something is remaining, and that seems a little bit in opposition to one another.	24.0	96.0
201612	2273	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	Oh, I thought they were synonyms, but I defer.	24.0	999.0
201612	2274	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	And that’s why I was more in the camp of “still are low.”	24.0	96.0
201612	2275	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I favor the way it’s written now, because if you say something has moved and then say something remains, was it at rest, or is it moving?	24.0	96.0
201612	2276	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	It just seems a little contradictory.	24.0	96.0
201612	2277	2016-12-14	meeting	MESTER	I think of “remain” and “still are” as synonyms, but I’m happy to defer and leave it the way it is.	24.0	999.0
201612	2278	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Are there strong views about this?	24.0	65.0
201612	2279	2016-12-14	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it matters.	24.0	96.0
201612	2280	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Should we leave it the way it is then?	24.0	65.0
201612	2281	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201612	2282	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Now, because it has been a year since our previous policy action, I thought it might be helpful if I remind you of the procedure we follow for Board decisions on interest rates on reserves and discount rates taken in association with FOMC monetary policy decisions.	24.0	65.0
201612	2283	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	First, the FOMC will vote as usual on the monetary policy statement and the directive to the Desk.	24.0	65.0
201612	2284	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	Second, the Board only, and not the FOMC, will vote on corresponding changes to the interest rates on reserves.	24.0	65.0
201612	2285	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, the Board only will vote on changes to discount rates.	24.0	65.0
201612	2286	2016-12-14	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s now first vote on the FOMC statement and directive, and let me ask Brian to make clear what it is we’re voting on and to call the roll.	24.0	65.0
