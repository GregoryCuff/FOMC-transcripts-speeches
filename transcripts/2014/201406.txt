201406	0	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to begin by welcoming three people to the table today:  Stan Fischer, Lael Brainard, and Loretta Mester.	5	5
201406	1	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	This is the first FOMC meeting for both Stan and Lael, but both have very deep experience in economic policy over many years in a variety of other contexts.	5	5
201406	2	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Loretta, as you all know, has actually been attending FOMC meetings for 14 years, but she joins us now as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.	5	5
201406	3	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We welcome our three distinguished colleagues and look forward to collaborating with them and to learning from them.	5	5
201406	4	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The first thing we need to do is items 1 and 2 this morning, which we will discuss in a joint FOMC and Board meeting.	5	5
201406	5	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	So with respect to the Board meeting, I need a motion to close the meeting.	5	5
201406	6	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Aside to Governor Fischer]	5	5
201406	7	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	“So moved.”.	5	5
201406	8	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Remember, I told you, it is an assigned job.	5	5
201406	9	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s always “so moved”?	5	5
201406	10	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	There’s no variation?	5	5
201406	11	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	No, that’s it.	5	5
201406	12	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	No variation.	5	5
201406	13	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	All right.	5	5
201406	14	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201406	15	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	And then I say, “Without objection.”	5	5
201406	16	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	5	5
201406	17	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe there is an objection, but at any rate, our first item is a staff report on market developments and operations.	5	5
201406	18	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Lorie Logan.	61	6
201406	19	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201406	20	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, market participants were focused on two ongoing themes:  the decline in longer-term interest rates, and the low levels of volatility across financial markets.	61	6
201406	21	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I will focus on these two developments before turning to the ECB’s recent policy actions.	61	6
201406	22	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Simon will review Desk operations and discuss two memos on the effective federal funds rate and overnight RRP counterparty framework that you received in advance of the meeting today.	61	6
201406	23	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, domestic financial conditions eased a bit over the period, continuing a broad trend since the December FOMC meeting.	61	6
201406	24	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Longer-term US interest rates have declined—driven almost entirely by declines in real rates—while corporate credit spreads have narrowed and equity prices have increased.	61	6
201406	25	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	This easing in conditions has occurred against a backdrop of highly accommodative monetary policy from major developed-economy central banks, including the ECB.	61	6
201406	26	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The pronounced decline in longer-term tenors has occurred across advanced foreign economies despite important differences in their economic and policy outlooks.	61	6
201406	27	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the US, UK, and German five-year, five-year forward nominal rates are about 65 to 90 basis points lower since December.	61	6
201406	28	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants cite a variety of potential drivers for the declines, but do express some puzzlement over the extent of the moves.	61	6
201406	29	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	To better understand the drivers, the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the decline in the five-year, five-year forward Treasury rate since the end of last year.	61	6
201406	30	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, on average, respondents assigned the highest importance to three factors: a decline in the expected level of the long-run real federal funds rate, changes in economic and policy outlooks in other advanced economies, and “market- related factors,” which includes things such as portfolio reallocation, positioning, and safe-haven flows.	61	6
201406	31	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Changes to the US economic outlook and the accumulation of US dollar reserves were viewed as somewhat less important, although as you can see, buy-side participants placed more weight than dealers on reserve accumulation as a factor.	61	6
201406	32	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s surveys provide further evidence of the importance of a decline in the expected level of the long-run federal funds rate as a contributor to the decline in longer-dated forwards.	61	6
201406	33	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, the distribution of dealer estimates of the longer-run target rate shifted down between the December and June surveys, with the median and modal responses declining from 4 percent to 3.5 percent.	61	6
201406	34	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The buy-side survey also shows a decline in expectations for the longer-run rate.	61	6
201406	35	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In commentary explaining revisions to these expectations, dealers principally highlighted reductions in estimates of potential GDP growth.	61	6
201406	36	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, many have highlighted comments reportedly made by former Chairman Bernanke during recent private speaking engagements that he does not expect the federal funds rate to reach 4 percent in his lifetime.	61	6
201406	37	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Notably, roughly one-third of dealers expect some downward revisions to the SEP projections for the longer-run target rate.	61	6
201406	38	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As I noted, survey respondents also rated changes in the economic and policy outlooks in other advanced economies as an important contributor.	61	6
201406	39	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Commentary over the period highlighted building expectations for additional accommodation from the ECB, which reportedly pressured euro-area sovereign yields lower, increasing the relative attractiveness of Treasury securities.	61	6
201406	40	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, survey respondents rated market-related factors highly.	61	6
201406	41	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Desk contacts have pointed to a reversal of positions from investors who came into 2014 betting on an increase in rates as one such factor.	61	6
201406	42	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	This view is supported by net speculative positioning in 10-year Treasury futures, which has moved closer to neutral after starting the year significantly short.	61	6
201406	43	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast to longer-term rates, the market-implied federal funds rate path is little changed since December, as shown in the bottom-left panel, and currently lies below the median of Committee participants’ target rate projections in the March SEP.	61	6
201406	44	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Most dealer and buy-side survey respondents continue to see the second half of 2015 as having the highest probability of liftoff, roughly in line with market pricing, and do not expect material changes to the 2015 or 2016 rate projections in the forthcoming SEP.	61	6
201406	45	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Among those who do expect changes to these nearer-term rate projections, views are roughly evenly split on the likely direction of those changes.	61	6
201406	46	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In sum, while expectations for the path of policy rates over the next several years appear little changed since December, the evidence suggests that a significant portion of the decline in longer-dated forward rates is due to declines in longer-run policy rate expectations.	61	6
201406	47	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	A number of other factors also appear to have depressed term premiums.	61	6
201406	48	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	One other factor that Desk contacts have linked to the declines in longer-term interest rates is the low level of realized and implied interest rate volatility, the second theme in focus over the period.	61	6
201406	49	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In fact, low volatility is a phenomenon that extends broadly across financial markets.	61	6
201406	50	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, implied volatilities in equity, currency, and interest rate markets are currently at or near their lows since these markets developed in the 1990s and around levels prevailing just prior to the financial crisis.	61	6
201406	51	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	While the panel shows options with one-month expiries, implied volatility on options with longer expiries has also generally declined, albeit not to historical lows.	61	6
201406	52	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s surveys asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining declines in implied volatility across markets.	61	6
201406	53	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit, respondents on average rated “investor reach-for-yield behavior” and “low levels of realized volatility” as the most important factors.	61	6
201406	54	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Reduced uncertainty about central bank reaction functions and the global economic outlook were viewed as relatively less important.	61	6
201406	55	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Reach-for-yield behavior in this context might be interpreted as investor willingness to sell options even when the expected returns to doing so are unduly low, in an effort to boost portfolio returns amid exceptionally low levels of interest rates.	61	6
201406	56	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Desk contacts report that selling options to enhance yield is being employed in larger size by a wider array of market participants.	61	6
201406	57	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	A reach for yield amid these low interest rates and volatility has likely contributed to the appreciation of various risk asset prices over recent months.	61	6
201406	58	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, high-yield corporate credit spreads to Treasury securities have narrowed significantly and are near historical lows.	61	6
201406	59	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Similarly, emerging market asset prices have risen and EM sovereign and corporate spreads have narrowed.	61	6
201406	60	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	This has occurred despite a broad downgrade of EM growth prospects and uneven improvements in addressing economic imbalances across countries.	61	6
201406	61	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Risk asset prices in the euro area have also risen over recent months, driven in large part by building expectations for ECB policy actions.	61	6
201406	62	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The ECB signaled its willingness to ease policy at its May meeting and announced a variety of easing measures at its meeting earlier this month; taken together, these measures exceeded most market participants’ expectations.	61	6
201406	63	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Specifically, the ECB cut its main refinancing rate to 15 basis points and deposit rate to negative 10 basis points.	61	6
201406	64	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	It also lowered the marginal lending facility rate to 40 basis points.	61	6
201406	65	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, it announced targeted long-term refinancing operations linked to bank lending, extended the fixed-rate full allotment stance, suspended the sterilization of its Securities Market Program, and announced that it would intensify preparatory work related to outright purchases in ABS markets.	61	6
201406	66	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Since the May ECB meeting, broad euro-area financial conditions have eased.	61	6
201406	67	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations for the path of policy rates in the euro area have pushed out considerably, with futures rates now implying EONIA will first reach 25 basis points in early 2017, out from spring 2016, and the euro has depreciated over 2 percent against the US dollar.	61	6
201406	68	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The easing in conditions has been especially pronounced in the periphery.	61	6
201406	69	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As seen in the middle-left panel, peripheral equity indexes have increased as much as 7 percent, while 10-year Spanish and Italian spreads to German equivalents have narrowed as many as 20 basis points.	61	6
201406	70	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, there have been reports of credit lines for peripheral banks opening up in recent days as institutions search for positive yield.	61	6
201406	71	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the positive impact on asset prices and market conditions, building expectations for ECB action appear to have only modestly affected euro-area inflation expectations.	61	6
201406	72	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, the recent increase in measures of shorter-dated forward inflation compensation has only partially offset the earlier declines, and they remain well below the ECB’s objective of close to, but below, 2 percent over the medium term.	61	6
201406	73	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	However, longer-dated measures of euro-area inflation compensation have remained relatively stable.	61	6
201406	74	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The ECB actions also prompted notable declines in euro-area money market rates.	61	6
201406	75	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, forward EONIA rates have declined between 10 and 20 basis points since the May meeting.	61	6
201406	76	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	While EONIA spot and forward rates have thus far remained positive, we understand there may be some interbank overnight unsecured trades taking place at negative rates, while offered rates on overnight repo against core euro-area sovereign collateral have turned negative, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201406	77	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	To avoid negative rates, investors are attempting to term out their euro-area money market investments when they can, though this may become increasingly challenging.	61	6
201406	78	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	German bills rates are already offered at negative rates out to 12 months and French bills are offered at negative rates out to 6 months.	61	6
201406	79	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the negative rates, the Desk has not yet heard of material dislocations in euro-area money markets.	61	6
201406	80	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	However, the impact on market functioning may become more pronounced as additional excess liquidity is introduced to the financial system with the suspension this week of SMP sterilization and the start of targeted LTROs in September.	61	6
201406	81	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I will now turn it over to Simon.	61	6
201406	82	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	To continue Lorie’s discussion of euro-area money markets, negative short-term rates pose challenges for the investment of the SOMA and ESF euro portfolios, given the goals of both ensuring adequate liquidity and preserving the principal balance of foreign currency holdings.	61	6
201406	83	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit, over the last few days we have lowered holdings of euro reverse repos, which would earn negative returns, and moved investments into official deposits, which currently earn either zero or a small positive return.	61	6
201406	84	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We have not until today invested in market instruments at negative rates; however, given the Euro system’s decision to apply a minus 15 basis point rate on top of the negative 10 basis point deposit rate on cash accounts over 100 million euro, we have decided to temporarily invest in market instruments with mildly negative rates.	61	6
201406	85	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As well as continuing to evaluate all options at official institutions, the Desk will increase the duration of the portfolio’s outright bond holdings.	61	6
201406	86	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Continuing with foreign operations, as explained in the memo that Steve Kamin and I sent to the Committee on June 6, the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, ECB and Swiss National Bank announced earlier today that their routine 7-day dollar auctions will continue for at least another two months beyond July 31.	61	6
201406	87	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Although they phased out their 84-day auctions, these central banks expressed the view that continuing 7-day operations would be prudent in light of potential systemic instability in dollar funding markets.	61	6
201406	88	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Their current plan is to evaluate on a monthly basis whether to announce further extensions of the scheduled auctions.	61	6
201406	89	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Recall that the recent usage of the liquidity swap lines has been minimal.	61	6
201406	90	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Turning to domestic operations, the overnight RRP exercise continues to serve as a floor for overnight rates.	61	6
201406	91	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Treasury bill supply decreased significantly in April and May, consistent with the typical seasonal pattern.	61	6
201406	92	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Historically, ongoing declines in Treasury supply have put downward pressure on GC repo rates.	61	6
201406	93	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, GC repo rates did not decline significantly this year, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201406	94	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Rather, take-up at our operations increased sharply—shown in the middle-left panel—and the GCF repo index printed consistently above the 5 basis points offered on our operations.	61	6
201406	95	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Over the past few weeks, bill and other Treasury supply have increased, likely leading to increases in GC repo rates and large declines in overnight RRP take- up.	61	6
201406	96	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Looking ahead to quarter-end, market participants generally expect that participation in the overnight RRP exercise will increase notably.	61	6
201406	97	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As banks and dealers cut back on the amount of overnight investments that they offer to money funds, interest in our operations is expected to increase.	61	6
201406	98	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Of note, over the past two quarter-end periods, take-up has increased by an average of about $160 billion in the week leading up to quarter-end.	61	6
201406	99	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The staff also continues to test the TDF.	61	6
201406	100	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As part of the current testing plan, the maximum award amount and offered rate are being gradually increased.	61	6
201406	101	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Take-up at operations, shown in the middle-right panel, has increased significantly as a result.	61	6
201406	102	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The offered rate will increase over the next three operations, to a maximum of no more than 30 basis points.	61	6
201406	103	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Market participants estimate that take-up could reach $100 billion or more over the remainder of the testing period, which extends through early July.	61	6
201406	104	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Banks suggest that as long as the rate offered on TDF deposits remains only modestly higher than the IOER rate, participation and usage in the exercise will be limited.	61	6
201406	105	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A significant spread is likely necessary to encourage take-up since, unlike reserves, TDF deposits do not count toward an institution’s high quality liquid assets in the LCR.	61	6
201406	106	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, if banks had the option to withdraw funds before the specified maturity date, TDF deposits could become LCR-compliant.	61	6
201406	107	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in the memo you received last week, staff have developed plans for preliminary testing of a variation of the TDF that would include an early-withdrawal feature.	61	6
201406	108	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Under any such testing, a penalty rate would be charged to firms for breaking a term deposit, and it would be set at a level that would make the opportunistic early withdrawal of funds very unlikely.	61	6
201406	109	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Shifting to asset purchases, over the intermeeting period market participants pushed out their expectations for the timing of the end of SOMA reinvestments, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201406	110	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Pooling across the dealer and buy-side surveys, the median respondent now expects MBS reinvestments to end three months after liftoff, six months later than in the April survey, though the dispersion of responses remains very wide.	61	6
201406	111	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents and other contacts suggested that the shift to anticipating a later end to reinvestments is largely due to a speech by Vice Chairman Dudley, in which he discussed his preference to end reinvestments after the first increase in short-term interest rates.	61	6
201406	112	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	MBS market participants in particular focused on these comments and cited them as one factor contributing to the 9 basis point narrowing in option-adjusted spreads on production-coupon agency MBS over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201406	113	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, market participants also described the recent narrowing in OIS, shown in the bottom-right panel, as part of a longer-term trend, which they primarily attribute to limited origination.	61	6
201406	114	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We have fully transitioned to purchasing MBS over FedTrade, the Desk’s in- house trading platform, though we continue to conduct dollar roll transactions over Tradeweb, a commercial trading platform.	61	6
201406	115	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The switch to purchasing through large- scale auctions does not appear to have significantly changed market dynamics and staff analysis thus far indicates we are receiving better execution than the mini- auctions run on Tradeweb, consistent with standard auction theory.	61	6
201406	116	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As was the case at the last meeting, if the FOMC chooses to decrease the pace of Treasury purchases, we will reduce the frequency of Treasury operations, while leaving the purchase distribution unchanged.	61	6
201406	117	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If Treasury or MBS purchases are reduced, as expected by nearly all market participants, we would release a Desk statement at the same time as the Committee statement.	61	6
201406	118	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will have copies of the statement available for review tomorrow.	61	6
201406	119	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Finally, I will briefly review two memos you received prior to the meeting, beginning with the staff’s proposal for creating a more robust federal funds effective rate.	61	6
201406	120	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As we have discussed in the past, and as you can see through the dotted line in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, trading volumes in the fed funds market have decreased significantly since the financial crisis.	61	6
201406	121	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A few foreign banking organizations now comprise the majority of federal funds borrowing.	61	6
201406	122	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The implementation of regulatory change and some of the normalization approaches the Committee is considering may further reduce activity in the market, to the point that the fed funds effective may become an inappropriate benchmark for money market conditions or an unreliable reference rate for financial contracts.	61	6
201406	123	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The staff recommends addressing this concern in two parts.	61	6
201406	124	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	First, we intend to switch in 2015 to using FR-2420 as the source for the underlying transaction data in the calculation of the effective rate.	61	6
201406	125	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the improved governance, the panel structure of this data may reduce complications that are caused by the changing quality-mix of firms in our brokered data set.	61	6
201406	126	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Second, we propose publishing an expanded overnight, unsecured bank funding rate that includes trading activity in Eurodollar deposits negotiated in New York.	61	6
201406	127	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Eurodollars are likely the closest alternative to fed funds.	61	6
201406	128	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Both are used by DIs to fund short-term assets, including reserve balances, and both are transacted in wholesale markets, usually at overnight tenors.	61	6
201406	129	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Moreover, as again shown in the top- left panel, Eurodollar activity brokered in New York has averaged $100 billion since 2010, more than twice the volumes in the fed funds market.	61	6
201406	130	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top- right panel, the volume-weighted averages of the two rates tend to be very close to each other.	61	6
201406	131	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The staff proposes two options if the Committee chooses to move forward with the introduction of an expanded rate.	61	6
201406	132	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The first is to continue to publish the current fed funds effective rate, while also introducing a second rate, with a different name, that includes Eurodollar activity.	61	6
201406	133	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The second is to incorporate Eurodollar activity into the current fed funds effective rate, with no change in name.	61	6
201406	134	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Under either option, the Committee could choose either to target the expanded rate or to use it as an additional indicator of money market conditions.	61	6
201406	135	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A second staff memo you received last week reviews the counterparty framework for overnight RRP operations.	61	6
201406	136	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As you know, the Desk conducts overnight RRPs with an expanded set of counterparties, including large money market mutual funds, GSEs, and a few depository institutions.	61	6
201406	137	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The share of take-up in our operations by each counterparty type is shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201406	138	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	These counterparties were originally chosen in “waves” from 2010 to 2012 and were selected mostly for their capacity to support term draining operations.	61	6
201406	139	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Given operational constraints on our total number of counterparties and our interest in adding firms in an efficient manner, the eligibility criteria we established requires a minimum level of investable assets.	61	6
201406	140	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We last took applications in September 2012, well before the overnight RRP exercise began.	61	6
201406	141	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As I mentioned, the overnight RRP operations seem to provide a floor on overnight rates, which suggests that efficacy considerations do not require changes to our counterparty list.	61	6
201406	142	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, the Committee may consider changing the counterparty policy for other reasons.	61	6
201406	143	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In the memo you received, the staff discussed four possible approaches, outlined in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201406	144	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	These approaches are not mutually exclusive.	61	6
201406	145	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	First, the Committee could decide to defer any decision about the counterparty list until a later date.	61	6
201406	146	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	This option may be attractive if the Committee is concerned about inadvertently signaling that overnight RRPs will become an ongoing part of the operating framework.	61	6
201406	147	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, we would not recommend postponing action for more than a short period of time, as a fixed counterparty list does not seem consistent with a standard Desk objective of fairness in the counterparty framework:  Fairness implies not discriminating among firms that can equally satisfy eligibility and execution objectives subject to operational constraints.	61	6
201406	148	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Many firms that are similar to current counterparties have expressed interest in participating in operations, and market participants are generally accustomed to the primary dealer framework, in which counterparties are added on a rolling basis.	61	6
201406	149	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Second, the Desk could add more counterparties of the current types, with either the current or different eligibility criteria.	61	6
201406	150	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Opening the exercise to new counterparties would address the fairness questions discussed above.	61	6
201406	151	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee is interested in expanding the opportunity to participate in operations to a broader array of firms, one option would be to decrease the minimum assets under management for money funds.	61	6
201406	152	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Third, the Committee could choose to admit new types of firms.	61	6
201406	153	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	For example, the Desk has been approached by nonfinancial corporations, nonbank financial services companies, state and local government pension funds, and others.	61	6
201406	154	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	While this option could improve the efficacy of the overnight RRPs, it is operationally impractical and, we believe, unnecessary to extend eligibility to investors in these categories.	61	6
201406	155	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The fourth option is to prune the existing counterparty list, so as to simplify the operating model or achieve policy objectives distinct from those usually considered by the Desk.	61	6
201406	156	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	For example, one standard reason to remove a primary dealer would be weak participation in operations, perhaps caused by a change in business model.	61	6
201406	157	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, in the case of the overnight RRP operations, even if a firm does not always actively participate in operations, assuming no change in business model, its counterparty status may still provide it with bargaining power that helps in the formation of a floor for overnight rates.	61	6
201406	158	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Removing counterparties for reasons unrelated to efficacy may be difficult to communicate and may also compromise the efficacy of the tool.	61	6
201406	159	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That said, if directed by the Committee, the Desk could quickly eliminate some categories of expanded counterparties—for example, prime money market funds—and attempt to restore any loss of efficacy by adding counterparties from the remaining categories.	61	6
201406	160	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In the interest of fairness—especially as we have not accepted applications for the program for some time—the staff recommends the second option: admitting additional firms that meet the current eligibility requirements.	61	6
201406	161	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A few more details on the staff’s recommended approach are outlined in the bottom-left panel:  We would like to seek your consent to open a new wave in July for firms that meet the current eligibility criteria.	61	6
201406	162	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	By beginning the process soon, the staff could start the time-consuming credit, legal, and regulatory reviews.	61	6
201406	163	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We would anticipate receiving applications from about 25 money funds, about evenly split between government and prime funds.	61	6
201406	164	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	About half of those funds would be associated with investment managers that do not currently have a fund that is a counterparty to our operations.	61	6
201406	165	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A few additional FHLBs may also join.	61	6
201406	166	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee chooses to use overnight RRP operations as part of its normalization strategy, the staff would recommend a switch in the future to accepting new counterparties on a rolling basis, similar to the primary dealer process.	61	6
201406	167	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee was interested in changing the eligibility criteria—for example, by decreasing the required assets under management—that might be a convenient time to do so.	61	6
201406	168	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201406	169	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201406	170	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201406	171	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Lorie or Simon?	62	6
201406	172	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	62	6
201406	173	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	174	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Simon, just on this last discussion, can you project forward to an imagined steady state in which we are using overnight reverse repos as a key part of our scheme?	62	6
201406	175	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	What volume level and counterparty population do you think would be required just to exercise monetary control?	62	6
201406	176	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We have reasonable control in terms of providing a floor with the 140 counterparties we have right now.	62	6
201406	177	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The government money funds account for just over 50 percent of the assets under management in that sector; the prime for about 85 percent of the assets under management.	62	6
201406	178	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So I don’t think that we would necessarily need to add counterparties solely for the reason of execution.	62	6
201406	179	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The reason is that we think it’s hard to explain why a certain set of money funds have access and others don’t have access, given how we rolled out the waves—so that’s a fairness objective.	62	6
201406	180	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In terms of how large the facility will get, that’s really going to depend on the spread that you set.	62	6
201406	181	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And if we’re at the current spread, we’ve seen activity, when Treasury bill supply declined, between $200 billion and $300 billion.	62	6
201406	182	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So if you added more counterparties, it’s likely you’d get slightly more usage.	62	6
201406	183	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Over the last week, usage has declined quite markedly.	62	6
201406	184	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	You can’t quite see it in the chart because we closed the chart on Friday, but yesterday we dropped down to $53 billion of usage as rates got higher.	62	6
201406	185	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you.	62	6
201406	186	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201406	187	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	188	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You said in response to President Lockhart, and in your presentation, that the overnight RRP facility is providing an effective floor on the RP rate.	62	6
201406	189	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Late last year, when the Desk was seeking an extension of the program—this program of testing and exploration and learning and research—I was asking what were we going to learn in the period ahead.	62	6
201406	190	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And I was told we’d learn more about whether it would provide an effective floor.	62	6
201406	191	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So it seems like we’ve learned that.	62	6
201406	192	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m wondering, are we going to learn more about the extent to which this provides an effective floor between now and the time at liftoff when we would want to use this?	62	6
201406	193	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And, if so, is there a reason to continue this program at this scale?	62	6
201406	194	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Or should we be winding it down and waiting and rolling it up for when the time comes to use it?	62	6
201406	195	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I would say, under the current set of rates, the additional amount that we can learn relative to what we learned over the past few months is going to be much smaller than what we learned in the first nine months.	62	6
201406	196	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We will still learn just a little bit—we’ve got the quarter-end coming up.	62	6
201406	197	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If we weren’t restricted to the 0 to 5 basis points, we could definitely learn more.	62	6
201406	198	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Right now—you can see in chart 14 that repo rates have increased quite a lot.	62	6
201406	199	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And we don’t know what would happen if we weren’t restricted to the 0 to 5 basis points.	62	6
201406	200	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think that we feel comfortable recommending a change just to test for what we might learn there, because trying to explain changes like that to markets could be quite difficult, just as explaining the change that “We have tested it, it works great, and we are just going to shut it down until, say, the middle of next year” would be a reasonably complicated thing to explain, given we have the authorization through January 2015.	62	6
201406	201	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If I can follow up, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	202	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Do markets view this as a permanent program at this point?	62	6
201406	203	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	No.	62	6
201406	204	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	No, they don’t.	62	6
201406	205	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Certainly, many people in the market on both sides hope that it will be a permanent program.	62	6
201406	206	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	When we meet with the types of investors who use this program, they would like to have more clarity as to whether it will be a permanent program or not.	62	6
201406	207	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Most analysts who look at the issues that we face expect it to become a permanent program.	62	6
201406	208	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	But the investors have to be wary as to the decisions that you might take around this table.	62	6
201406	209	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	One of the memos contained information that someone is designing a fund specifically for investments in this.	62	6
201406	210	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That seems to indicate that at least some asset managers view this as highly likely to become relatively permanent.	62	6
201406	211	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Certainly, I think both because of the success that we’ve had in forming a floor, and when they look at the problem we are facing with a very large balance sheet, they would expect us to use this type of operation—it would be a natural conclusion.	62	6
201406	212	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And the overnight RRP−only fund will be one device that will be likely to firm the floor.	62	6
201406	213	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There could be issues arising from that type of model that might come out in the later discussion that we have.	62	6
201406	214	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201406	215	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	216	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a question about chart 17 on exhibit 3, which is the answer to the question about expected number of months.	62	6
201406	217	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a concern that this line of questioning could send the signal that the Committee is thinking about the decision to lift off in terms of a time-contingent basis as opposed to a state-contingent basis.	62	6
201406	218	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was wondering if the Desk had contemplated formulating this kind of question, either replacing or augmenting the survey by asking about changes in conditions that would lead to liftoff.	62	6
201406	219	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So we asked for economic conditions at liftoff.	62	6
201406	220	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We also asked—I’m just going to check that I’ve got this right—for the modal time of liftoff and the time at which you expect reinvestments to end.	62	6
201406	221	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Then, we took the difference between those two dates.	62	6
201406	222	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think it would be a little bit leading right now for us to ask for economic conditions consistent with ending reinvestments, because we haven’t really directly communicated that as being one of the criteria.	62	6
201406	223	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If that is one of the criteria that you choose for ending reinvestments, then we could definitely ask that question.	62	6
201406	224	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see.	62	6
201406	225	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So this is imputed from two different questions.	62	6
201406	226	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I didn’t understand that.	62	6
201406	227	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201406	228	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	The question asks:  “Provide your estimate of the most likely quarter and year during which the FOMC will first cease reinvesting some or all payments of principal on Treasuries and/or agency debt and MBS.	62	6
201406	229	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, please provide your expectation for the timing.”	62	6
201406	230	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	It has been a long-standing question.	62	6
201406	231	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is helpful.	62	6
201406	232	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	62	6
201406	233	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201406	234	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	235	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Actually, President Lacker’s question touched on mine.	62	6
201406	236	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let me just be clear.	62	6
201406	237	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So, Simon, based upon your conversations with market participants and as you think about the different counterparty expansion options, the market participants don’t have a strong view as to whether or not this will, in fact, be a temporary program through our transition to policy normalization or whether or not it will become a permanent program, say, still in existence 5 to 10 years from now?	62	6
201406	238	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201406	239	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There’s no real confidence of the operating regime, say, in 2020 that the Federal Reserve would have.	62	6
201406	240	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s probably similar to any projection six to seven years ahead that people would make.	62	6
201406	241	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Would any of these options under consideration tend to bolster the belief that it would be more permanent than otherwise?	62	6
201406	242	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that option 2 is definitely going to make people think that it is more likely permanent.	62	6
201406	243	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Option 3,in which we reach out to a different set of firms, would certainly do that.	62	6
201406	244	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Option 1—definitely the pro on that is that it leaves flexibility with the current counterparty list.	62	6
201406	245	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The reasons that we don’t really like option 1 are, first, that we think it’s likely that you will choose something like the overnight RRP.	62	6
201406	246	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And second, it takes time to onboard the new counterparties that we would get, and it’s a strange operating model to have this fixed list whereby the only changes to the counterparties on the list come about because a firm goes out of business or its assets under management go below $5 billion, which are some of the changes that we’ve had.	62	6
201406	247	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201406	248	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201406	249	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	250	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I defer my comments on panels 21, 22, and 23 until we get into the discussion.	62	6
201406	251	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I want to come back to the Term Deposit Facility, because you have mentioned we have had some memos about perhaps providing some flexibility there by allowing for withdrawal, but at a penalty rate.	62	6
201406	252	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And I just wondered, as you mentioned, Simon, if you could give us a sense of the mathematics at this juncture as we contemplate this.	62	6
201406	253	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I’m going to pass that over to Bill.	62	6
201406	254	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Bill, would you provide us with the mathematics, please?	62	6
201406	255	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	In terms of the breakability?	62	6
201406	256	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Part of what we described in the memo was, for example, a fee that would involve giving up the interest on the term deposit and paying a penalty of 75 basis points at an annual rate on the amount.	62	6
201406	257	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So that would mean that if you broke the term deposit immediately—when you got it, in effect—you’d be giving up the interest and then paying the 75 basis points.	62	6
201406	258	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That would be something like using the term deposit at the discount window and getting a discount window loan at 75 basis points.	62	6
201406	259	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Later in the week, if you broke it, it would be more expensive because you would be giving up the interest and you’d also be paying 75 basis points for the whole week, in effect, rather than paying it just for the couple of days, say, that you needed the cash.	62	6
201406	260	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So we have in mind a pretty hefty penalty.	62	6
201406	261	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s higher than the cost of using the term deposit as collateral at the discount window, which you could do and borrow at the discount window.	62	6
201406	262	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So we think there wouldn’t be usage except in very, very unusual circumstances.	62	6
201406	263	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	264	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I know we’re not going to talk about financial stability, Madam Chair, but following up on Lorie’s point, we’re talking about the VIX and we’re also talking about what’s happening in high yield.	62	6
201406	265	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The Santander issue caught my eye in terms of their auto deal.	62	6
201406	266	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I mean, nonprime debt issuance has been growing very rapidly.	62	6
201406	267	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It is about 34 percent of the market thus far this year; it’s up from one-fourth last year.	62	6
201406	268	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And then the CLO market has priced $53 billion or $54 billion through last week; that’s up 35 percent over last year.	62	6
201406	269	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’m just wondering, from the Desk’s standpoint, are you seeing these as danger signals, or has it been expected?	62	6
201406	270	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	What I was reporting was what we’re hearing market participants focus on lately, and they’ve been talking a lot about the low levels of volatility and the spread levels, particularly in high yield, as we show in the chart.	62	6
201406	271	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I haven’t been in conversations with them when they’ve been pointing to particular vulnerabilities in particular asset classes, though I know there’s a lot of staff work going into this and other areas.	62	6
201406	272	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	It wasn’t part of the conversations I’ve heard.	62	6
201406	273	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	They’ve been more focused on these overall levels in these particular markets.	62	6
201406	274	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Perhaps, Madam Chair, when we rotate back at whatever proximate meeting we have, we might drill down a little bit on the CLO market because it obviously is something that got out of control before.	62	6
201406	275	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It is growing like Topsy, and I just hope we’re paying attention to it again.	62	6
201406	276	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	There’s a limit to what we can do, but I’m just—	62	6
201406	277	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s certainly a market that we have tracked, and the structures that are in place are reasonably robust.	62	6
201406	278	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that I would be more concerned about the reach-for-yield that’s going on perhaps outside the United States and about an event similar to what we saw last year happening—but not within the United States, because we have really good insight now into some of the behavior here.	62	6
201406	279	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Forgive me for taking up time on this, but you’re less concerned about the CLO expansion domestically?	62	6
201406	280	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Less concerned.	62	6
201406	281	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s not like 2005 to 2007, when I think we ignored some of the large growth in credit.	62	6
201406	282	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, insight into what’s happening in the rest of the world is quite low.	62	6
201406	283	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In Lori’s chart number 8, if you look at the correlation there between two things that don’t necessarily have to be related—they have been quite close since late February.	62	6
201406	284	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	285	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	President Fisher, if I can add one thing.	62	6
201406	286	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So we have heard anecdotes of investor funding essentially triple-A tranches or other tranches of CLO, using financial leverage, repo, or prime brokerage.	62	6
201406	287	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	We added a special question in the SCOOS this round asking exactly this question, whether dealers have seen funding of these structures.	62	6
201406	288	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The responses came back saying that, first of all, they have seen an easing in terms of funding since the beginning of the year.	62	6
201406	289	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	And they have seen demand coming from credit hedge funds, and then they have seen funding across the capital structure essentially from triple-A all the way down to the mezzanine tranche.	62	6
201406	290	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Now, this is not quantitative—it’s a qualitative question—but it confirms the anecdotes that we have heard in markets, that investors are reaching out to boost yields using financial leverage.	62	6
201406	291	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	292	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201406	293	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have two questions for Simon regarding eligibility.	62	6
201406	294	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first one is whether any nonbank SIFIs—AIG, Prudential, or GE Capital—have asked whether they should have access to the ON RRP facility because they are supervised by the Fed, and money market funds aren’t.	62	6
201406	295	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And then the second question is that currently it looks like the SEC reform is going to go forward sometime in July.	62	6
201406	296	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if it were for some reason to stall and we were to choose to only use government money market funds and not prime money market funds, do you think there would be sufficient capacity to run this facility with the government funds only?	62	6
201406	297	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	To answer the first question, we’ve definitely heard from at least one of those three.	62	6
201406	298	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that is a different type of extended counterparty.	62	6
201406	299	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We could definitely do that.	62	6
201406	300	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I just think it’s easier to have a very clear regime in place.	62	6
201406	301	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We could use the FSOC—if they designate a firm a systemically important nonbank institution, that could be one metric for doing that.	62	6
201406	302	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	On the government funds—if you go to the chart which shows you that most of the take- up has been from the government money funds, and given that we have somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of the assets under management in the government money fund industry, I think if we wanted to exclude the prime funds, we could certainly do that.	62	6
201406	303	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	One of the things that is true is prime funds can invest in government-only funds.	62	6
201406	304	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So just excluding the prime funds doesn’t necessarily mean they won’t have pretty quick access through the family of funds they’re in to the overnight RRP.	62	6
201406	305	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Though there may be a difference between treating somebody as a counterparty and giving them access to instruments indirectly.	62	6
201406	306	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Definitely, there is a difference, yes.	62	6
201406	307	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	62	6
201406	308	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	May I follow up, Madam Chair?	62	6
201406	309	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think what we emphasized in the memos that we sent was there are two issues here.	62	6
201406	310	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	One issue is the financial-stability issue, the kind of run-risk issue.	62	6
201406	311	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	There, excluding the prime funds doesn’t really help for the reasons that Simon just gave.	62	6
201406	312	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	They can still run.	62	6
201406	313	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	They just run through an affiliated government fund, a government-only fund.	62	6
201406	314	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The other issue is the desire to send a signal, make a statement, about concerns about the business model of prime money funds.	62	6
201406	315	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And that would be a separate reason not directly involving the issues surrounding normalization, but another policy point that you want to make.	62	6
201406	316	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	There’s another financial-stability issue which the memo highlights that you might want to consider and that is that the variability or volatility of take-up of the prime funds is much higher than that of the government funds.	62	6
201406	317	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	If you have this individual cap and the volatility of take-up is very high, you might see a tradeoff between volatility and where you set the cap, essentially.	62	6
201406	318	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So excluding the prime funds would essentially have a take-up that is much less volatile than if you included them.	62	6
201406	319	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Now of course, if the prime funds start putting money into the government funds, that might increase the volatility of the government funds, so the tradeoff is not obvious.	62	6
201406	320	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Also, we have to be careful because we don’t know exactly how the prime funds use their access.	62	6
201406	321	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So it could be part of the bargaining path or make the market more competitive.	62	6
201406	322	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Sorry, President Lacker, a follow-up.	62	6
201406	323	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	62	6
201406	324	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	325	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I just want to follow up on Eric’s point to understand the New York Desk’s thought here.	62	6
201406	326	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	So if we were to decide to exclude prime funds, you’re not worried about closing the barn door.	62	6
201406	327	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	You have 25 percent share of allotment presently.	62	6
201406	328	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	That would not present a problem to you?	62	6
201406	329	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As I said in the briefing, we would attempt to restore the efficacy of the overnight RRP.	62	6
201406	330	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s really a decision for you about that tradeoff.	62	6
201406	331	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	At first, the efficacy would be lower without the prime funds, but over time I’m sure we can build that back up.	62	6
201406	332	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	333	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201406	334	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201406	335	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to refer to exhibit 1, chart 3, which shows factors contributing to the decline in five-year, five-year forward Treasury rates.	62	6
201406	336	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	There are a lot of factors here.	62	6
201406	337	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of the market chatter that I’ve heard would attribute the decline to the ECB taking an extraordinary policy action.	62	6
201406	338	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I didn’t see that listed explicitly here as a reason.	62	6
201406	339	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So should I put that in the category of “Other AFE Outlook”?	62	6
201406	340	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	That’s correct.	62	6
201406	341	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201406	342	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s what they’re referring to there.	62	6
201406	343	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Some of them may be referring to that.	62	6
201406	344	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I think others could be different, but I think those who would put a lot of weight on the ECB explanation would put it in that category.	62	6
201406	345	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	As opposed to, say, China or something else.	62	6
201406	346	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Oh, China wouldn’t be AFE.	62	6
201406	347	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Sorry.	62	6
201406	348	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I think that China would be “reserve accumulation,” mostly.	62	6
201406	349	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	But I guess, the stories they tell would be mostly reserve accumulation, which does show some difference between the dealer and the buy side.	62	6
201406	350	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201406	351	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My interpretation has been that the ECB has been contemplating extraordinary action.	62	6
201406	352	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	They finally came through on it and that’s been at least a major factor.	62	6
201406	353	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s consistent with what’s being said here.	62	6
201406	354	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	Yes.	62	6
201406	355	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	I cited the longer-run target rate and then also, I think, the ECB—I talked a little bit about that playing a role.	62	6
201406	356	2014-06-18	meeting	LOGAN	As those rates have come down significantly, it’s affected rates globally.	62	6
201406	357	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201406	358	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Very good.	62	6
201406	359	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201406	360	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	China is still buying a tremendous amount of securities each day as well.	62	6
201406	361	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	62	6
201406	362	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	363	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I want to follow up on President Rosengren’s question as well, and I want to take a little different variation.	62	6
201406	364	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think you were alluding to this, Simon.	62	6
201406	365	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	If we stuck to government-only money market funds and excluded the prime funds, for example.	62	6
201406	366	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	If I look across the quarter, look across the usage, one of the things that we’ve witnessed is this sharp uptake at the end of quarters.	62	6
201406	367	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Presumably, I’m guessing, there’s some balance sheet dressing that’s going on by primarily the prime funds, or is there a usage variation in these periods when you’ve gotten these spikes for the prime funds and the government-only funds?	62	6
201406	368	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s not balance sheet dressing by the prime money market funds.	62	6
201406	369	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s balance sheet dressing by the counterparties they would usually invest cash with.	62	6
201406	370	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So, for example, one of the issues with prime funds is they still invest a lot in European banks effectively, and the European banks, as they get close to quarter-end, tend to reduce the amount of their balance-sheet funds that they’ll offer to the prime fund.	62	6
201406	371	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So one of the things that we’ve seen at quarter-end is an increase in take-up in the overnight RRP.	62	6
201406	372	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That has meant that RRP rates, despite this big flow of cash into the repo market, haven’t fallen that much because we’ve provided this floor.	62	6
201406	373	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And we’ve improved market functioning relative to the repo markets in the United Kingdom, for example, over those month- and quarter-end periods.	62	6
201406	374	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s a difficult question as to why this window-dressing is so powerful and what it means for the regulations in place that banks choose to window-dress so much.	62	6
201406	375	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But it’s the banks as the counterparties, not the prime funds that are doing it.	62	6
201406	376	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Interesting.	62	6
201406	377	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And your other point then, just to make sure I understand, is that if there is a government-only fund and a prime fund, even in that situation they are part of the same family of funds.	62	6
201406	378	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Your point was that—and Bill was making it—prime funds can actually use the government-only fund as a conduit to—	62	6
201406	379	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s an eligible investment option for the prime fund.	62	6
201406	380	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Okay.	62	6
201406	381	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	62	6
201406	382	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	62	6
201406	383	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62	6
201406	384	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201406	385	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	If not, I need a motion to ratify open market operations.	63	6
201406	386	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201406	387	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201406	388	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Am I supposed to say something?	63	6
201406	389	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	This is an FOMC issue as opposed to a Board issue.	63	6
201406	390	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	So moved, Madam Chair.	63	6
201406	391	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	This is very subtle, Stan.	63	6
201406	392	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	63	6
201406	393	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It’s way beyond me.	63	6
201406	394	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m just a central banker—	63	6
201406	395	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move to our discussion, then, on policy normalization, and let me just make a few remarks, if I might, to begin.	92	9
201406	396	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	First, I’d like to express my appreciation to all of you for the very engaging and productive discussion we had at our last meeting, and I very much want to thank the staff for their excellent support last time and this time as well.	92	9
201406	397	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We covered a number of issues.	92	9
201406	398	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We considerably clarified the area in which we’re likely to find consensus, and we succeeded, I think, in trimming down the range of options appreciably.	92	9
201406	399	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	As we resume our discussion today, let me remind everyone that we have set a goal of clearly articulating to the public our normalization strategy and framework at the time of the September meeting.	92	9
201406	400	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	This is an important deadline because I consider it essential for us to define concretely and communicate our plans well before the first steps in normalizing policy become appropriate.	92	9
201406	401	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We will also need to provide clarity about the mechanics of our approach in order to ease the transition for market participants and to make sure that the required market infrastructure is in place.	92	9
201406	402	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Meeting this timetable will require our collective focus on some key remaining issues.	92	9
201406	403	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In general, I think we’ve agreed that our normalization framework should allow us to deploy our mix of tools relatively flexibly to deal with contingencies that arise.	92	9
201406	404	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But it also needs to be simple and clear enough that we can convincingly communicate it to the public.	92	9
201406	405	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Since interest rate normalization will begin at a time when our balance sheet is quite large, there’s broad consensus that raising the interest rate on excess reserves will be a central part of the rate normalization process.	92	9
201406	406	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, there are also some additional issues, and I’d like to describe, based on our previous discussion, what I’d characterize as a centrist approach.	92	9
201406	407	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	There seems to be broad, although not unanimous, agreement that the overnight RRP facility should play at least some role in our normalization plans since it would help to provide a more reliable floor for short-term rates than would IOER alone.	92	9
201406	408	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Assuming that we do operate this facility during normalization, the spread between the overnight RRP and IOER rates becomes an important issue, and at the last meeting, I heard pretty widespread support for keeping that spread rather wide.	92	9
201406	409	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We focused on two arguments that favor maintaining a significant spread, perhaps in the neighborhood of the current 20 basis points.	92	9
201406	410	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	First, I think there is a general desire to preserve trading activity in the federal funds market; and second, given a range of uncertainties and concerns about the overnight RRP facility, there’s a desire to keep that facility modest in size.	92	9
201406	411	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I hope we can make progress today on a number of important follow-on issues, which are spelled out in the staff memos.	92	9
201406	412	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, we need to consider the role of the federal funds, IOER, and overnight RRP rates in both the implementation and communication of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	413	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We need to decide how to limit the financial-stability risks associated with the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	414	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We have to make choices, as Simon mentioned, relating to the modernization of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	415	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	And we also need to decide on our reinvestment strategy.	92	9
201406	416	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	It’s probably not essential that we reach final agreements today.	92	9
201406	417	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, if we do reach agreement on particular issues at today’s meeting, we could convey such progress to the public either through the minutes or tomorrow’s press conference.	92	9
201406	418	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	However, by the end of the July meeting, I hope we will have settled most of these substantive issues.	92	9
201406	419	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	That would allow us to finalize a set of revised normalization principles at the September meeting.	92	9
201406	420	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We had what I thought was a very good discussion and back-and-forth on the issues last time.	92	9
201406	421	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I hope that we can again make good use of the Q&A period after the staff presentations to make comments and ask questions that will help us all work through these complicated issues.	92	9
201406	422	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We will also have a full go-round to make sure we hear everyone’s views on the key remaining issues, and we have purposely started very early today to allow a good deal of time for this discussion.	92	9
201406	423	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	So with those introductory remarks, let me turn the floor over to the staff.	92	9
201406	424	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think Gretchen is going to begin.	92	9
201406	425	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	426	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	My colleagues and I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Monetary Policy Normalization.”	92	9
201406	427	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	We will focus on three key decisions that you will need to make as you develop your approach to policy normalization.	92	9
201406	428	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	I will talk about considerations that might bear on your choice of rates to use for setting the stance of policy and communicating it to the public, then Fabio will talk about how you might choose to limit the financial-stability risks posed by an overnight RRP facility, and finally Debby will discuss the Committee’s options regarding the end of reinvestment.	92	9
201406	429	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	I’ll begin by summarizing the staff’s reading of the perspectives that you provided during the normalization go-round at the April meeting.	92	9
201406	430	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Although you expressed preliminary views and made no decisions, there appeared to be areas of common ground.	92	9
201406	431	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Staff took these areas as building blocks for a couple of approaches to policy normalization that you may find broadly acceptable, though not yet fully specified.	92	9
201406	432	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	As shown in the top panel of your first exhibit, and as the Chair just noted, in April, most of you envisioned using overnight RRPs in addition to IOER to help control short-term interest rates during the process of policy normalization.	92	9
201406	433	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	This approach could entail risks to financial stability from disruptive surges in take-up of RRPs during periods of financial stress.	92	9
201406	434	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	As a result, you expressed interest in imposing some limits on potential disruptive surges of take-up at an overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	435	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	In addition, you generally expressed a preference for approaches to policy normalization that would not be expected to further reduce trading in federal funds.	92	9
201406	436	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	To support such trading, you could have an appreciable spread—such as the current 20 basis point spread—between the IOER and overnight RRP rates, at least initially.	92	9
201406	437	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	An appreciable spread would also help to address your reservations about executing a very large volume of overnight RRPs with money market mutual funds and other nonbank counterparties on a regular basis.	92	9
201406	438	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	You held mixed views regarding the use of term deposits and term RRPs to drain reserves; some thought such tools could be helpful but many saw them as likely to be expensive or ineffective.	92	9
201406	439	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Even so, you generally did not wish to preclude further development and testing of term tools because it could prove useful to have them at the ready if the combination of IOER and overnight RRPs does not work as expected.	92	9
201406	440	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Two other common themes to your remarks were the desire to preserve flexibility about the longer-run policy framework, and support for developing an expanded measure of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	441	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Finally, you generally supported informing the public about your updated normalization plans at the time of the September FOMC meeting.	92	9
201406	442	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	If you wanted to consider approaches that incorporate these broad features, then, as noted in the middle panel, one key design issue is the role that you want the federal funds rate (or, as Simon discussed, an expanded version of that rate) to play during normalization—that is, do you want to set and communicate the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate, or by emphasizing the administered rates on overnight RRPs and IOER?	92	9
201406	443	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Either way, you’d be using a variant of a floor system to implement policy, one with two floor rates—the IOER rate for depository institutions and the overnight RRP rate for the Federal Reserve’s RRP counterparties.	92	9
201406	444	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	We think approaches that rely on adjusting these two rates to manage short-term interest rates can be successful, whether they focus primarily on the federal funds rate or on administered rates.	92	9
201406	445	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the bottom panel, you might want to target the federal funds rate because the rate is familiar to the public, so your communications should be well understood; making a change could risk complicating policy communications during normalization, when clear communication will be critical.	92	9
201406	446	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	You may also be inclined to use the federal funds rate now because you want to leave open using it in the longer-run policy approach after normalization is complete.	92	9
201406	447	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	If the Committee chooses to target the federal funds rate during normalization, it would also need to decide whether to use a point target, as it did prior to the financial crisis, or a target range.	92	9
201406	448	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Although current conditions in the federal funds market differ appreciably from those that prevailed when the supply of reserve balances was much smaller, you might judge that the public would most easily understand a point target for the federal funds rate, and that changes in a point target may provide a clearer signal of adjustments in the stance of monetary policy than would changes in a target range.	92	9
201406	449	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	With this approach, the FOMC would set a specific target level for the federal funds rate and direct the Desk to adjust the overnight RRP rate, perhaps within a specified range, during the intermeeting period to help keep the federal funds rate close to the point target.	92	9
201406	450	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	The Board would set the IOER rate at an appropriate spread to the federal funds target.	92	9
201406	451	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Because entities with direct access to overnight RRPs should not be willing to lend overnight in unsecured markets at a rate below the overnight RRP rate, an increase in the overnight RRP rate should put upward pressure on rates in short-term unsecured funding markets and help to move the federal funds rate back up toward its target when it falls below.	92	9
201406	452	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Similarly, reducing the overnight RRP rate should put downward pressure on the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	453	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	However, this approach is untested.	92	9
201406	454	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	As such, the Committee might also need to authorize the use of term reserve draining tools, on a contingent basis, in case they prove necessary to hit the point funds rate target.	92	9
201406	455	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Even so, given the high level of reserves and the reliance on new tools, the Committee might need to tolerate, at least initially, greater volatility in the level of the federal funds rate around the point target than was the case before the financial crisis.	92	9
201406	456	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Thus the Committee might want to communicate that it expects the federal funds rate to be close to the point target on average over time, but not necessarily each day.	92	9
201406	457	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Alternatively, the Committee may want to use a target range for the federal funds rate, as it does today.	92	9
201406	458	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	In particular, as I just described, in current circumstances it may be difficult to hit a point target for the federal funds rate with sufficient precision.	92	9
201406	459	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Also, if the Committee targets a range, the spread between the two administered rates likely could remain constant throughout the intermeeting period rather than being subject to adjustment, as would be the case if there is a point target.	92	9
201406	460	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Having a fixed spread between the two administered rates could be seen as desirable because it might be more efficient for the transmission of monetary policy and less disruptive for money markets than the case in which the overnight RRP rate was adjusted regularly.	92	9
201406	461	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	If it took this approach, the Committee could begin to normalize rates by announcing a higher target range for the federal funds rate, and the IOER and overnight RRP rates could be raised by the same increment, preserving their current spread.	92	9
201406	462	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	However, given the level of reserves and the use of new tools, the accompanying increase in the federal funds rate could be larger or smaller than desired, and policymakers would need to decide how to react to situations in which the federal funds rate moves outside its desired target range—for example, by making an adjustment to the administered rates.	92	9
201406	463	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Rather than focusing on the federal funds rate, you might choose to set and communicate the stance of policy primarily through the overnight RRP and IOER rates, as noted in the top panel of exhibit 2.	92	9
201406	464	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	If you took this approach, you could announce a less accommodative policy stance by raising these two administered rates by the same amount, and the Committee could state that it expects the general level of short-term market rates to rise by a broadly similar amount.	92	9
201406	465	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	You could even say that you expect short-term rates including the federal funds rate to rise by a broadly similar amount, if you wanted to focus some attention on that rate without targeting it.	92	9
201406	466	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Communicating through administered rates may afford the Committee greater leeway to take no action if short-term market rates were to move temporarily outside of their expected range, since the range would not be the primary focus of communication, though also pointing to the funds rate would probably reduce that leeway.	92	9
201406	467	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Of course, if short-term market rates were persistently outside the Committee’s desired range, then some additional adjustments in the administered rates would be necessary, perhaps even during an intermeeting period.	92	9
201406	468	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Finally, as noted in the last panel, the efficacy of your chosen approach will depend in part on your decisions about how tightly to limit take-up at the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	469	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	The tighter the caps on take-up at the facility—that is, the more frequently they bind—the less the facility can be expected to exert control over short- term market interest rates.	92	9
201406	470	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	In general, the degree of control that the ON RRP facility is expected to have over short-term market interest rates has implications for your decisions about your communications strategy, but also for the effectiveness with which the stance of overnight rates is transmitted to longer-run rates and real activity.	92	9
201406	471	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	Fabio will now discuss approaches to limiting disruptive surges in take-up at the ON RRP facility as well as its total size.	92	9
201406	472	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Thank you, Gretchen.	92	9
201406	473	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In my remarks, I will review design features and other mitigants that could lessen financial-stability concerns associated with an overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	474	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	These mitigants are the subject of one of the memos you received over the intermeeting period.	92	9
201406	475	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	As indicated in the top left panel of exhibit 3, the memo focuses on caps on usage as a form of circuit breaker during a period of market stress.	92	9
201406	476	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	These caps are not intended to limit average take-up at the facility under normal market conditions and are expected to bind only rarely.	92	9
201406	477	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Instead, these caps are designed to prevent a disruptive surge in take-up at the facility over a short period, which could be associated with a loss of short-term funding for financial institutions and nonfinancial firms, and to provide policymakers with some time to assess conditions and to determine whether additional responses are warranted.	92	9
201406	478	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	As noted to the right, the memo identifies two main possibilities for the design of circuit breakers: individual caps—that is, caps specific to each reverse repo counterparty (or RCP)—and an aggregate cap on potential facility usage.	92	9
201406	479	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The main benefit of individual caps is that each RCP would know in advance the maximum amount it can invest at the facility each day.	92	9
201406	480	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	An aggregate cap instead would allow greater flexibility for allocating usage across RCPs, and could be accompanied by a market-based pricing mechanism—such as a uniform-rate auction—to allocate take- up when the cap is binding.	92	9
201406	481	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Ordinarily, the rate produced by this process would be the overnight RRP rate set by the Committee, but when the cap binds, the auction rate could be lower.	92	9
201406	482	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The Committee may consider additional features that apply to both individual and aggregate caps.	92	9
201406	483	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Caps can be rigid (so that there is a take-up limit that cannot be exceeded) or flexible (where the limit could be exceeded, perhaps at a lower rate, when demand exceeds the stated cap).	92	9
201406	484	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition, caps can be static (set in advance and unvarying) or dynamic (adjusted periodically according to a predetermined algorithm).	92	9
201406	485	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Finally, dynamic caps could be set equal to previous average usage over some period plus some amount (so additive) or equal to previous average usage multiplied by some amount (so multiplicative).	92	9
201406	486	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	As indicated in the middle left panel, in assessing advantages and disadvantages of these possible design features, the Committee may find it useful to consider a number of issues.	92	9
201406	487	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	A table in the memo summarizes these various considerations.	92	9
201406	488	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In this briefing I will focus on three of them.	92	9
201406	489	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	First, how to effectively balance the two policy goals of controlling potentially disruptive surges in take-up and setting an effective floor on short-term rates.	92	9
201406	490	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The caps should not be too tight:  Very low caps that often bind could virtually eliminate surges into the facility but would diminish its effectiveness in controlling rates.	92	9
201406	491	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	By contrast, very high and loose caps would have the opposite outcome, improving control over rates, but allowing potentially disruptive surges into the facility.	92	9
201406	492	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Evidence from the overnight RRP exercise to date indicates that individual take-up varies proportionally much more than aggregate take-up, so it may be difficult to set individual caps that provide enough flexibility without leaving considerable room for a surge in aggregate usage.	92	9
201406	493	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	This observation suggests that an aggregate cap may be more effective than individual counterparty caps in balancing the two policy goals, especially if accompanied by a pricing mechanism to facilitate a market-based allocation of overnight RRP when the cap binds.	92	9
201406	494	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Second, ease of implementation and burden on RCPs.	92	9
201406	495	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Current Desk systems could handle in a robust and automated fashion an aggregate cap with a uniform-price auction to allocate awards when the cap binds as well as a uniform system of individual caps.	92	9
201406	496	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	However, implementation of some other more complex possibilities—for example, a system in which the rate on the overnight RRP declines with aggregate take-up according to a specified schedule—would require a potentially significant amount of time to make changes to Desk systems.	92	9
201406	497	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	With respect to burden on RCPs, an aggregate cap paired with an auction would require RCP bids to include both a quantity and a rate that may vary.	92	9
201406	498	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	As a result, this option may be perceived as somewhat more burdensome than current operations, which only require RCPs to submit a quantity and confirm the specified ON RRP rate.	92	9
201406	499	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	However, when the aggregate cap is not expected to bind, the problem faced by RCPs would be no more complex than it is now.	92	9
201406	500	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Finally, communication issues.	92	9
201406	501	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Overall, simpler options would undoubtedly be easier to communicate.	92	9
201406	502	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Static, uniform counterparty caps, as currently used, would probably present the fewest communication challenges, but a rigid aggregate cap would also be straightforward to describe.	92	9
201406	503	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The use of dynamic caps might present some communications challenges, at least initially.	92	9
201406	504	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Advance communication of rules for setting the level of caps, so that market participants would be familiar with the mechanics of the facility and would not necessarily interpret binding caps as signals about the Committee’s intentions, would also be advantageous.	92	9
201406	505	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In light of the considerations outlined above, the Committee might want to focus today’s discussion on two options, highlighted in the panel to the right.	92	9
201406	506	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The first option—an individual cap option—envisions the use of individual rigid caps that are adjusted periodically based on past usage.	92	9
201406	507	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, an RCP’s cap could be set each month to its average take-up over the previous month plus an amount in a range between $1 billion and $5 billion.	92	9
201406	508	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The rate paid is the overnight RRP set by the Committee.	92	9
201406	509	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The second option—an aggregate cap option—involves an aggregate rigid cap that is adjusted periodically based on past usage.	92	9
201406	510	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, the aggregate cap could be set each week to the average take-up over the previous week plus an amount in a range between $50 billion and $300 billion.	92	9
201406	511	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Each day, the Desk would conduct a uniform-price auction for the cap amount with a maximum allowable bid equal to the overnight RRP rate set by the Committee; because demand would rarely exceed the cap amount, RCPs would almost always be able to invest the amounts that they have requested and receive the announced overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201406	512	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	As indicated in the bottom panel, the wide range for the additive factors in these proposals reflects the difficulty of evaluating the tradeoffs between having caps set high enough to make an overnight RRP facility effective in firming rates but also low enough to limit potentially disruptive surges.	92	9
201406	513	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Both components of the tradeoff are uncertain, and more staff work during the testing phase would be needed to help inform the Committee’s choice of the additive factor.	92	9
201406	514	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The Committee may want to consider whether setting caps so that they may bind occasionally—for example, at quarter-ends—could have salutary effects.	92	9
201406	515	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Occasionally binding caps may reduce pressures for changes in rules when caps do bind because market participants would become familiar with procedures, expect them to be followed, and temper their reliance on overnight RRP in their own contingency planning.	92	9
201406	516	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	On the other hand, caps that bind, even rarely, in normal times could also have costs—for example, by constraining the facility’s ability to accommodate quarter-end pressures.	92	9
201406	517	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In addition to the risks associated with a sudden surge in take-up, the Committee may be concerned that dynamic caps that adjust automatically could result in a very large facility size during protracted periods of stress as the effective limit ratchets upwards, an outcome that could lead to further disruptions in funding markets.	92	9
201406	518	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Although the Federal Reserve has a number of tools at its disposal to ameliorate financial strains by injecting liquidity back into the system, several factors could limit the efficacy of these tools or temper the willingness of policymakers to use them.	92	9
201406	519	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Hence, the Committee may want to impose an ultimate limit on facility usage as a complement to dynamic caps.	92	9
201406	520	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, it may set an overall facility limit of $750 billion or $1 trillion or an individual limit of $10 billion or $15 billion if individual caps are used.	92	9
201406	521	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Further staff work would be needed to calibrate this ultimate limit to balance the financial-stability risks with reduced control over rates during the normalization process.	92	9
201406	522	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	In the event that caps bind because of a surge into overnight RRP—that is, if circuit breakers are “tripped”	92	9
201406	523	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	—the Committee may face pressures from multiple constituencies.	92	9
201406	524	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	RCPs may advocate raising or eliminating the caps, while institutions facing strains in funding markets may advocate for injections of liquidity.	92	9
201406	525	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The Committee may want to consider whether additional actions to mitigate strains would be warranted in such situations.	92	9
201406	526	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	For example, the Committee could lower the overnight RRP rate, adjust the cap, or provide liquidity.	92	9
201406	527	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Debby will now talk about reinvestment options.	92	9
201406	528	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, Fabio.	92	9
201406	529	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Turning to exhibit 4, I will cover options for when to cease or reduce reinvestments, which is another element of your normalization strategy.	92	9
201406	530	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	As noted in your top left panel, the exit principles included in the minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting indicated that ceasing or reducing reinvestments would likely be the first step in the process of normalization, and would be followed by modifications to forward guidance, reserve draining operations, and only then an increase in the target federal funds rate; agency securities would likely be sold sometime after that.	92	9
201406	531	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Several important changes—noted in the top-right panel—have occurred in the three years since.	92	9
201406	532	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	They include a substantial increase in securities holdings and excess reserves; the sale of shorter-dated Treasury securities holdings during the Maturity Extension Program; changes in the forward guidance; the Committee’s indication that it no longer expects to sell agency MBS during normalization; and the development of overnight RRPs to help control interest rates with a large balance sheet.	92	9
201406	533	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	As summarized in the next panel, if the economy evolves in line with the staff’s baseline expectations, halting reinvestments six months before liftoff, at liftoff, or sometime after liftoff has relatively limited effects on estimates of the term premium and balance sheet.	92	9
201406	534	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Accordingly, in that case, the choice does not materially affect the timing of liftoff or macroeconomic outcomes, nor does it have a discernible effect on projected remittances to the Treasury.	92	9
201406	535	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	That said, to the extent that the flow of purchases might have an effect on interest rates—a possibility that is not factored into staff models but which some market participants appear to put weight on in the MBS market—announcing a halt in reinvestments may put some upward pressure on MBS rates, which could pass through to primary mortgage rates.	92	9
201406	536	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	As noted in the middle-right panel, there are several possible options for timing an end to reinvestments as part of a revised normalization strategy—before liftoff, after liftoff, or coincident with liftoff.	92	9
201406	537	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	All else equal, ceasing reinvestments prior to liftoff—the first option—would normalize the size of the balance sheet sooner than in the other options and would slightly reduce the level of reserves prior to liftoff.	92	9
201406	538	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	In the staff’s current baseline, reserves are drained to a lesser degree (both in dollar terms and as a share of the balance sheet) than the staff originally projected in mid-2011.	92	9
201406	539	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Because even passive reductions in security holdings are a means for removing policy accommodation, the Committee would presumably stop reinvesting principal payments only when it judged that conditions were appropriate to begin to tighten policy.	92	9
201406	540	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	However, if you are concerned that reductions in securities holdings might have an unpredictable effect on interest rates that could potentially delay liftoff, you may prefer to maintain reinvestments until sometime after liftoff—which is a second option.	92	9
201406	541	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	You also might prefer initiating policy normalization with an increase in your target for short-term interest rates in part because you have indicated that you plan to use short-term interest rates as your primary tool for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	542	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Moreover, you might want to gain confidence in the sustainability of the tightening cycle, halting reinvestments only once you were confident that the decision was unlikely to be reversed.	92	9
201406	543	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Some policymakers may judge it appropriate to maintain reinvestments beyond liftoff in order to limit the risk of a too-large tightening of financial conditions upon liftoff, and potentially to enhance flexibility to provide more accommodation if the economy weakens during the tightening cycle.	92	9
201406	544	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	But other policymakers may be concerned that an end to reinvestments could be delayed for a substantial period, implying that the balance sheet would not begin to shrink until much later than they judge appropriate.	92	9
201406	545	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	If you decide to end reinvestments after liftoff, you might want to adopt a trigger or threshold relative to your interest rate target, economic conditions, or time.	92	9
201406	546	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Depending on the details of the approach taken, communications associated with an after-liftoff option could be more complicated than in the other options for stopping reinvestment.	92	9
201406	547	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	A third option would be to halt reinvestments at the same time as liftoff.	92	9
201406	548	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Taking actions on interest rates and the balance sheet simultaneously offers simplicity in communications, but also could make the initial tightening move less gradual than starting with either tool first.	92	9
201406	549	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Of course, ceasing reinvestments entirely is not the only alternative to reinvesting all payments of principal.	92	9
201406	550	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	As seen in the bottom panel, the monthly runoff of securities from the SOMA portfolio is quite variable in the case of Treasury securities, which start to mature in size in 2016.	92	9
201406	551	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	It is also subject to prepayment uncertainty in the case of agency MBS (for which modeled estimates are shown in the chart).	92	9
201406	552	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	If you wished to see a steady decline in the size of the portfolio, you could smooth the path by conducting partial reinvestments in months when runoff was particularly large, perhaps augmenting this strategy with sales of short-dated securities in months when runoff was small.	92	9
201406	553	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Separately, you could use reinvestment policies to shift the allocation of assets within the portfolio—for example, by diverting MBS reinvestments into Treasury securities to expedite a return to an all- Treasury portfolio, or vice versa to provide ongoing support to the housing market.	92	9
201406	554	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	The final page of your handout provides a copy of the questions that were distributed with the staff memos on normalization.	92	9
201406	555	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	You may want to address these questions in your contributions during the go-round.	92	9
201406	556	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Thank you, Madam Chair, that completes our prepared remarks.	92	9
201406	557	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	We’d be happy to take questions.	92	9
201406	558	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201406	559	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to a question and answer period, and as last time, I urge two-handed interventions when topics come up where there are a number of issues that would benefit from back-and-forth.	92	9
201406	560	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201406	561	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	562	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Debby, I think this question is probably primarily directed toward you because it’s about reinvestment.	92	9
201406	563	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	As I read the memo and listened to your presentation today, I came away with the impression—but correct me if I’m wrong—that you collectively think that the most significant effect of a decision to end reinvestment would be a signaling effect rather than a real economic effect.	92	9
201406	564	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I know there’s the continued stock−flow debate, but apart from that, is it essentially a signaling device?	92	9
201406	565	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	We think the signaling effect that this should have on short-term rates probably wouldn’t depend on which tool you use, but there is uncertainty around what kind of signaling effect an announcement on reinvestments could have in regards supply  For example, for MBS, there’s some endogenous response to our purchases, and that creates at least some uncertainty.	92	9
201406	566	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	We don’t think that’s necessarily a big issue now, as we’ve been tapering purchases in a very predictable way, but we hear from market participants that there could be a flow effect that is associated with the signal we send about our purchase plans.	92	9
201406	567	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I guess I had been under the impression, just listening to market participants, that regardless of on which part of the yield curve the ceasing of reinvestment would have the most noticeable effects, that the cessation of reinvestments would be read more generally as a prelude to tightening or, if it came after liftoff, it would be read as sort of a ramping up of tightening.	92	9
201406	568	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And I guess I’m asking whether the Desk shares that general view.	92	9
201406	569	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Based on last year’s events, it seems that we can say things that should not be that big of news to markets, and they take it as a viewpoint of the reaction function.	92	9
201406	570	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I do think what Debby was trying to put in play there is if you’re looking at early next year, then the main focus will be on when the first increase in the policy rate happens.	92	9
201406	571	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So that’s what the memo looked at.	92	9
201406	572	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There is potentially more signaling there.	92	9
201406	573	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Ex post, it is also true that if you kept reinvesting, it would be a sign of all clear to stop the reinvestments at that point, which might be either good for you or bad for you at that point.	92	9
201406	574	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Right.	92	9
201406	575	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	That’s very helpful, and that actually gets to the question I had about the decision on reinvestment.	92	9
201406	576	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	It seems as though there’s a certain contingency associated with this.	92	9
201406	577	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	That is, it seems to me it’s a little hard to judge now when that signal would either be minimized or maximized, as we would most prefer.	92	9
201406	578	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	So I was a bit concerned about the prospect of setting forth a chronology similar to what we did in June 2011, which had cessation of reinvestment clearly at a particular stage in the normalization process.	92	9
201406	579	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Can you address a bit whether that concern is outweighed by the need for clarity to markets, or do you think it’s a legitimate concern and thus an argument for not committing ourselves now to where it would fit within the sequence of normalization policies?	92	9
201406	580	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Last year, when we tried to give clarity, it didn’t work too well.	92	9
201406	581	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	It was a lot of clarity.	92	9
201406	582	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	It was like a blinding light.	92	9
201406	583	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	584	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	This is a little bit different.	92	9
201406	585	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	You saw how diffuse expectations are for when reinvestments end.	92	9
201406	586	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think we would take seriously, surprisingly after all this time, the flow effects just a little bit in the MBS market.	92	9
201406	587	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And one of the issues the memo tried to address is that we own a lot of mortgage-backed securities.	92	9
201406	588	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So our decision about whether to reinvest or not could be quite a large signal for that market , which is, I think, the second point that Debby was trying to make.	92	9
201406	589	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	This is a result of the asset purchases that we’ve done.	92	9
201406	590	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We own—what was the share of the outstanding stock?—something like one-third of the mortgage-backed securities.	92	9
201406	591	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And if we limit it to the set of securities that we are actually buying, then it is about 40 percent—so a significant presence in that market.	92	9
201406	592	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think over the next two months, the reinvestments will be larger than the new purchases that we’re making.	92	9
201406	593	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	I could add to that, Simon.	92	9
201406	594	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	With MBS, given the uncertainty as to what prepayments will look like in the future, too, there’s some uncertainty as to exactly how much will be rolling off our balance sheet and what risk we’re putting back into the market over time.	92	9
201406	595	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander—President Bullard.	92	9
201406	596	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Sorry, could I just add something?	92	9
201406	597	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Governor Tarullo, I think a key question that you face is how you describe when it will be that you will want to end reinvestment.	92	9
201406	598	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And as I think you were suggesting a moment ago, it probably would be better to not be too crisp and clear about what the timing is expected to be and instead condition that on some set of economic outcomes that would suggest it was then appropriate to begin not reinvesting or reducing the amount of reinvestment.	92	9
201406	599	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Perhaps there would be some intermediate step, as Debby described.	92	9
201406	600	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But I think being a little bit too crisp and too clear, as we learned last year, can make people think you’re on a forced march to do it, and that, maybe, is where you get an adverse reaction.	92	9
201406	601	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Are you saying—when you’re cautioning against being too crisp or clear about the when, do you mean just in absolute terms or do you mean even relative to other normalization steps?	92	9
201406	602	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Well, I think relative is okay.	92	9
201406	603	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I mean in absolute terms.	92	9
201406	604	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	92	9
201406	605	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	92	9
201406	606	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	607	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201406	608	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Just about the flow effects, Simon, I was looking at exhibit 3, at the option-adjusted spreads.	92	9
201406	609	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	If I look at those prior to when we started reducing purchases in MBS this past December and today, they have gone up and down, but they are kind of where they were before we started reducing purchases.	92	9
201406	610	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	So should I interpret that as maybe the flow effect isn’t having that big an effect on the spreads or what should I take away from that picture?	92	9
201406	611	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Because we are buying a lot less now than we were.	92	9
201406	612	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That is true.	92	9
201406	613	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And the spreads are about the same now.	92	9
201406	614	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There’s a lot of forces that move around the option-adjusted spread.	92	9
201406	615	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	There’s a lot of forces that move around lots of interest rates.	92	9
201406	616	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s true, and that’s one of the issues that we face with the large-scale asset purchase program.	92	9
201406	617	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It is probably only contributing 20 to 30 percent of the fluctuations we see.	92	9
201406	618	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So we look at experiments.	92	9
201406	619	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We know when we announced the $40 billion per month, that had an effect which was a little outsized at first, which is probably related to the dynamics of the mortgage market.	92	9
201406	620	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The tripwire for Vice Chairman Dudley’s speech tells you something similar to that as well.	92	9
201406	621	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Now, I can construct calculations in which the market’s view of the stock of mortgage-backed securities changed sufficiently following that speech to justify that fall in the option-adjusted spread.	92	9
201406	622	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	But I wouldn’t put 100 percent weight on that type of model.	92	9
201406	623	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The issue that you are facing as you move toward liftoff, the situation you don’t want to have is an abrupt tightening of financial conditions.	92	9
201406	624	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And we are putting a little bit of weight on the MBS flow effect as potentially producing that, if you announced a reinvestment policy that was surprising to the market.	92	9
201406	625	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	As you can see in panel 17, the market has moved a little bit, but it’s a little bit all over the place.	92	9
201406	626	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Some people will be surprised right now.	92	9
201406	627	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Just one point to make.	92	9
201406	628	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The effect of Vice Chairman Dudley’s speech in markets isn’t really a flow effect.	92	9
201406	629	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We didn’t change our flow of anything.	92	9
201406	630	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We were talking about a change in flow being further in the future, and that affects the stock of the securities we’re going to be holding for quite a long time, potentially.	92	9
201406	631	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And I think that also had an effect.	92	9
201406	632	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So I’m not sure how much I want to read this as telling me that there’s a flow effect and how much I want to be saying it’s telling me there are stock effects and other market dynamics, and we are now expected to hold more MBS for longer than we were before.	92	9
201406	633	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s what I was trying to get at.	92	9
201406	634	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s more than just sort of—	92	9
201406	635	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s hard to be confident of how to interpret that.	92	9
201406	636	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard, you had a two-hander.	92	9
201406	637	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	638	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This is a question for Debby.	92	9
201406	639	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	You argued that our tapering, because it has been on a schedule, has not had very much impact in markets.	92	9
201406	640	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So, by analogy, could I argue that a managed reinvestment policy in which you allowed the balance sheet to shrink at some fixed rate over time would be equally smooth and equally predictable in markets, and that, there again, you would get very small effect or no effect?	92	9
201406	641	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	We think that could certainly help.	92	9
201406	642	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	That doesn’t necessarily mean by not doing it that you risk having the opposite effect.	92	9
201406	643	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	I think with the amounts that we’re looking at for reinvestments, it’s one thing to go from $40 billion a month to zero.	92	9
201406	644	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	Depending on how much you have coming off in any month, that may or may not have as large an effect, right?	92	9
201406	645	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	92	9
201406	646	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So what I’m saying is if you look at this picture at the bottom of exhibit 4, that’s saying that it’s highly variable if you just cease reinvestments altogether.	92	9
201406	647	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But if you manage that process so that the balance sheet goes down in an orderly way, then evidently, or I guess, you would get the same kind of effect that we’ve gotten from our taper, which is that that gets fully incorporated into market expectations.	92	9
201406	648	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	There are no surprises.	92	9
201406	649	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think something like the speech by Vice Chairman Dudley does create something of a surprise in markets, because they are not quite sure how that is going to be managed in the future.	92	9
201406	650	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But then, we could announce a schedule like this, is what I’m saying, and then you think it would work out smoothly if we went in that direction.	92	9
201406	651	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	That’s right, to provide that kind of clarity, I think then the market can slowly adjust and find other marginal buyers as we slowly step out of the market.	92	9
201406	652	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	92	9
201406	653	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, did you have a two-hander?	92	9
201406	654	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I did.	92	9
201406	655	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Simon, going back to your 30 percent number, in your own mind, do you contemplate us conducting reinvestment in order to maintain that ratio?	92	9
201406	656	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s what the reinvestment would do—it would maintain that ratio.	92	9
201406	657	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Unless we agreed on some kind of adjustment of the reinvestment rates.	92	9
201406	658	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That is subject to the rate at which the outstanding stock is growing.	92	9
201406	659	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The net issuance has been quite small for a while, as you know.	92	9
201406	660	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We would expect, then, that in 2015–2016, that would start to grow, both as you got more activity in the housing market and house prices went up, the limit becomes a smaller share.	92	9
201406	661	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	But effectively, if you reinvest the principal paydowns, you are keeping your share of the outstanding stock reasonably constant.	92	9
201406	662	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	92	9
201406	663	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley, did you have a two-hander?	92	9
201406	664	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, a two-hander.	92	9
201406	665	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	On this issue of the announcement effect, I think it really depends a lot on market position.	92	9
201406	666	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This issue of distinguishing between flows and stocks is very difficult, because it is also a question of, how does this signal affect what portfolios people actually want to hold.	92	9
201406	667	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And so you can have a signal that has a pretty large effect on interest rates—you know, last summer is a good example of that.	92	9
201406	668	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Even though it doesn’t change how the balance sheet is actually likely to evolve.	92	9
201406	669	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think market positioning is really a big factor here, and I think we do not want to lose sight of that.	92	9
201406	670	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of Governor Tarullo’s observation about what do we need to say, my own view is I think we do have to say something, because we basically said in the old exit principles that we’re going to do the reinvestment ahead of raising short-term rates.	92	9
201406	671	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think to say that we have no idea now, is probably not a very good outcome.	92	9
201406	672	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But I do agree with Governor Tarullo that we don’t want to say more than what we actually know.	92	9
201406	673	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We certainly want to keep flexibility, because when you would want to time the end of reinvestments could depend on a whole host of factors, depending on what the shape of the yield curve looks like, what the strength of the economy is, what is happening in the housing sector.	92	9
201406	674	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So you might want to maintain a fair amount of flexibility in terms of the precise timing.	92	9
201406	675	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota, did you have a two-hander?	92	9
201406	676	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I did.	92	9
201406	677	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	678	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And it actually builds on what Vice Chairman Dudley was just saying.	92	9
201406	679	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I understand the desire to retain flexibility, but I guess I took a slightly different lesson from the events of 2013, which is that the Committee’s desire to retain flexibility in September 2012 left markets with uncertainty about what we meant about sufficient improvement in the labor market outlook.	92	9
201406	680	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And then our decisions were viewed as containing information about our reaction function, about how hawkish or dovish this Committee is.	92	9
201406	681	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And so that’s a cost of retaining flexibility—that your decisions are not viewed as being necessarily conditional on economic outcomes, but rather on the makeup and the inclinations of the Committee.	92	9
201406	682	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own view of the events of 2013 is that we weren’t sufficiently clear in September 2012, and that’s what led to the challenges.	92	9
201406	683	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think we should be careful in thinking that through as we are thinking about communicating in the future.	92	9
201406	684	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201406	685	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201406	686	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	687	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I had several questions about MBS, which have now been fully answered.	92	9
201406	688	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But I have one I’d like to ask about Treasuries.	92	9
201406	689	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	There is quite a bit of volatility in Treasury volumes coming up in 2016 as the MEP cycles out.	92	9
201406	690	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I assume these are the kind of volumes that we would expect the Treasury market, in ordinary times, to be able to absorb without great difficulty.	92	9
201406	691	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Is that the case?	92	9
201406	692	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And, if not, have we thought about ways to mitigate that?	92	9
201406	693	2014-06-18	meeting	LEONARD	If we’re not rolling it over, this is an amount that we think the market would be able to absorb, and that Treasury would also be able to make plans for in their primary issuance and be able to accommodate in their refundings.	92	9
201406	694	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thanks.	92	9
201406	695	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201406	696	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I want to slightly change the focus, and that’s why it was one-handed.	92	9
201406	697	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I have a series of questions.	92	9
201406	698	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	First, we are thinking about whether we want a system in which we are going to use the overnight RRP and IOER, and then make a decision about what we want to do with the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	699	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	What information did you get about the predictability of the federal funds rate from this experiment?	92	9
201406	700	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s printed somewhere between 7 and 10 basis points.	92	9
201406	701	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s a little bit firmer over the last week.	92	9
201406	702	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The reason we said it was an untested approach is that we don’t know whether changing the rate on the overnight RRP would lead to changes in flows in the federal funds market, which would allow us to then control the fed funds rate.	92	9
201406	703	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We think that the logic suggests that we would be able to do that.	92	9
201406	704	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know, Bill, if you want to add some more.	92	9
201406	705	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s right, that the funds rate has continued to move with other short-term market rates, as Simon discussed.	92	9
201406	706	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We think that the overnight RRP rate has set a floor for market rates that has been reasonably good in the period when there was a reduction in bill issuance and rates fell.	92	9
201406	707	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that what we have learned is really about control and the control that we can get from the overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201406	708	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But as Simon indicated, particularly if you were trying to hit a point target, the question of, if the funds rate is 5 basis points or 7 basis points below your point target, how much do you move the overnight RRP rate to get it there?	92	9
201406	709	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	How quickly do markets adjust to the higher floor?	92	9
201406	710	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And so how rapidly does the funds rate get there?	92	9
201406	711	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And also, there is the constraint that if you want to keep the funds market more or less trading as it is trading now, you can’t raise the overnight RRP rate too far, too close to the IOER rate, because that will ultimately undermine the trading in the funds market.	92	9
201406	712	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So there are just a bunch of things that we don’t really know, and trying to implement an approach in which there is a target for the funds rate that you are trying to hit by moving the overnight RRP rate would require some learning by doing.	92	9
201406	713	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And potentially some of that learning would be, do you want to also be constrained by keeping a reasonably large spread between IOER and overnight RRP.	92	9
201406	714	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	There may be times when you can’t hit your target, and you just have to live with some uncertainty of where the funds rate will be relative to target.	92	9
201406	715	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	92	9
201406	716	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So the next question I have is, if we had never had the federal funds rate, and we run without worrying about the federal funds rate for two or three years, and the system more or less works, and let’s say there’s a lot of turnover on this Committee, so nobody remembers why we used the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	717	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	718	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Isn’t this a strange thing that you want to focus and go back to?	92	9
201406	719	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a market between European banks and Federal Home Loan Banks.	92	9
201406	720	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Why would you put that in the middle of this system if you were reinventing it?	92	9
201406	721	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s currently this somewhat idiosyncratic market.	92	9
201406	722	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But in normal times—and we hope to get back to normal times—it will not be.	92	9
201406	723	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It will be, again, the rate at which DIs are lending to each other in an overnight market, and it will be their marginal cost of funds, and it actually seems to me an attractive rate to target.	92	9
201406	724	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The marginal cost of funds for DIs, it’s a relatively small market in which we control a lot of the parameters, so that we can operate in that market and control rates with a relatively small balance sheet, relatively small operations, and depend on the DIs basically to arbitrage that into other short-term market rates.	92	9
201406	725	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think it has real appeal as a long-term way of implementing policy.	92	9
201406	726	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s why we ended up, back in the 1980s, using that structure for implementing policy.	92	9
201406	727	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	If the Committee were confident they didn’t want to go back to that, then I would agree with you that currently this is a somewhat strange market.	92	9
201406	728	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Why are we twisting ourselves around to not unwind that market?	92	9
201406	729	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Well, I think the discussion around this table has suggested that there are people who want to go back, down the road, to implementing policy with the funds rate.	92	9
201406	730	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And that, I think, suggests it is at least costly to step away from that rate for a while, allow that market to potentially get very small and idiosyncratic, and then try to come back to it later.	92	9
201406	731	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Can I just add one thing?	92	9
201406	732	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We need some market rates that we would actually look at to see whether the policy is actually working through from the other rates that we are setting.	92	9
201406	733	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And it is pretty natural for the FOMC to look at something like the effective federal funds rate as the market rate that it might be looking at, just because that’s what we used before.	92	9
201406	734	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, just one last comment.	92	9
201406	735	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	As I understand it—this is academic knowledge—actually hitting the federal funds rate is a complicated story.	92	9
201406	736	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And if you were starting to tell that story, it would sound no less complicated than the stories we have about using the federal funds rate and all that, and everybody has to get up in the morning and figure out exactly how much liquidity to put into the market, and so forth.	92	9
201406	737	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So is it a very natural policy rate?	92	9
201406	738	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I actually disagree with that in normal times, because in normal times, as I said, the funds market is small, we control a lot of the parameters through reserve requirements and through our open market operations, and we have pretty good visibility into, for example, what the Treasury balance is going to be.	92	9
201406	739	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So we can make pretty small adjustments and target the funds rate very closely, and we understand that market very well.	92	9
201406	740	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I would be at least hesitant and would want to think pretty hard about shifting to a system in which we’re implementing policy in an ongoing way through an RRP rate and our operations are overnight RRPs.	92	9
201406	741	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that’s an implementation process that is feasible, but you would have to do it with a much bigger balance sheet, because potentially you’d be doing a lot of RRPs to push around what is a very, very large market.	92	9
201406	742	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And it would just be, I think, a very different set of special factors that we would have to learn about, and we’d learn about them, and we’d figure them out, and we could do that.	92	9
201406	743	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But it is a very different way of implementing policy, and it would have serious consequences for the balance sheet and the size of our operations.	92	9
201406	744	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I know Simon will have more to say on that.	92	9
201406	745	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think we have to worry about checks getting stuck on planes anymore, the way that check processing works.	92	9
201406	746	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So that’s good.	92	9
201406	747	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That simplifies one part of some of the issues that we have.	92	9
201406	748	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now we have to worry about the computers being hacked.	92	9
201406	749	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	92	9
201406	750	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s a lot easier than it would have been 25 years ago.	92	9
201406	751	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I do think that when you describe to people what that operating system was, it is not the most obvious operating system that we evolved to.	92	9
201406	752	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	However, it worked really well, and it achieved the goals of the FOMC for a substantial period of time.	92	9
201406	753	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Regulatory reform and other changes in the financial system, which I think we discussed at the last meeting, make me, I think, a little less confident that we could go back to that nice position in which, each day, we could hit the target basically by injecting a very small amount of cash, you know, one three-thousandths of what the balance sheet is right now, and whether we’d really want to do that to affect financial conditions.	92	9
201406	754	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think Vice Chairman Dudley was really clear at the last meeting that none of you really care about which rate we target each day on the Desk.	92	9
201406	755	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	What you care about is the impact you are going to have on general financial conditions.	92	9
201406	756	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And Bill English gave, I think, the real strength for the federal funds rate, which is that targeting it was very effective in moving financial conditions around.	92	9
201406	757	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	What we don’t know, when we get back to 2021, 2022, whenever it happens, and we’ve got a smaller balance sheet, whether that market will be as effective as some other markets, given the change in the financial system, particularly driven by regulation.	92	9
201406	758	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	92	9
201406	759	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	92	9
201406	760	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	92	9
201406	761	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	There is no reason, though, why we have to make this decision today about what we’re going back to.	92	9
201406	762	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that the only decision we would probably want to make is, do we not want to rule out one or the other?	92	9
201406	763	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as both are still viable, it seems that it’s more sensible to learn more.	92	9
201406	764	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, the world is going to be quite different in 2021, 2022.	92	9
201406	765	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see why a decision needs to be made today.	92	9
201406	766	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, Bill, do you think we have to decide or in any way pre-commit ourselves?	92	9
201406	767	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	No, not at all.	92	9
201406	768	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But I think what all of you have said in the past is that you don’t want to close doors.	92	9
201406	769	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And I think it would be at least pretty close to closing a door, for example, if the Committee went with the rate on overnight RRP very close to IOER; it should then not expect the federal funds market to function, at least in its traditional way.	92	9
201406	770	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And if all of the communication about policy was in terms of IOER and overnight RRP, then I think it would be difficult to go back to something like the pre-crisis structure.	92	9
201406	771	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So, Bill, not to disagree [laughter], but if we got the overnight RRP close to the rate of interest on excess reserves, one possibility is that we would get back the traditional fed funds market.	92	9
201406	772	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	What we have right now is a market that we don’t want someone to write a long newspaper story on about how the effective rate is constructed, because it is basically FHLBs taking money out of their bank accounts with the Fed, giving it to a foreign banking organization that puts it back into a bank account with the Fed and earns 25 basis points.	92	9
201406	773	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s a pretty unusual market.	92	9
201406	774	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s a very efficient deposit market.	92	9
201406	775	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We had a very efficient market before for sharing liquidity across banks.	92	9
201406	776	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Both of them seem to work in terms of getting your intent through to financial market conditions.	92	9
201406	777	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	92	9
201406	778	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker had a two-hander.	92	9
201406	779	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Two observations on the line of questioning that Governor Fischer initiated.	92	9
201406	780	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	One is that under the old regime, when targeting the fed funds rate, there was this two- week window in which DIs had to hit their reserves target.	92	9
201406	781	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It worked by itself.	92	9
201406	782	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We only really needed to hit the target the last day.	92	9
201406	783	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It was the expectation of that that made the funds rate equal the target for all the other days in the two-week maintenance period.	92	9
201406	784	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	A lot has changed, but the fact that we were targeting the federal funds rate is what led it to behave the way it did.	92	9
201406	785	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It is not obvious that now—when we’re not implementing a point target for the funds rate—provides good evidence about how the relationship between the RP rate and the funds rate would work if we were targeting the funds rate.	92	9
201406	786	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d also point out that, in the old regime, the spread between the RP rate and the funds rate was tremendously variable.	92	9
201406	787	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You know, it was above 15 basis points, below 15 basis points, above and below very frequently.	92	9
201406	788	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And it didn’t seem to bother us, and as you said, we had effective control over the broad set of market interest rates.	92	9
201406	789	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So the nature of these spreads is something that is very regime-dependent.	92	9
201406	790	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And just making an inference about what a point target for the funds rate would be like is difficult to do.	92	9
201406	791	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	About whether we need to decide our long-run framework or not, we’re building some machinery and we’re raising some expectations.	92	9
201406	792	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And some market participants are building business models on the availability of a Fed RRP facility.	92	9
201406	793	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And I raised this point last fall.	92	9
201406	794	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We are raising expectations, and we are raising adjustment costs.	92	9
201406	795	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We are inducing people to undertake investments that would be costly to reverse, and the prospect of those costs has the ability to kind of stay our hand, and make us reluctant to back away from offering RRPs on the scale and scope that we are offering them now.	92	9
201406	796	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	This is why I raised the question at the beginning.	92	9
201406	797	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Can I just make one little point?	92	9
201406	798	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The fact that we had a lot of control means that, if people know you have a lot of control, you don’t necessarily have to do that much to achieve the point target.	92	9
201406	799	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In the situation we’re in right now, people might doubt the precision of control that we have on the federal funds market.	92	9
201406	800	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So announcing a point target, we’d probably have to have a proof of concept that we can get the effective federal funds rate to hit that target with a reasonable amount of ease.	92	9
201406	801	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d say a third thing—so it could be that IOER is quite effective.	92	9
201406	802	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But if we choose another thing that has a fixed relationship to IOER, and announce that that’s the thing we are changing, it’s not clear everything is going to work out just the same way, even though if you looked at it, the funds rate would look like a peculiar market to claim you’re targeting, as Governor Fischer pointed out.	92	9
201406	803	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Can I just add a thought in response to what you said on building expectations about overnight RRP?	92	9
201406	804	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think the Committee can choose to build expectations or not.	92	9
201406	805	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	In particular, one could imagine in September saying that we are going to use overnight RRP as a tool during normalization, but we don’t necessarily intend to use it in the long run.	92	9
201406	806	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And I can see a path forward that would involve, let’s say, raising IOER and overnight RRP basically in parallel as you tighten, raising the target range for the federal funds rate, maybe later on you go to a point target.	92	9
201406	807	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Over time, the balance sheet is shrinking.	92	9
201406	808	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Over time, the overnight RRP isn’t as helpful and isn’t as important in applying a floor.	92	9
201406	809	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The setting of IOER is sufficient to pull rates higher.	92	9
201406	810	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	So you allow the overnight RRP rate to fall relative to market rates, relative to IOER, and over time it becomes essentially irrelevant.	92	9
201406	811	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Nobody really wants it because the rate on it is lousy relative to market rates, and so it goes away.	92	9
201406	812	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t see that there isn’t a process for proceeding whereby you could use overnight RRP as a tool to give you confidence that you can raise rates when the time comes to raise rates, but not make it part of a long-run toolkit.	92	9
201406	813	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	I was just going to add one thing along those lines, that in the April memos the staff raised the issue of the consideration of how big of a footprint you would like to have in the long run in the nonbank sector.	92	9
201406	814	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	And the conversation so far has mainly been about control and efficacy and transitioning back and forth.	92	9
201406	815	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	But in the long run, you might have some concerns about possibly relying quite heavily on nonbanks, paying them interest.	92	9
201406	816	2014-06-18	meeting	WEINBACH	That gets attention politically, maybe, and you may just have some longer-run considerations that mean that you could rely on the overnight RRP facility in the short term but not necessarily forever.	92	9
201406	817	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, may I follow up?	92	9
201406	818	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	There was this point where, in the sequence you sketched out, in which we discover that the overnight RRP rate isn’t that necessary.	92	9
201406	819	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Then, we reduce it.	92	9
201406	820	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m unclear on how we would learn that before we would reduce it.	92	9
201406	821	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Within the range between overnight RRP and IOER, market rates would move up toward IOER.	92	9
201406	822	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As the amount of reserves goes down, as IOER is the more effective tool—	92	9
201406	823	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I mean, we know that it’s about a 15 or 20 basis point spread you need to arbitrage IOER and the ON RRP rate.	92	9
201406	824	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We have a lot of information that points to something in that range.	92	9
201406	825	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So if you keep the interest rate on ON RRPs at 15 or 20 basis points, you are not going to see whether, without that floor, the arbitrage is effective.	92	9
201406	826	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I agree, at the beginning, when you raise rates in the way I described, you wouldn’t see whether the overnight RRP was doing you all that much good.	92	9
201406	827	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It might be that just raising IOER with no overnight RRP would provide a sufficient magnet, would move rates up along with IOER.	92	9
201406	828	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You would not see that in the process I described.	92	9
201406	829	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You would ultimately see, as the balance sheet shrank and the amount of reserves shrank, market rates moving up within that range—that, say, 20 basis point range between overnight RRP and IOER.	92	9
201406	830	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And, as it moved higher, you would have less take-up on the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	831	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It would just be less important as a way of providing a floor.	92	9
201406	832	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You wouldn’t get a lot of dollars coming into overnight RRPs and—	92	9
201406	833	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	How much balance sheet shrinkage would we need—	92	9
201406	834	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Eventually, some banks would be short of reserves, and if they’re—	92	9
201406	835	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	92	9
201406	836	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But wouldn’t we have to go down to like, $100 billion in reserves to get there?	92	9
201406	837	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I mean, that would take a long time.	92	9
201406	838	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A hundred trillion?	92	9
201406	839	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Do you mean—	92	9
201406	840	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m sorry?	92	9
201406	841	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Did you say “$100 billion” or “$100 trillion”?	92	9
201406	842	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I said “$100 billion.”	92	9
201406	843	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t say “$100 trillion.”	92	9
201406	844	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That our balance sheet—[Laughter]	92	9
201406	845	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think we know exactly, as the balance sheet shrinks and the amount of reserves goes down, where it is that rates are going to begin to move up in this range.	92	9
201406	846	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	But I don’t think it’s going to be $100 billion.	92	9
201406	847	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think that, at $100 billion, the funds rate would be trading above IOER.	92	9
201406	848	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That makes sense, but it strikes me it would take a while.	92	9
201406	849	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We can find out right away by leaving the RRP rate at 5 or 10 basis points when we raise—	92	9
201406	850	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Absolutely.	92	9
201406	851	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I agree you could do that experiment, as long as you’re comfortable saying, “Here it is.	92	9
201406	852	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s D-Day.	92	9
201406	853	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re raising rates.	92	9
201406	854	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re going to do it.”	92	9
201406	855	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You raise IOER, and rates don’t go up—because they might not—and—	92	9
201406	856	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So they don’t go up when—you know, for a couple of weeks—so we miss the liftoff by a couple of weeks.	92	9
201406	857	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We raise the RRP rate at the next meeting.	92	9
201406	858	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	This is clearly an issue before the Committee, but I would be nervous, I guess, that if that happened there would just be a tremendous risk to confidence that markets have in the ability of the Committee to raise rates when the time comes.	92	9
201406	859	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher has a two-hander.	92	9
201406	860	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Well, with regard to Governor Fischer’s comment about the possible vestigial nature of fed funds, we had a discussion at the last meeting about the contractual obligations being $11 trillion.	92	9
201406	861	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Just for point of clarification, did our legal minds give us an answer on that in terms of, if we were to move away from fed funds qua fed funds, does this present a problem from the standpoint of the outstanding $11 trillion in contractual obligations that we discussed at the last meeting?	92	9
201406	862	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think there are a number of issues which are addressed in the previous memo and the memo that you got this time.	92	9
201406	863	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The first one is, how robust is the current effective federal funds rate print?	92	9
201406	864	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And do we feel that we can print the effective federal funds rate in the future, either from the brokered data or the FR-2420?	92	9
201406	865	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Now, the quality of that as a reference rate could get low if the volume in the markets got low.	92	9
201406	866	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And we don’t want a very small cash market supporting $11 trillion of other types of instruments, because that offers lots of incentives for behavior that we don’t want.	92	9
201406	867	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There is another issue if we try to expand the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	868	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If we take option 2, in which basically we start printing an effective federal funds rate which has the Eurodollar transactions there, whether that could lead to contract frustration claims.	92	9
201406	869	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We don’t think that’s a high chance, but that’s a higher risk than under option 1, in which you are printing off the federal funds classic, say, and an overnight bank funding rate, whatever name we go with.	92	9
201406	870	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That was one of the issues we addressed in that memo.	92	9
201406	871	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think any of the lawyers in the room will be able to give us great confidence on this.	92	9
201406	872	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Scott had some reasonably good ideas about how, when we refine the data collection on the FR-2420, we could guide market participants.	92	9
201406	873	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t know, Scott, if you want to explain that.	92	9
201406	874	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	Yes.	92	9
201406	875	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	We think that we could do either of the two options.	92	9
201406	876	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	The advantage of the second option is we think it would have slightly less disruptive effect in the market, the second option being the one in which we continue to print the first effective federal funds rate and create a new rate.	92	9
201406	877	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	That allows the market to self-adjust without changing the expectations around the first effective fed funds rate.	92	9
201406	878	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	On the other hand, either way the parties in some contracts are going to want to renegotiate their terms based on the information that is available.	92	9
201406	879	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	Our rate is put out there not as one that we expect the markets to use, but just as information that we make available to the public and that they are able to use as they want.	92	9
201406	880	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	As long as we give them notice about how we are changing those rates and we give them various options, we give the market more flexibility to adjust its contracts.	92	9
201406	881	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	And so we think the second one gives it a little more flexibility.	92	9
201406	882	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s option 1 in the way we described this, Scott, is that right?	92	9
201406	883	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Yes, I think it is, so—	92	9
201406	884	2014-06-18	meeting	ALVAREZ	Okay.	92	9
201406	885	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	One of the problems with option 1, or, as Scott called it, option 2, is we are still printing the effective federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	886	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So shifting people from those contracts which have the effective federal funds rate might be harder to do.	92	9
201406	887	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And we can’t really say that it’s a very bad rate that we’re printing, but we’d like to persuade people to move to the more robust rate.	92	9
201406	888	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	A lot of the reference-rate work that Governor Powell is going to be involved in is trying to make sure that reference rates are more robust in the future.	92	9
201406	889	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And the effective rate that we are currently printing doesn’t have some of the characteristics you’d like of a robust rate.	92	9
201406	890	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell with a two-hander.	92	9
201406	891	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m sorry.	92	9
201406	892	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, do you want to—	92	9
201406	893	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’m just trying to decide, does this interfere with our deciding between option 1 and 2?	92	9
201406	894	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It sounds like option 1 is a little more friendly.	92	9
201406	895	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think it is.	92	9
201406	896	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Under option 1, the push to move from the federal funds classic is less big.	92	9
201406	897	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We could indicate through the data collection that we believe that this overnight bank funding rate is a more robust rate and try to make it clear from that.	92	9
201406	898	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you very much.	92	9
201406	899	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell, a two-hander, and then we’re going to go back to our—	92	9
201406	900	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I was going to talk about this in my comments, but because of the LIBOR work that I have been involved in, I’ve spent a fair amount of time on this contract frustration issue, and my answer to the question of do we need to let the contract frustration issue drive this is “no.”	92	9
201406	901	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I mean, there are other things that can be weighed back and forth, but under New York law, it’s a very, very difficult case to make, and we’ve got pretty good facts that just wouldn’t fit within any of the precedents that have been done, in my view.	92	9
201406	902	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I no longer have a license to practice law, but that’s my take.	92	9
201406	903	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	904	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	905	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201406	906	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m going to switch the topic completely if I could, and I want to talk about the individual rigid caps.	92	9
201406	907	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is, the purpose of the caps is to deal with broad-based financial-stability concerns.	92	9
201406	908	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s not really intended to deal with micro issues specific to money market funds.	92	9
201406	909	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if we think about the prime money market funds—and Simon mentioned that one-third of their assets are in European bank debt.	92	9
201406	910	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Currently most of that bank debt is paying about 25 basis points.	92	9
201406	911	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it’s a way for the prime funds, in effect, to pay for their management fees, but it doesn’t really get passed on to the investor.	92	9
201406	912	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if all of a sudden we raise rates when Europe isn’t—say we go up by 25 basis points—then the assets that the prime funds previously were investing in are no longer going to be particularly attractive.	92	9
201406	913	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So either investors are going to switch, or the prime funds are going to switch.	92	9
201406	914	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s going to cause variation in individual funds, both in government funds, potentially, and in the prime funds.	92	9
201406	915	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And you might get a situation in which the caps become binding at a time when it was just meant to be a 25-basis-point change that we did that wasn’t done in conjunction with Europe.	92	9
201406	916	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And as a result, the micro decisions that the prime funds have been making result in a bunch of these individual rigid caps becoming binding.	92	9
201406	917	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And now we have something that’s binding not because of a financial-stability concern, and it could be at the very first time we tighten.	92	9
201406	918	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So do you have that concern with the individual caps?	92	9
201406	919	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And do you think the individual caps that are so micro-focused run the risk of not really dealing with broader financial-stability concerns, but maybe much more micro concerns than we’re trying to get at?	92	9
201406	920	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	I don’t think we thought in those terms, but following up on that thought, we looked at the variability of take-up of an individual fund.	92	9
201406	921	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So if you think of the tradeoff during a potential surge between where you set the size of the cap and the frequency of binding of these caps, the aggregate cap has a better tradeoff.	92	9
201406	922	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Because the individual caps are much more volatile, you need a much higher individual cap to get an equal frequency of binding for an individual cap versus an aggregate cap.	92	9
201406	923	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So the individual cap has a less favorable tradeoff than the aggregate cap, whereby you can essentially have a lower aggregate cap and at the same time have the same frequency of binding.	92	9
201406	924	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	That’s one of the arguments I made during the briefing, that you essentially get a better tradeoff between the potential surge and the frequency of the time that you want the caps to bind.	92	9
201406	925	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	That was one of the arguments in favor of the aggregate cap.	92	9
201406	926	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	It wasn’t applied to that specific European case, but that was the underlying argument.	92	9
201406	927	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	One issue is, suppose we do use the overnight RRP as part of the liftoff and we do have caps, we should think very carefully about what might happen as we’re first raising money market rates.	92	9
201406	928	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It wouldn’t be the case, then, that we’d want to trigger one of the caps, because what we’re trying to do is raise rates and use the overnight RRP to make sure we don’t leave any rates behind.	92	9
201406	929	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So I take the point that we should think very carefully, if we do use the overnight RRP, about how flows might change as we are initially raising rates.	92	9
201406	930	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley, a two-hander.	92	9
201406	931	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure it would work exactly the way you outlined, President Rosengren, in the sense that dollar rates can diverge from euro rates, and the difference between those rates gets reflected through the forward foreign exchange rate.	92	9
201406	932	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So even if we raised dollar rates, those European banks would still fund in dollars.	92	9
201406	933	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that they would vanish from the dollar market to go to the euro market to fund themselves.	92	9
201406	934	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think you would see this loss of demand just because our rates rose relative to their rates.	92	9
201406	935	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But their dollar-denominated bank debt in Europe is paying roughly 25 basis points now.	92	9
201406	936	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if you have a choice between buying bank debt of a European bank with a lot of credit risk or a reverse repo with no credit risk at 25 basis points or higher, it does seem that that’s going to cause shifts among either investors or in terms of funds.	92	9
201406	937	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Those European banks would have to pay more.	92	9
201406	938	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s the point.	92	9
201406	939	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We’re raising rates.	92	9
201406	940	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the Europeans aren’t raising rates.	92	9
201406	941	2014-06-18	meeting		[Simultaneous conversation]	92	9
201406	942	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think that’s relevant.	92	9
201406	943	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think it is probably relevant depending on how well the swap market works.	92	9
201406	944	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That is a caveat that you—	92	9
201406	945	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Assuming the markets work in a reasonably efficient way, you’ve got the big change between dollar rates and European rates, and they’ll still fund in dollars.	92	9
201406	946	2014-06-18	meeting	KAMIN	I think most of the demand for dollar funding by European banks is to fund their—	92	9
201406	947	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Dollar book.	92	9
201406	948	2014-06-18	meeting	KAMIN	—dollar assets, exactly, and not so much to arbitrage between investments in dollars and investments in euros—	92	9
201406	949	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	They can fund in euros and then swap it into dollars or they can fund in dollars, you know, to fund their dollar assets, but I don’t think it has quite—	92	9
201406	950	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And efficient markets, if they work properly, they should be exactly the same.	92	9
201406	951	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	They might not be completely efficient at this time.	92	9
201406	952	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201406	953	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We are going back to our one-handed list.	92	9
201406	954	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	955	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201406	956	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	957	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think everyone will be relieved to know that I’m going back to the line of conversation between Bill English and President Lacker.	92	9
201406	958	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	959	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Seriously, I thought it was very important and very interesting.	92	9
201406	960	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there are two kinds of long runs to think about.	92	9
201406	961	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One kind of long run is when interest rates are back to normal.	92	9
201406	962	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So interest rates are back in the 3 to 4 percent range, consistent with what the Committee thinks is back to normal.	92	9
201406	963	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think a lot of these issues that seem very important right now, about 20 basis point spreads versus 40 basis point spreads, are basically very important right now because of the fact that we’re going to be raising rates from 25 to 50 basis points.	92	9
201406	964	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think when we’re back to the 3 to 4 percent range, I don’t see those questions as probably being as material.	92	9
201406	965	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So my question is, how easy would it be to vary the usage of the facility, the overnight reverse repo facility, as we raise rates?	92	9
201406	966	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we think about allowing the spread to increase between the two rates as we were to raise rates, is that doable?	92	9
201406	967	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is there a technical problem with that?	92	9
201406	968	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think so.	92	9
201406	969	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As I said earlier in my remarks to President Lacker, I think as the balance sheet shrinks—so your long run, is it as rates go up or as the balance sheet shrinks?	92	9
201406	970	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	What I had in mind was more the likelihood that, as the balance sheet shrinks, the additional control we get from the overnight RRP will become much less consequential—	92	9
201406	971	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I understood your point.	92	9
201406	972	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	—and, as I said, can be allowed to wither away if that was what the Committee—	92	9
201406	973	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	No, I understood your logic, and I thought that made perfect sense, although that long run, as President Lacker pointed out, is what one might call the very long run, and I’m anticipating a more—	92	9
201406	974	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So you’re thinking 2017.	92	9
201406	975	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	2017, 2018, 2019.	92	9
201406	976	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In any event, a nearer long run when we’re getting back to normalization of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	977	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	At that time, the Committee could choose to lower overnight RRP relative to IOER.	92	9
201406	978	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	In some sense, it might be an experiment to see how much control you’re getting from IOER and how much control you lose by lowering the overnight RRP rate.	92	9
201406	979	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I know Simon probably has more thoughts.	92	9
201406	980	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There’s control on the overnight rates and the effect on financial conditions.	92	9
201406	981	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	When we get to 2017, 2018, the regulatory environment will be fixed.	92	9
201406	982	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Everyone will be in that new regulatory environment.	92	9
201406	983	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We have to look at what the best way of implementing monetary policy is in that regulatory environment, and that could look quite different from the way it looked in 2000.	92	9
201406	984	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Could I ask a follow-up, Chair?	92	9
201406	985	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Bill English, you gave some sample language about the use of the facility.	92	9
201406	986	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess this is more a question for the Desk.	92	9
201406	987	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Suppose the Committee were to announce that in the long run we do not plan to be using the overnight reverse repo facility as part of the implementation of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	988	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Do you think that would cause significant disruptions in our ability to use it in the near term?	92	9
201406	989	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I would say that you might have to pay up 1 or 2 basis points to get the same interest rate control, but, no, if you said, you know, once the balance sheet gets down to $200 billion above currency, we’ll no longer use the overnight RRP—that is significantly far off.	92	9
201406	990	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I mean, in the modal estimate, it’s six or seven years away.	92	9
201406	991	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	In expected value, it might be an infinite amount away.	92	9
201406	992	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So they probably wouldn’t care about it.	92	9
201406	993	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	92	9
201406	994	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	92	9
201406	995	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	996	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201406	997	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	998	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let me pick up where President Kocherlakota left off, because my first question—I have two—but he just asked one, which was would the ON RRP effectiveness be reduced if we announced explicitly that this is only going to be a temporary program and we have no intention of it being permanent.	92	9
201406	999	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So the answer is not really, not much difference.	92	9
201406	1000	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Not on the interest-rate control.	92	9
201406	1001	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	92	9
201406	1002	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	All right.	92	9
201406	1003	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So the second one is, I personally think it’s going to be tough to end this overnight RRP program.	92	9
201406	1004	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I keep thinking about what the permanent consequences of it are.	92	9
201406	1005	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to ask a question along those lines.	92	9
201406	1006	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And I think we would benefit if we, sooner rather than later, had some of the scenario analysis.	92	9
201406	1007	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But if we are thinking about how to understand the long-run implications of using the overnight RRP program with our monetary policy tools, how would the overnight RRP rate behave during a global risk event?	92	9
201406	1008	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Suppose there’s a global risk event.	92	9
201406	1009	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	There’s a lot of risk aversion somewhere else in the world at a time when the United States is running the more normal funds rate, say 4 percent, and in fact, the economy is doing well and maybe we’re worried about inflation.	92	9
201406	1010	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Following up on Governor Fischer’s question, which I interpreted as maybe we don’t need the funds rate, so maybe it’s the overnight rate that is a big policy indicator, and we’re running an aggregate cap with flight to quality.	92	9
201406	1011	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We hit the cap.	92	9
201406	1012	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	The overnight rate is going to run down at a time when we’re posturing that we probably need tighter policy.	92	9
201406	1013	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	How are we thinking about doing monetary policy in a world configuration like that, in which signals are being confused?	92	9
201406	1014	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So in this world, the aggregate cap is triggered.	92	9
201406	1015	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The uniform price auction comes in, and then the rate that clears that auction goes down.	92	9
201406	1016	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	And the next week in the example, the take-up can go up in the overnight RRP and the cap resets to a large amount.	92	9
201406	1017	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So you have that temporary effect there.	92	9
201406	1018	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If you had a more rigid cap, you would still have flight-to- quality flows into the United States, into other markets, that would be affecting those rates.	92	9
201406	1019	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Suppose the Committee had an attitude that we really didn’t want to increase beyond this cap very much; that, you know, we’re willing to use this, but we don’t—	92	9
201406	1020	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So then what you’re going to see is if people really want to get into US assets, they will tier through various US assets at that point, which effectively will ease financial conditions in the United States, which you might not like.	92	9
201406	1021	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	With the overnight RRP, you have a little bit more control of that because you’re fixing that rate.	92	9
201406	1022	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So in the past we would—you know, when we had a funds rate that we controlled, I mean, we could control it, and Treasury rates would start plummeting, like the Asian financial crisis, and so depending on how things got priced off that, mortgage rates fell in that time period and in another time period they might not.	92	9
201406	1023	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But all of a sudden this could lead to even more exuberance on the part of the economy at a time when you think that inflation is overheating.	92	9
201406	1024	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	If it’s a global event that’s taking place somewhere else more than in the United States, how are we going to implement a tighter policy?	92	9
201406	1025	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I mean, if—	92	9
201406	1026	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Well, an overnight RRP would let you do that more easily than other mechanisms we have, subject to how much take-up—	92	9
201406	1027	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But the rate has gone down.	92	9
201406	1028	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	No, no.	92	9
201406	1029	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	You’re not meddling with the rate.	92	9
201406	1030	2014-06-18	meeting		[Simultaneous conversation]	92	9
201406	1031	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Well, that’s if you let the cap go.	92	9
201406	1032	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Yes, that’s if you let the cap go first.	92	9
201406	1033	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If you don’t—	92	9
201406	1034	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But if you have an attitude that you don’t really want to play around with that cap, I mean—so these are a lot of choices that have to be made.	92	9
201406	1035	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	These are choices that the private sector is making and we’re moving along with them, or we can be more explicitly making those choices.	92	9
201406	1036	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it’s that different of a world.	92	9
201406	1037	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	There’s nothing specific, though, about the behavior of the facility in that case.	92	9
201406	1038	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	It’s just behaving like a Treasury bill, right?	92	9
201406	1039	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So that’s what a Treasury bill would do, and in fact, it’s intended to mimic the same dynamics that you’ve seen out of safe assets.	92	9
201406	1040	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	There is a lot of demand.	92	9
201406	1041	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The price goes up and the rates go down based on demand.	92	9
201406	1042	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	It wouldn’t be idiosyncratic to the facility.	92	9
201406	1043	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	It’s just like the behavior of short-term safe assets.	92	9
201406	1044	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Right.	92	9
201406	1045	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In the past, though, we could sort of keep the funds rate firm and point to the markets doing that.	92	9
201406	1046	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We weren’t doing this.	92	9
201406	1047	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Now our policy rate would be moving down.	92	9
201406	1048	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So—	92	9
201406	1049	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The policy rate is not moving down, I don’t think, in the way that we described it.	92	9
201406	1050	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, the market clearing price is going down.	92	9
201406	1051	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The market clearing price is going down at one of the auctions in which this happens, and then it depends how big that is.	92	9
201406	1052	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’ll show you the size of the flow, but I don’t think that’s your policy rate.	92	9
201406	1053	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	One point we try to make clear in the memo is that this is really meant to be a circuit breaker, to give you some time to reassess what conditions in markets are and what the appropriate response is that is warranted at that point.	92	9
201406	1054	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	You could decide to lower the overnight RRP or you could decide to play with the caps.	92	9
201406	1055	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	You could decide to do whatever you decide to do.	92	9
201406	1056	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	The caps are not meant to entirely solve your problem right there.	92	9
201406	1057	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	They’re just supposed to give you some time, as a circuit breaker would work, to reassess conditions and decide what the appropriate response will be.	92	9
201406	1058	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I have a two-hander from Governor Fischer.	92	9
201406	1059	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, I mean, in these circumstances you’d have to use the rate, and it would be the same today as well.	92	9
201406	1060	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t see that there’s any new principle that’s being introduced in this.	92	9
201406	1061	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It’s only because the United States is so big that we think that we can be indifferent to what’s going on in the rest of the world.	92	9
201406	1062	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	When conditions change in the rest of the world, they accept that they’re a little country.	92	9
201406	1063	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	They adjust the rate as well as the quantities, and we’re getting to be relatively smaller than we used to be.	92	9
201406	1064	2014-06-18	meeting	KAMIN	I would add that lately we haven’t seen too many instances in which the rest of the world has gone risk-off, in other words, flight to safety, and the US financial system has remained risk-on.	92	9
201406	1065	2014-06-18	meeting	KAMIN	Usually, when we see is spikes of risk aversion abroad, we see spikes of risk aversion in US markets.	92	9
201406	1066	2014-06-18	meeting	KAMIN	And so you could imagine some geopolitical event abroad spiking the usual increase in corporate credit spreads and declines in stock prices, wherein—although that would be a decision for you to make—some reduction in the fed funds rate might not be amiss.	92	9
201406	1067	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I thought your scenario was one in which we didn’t want to reduce the policy rate.	92	9
201406	1068	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Maybe I misunderstood.	92	9
201406	1069	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Right—it was one in which we still thought that there could be inflationary pressures in the United States.	92	9
201406	1070	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So they raise the overnight RRP rate—	92	9
201406	1071	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	No, but there’s a flight to quality.	92	9
201406	1072	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So they’re busting through the cap.	92	9
201406	1073	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	But then the next week people know that the cap is going to go up.	92	9
201406	1074	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So rates—	92	9
201406	1075	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Oh, no.	92	9
201406	1076	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s if you’re—okay.	92	9
201406	1077	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So that’s a choice, which is you’re willing to play around with the cap.	92	9
201406	1078	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I’ve sort of listened to some of the commentary around the table, and I don’t think that there’s going to be the same type of—	92	9
201406	1079	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	President Evans, the weekly average has gone up, which moves up—	92	9
201406	1080	2014-06-18	meeting		[Simultaneous conversation]	92	9
201406	1081	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	If I can clarify something at least—it’s either the cap or the rate, right?	92	9
201406	1082	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You either set a quantity or a price, and I think President Evans is suggesting that you don’t want to raise the quantity because you have concerns about the quantity.	92	9
201406	1083	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Then you’re going to have to let the price fall.	92	9
201406	1084	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And that’s a basic monetary policy issue.	92	9
201406	1085	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternatively, if you want to raise the rate and you want to do whatever you think is right for monetary policy, you’re going to have to, at least over some period of time—maybe not immediately, as Fabio was saying—let the cap be much higher.	92	9
201406	1086	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Also, it’s the aggregate that matters here.	92	9
201406	1087	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	So it depends what kind of mechanism you have set up.	92	9
201406	1088	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	If you adjust based on usage during the previous week and you reset quickly, then the cap moves itself up to accommodate demand, and the price impact is going to be lessened.	92	9
201406	1089	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	92	9
201406	1090	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	One thing, I mentioned is that this is intended to be an example in a more mature period.	92	9
201406	1091	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So we have to decide what the size of our balance sheet is so that we have sufficient assets on our balance sheet so that we could expand it into, potentially, a very large cap if there was a tremendous flight to quality.	92	9
201406	1092	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We’d have to be making some contingency decisions about how we’d want to be able to allow that cap to increase.	92	9
201406	1093	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	There are a lot of moving parts in this, and we’re familiar with the way we’ve thought about it when we have a funds rate as the instrument and the Treasury market responds as it does to market forces.	92	9
201406	1094	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And I think it is incumbent upon us to just think through these issues in a careful, clear fashion sooner rather than later.	92	9
201406	1095	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s really my only point.	92	9
201406	1096	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	President Evans, I think we have been trying to think through them in a clear way.	92	9
201406	1097	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	If the balance sheet gets smaller, then we’d have to think about whether you want to keep the overnight RRP.	92	9
201406	1098	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There are many reasons separate from interest rate control that this is an operation the Federal Reserve might want to offer, reasons to do with the regulatory changes and other things, such as the provision of safe assets.	92	9
201406	1099	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think we’re focusing a lot on the normalization part and the negative parts to do with the disruptive surges.	92	9
201406	1100	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There are other reasons why we might want to offer a facility like this.	92	9
201406	1101	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	On net, you might still want to do it.	92	9
201406	1102	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s separate from the normalization issues.	92	9
201406	1103	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Right.	92	9
201406	1104	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So maybe I wasn’t clear enough.	92	9
201406	1105	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I meant to be suggesting that this was a question for 5 to 10 years in the future when we’re in that type of setting and we needed to make some choices, not during the normalization period, during which I don’t have that many problems with this.	92	9
201406	1106	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201406	1107	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought this was a very interesting and useful conversation.	92	9
201406	1108	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The part I took away as being especially important is what Fabio said, that the better terminology for these caps is circuit breakers.	92	9
201406	1109	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It will just give the Committee time to think and react.	92	9
201406	1110	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be communicating about them if they are put in place, but the idea that they are hard- wired, I think, is wrong.	92	9
201406	1111	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee will be making state-contingent decisions in a very short period of time to deal with a crisis.	92	9
201406	1112	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would actually push back a little bit on what President Evans said about the need to think through these scenarios.	92	9
201406	1113	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s not humanly possible to think through all of the possible scenarios that will arise in those situations.	92	9
201406	1114	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think staff has done an excellent job of leading us through a wide range of important ones, but I think it’s very challenging for us to be thinking through this in the kind of calm we’re sitting in right now with VIX at whatever it is, 11½—to be thinking about what’s going to happen in these crisis scenarios.	92	9
201406	1115	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	One observation we make in the memo is that, if you want to ease market participants’ concerns about how it would work when the cap binds, how the auction would work, test it and make it bind occasionally.	92	9
201406	1116	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	And you could choose whatever framework you want to make them bind, whether quarter-end or some other period, so that people get used to the idea that the caps might bind once in a while or there could be an auction.	92	9
201406	1117	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	And it’s something that they can plan and they can think of like contingency planning, as opposed to a case in which it never binds, and then after three years it’s binding all the way.	92	9
201406	1118	2014-06-18	meeting	NATALUCCI	Some signal is attached to what the Committee’s intentions are at that point.	92	9
201406	1119	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that’s a helpful idea.	92	9
201406	1120	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think having it bind at quarter- end will be different from having it bind in the middle of a financial panic.	92	9
201406	1121	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Bagehot’s description of the financial panic of 1866, which was like the end of the world, is very helpful in understanding that.	92	9
201406	1122	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it is just really hard to think through how things will work in those situations.	92	9
201406	1123	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	So it’s supposed to bind in those situations to prevent disruptive changes in the funding flow, not to prevent people getting access to a safe asset when they really need that safe asset.	92	9
201406	1124	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201406	1125	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201406	1126	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have come to the end of our list.	92	9
201406	1127	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	So my suggestion at this point is we take a break and have lunch, bring lunch back here, take a 45-minute break.	92	9
201406	1128	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start up again around 1:00, and we’ll have our go-round.	92	9
201406	1129	2014-06-18	meeting		[Lunch break]	92	9
201406	1130	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest that we now move into our go-round in which we’ll address the questions, and let’s start with Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201406	1131	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1132	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And let me apologize in advance for the relative length of these remarks.	92	9
201406	1133	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll try to balance it off by keeping my remarks during the economic go-round short.	92	9
201406	1134	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Before beginning, though, I did want to commend the Chair and the staff for organizing our decision on normalization policies in the way that they have, with a series of discussions in consecutive FOMC meetings preceded by that set of introductory memos we got in April, which have now been supplemented with this additional set of memos that elaborate on some of the issues and questions raised in the April meeting.	92	9
201406	1135	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Having read last week the portion of the April transcript on normalization, I also want to note the openness with which participants considered the issues in that first discussion, the way in which the Chair encouraged productive interaction among participants, and the thoroughness with which the staff has responded in the second set of memos.	92	9
201406	1136	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And I say all this not simply to heap praise on people, but because I actually think it has presented a template for deciding on key issues that will serve us well over the course of the next couple of years.	92	9
201406	1137	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Turning now to the substance of the set of policy issues on normalization, I don’t want to bury my lead, so I’ll say upfront that my basic reaction is a growing uneasiness at the prospect of our normalization process resulting in a large, regularized ON RRP program.	92	9
201406	1138	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I hasten to add that I think we need to have ON RRP among the tools we use during normalization, and with respect to longer-term policies, there’s certainly merit in thinking about the idea of having ON RRP as a permanent tool of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	1139	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	So my uneasiness is grounded not in opposition to the instrument as such, but in a concern that by committing or perhaps overcommitting ourselves now to a large, sustained ON RRP facility, we could be courting unintended and possibly undesirable consequences.	92	9
201406	1140	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	At the April meeting, a number of participants commented on the potentially profound consequences for money markets and for the organization of the financial sector more generally of the creation of a large ON RRP operation.	92	9
201406	1141	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Many of us also noted the possibility that in times of stress, such an operation could exacerbate disintermediation by facilitating a run on assets carrying any credit or liquidity risk in favor of completely safe repos with the Federal Reserve.	92	9
201406	1142	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	A specific concern bridging both these observations was the possibility of the truly ironic outcome whereby the FOMC, nearly all of whose members have publicly identified money market funds as a major threat to financial stability, would have paved the track by which these funds could run from commercial paper, CDs, and other private-sector assets.	92	9
201406	1143	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I think the issue goes beyond this discrete though important consideration.	92	9
201406	1144	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	One might ask, for example, whether a large and permanent ON RRP facility would encourage a range of cash lenders to assume greater risk in the belief that they can quickly shift their asset composition to ON RRPs as circumstances change.	92	9
201406	1145	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Even financial actors that are not certified ON RRP counterparties might take advantage of this safest of havens through a restructuring of the interconnections of financial actors, whereby such actors would have what we might call a standing line of liability with qualified counterparties.	92	9
201406	1146	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The staff memos for this meeting didn’t really address the potential for far-reaching change in business models of various parts of the financial sector.	92	9
201406	1147	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, it would have been asking a lot to expect such analysis in just a few weeks, based on the limited testing that has taken place to date.	92	9
201406	1148	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The memo on counterparties seemed to assume that a greater number of counterparties was desirable precisely because of the intention to use ON RRP as a primary tool of normalization.	92	9
201406	1149	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	In any case, I don’t think we yet have a very good basis for understanding the effects a large, sustained ON RRP program would have.	92	9
201406	1150	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Among other things, I wonder whether such a program would actually be reversible after monetary policy normalization or whether some years from now its contemplated termination would be seen as too disruptive to a reshaped financial sector.	92	9
201406	1151	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The financial-stability concerns from the previous meeting were addressed mainly through a proposal for some variant on a system of caps in order to limit the potential for a surge of disintermediation during a crisis.	92	9
201406	1152	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The memo on financial-stability concerns considers both individual and aggregate caps but forthrightly acknowledges that it’s very difficult to determine what level of cap would best balance the presumed reliance on ON RRP to firm rates and the desire to avoid disruptive surges.	92	9
201406	1153	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, though, I read the suggestion that the cap might be set at average recent use plus as much as $300 billion—the estimated amount of flight to quality in the worst week of the crisis—as tantamount to forgoing this balancing effect by having formal caps that are not practically binding.	92	9
201406	1154	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I at least would be uncomfortable launching a normalization program that essentially subordinated financial-stability concerns to the interests of maximum control over short-term rates.	92	9
201406	1155	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But even if we were to set caps that would be expected to bind, I think there are two concerns.	92	9
201406	1156	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The first and lesser is that they could be a quite visible metric of the flight to quality during a period of stress, assuming that there would be something close to real-time transparency around the usage of ON RRP.	92	9
201406	1157	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	That is, they would provide a kind of play-by-play of increasing stress as funds flowed into the ON RRP program.	92	9
201406	1158	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	The second and more important concern is that the system of binding caps could lack credibility.	92	9
201406	1159	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think there’s some reason for skepticism that the caps would hold in a period of near-crisis, and in fact, I think the characterization by some in the morning session of these as circuit breakers or triggers rather than real caps more accurately captures the institutional dynamic that would ensue.	92	9
201406	1160	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Based on what we know and have discussed to this point, the cap system strikes me as an almost textbook case of a time-consistency problem.	92	9
201406	1161	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	We will grow the ON RRP facility and solemnly indicate that its usage has limits, but then as stress builds and the money markets in which ON RRP will have become such a major part come under pressure for capital conservation, we could be tempted to offer this safe haven without any limit but the size of our balance sheet, at least to those previously qualified as counterparties and maybe to others as well.	92	9
201406	1162	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And, it’s important to note, that might well be the right ex post response under such circumstances, but it’s precisely for this reason that the caps may lack ex ante credibility.	92	9
201406	1163	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	A large-scale flight to quality at the Fed would mean the withdrawal of funding from lots of private balance sheets, a circumstance in which we would doubtless feel considerable pressure, policy and political, to lend the funds that we were borrowing.	92	9
201406	1164	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	In that case, we would once again be in the business of creating our alphabet facilities that de facto affect significantly where relatively scarce credit is flowing in the economy.	92	9
201406	1165	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But in this new world, we might have morphed from being a lender of last resort to an intermediator of something less than last resort.	92	9
201406	1166	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think it’s hard to know how much more disintermediation would take place in a world in which the Fed was providing a safe asset whose price was, at least for a time, insensitive to increased demand over and above the amount we saw actually occur during the last financial crisis.	92	9
201406	1167	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s at least possible that it would be significantly greater and, indeed, that the existence of a large, standing ON RRP program would, by facilitating disintermediation, amplify it during moderate stress periods, such as that we experienced in the late summer of 2011.	92	9
201406	1168	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	More generally, it is possible that such a program would encourage business models of short-term intermediation that would be premised on the ability to exit quickly to a completely safe haven.	92	9
201406	1169	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	To repeat what I said at the outset, I believe we need to include ON RRP in the normalization toolkit, but, subject to further discussion today and between now and our July meeting, my current view is that we should aim for the ON RRP program to play more of a backup role.	92	9
201406	1170	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	If the program does not become and remain predictably large, the odds of unintended and perhaps not fully understood consequences are lower.	92	9
201406	1171	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, even a less prominent use of the program in pursuit of specific monetary policy ends, as opposed to simply for testing, might provide some insight into what the effects of a large, permanent program would be.	92	9
201406	1172	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And I want to add here that I listened with interest to some of the discussion before lunch as to whether we might say at the outset that we would not continue the program after normalization was completed.	92	9
201406	1173	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think that might be a mistake as well.	92	9
201406	1174	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know why we’d necessarily want to rule out the possibility of continuing its use as some form of a monetary policy instrument.	92	9
201406	1175	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	It’s just the growth of it and the consequences that would ensue from the early growth that concern me.	92	9
201406	1176	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, this set of concerns has implications for our choices on normalization policies, and in an effort to be at least somewhat constructive here, I’ve tried to specify for myself what I think those implications are.	92	9
201406	1177	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	First, we should rely principally on the IOER rate to affect interest rates.	92	9
201406	1178	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Second, in order to avoid the need for continuous fine-tuning using ON RRP, to the degree that we set the federal funds rate as a target—whether the current or revised version of the federal funds rate—that target should be a range rather than a specific point.	92	9
201406	1179	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not really sure whether it’s better to have this rate as a target or whether the Committee can instead simply be monitoring the effect of IOER and other instruments on relevant interest rates without setting even a target range, and on that point I’m interested to hear the views of others today.	92	9
201406	1180	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Third, so as to limit the growth of the ON RRP program, the spread should be at least the current 20 basis points.	92	9
201406	1181	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Fourth, a desire to limit, if possible, the size of the ON RRP program means we may need to use some policy tools that, considered individually, may not have seemed particularly attractive.	92	9
201406	1182	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	As is usually the case, policy decisions entail a choice among imperfect alternatives.	92	9
201406	1183	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Since each mix of policy tools carries certain risks alongside its expected efficacy, a tool should not be disqualified simply because it’s arguably less effective than another, since it may entail fewer risks.	92	9
201406	1184	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	So, for example, my uneasiness about a large ON RRP operation has caused me to rethink what was my tentative conclusion that we shouldn’t use a term deposit facility.	92	9
201406	1185	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Fifth, it’s important to note that if the approach suggested in the preceding four points did not produce the firming we desire during the normalization process, we would still be able to expand the use of ON RRPs either by increasing the universe of eligible counterparties or narrowing the spread relative to the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	1186	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I acknowledge that this more eclectic approach compounds what is already a communications challenge for our normalization policies.	92	9
201406	1187	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	An inability to communicate our intentions and expectations with relative clarity might undermine the efficacy of the normalization process itself.	92	9
201406	1188	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I hope that, at least as far as communication in September of our revised exit strategy is concerned, we might be able to describe something that was driven by IOER with reference to the effect on the federal funds rate or some other relevant rates, and that we could refer to other tools, including ON RRP, that would be available to firm interest rate floors if and as needed.	92	9
201406	1189	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But here again, my own calculus of the costs and benefits of this approach would be affected by the views of others, particularly the Chair, on whom the burden of communicating on behalf of the whole Committee will fall, as to the relative communication challenges of this and different approaches.	92	9
201406	1190	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1191	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	May I ask a clarifying question?	92	9
201406	1192	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Governor Tarullo, you used the word “large” a lot in your comments.	92	9
201406	1193	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Can you give me a sense of what “large” is?	92	9
201406	1194	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Well, part of the problem  is that I haven’t been able to get a very good sense of what people are contemplating for the size of the ON RRP program as an ongoing tool to play the kind of role in a corridor system that people had contemplated.	92	9
201406	1195	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I have to say that it seems to me that if it got very much larger than it already is, we would begin to run some of the risks that I identified.	92	9
201406	1196	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So $200 billion is okay?	92	9
201406	1197	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m just trying to get a sense of where you start to get concerned.	92	9
201406	1198	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	It’s fairly easy to say that at current levels I don’t have a high level of concern.	92	9
201406	1199	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Because of my skepticism about how well caps will hold once one is on some sort of trajectory upward, I think my concern may be as much in the way we project it and grow it initially as opposed to the size it actually ends up being.	92	9
201406	1200	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	92	9
201406	1201	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1202	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92	9
201406	1203	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1204	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Let me begin by thanking the staff for the background memos on normalization issues.	92	9
201406	1205	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I thought these were thoroughly done, touching on a wide range of topics that could influence the Committee’s future decisionmaking in this area.	92	9
201406	1206	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I intend to simply walk through the four questions posed in the appendix of the staff memo “Overview of Additional Staff Memos on Normalization” by English and colleagues.	92	9
201406	1207	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The first question concerns the wisdom of keeping the federal funds rate as a primary vehicle for Committee communications regarding the stance of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	1208	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My main comment here is that I think it is risky to keep referring to the federal funds rate or its more elaborate cousin that includes Eurodollar transactions as the main policy focus of the FOMC.	92	9
201406	1209	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	With such high levels of reserves in the banking system, the federal funds rate is a mere shadow of its former self, and it seems unlikely to return to true form over the medium term.	92	9
201406	1210	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Moreover, the expanded version—the overnight bank funding rate—may behave inappropriately in times of stress, as noted in the staff memo on the subject, possibly because of events outside US borders.	92	9
201406	1211	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This could make for a difficult situation to manage if FOMC communications were to be squarely centered on such a rate.	92	9
201406	1212	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The IOER rate, in my view, also has limitations because it is only applicable to the banking system, a shrinking fraction of the financial intermediation sector in the United States.	92	9
201406	1213	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This leaves the overnight reverse repo rate, with its broader system of counterparties, as the most promising candidate for the label of policy rate.	92	9
201406	1214	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The scenarios outlined in the staff analysis suggesting how the overnight RRP rate might be set in conjunction with the IOER rate seemed reasonable to me.	92	9
201406	1215	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I would be open to making some reference to the federal funds rate, but obliquely and in a way that makes it clear that this particular short-term rate does not today carry the importance that it once did.	92	9
201406	1216	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The second question posed concerns the potential circuit breakers to prevent what might be thought of as excessive take-up in the overnight reverse repo program during periods of financial stress.	92	9
201406	1217	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	After reviewing the memo on this topic, I would be willing to support, at least initially, an aggregate cap that would adjust dynamically according to relatively slowly changing macroeconomic conditions.	92	9
201406	1218	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My sense on this is that, should a period of severe financial stress arise in which financial firms are turning to the overnight reverse repo program aggressively, we are probably going to want to allow the cap to be breached to respond to the crisis—and in this respect, I agree with the comments just made by Governor Tarullo that these are not credible caps.	92	9
201406	1219	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But a cap would allow that decision to be made at the time.	92	9
201406	1220	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The decision to move the cap could be made then, at the time, by the Committee and would send a signal that the Committee does not expect extraordinary usage in ordinary times.	92	9
201406	1221	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	One of the most serious issues with the overnight reverse repo program—and here again, I’m agreeing with Governor Tarullo’s comments that he just made—may be the signal being sent by the Fed to nonbank counterparties that they will now be treated almost like banks but without the regulatory apparatus that banks otherwise have.	92	9
201406	1222	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Strictly speaking, we are saying no such thing.	92	9
201406	1223	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But if the impression is created, market pricing can be affected nevertheless.	92	9
201406	1224	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This aspect of the facility bears careful watching as we go forward.	92	9
201406	1225	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So I would describe this as a medium- term to long-term industrial organization issue, as opposed to the operational issues that we have been discussing so far.	92	9
201406	1226	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The third question involves reinvestment of principal on securities holdings.	92	9
201406	1227	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee laid out ending reinvestment as a preliminary step before raising the policy rate in the exit principles of the spring of 2011.	92	9
201406	1228	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’d prefer that we retain this step in the exit principles.	92	9
201406	1229	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, it is a relatively mild way to begin the removal of policy accommodation.	92	9
201406	1230	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Certainly, the staff simulations seem to bear this out, to the extent we have reasonable models of these effects.	92	9
201406	1231	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee has wanted to get back to a more normal-size balance sheet, and the end of reinvestments would provide a relatively mild way to begin to accomplish that task.	92	9
201406	1232	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Even those on the Committee who may be comfortable with a relatively large balance sheet probably do not desire the $4 trillion–plus size that we have now.	92	9
201406	1233	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Among other risks, we will eventually have to pay very large sums to the largest banks in the United States, as well as large foreign banks, through IOER.	92	9
201406	1234	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I remain concerned that this is potentially a political loser for the Fed when this time arrives.	92	9
201406	1235	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	For these reasons, I think we need to get on with ending reinvestment and reducing the size of the balance sheet when we have the opportunity.	92	9
201406	1236	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Without the step of ending reinvestments first, in my view, there will be even more pressure on the date of policy rate liftoff, possibly pulling that date forward from when it would otherwise occur.	92	9
201406	1237	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I would be open to more graduated or managed approaches to ending reinvestment should the Committee wish to go in that direction.	92	9
201406	1238	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We talked a little bit about that in the question-and-answer session earlier.	92	9
201406	1239	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it could be done—instead of just saying, “End reinvestment,” you could do it in a way that said, “We want the balance sheet to go down at a certain pace.”	92	9
201406	1240	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	And I think that would be fine.	92	9
201406	1241	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The fourth question concerns the idea of an expanded definition of the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1242	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In answer to the first question just now, I noted that a definitionally revamped overnight bank funding rate may not behave well in a time of financial stress, possibly because of developments outside the United States, according to a staff memo.	92	9
201406	1243	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This seems to suggest to me that we would not want to go in this direction.	92	9
201406	1244	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The definitionally-revamped overnight bank funding rate would behave well when it does not matter—that is, when fed funds and Eurodollar transactions occur at the same price—and may behave poorly when it does matter—that is, in times of stress.	92	9
201406	1245	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If this is the case, why do it?	92	9
201406	1246	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1247	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1248	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92	9
201406	1249	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1250	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is our third crack at crafting an exit strategy.	92	9
201406	1251	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The second proposed exit strategy looked quite different than the first.	92	9
201406	1252	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This announcement is likely to be quite different than the first or the second.	92	9
201406	1253	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	That we have changed our strategy as the size of our balance sheet and economic circumstances have changed is quite reasonable.	92	9
201406	1254	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, our communication of strategies that were highly dependent on future circumstances was not as effective as we might have liked.	92	9
201406	1255	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	That should provide a significant caution as we consider our future strategy and accompanying communications.	92	9
201406	1256	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are many questions we cannot know the answer to until we have begun the process of normalization.	92	9
201406	1257	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, we do not know how strong the gravitational pull of interest on excess reserves will be on market interest rates as we raise the IOER rate or as we face periods of financial turbulence.	92	9
201406	1258	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We do not know the size of the take-up of our reverse repo facility, both as we raise rates and as institutions like government money market funds adjust to the new facility.	92	9
201406	1259	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nor do we know the extent to which counterparties will flock to our facility during periods of financial turbulence, or how much the use of our reverse repo facility might reduce the willingness to lend to the private sector during periods of financial turbulence.	92	9
201406	1260	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This facility works primarily through money market funds.	92	9
201406	1261	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The SEC is considering significant regulatory changes to money market funds.	92	9
201406	1262	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The money market fund industry may go through significant change as a result of this facility and the SEC regulatory changes.	92	9
201406	1263	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And the nature of these structural changes and their effects on short-term markets are hard to predict at this time.	92	9
201406	1264	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	These are but a few questions that, I think, will be important to better understand over time.	92	9
201406	1265	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are many others.	92	9
201406	1266	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, uncertainty does not excuse inaction, but it is a reason to admit to ourselves and the public that this will be somewhat experimental.	92	9
201406	1267	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	No central bank has exited with this balance sheet and set of instruments before.	92	9
201406	1268	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	How we proceed and what our final destination will be are likely to be influenced by what we learn along the way.	92	9
201406	1269	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we provide too rigid a set of principles in our initial communications, we risk misleading rather than informing the public.	92	9
201406	1270	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We can, of course, only make decisions based on what we know now.	92	9
201406	1271	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But what I am counseling is building flexibility into our processes and communications, consistent with the limits of our current knowledge and with our willingness to adjust as we learn more.	92	9
201406	1272	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our earlier set of exit announcements were necessarily constrained by our knowledge at that time, but they were received by the market as a set of relatively rigid guidelines for exit, which they probably should not and could not have been.	92	9
201406	1273	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Turning to the questions posed to us in the memos, first, our communication strategy should be clear and simple.	92	9
201406	1274	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should announce that we are setting the interest rate on excess reserves as our policy tool.	92	9
201406	1275	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While we should announce that we plan to initially maintain the reverse repo rate at roughly a 15 to 20 basis point discount to the rate of interest on excess reserves, we should make clear that we may alter the spread over time depending on economic circumstances and our experience using these instruments to affect short-term market interest rates.	92	9
201406	1276	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would be opposed to announcing we are targeting the federal funds rate, or any other market rate, until we obtain a better understanding of how the facility functions.	92	9
201406	1277	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should gather more information from the first several tightening actions and then decide, with much fuller information than we have now, about the costs and benefits of moving from administered rates to another set of rates in our communication.	92	9
201406	1278	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Turning to question 2, the main counterparties to this facility are government and prime money market funds.	92	9
201406	1279	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	There has not been much discussion of the implications of this new facility working largely through private money market funds, particularly at a time when the SEC’s regulation is in flux.	92	9
201406	1280	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, money market funds are likely to make more adjustments once the parameters of our program are announced.	92	9
201406	1281	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As for the cap alternatives, since money funds, particularly some wholesale funds, can have quite variable flows, individual caps may be complex and burdensome and during times of stress may even be perverse.	92	9
201406	1282	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, if wholesale investors become worried about a large fund, and there is a significant shift to another fund family, would we want credit concerns about specific fund families to lead to binding individual caps?	92	9
201406	1283	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This could especially be an issue during periods of financial stress, when the credit reliability of a fund family could be questioned.	92	9
201406	1284	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	It should also be noted that a government-only fund, while posing no credit risk, is likely to have a fixed NAV under the expected SEC proposal.	92	9
201406	1285	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This could result in government funds being particularly attractive to hot money in times of financial stress, implying many of these funds may be faced with highly variable investor flows.	92	9
201406	1286	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am quite concerned that individual caps have collateral problems that are poorly understood at this time.	92	9
201406	1287	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would much prefer an aggregate cap.	92	9
201406	1288	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I would set it at a much higher level than was discussed in the memo.	92	9
201406	1289	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We want the cap to be binding during periods of significant stress, but we do not want it to be binding during normal periods, including the end of the quarter, the end of the year, and tax deadlines, when flows in and out of funds have the potential to be much larger than normal, particularly if this becomes an attractive vehicle for both corporate and retail investors.	92	9
201406	1290	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would set a large cap relative to our balance sheet that could be triggered only in quite stressful times.	92	9
201406	1291	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The whole purpose of this facility is to tighten the spread under the short-term market rates relative to the rate of interest on reserves.	92	9
201406	1292	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We want that to be binding unless there is significant financial instability, in which case the caps are binding, but we are also likely to be considering lowering significantly the reverse repo rate and, if it is likely to be of macroeconomic consequence, also the rate of interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201406	1293	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Question number 3—our taper strategy has been gradual, consistent, and transparent.	92	9
201406	1294	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Markets appear to have found this predictability reassuring.	92	9
201406	1295	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Rates and volatility have shown little reaction to our previous meetings’ decisions to taper our purchases.	92	9
201406	1296	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Learning from this experience, I would not make reinvestment discrete.	92	9
201406	1297	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Rather, I would, at the appropriate time, begin a somewhat symmetric taper of our reinvestments, reinvesting a percentage of principal repayments and reducing that percentage in a consistent and gradual way.	92	9
201406	1298	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The hurdle for changing the tapering path for reinvestment would be similar to that for the current tapering program.	92	9
201406	1299	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is, we would continue on that path as long as we do not experience significant, unexpected changes to our economic forecast, either up or down.	92	9
201406	1300	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of when to start the reinvestment taper, I would make that dependent on the economic situation at the end of the year.	92	9
201406	1301	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We might expect a diminished reinvestment around the time of our first rate increase, but we would move that forward in time if the economy is growing unexpectedly fast and put it back in time if the economy is disappointing.	92	9
201406	1302	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For question 4, I am in favor of publishing an expanded benchmark as an additional benchmark rate.	92	9
201406	1303	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Until we have some experience with tightening rates, I would not use the current federal funds rate, or this additional benchmark, for anything other than informational purposes.	92	9
201406	1304	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, we should proceed cautiously and flexibly.	92	9
201406	1305	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should acknowledge that we are very likely to make changes as we learn from our initial actions.	92	9
201406	1306	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should not make any decisions about future operating procedures or what the eventual size of our balance sheet will be until we better understand the transition.	92	9
201406	1307	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect that this facility will be successful and may become our future operating procedure.	92	9
201406	1308	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Allowing the short-term interest rate decision to be separate from the balance sheet decision gives us an important tool that we may want to use in the future.	92	9
201406	1309	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, there should be a broader discussion of our strategy in the context of financial stability.	92	9
201406	1310	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, we may find value in keeping some MBS on the balance sheet, both for adjusting interest rates in some circumstances and for signaling in the event of another housing price bubble.	92	9
201406	1311	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Having some direct effect on long rates, as well as short rates, may be useful both for achieving our dual mandate and also for addressing financial-stability concerns, as our regulatory tools have long implementation lags and are cumbersome to use effectively.	92	9
201406	1312	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I hope we continue to have an open mind until we better understand this facility.	92	9
201406	1313	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1314	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92	9
201406	1315	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92	9
201406	1316	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1317	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Kudos, again, to the Board staff for comprehensive memos and presentations.	92	9
201406	1318	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, these questions have implications for monetary control, communications, and financial stability.	92	9
201406	1319	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	To begin, I just want to reiterate my support for the areas of common ground that are listed in exhibit 1 of the handout, especially, as President Rosengren mentioned himself, the need both for flexibility in our approach over the next few years and to recognize that we will be doing a lot of learning along this path.	92	9
201406	1320	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we want to make sure we set up a plan that both allows for that flexibility and recognizes the need to learn along the way.	92	9
201406	1321	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	To preview my answers to the four questions, my preference is that we initially target a range for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1322	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I believe that varying the interest rate on excess reserves and the reverse repo rate should be sufficient to achieve a reasonable target range—say, 25 basis points.	92	9
201406	1323	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of reverse repos and the need for caps, for financial-stability issues, I do think that aggregate quantity caps make sense as circuit breakers.	92	9
201406	1324	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d prefer these to be static rather than dynamic.	92	9
201406	1325	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I support delaying the end of reinvestments until sometime after liftoff.	92	9
201406	1326	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, I am for having the New York Fed publish an expanded federal funds benchmark as a new rate, not as a substitute.	92	9
201406	1327	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let me expand on each of these points.	92	9
201406	1328	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, monetary control and financial stability both call for continuing to emphasize the fed funds rate during normalization.	92	9
201406	1329	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most of the time, an administered overnight repo rate would provide similar monetary control of relevant short- term rates, but I do think targeting a market rate like the fed funds rate has an advantage, and that is that there can be times when there are idiosyncratic factors that drive the repo rate down or up, causing the spread from that repo rate to the market rate to be moved around.	92	9
201406	1330	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going back to a principle from William Poole’s 1970 article in, targeting a market rate like the federal funds rate insulates you from idiosyncratic factors that create spreads between that and the repo rate and acts as an automatic stabilizer.	92	9
201406	1331	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s my argument for why a market rate is better than the overnight repo rate.	92	9
201406	1332	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of communications, our lengthy briefings and discussions on this issue make it clear that normalization is already complicated enough.	92	9
201406	1333	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, where possible, I think we’ve got to keep our procedures simple and familiar and make it easier for the public to understand our policies.	92	9
201406	1334	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And as I said back in April, the fed funds rate may not be perfect, but it is well known.	92	9
201406	1335	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to the question of a point target versus a targeted range—I strongly support a range as we start this process of normalization.	92	9
201406	1336	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	A quarter-point range will provide sufficient macroeconomic control, while reducing pressure to immediately perfect our use of the IOER rate and the reverse repo facility.	92	9
201406	1337	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, over time we will learn how to best control the fed funds rate with these instruments.	92	9
201406	1338	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We will also learn about how much take-up there will be on the overnight reverse repo facility.	92	9
201406	1339	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And as we get that information, and we get a finer understanding of this, we can transition to a point target at some point in the future.	92	9
201406	1340	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But to my mind, the most important thing we need to do in this early stage of normalization is to make sure that we can demonstrate to the public our confidence in our ability to control market interest rates per the requirements or per the desires or as needed for monetary policy goals.	92	9
201406	1341	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the early stages, I really see the need to focus attention on the fact that we have an interest rate we are trying to raise for macroeconomic reasons, and we are able to do it through the facilities we have.	92	9
201406	1342	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the second question, when it comes to circuit breakers on the overnight reverse repo facility, some sort of static cap would be simple and preferred.	92	9
201406	1343	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Dynamic caps are potentially subject to gaming and actually create some incentives for firms to use the facility more.	92	9
201406	1344	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, they are hard to properly calibrate, as said in some of the earlier conversations we had today, and I also think they are just more difficult to communicate.	92	9
201406	1345	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recommend that we let the Committee adjust the cap as needed, as we learn more about the market take-up and behavior.	92	9
201406	1346	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, thinking of this as the early decision, it would be to have an aggregate fixed static cap, but then as we learn more over the next six months or a year after we start this process, we could adjust that.	92	9
201406	1347	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Third, I favor ending reinvestment sometime after liftoff.	92	9
201406	1348	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My views on this are similar to how Governor Tarullo set up that question.	92	9
201406	1349	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Stopping reinvestment six months earlier or later should have negligible economic or financial effects.	92	9
201406	1350	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is just not a first-order policy decision in terms of the effects on the economic outlook and in terms of achievement of goals.	92	9
201406	1351	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, ending reinvestment before liftoff, or even at the time of liftoff, could be counterproductive because markets may see this, like they did last year, as a signal of a shift in direction toward much tighter policy by the Committee.	92	9
201406	1352	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would rather avoid the problem of sending confusing signals by taking reinvestment off the table until we have the normalization of the funds rate well under way.	92	9
201406	1353	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In a way, I think of this as wanting to get the reinvestment decision off the front page of the paper and buried in the back of the business section, because that really is the level of effect it has on the economy.	92	9
201406	1354	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would not be more specific than that regarding the timing of the ending of reinvestment—there were some ideas of linking it to the interest rate or economic conditions.	92	9
201406	1355	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think we want to have that flexibility, for the reasons a number of people have already mentioned, to be able to make that decision based on economic conditions and financial conditions.	92	9
201406	1356	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And when we do end reinvestment, we should keep it simple, and I would argue against trying to smooth the week-to-week or month-to-month reinvestment rates or trying to taper it.	92	9
201406	1357	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think, again, this is not a first-order macro or financial event.	92	9
201406	1358	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think what we really need to do is just execute a plan.	92	9
201406	1359	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the lessons I took—I guess we all take different lessons from events—was that once we started executing the taper, it went very smoothly.	92	9
201406	1360	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think that we really need to worry as much about market functioning around the ending of the reinvestment.	92	9
201406	1361	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, if there were real problems in market functioning, those should be taken into account.	92	9
201406	1362	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Fourth, I support publishing the expanded rate that includes Eurodollar transactions as an additional rate.	92	9
201406	1363	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The rate on actual federal funds transactions, which would of course take advantage of the new FR-2420, would remain the basis of our communications, in my view.	92	9
201406	1364	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Focusing on fed funds transactions is simpler to communicate and should be fine for monetary control.	92	9
201406	1365	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the expanded rate might be more precise but offers limited benefits at this point in terms of our monetary policy target.	92	9
201406	1366	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, I am all for developing that.	92	9
201406	1367	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me finish up with some broader observations linked to some comments from the previous meeting and from President Kocherlakota and President Evans earlier about learning, language, and war-gaming.	92	9
201406	1368	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We are going to learn a lot about this after we start this process.	92	9
201406	1369	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think we should start the normalization with familiar tools and terminology, wherever possible, and later changes then can be an evolution and not a reversal.	92	9
201406	1370	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given that, the language we use in the revised exit principles should not lock us in unnecessarily.	92	9
201406	1371	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, highlighting a range for the funds rate now would provide flexibility, and we can later narrow that range to a point, if it’s appropriate.	92	9
201406	1372	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of future statement language, draft 3', which provides a fed funds range, could be more explicit that the reverse repo facility supports the implementation of our federal funds rate target.	92	9
201406	1373	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So rather than saying, “The Committee authorizes the Open Market Desk to execute overnight reverse repo agreements at a rate of 30 basis points,”	92	9
201406	1374	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would prefer to say something like, “Consistent with this decision”—the decision about the federal funds rate target range—“the Committee authorizes the Open Market Desk to execute the reverse repo operations.”	92	9
201406	1375	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think a really open question is, where do we want this spread to be—and also, getting back to Governor Tarullo’s comments, how much take-up do we really want from this facility?	92	9
201406	1376	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those, again, are things we will learn when we are actually doing it.	92	9
201406	1377	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right now, we can maybe just guess.	92	9
201406	1378	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And finally, as President Kocherlakota said in April, and as President Evans brought up, I do think we really need to think through or wargame some of these scenarios, and the scenarios that I think are more interesting are not like the fall of 2008.	92	9
201406	1379	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the fall of 2008, you’re cutting the funds rate to zero.	92	9
201406	1380	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	You’re driving all interest rates to zero.	92	9
201406	1381	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s kind of a no-brainer from the point of view of thinking about some of these issues around market operations.	92	9
201406	1382	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you think more about a stress situation like in the Asian financial crisis and around that time, maybe even late 2007 and early 2008, when there were runs to safe assets but we actually had a target fed funds rate that was significantly above zero.	92	9
201406	1383	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So then you start thinking about scenarios in which you are trying to maintain monetary policy control for dual-mandate reasons, at the same time that you are trying to deal with the fact that there is dislocation in the reverse repo or the Treasury market, and thinking about how these various arrangements and also how these caps could actually work.	92	9
201406	1384	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that President Evans was pushing arguments along this line.	92	9
201406	1385	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do think we should be thinking through those, and how we expect it would work, and to what extent we would need to have monetary policy decisions changing the interest rates in addition to the actual functioning of the facilities as set up.	92	9
201406	1386	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, the big question that has come up a number of times—President Kocherlakota brought it up at the previous meeting—is the credibility or the time-inconsistency of these caps.	92	9
201406	1387	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In war-gaming this, we have to be realistic and think about how we would really behave in these stress scenarios, rather than what we would declare.	92	9
201406	1388	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that this is something we should just continue to discuss and think about.	92	9
201406	1389	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you very much.	92	9
201406	1390	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201406	1391	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1392	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a follow-up question for President Williams.	92	9
201406	1393	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even in the fall of 2008, if we’d had this facility, couldn’t the Committee have thought about setting that rate negative?	92	9
201406	1394	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s still an issue of being able to adjust the spread even though you’re going to be driving the level down.	92	9
201406	1395	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s absolutely right, but again, I think that maybe the more interesting scenario is when you’re actually—	92	9
201406	1396	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wasn’t disagreeing with that.	92	9
201406	1397	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1398	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	92	9
201406	1399	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	If I may, Madam Chair, I’d first like to welcome two old friends to the Committee, Stan Fischer and Lael Brainard, and I suggest that we garnish Governor Fischer’s substantial new wages to pay me back for all the times he used the treadmill at the Hotel Okura and charged it to my room over in the—	92	9
201406	1400	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	1401	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And as to Governor Brainard, I had the pleasure of working with her—actually, under her tight control—for four years during the Clinton Administration.	92	9
201406	1402	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	So I want to welcome both of you.	92	9
201406	1403	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As I mentioned in the previous meeting, we are in the process of evolution.	92	9
201406	1404	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I went back to Roosa, Volcker, Sternlight, Fisher, and now you, Simon Potter—obviously this discussion has informed this evolution enormously.	92	9
201406	1405	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I found the previous meeting and this meeting, particularly the first parts of these meetings, to be enormously informative and very, very helpful, as well as the papers that were delivered, and I do want to give credit to everybody that prepared those papers and thank them for them.	92	9
201406	1406	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But I do think we need to proceed deliberately, and I’m going to answer the questions with that in mind, bearing in mind again, as I mentioned earlier, that unlike in the old days, we in essence are only one-quarter or maybe one-fifth of the credit system, and we have to be mindful of that fact as we process these different questions.	92	9
201406	1407	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I was captivated by and am in full agreement with Governor Tarullo’s statement and also, shockingly, increasingly over time thinking more and more like President Rosengren.	92	9
201406	1408	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But to start out with question 1, I do think we ought to use the IOER rate as the principal tool to affect interest rates.	92	9
201406	1409	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I have a concern about the ON RRP program.	92	9
201406	1410	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I want to talk about that in just a second, but I do think that basically the principal tool to affect interest rates is the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	1411	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the ON RRP program, I was affected by the discussion we had today about using it as a circuit breaker.	92	9
201406	1412	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I think that makes eminent sense.	92	9
201406	1413	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I have concerns, however—and I hope the New York Desk will forgive me—I don’t mean this critically, but when, for example, we looked at exhibit 4, item number 22, and you mentioned your option was to add more counterparties of the current types, there’s a little bit of a “more the merrier” tune that comes through the memo that was written in terms of the review of the counterparty framework for overnight RRP operations, and I think we have to be careful here.	92	9
201406	1414	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I think there ought to be a clear and principled dividing line between those with access to that facility and those without.	92	9
201406	1415	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We could discuss what that dividing line should be.	92	9
201406	1416	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	My concern, Madam Chair, is that—and maybe this is what Governor Tarullo was saying—I don’t have a sense of final dimension here.	92	9
201406	1417	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And I’m worried, given the fact that there are so many possible counterparties, and given the fact that we’re one-quarter or one-fifth of the credit system, that this could grow like Topsy and maybe grow slightly out of control.	92	9
201406	1418	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We can’t be all things to all people, and we have to figure out what the strict limitations and definitions are.	92	9
201406	1419	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’m not saying we should not have RRP operations, but I personally struggle with what the order of dimension will be.	92	9
201406	1420	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I could make a case that, if we had a clear and principled dividing line, we would include depository institutions—our traditional Fed partners—the Federal Home Loan Banks, the housing GSEs, and government money market funds.	92	9
201406	1421	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I could make a case for excluding the prime money market funds.	92	9
201406	1422	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But I am a little bit worried that if we just keep adding more, we might create something that puts us in a place of being too much a part of the market, and I just wanted to voice that honestly and frankly to the Desk and to the rest of the folks at the table.	92	9
201406	1423	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With regard to the issue of reinvestment of principal, I think President Rosengren makes a very good point.	92	9
201406	1424	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I view that as a signaling device, and as much as we want to define forward guidance with specificity, as much as we try to define an exit principle with great specificity, as President Rosengren pointed out, we’ve had two goes at it before.	92	9
201406	1425	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	This is very much a matter of feel.	92	9
201406	1426	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The term “war-gaming” has been used quite a bit in today’s discussion.	92	9
201406	1427	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The old way to conduct a war is, you didn’t shoot until you saw the whites of the eyes of your opponents.	92	9
201406	1428	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With modern technology and modern modeling and so on, that’s been affected, but I mention that only because I would feel comfortable moving the base rate up once we see the whites of the eyes of a full recovery and meeting the dual mandate.	92	9
201406	1429	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	There may be a utility in using the reinvestment tool as we feel more confident, but don’t quite have the absolute level of confidence we would need to raise the base rate, depending on how the economy evolves, as President Rosengren said.	92	9
201406	1430	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it makes a huge difference in terms of affecting the size of the balance sheet, but it is a signaling device.	92	9
201406	1431	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I would be in favor of keeping open the option of tapering back our repurchases—I think, President Rosengren, you used the phrase “symmetric reduction”—in order to send a signal to the market that we’re increasingly confident and it’s a bridge to raising the base rate.	92	9
201406	1432	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Because the other thing I feel very strongly about, and I’ve discussed this with you offline, Madam Chair, is that when we decide to raise the base rate, I don’t want to do things in a sudden, old-fashioned way.	92	9
201406	1433	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to do it by a quarter-point or maybe less than a quarter-point at a time.	92	9
201406	1434	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	So those are my feelings on the reinvestment of principal.	92	9
201406	1435	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As to the fourth point, I am in favor of continuing to publish something very much like the current funds rate, but maybe described as the overnight bank funding rate that would capture trades in the overnight Eurodollar market.	92	9
201406	1436	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We had a little discussion there, clarified and then confused by our great legal counsel, but I’m basically arguing the case that option 1 might be the easiest thing to do from the standpoint of the transactional commitments that exist in the marketplace.	92	9
201406	1437	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And I think one of the benefits of that would be that limiting to domestic institutions and US offices of foreign institutions could blunt the political criticism we might receive if there was a sense that we were providing a facility that’s unduly influenced by foreign borrowing costs.	92	9
201406	1438	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Those are my overall views, Madam Chair, and I realize they’re not all that specific, but we’re still feeling our way through this, and we’ll get more specific as we go through time.	92	9
201406	1439	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you very much.	92	9
201406	1440	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1441	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a clarifying question?	92	9
201406	1442	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92	9
201406	1443	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So does that mean you want to have two federal funds rates, the old one and the new one?	92	9
201406	1444	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	No.	92	9
201406	1445	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’m just saying that we would broaden the definition as suggested under option 1.	92	9
201406	1446	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Option 1 has us printing two rates, the fed funds classic and the overnight bank funding rate.	92	9
201406	1447	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There’s a little bit of confusion about that.	92	9
201406	1448	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you for the clarification.	92	9
201406	1449	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to make sure I understood what option 1 was.	92	9
201406	1450	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	92	9
201406	1451	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1452	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201406	1453	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1454	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The discussion so far has been useful and illuminating.	92	9
201406	1455	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	There are many complexities and subtleties, and when presented with a number of tradeoffs in which the choice isn’t clear-cut, my approach is to pose some framing questions or tests as a way to sort through the options.	92	9
201406	1456	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	My tests are, first, the probability of achieving control over short-term rates; second, where feasible, some flexibility to allow tactical adaptation as we learn; and, third, simplicity and clarity of communications.	92	9
201406	1457	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	When I go through the questions I will reorder them a little bit and bunch some together.	92	9
201406	1458	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question of the emphasis on the federal funds rate or administered rates, first, I expect we’re going to settle on using alternate rates for both monetary control and communications purposes, and I think it’s worth trying to preserve in that construct the use of the fed funds rate.	92	9
201406	1459	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I favor beginning with a target range for the federal funds rate, since it is now familiar and probably more workable in the early stages.	92	9
201406	1460	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So I favor the second of the two options presented in the staff memo.	92	9
201406	1461	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I see it as giving us the best chance of exerting control over short-term rates.	92	9
201406	1462	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If we go this way, a first order of business will be to construct statements that are as clear as possible, given all the moving parts.	92	9
201406	1463	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the 3' verbiage in the illustrative time of liftoff statement would meet the test of clarity and simplicity.	92	9
201406	1464	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Now I’ll go to question 4, and that is the question about publishing an expanded fed funds rate definition.	92	9
201406	1465	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m open to an expanded federal funds rate, including an expansion that incorporates Eurodollar transactions, along with nonbrokered fed funds transactions.	92	9
201406	1466	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time I think we should aim for the most durable definition possible of the target funds rate, and that leads me to thinking that we should include in our planning the scenario in which we return to a balance sheet of a size at which reserves are relatively scarce.	92	9
201406	1467	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So I don’t know if including Eurodollar transactions presents any issue in such a scenario, and this is the kind of question I think we can sort out in coming deliberations.	92	9
201406	1468	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On question 2, about circuit breakers—I thought the staff took a mostly neutral position in the presentation of options in the memos, but on this question I thought the staff went pretty far in pushing a cap on aggregate usage paired with a uniform-price auction mechanism.	92	9
201406	1469	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this is a sensible place to start.	92	9
201406	1470	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Although this is perhaps not a decisive consideration, this approach strikes me as simpler and less problematic to implement in terms of IT systems adjustments, as was pointed out in the memo.	92	9
201406	1471	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Some of my other duties in the System make me attentive to such a statement.	92	9
201406	1472	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to spend more time on this question of limits and circuit breakers leading up to the July decision point, and I hope we can ask follow-up questions of the staff during the period before the next meeting.	92	9
201406	1473	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The third question, which I’ll treat as the last one, is the reinvestment question—ceasing reinvestments or taking a graduated approach.	92	9
201406	1474	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Ending reinvestments simultaneously or coincident with liftoff is clearest and conveys greater conviction, but I’m open to doing it after liftoff because I think this buys some time to observe how the first phase of tightening goes.	92	9
201406	1475	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the reinvestment program can be ended or wound down based on tactical considerations after the transition represented by liftoff has been accomplished.	92	9
201406	1476	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	This, I think, is an area in which tactical flexibility is feasible.	92	9
201406	1477	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1478	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1479	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	92	9
201406	1480	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1481	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I, too, want to welcome our two new governors to our group.	92	9
201406	1482	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s delightful to have you with us, and I’m looking forward to having you as colleagues.	92	9
201406	1483	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But I also want to welcome my former colleague sitting next to me, Loretta.	92	9
201406	1484	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I sat next to Sandy for nearly eight years, and Loretta was behind me and could only whisper and send me notes when I misbehaved.	92	9
201406	1485	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And now she is close enough that she actually can kick me in the shin.	92	9
201406	1486	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	1487	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t know if that’s going to be a good thing or not, but I am delighted to welcome her as our colleague.	92	9
201406	1488	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’ve worked with her for many years, and I just want to say, “Congratulations and welcome.”	92	9
201406	1489	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I also want to start off by thanking the staff for all their helpful memos.	92	9
201406	1490	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think they were most extraordinary in many ways, and I was both impressed and greatly informed by them.	92	9
201406	1491	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	So I want to thank them for all that.	92	9
201406	1492	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t want to upset Governor Tarullo, but I’m afraid—	92	9
201406	1493	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Nobody wants to.	92	9
201406	1494	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m afraid I’m going to have to agree with a lot of he said.	92	9
201406	1495	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	1496	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, if that forces him to recant all that—I hope not, but I actually share a lot of his views, as you’ll see in my remarks.	92	9
201406	1497	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But before I address the specific questions under consideration, I’d like to state some of my general views regarding the normalization of policy.	92	9
201406	1498	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It appears to me that a lot of our discussion recently about our exit and normalization are overly concerned with the daily volatility in overnight rates.	92	9
201406	1499	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m a bit uncomfortable with the extent to which these concerns are driving our policy options.	92	9
201406	1500	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Historically, volatility in the funds rate has always been an operational feature of monetary policy, and I see no compelling reason why we can’t continue to accept volatility or why we should expect that that volatility will impede our ability to carry out policy consistent with our broad macroeconomic mandate.	92	9
201406	1501	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Also, I’m reluctant to move to conducting monetary policy operations with a large set of nonbank counterparties and to essentially sidestep the legal restriction on paying interest on reserves to anyone that is not a depository institution.	92	9
201406	1502	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I fear doing so could potentially have some unpleasant political ramifications.	92	9
201406	1503	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I also want to restate my guiding principle that any near-term tactical decisions we make should leave open the option of returning to a corridor system of some kind based on the fed funds rate or perhaps a more broadly defined interbank rate sometime in the future, which is my preferred way of conducting policy.	92	9
201406	1504	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	This means I probably would not support any communication or tactical steps that suggest we prefer or will rely on other instruments to administer monetary policy on a regular or routine basis.	92	9
201406	1505	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Special facilities, such as the TDF or the overnight reverse repo facility, should be viewed and communicated as temporary and shelved when not absolutely necessary.	92	9
201406	1506	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	With that in mind, in the interim as we shrink the balance sheet, I would rely primarily on the IOER administered rate, but then I would specify a range for the funds rate as we’ve been doing for the past five years.	92	9
201406	1507	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s not new anymore.	92	9
201406	1508	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	In doing that, I would be inclined and even comfortable if we expanded the range of that federal funds rate—maybe it doesn’t need to be 20 or 25 basis points.	92	9
201406	1509	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Maybe it can be 40 basis points.	92	9
201406	1510	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We can have a broad range initially.	92	9
201406	1511	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And then we may indicate that we would use other tools at our disposal—intentionally vague there—in the short run to ensure that the federal funds rate or our expanded definition doesn’t fall below that broad range.	92	9
201406	1512	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That would keep the ON RRP a smaller facility, at least in the near term.	92	9
201406	1513	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As we gain more experience, we will find out if that works, and whether we need to employ the ON RRP rate to keep the funds rate in its target range.	92	9
201406	1514	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As we raise rates, we might be able to shrink the funds rate target range as we get more comfortable with our ability to conduct monetary policy by having the IOER rate raise rates.	92	9
201406	1515	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As I said, I would also be comfortable with expanding or extending the definition of the effective funds rate to include Eurodollar transactions.	92	9
201406	1516	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’ll note that, in exhibit 20 from the briefing we had this morning, if you look at the period between 2010 and 2014 when there was a lot of volatility, the Eurodollar rate and the fed funds rate moved around pretty close together.	92	9
201406	1517	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	There doesn’t seem to be a huge disconnect between these two markets, so I’m comfortable expanding the definition of the fed funds rate in that dimension.	92	9
201406	1518	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think proceeding along these lines will make it easy for us to return to our corridor system that targets the domestic interbank rate.	92	9
201406	1519	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’d also note that as a governance matter, the FOMC and the Board of Governors would need to articulate a shared understanding of how the IOER rate would be set, and how that would be set relative to the funds rate range, until such a time as we can return to an explicit funds rate target.	92	9
201406	1520	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	So I prefer this option to targeting the ON RRP rate specifically.	92	9
201406	1521	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I believe that relying on the ON RRP rate is risky.	92	9
201406	1522	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We do not know the consequences for the microeconomic structure of short-term funding markets, or who’s being helped or harmed by us crowding into this market in such a big way.	92	9
201406	1523	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We are already witnessing an increase in demand from many people who wish to be counterparties.	92	9
201406	1524	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Why is that?	92	9
201406	1525	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t suspect they’re doing it out of patriotism.	92	9
201406	1526	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I suspect there’s a financial reason why they’d like to do that.	92	9
201406	1527	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	So there must be financial benefits to this, and we could be artificially creating or at least in some sense encouraging a huge demand for this product.	92	9
201406	1528	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But who are we squeezing out, and what will the consequences of that be, both intended and unintended?	92	9
201406	1529	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And what does this have to do with operating monetary policy and achieving our macroeconomic goals?	92	9
201406	1530	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As I previously mentioned, I’m very uncomfortable with the fact that we are engaging, I think, in a backdoor practice of paying interest on reserves to nondepository institutions.	92	9
201406	1531	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Governor Tarullo made a pretty articulate argument about the financial-stability risks and implications of this facility.	92	9
201406	1532	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We don’t know a lot about how it will play out, but I don’t think we ought to be designing our monetary policy instruments and operating procedures and using a monetary policy instrument for financial-stability reasons—I think we’re conflating those two.	92	9
201406	1533	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Even today I heard people moving back and forth between the ON RRP facility as a tool for monetary policy and as a tool to meet liquidity needs in the case of a crisis.	92	9
201406	1534	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we should be very careful about that.	92	9
201406	1535	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	So with respect to question 2, as I said, I am opposed to a full-allotment program for reverse repos.	92	9
201406	1536	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	If we choose to use reverse repos at all as a tactical tool during a transition to a smaller balance sheet, I prefer fewer counterparties and probably aggregate caps.	92	9
201406	1537	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The size of the cap should be an FOMC decision.	92	9
201406	1538	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Simplicity would be desirable, and thus, probably, I would start with an aggregate cap that’s static rather than one that’s dynamic.	92	9
201406	1539	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think our communications are hard enough without explaining how we’re going to dynamically adjust some kind of cap.	92	9
201406	1540	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I do not like the fact that the overnight reverse repo facility seems to be making it convenient for some institutions to dress up their balance sheets at the end of the quarter.	92	9
201406	1541	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t see that as a macroeconomic goal or role for the Federal Reserve, but this facility seems to be providing great support for at least some institutions to do that.	92	9
201406	1542	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That gives me pause to think about whether or not a counterparty cap might be appropriate as well, and I’m open to thinking further about that.	92	9
201406	1543	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Again, simplicity, I think, is going to be valuable.	92	9
201406	1544	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I would urge us to go in a different direction.	92	9
201406	1545	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I would urge us to play down the role of the ON RRP facility as much as we can.	92	9
201406	1546	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It is a transitional facility that we will use as the balance sheet shrinks, but not in an ongoing way.	92	9
201406	1547	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Like President Rosengren, I think it is a bit awkward at best for us to be entertaining an operating system in which money market funds are the major transmitter of monetary policy, particularly given our concerns that we have expressed both within the Committee and more publicly about the financial-stability issues surrounding money market funds.	92	9
201406	1548	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That does suggest to me that shrinking the counterparties may be the right approach—and I’d be willing to think about this further—just considering government-only money market funds as counterparties if we choose to go in that direction.	92	9
201406	1549	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding question 3, I am in favor of terminating our reinvestments in a prompt manner after the taper has ended.	92	9
201406	1550	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As many people have mentioned, the process of reducing or tapering our purchases, once we told the markets what we were going to do, has come off pretty smoothly, and I would be inclined just to keep on going.	92	9
201406	1551	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We’re tapering slowly.	92	9
201406	1552	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We can continue to taper and shrink the balance sheet, and I would be open to that—in fact, I even would encourage it.	92	9
201406	1553	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’d also like to see some more discussion concerning the desirability of changing the maturity structure of the balance sheet.	92	9
201406	1554	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We have a highly mismatched balance sheet subject to political risk, I think, as well as credit risk of various kinds.	92	9
201406	1555	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And as some people have argued, we are in the midst of a very large carry trade right now, and we’re going to have to unwind that at some point, and there will be costs to bear when we do that.	92	9
201406	1556	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’ll have some more to say about this later, but one thing that we might consider as we think about reinvestment is maybe we ought to be shifting our reinvestments into short-term Treasuries that would allow us a little more flexibility on our balance sheet as we move forward in time.	92	9
201406	1557	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That might be a step to manage our balance sheet’s maturity structure and exit.	92	9
201406	1558	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, let me reiterate that I’m supportive of extending the definition of the interbank rate that we target.	92	9
201406	1559	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The funds rate and the Eurodollar rate seem to move pretty closely together.	92	9
201406	1560	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And I would encourage the staff to do some more work and give us some more data on these rates that go back a little further in time.	92	9
201406	1561	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it may enhance our ability to conduct monetary policy in the future.	92	9
201406	1562	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1563	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1564	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201406	1565	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1566	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And thanks to the staff for excellent analysis of complex financial products and financial engineering of some of these tools.	92	9
201406	1567	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I agree with the staff’s overview assessment of the Committee’s consensus position from April.	92	9
201406	1568	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	When it becomes appropriate to reduce monetary accommodation, the Committee expects to employ our IOER and overnight RRP tools with a relatively wide spread between them, so that federal funds rate can be expected to trade within an indicated range.	92	9
201406	1569	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	As long as our balance sheet remains larger than in our prior policy environment, circa 2007, using the overnight RRP tool to firm up short-term money rates is a useful approach.	92	9
201406	1570	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That said, I do not favor moving to a floor system for the longer term.	92	9
201406	1571	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And even if we did, I would not favor a permanent ON RRP program, for reasons that I will expand upon shortly.	92	9
201406	1572	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So I think it is crucial that the language announcing our use of the ON RRP program and our exit strategy should emphasize the temporary duration of this policy tool.	92	9
201406	1573	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We should be explicit about the temporary nature of our use of ON RRPs during our policy normalization period.	92	9
201406	1574	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Otherwise, market participants will assume it is here for good and make costly market structure investments.	92	9
201406	1575	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	At that point, we will almost surely accept that our credibility will require us to maintain the overnight RRP program indefinitely.	92	9
201406	1576	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In order to avoid this eventual and unplanned fait accompli outcome, we need to be explicit, now and throughout the program’s use, that this is a temporary facility.	92	9
201406	1577	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let me be clear: I worry about the complexity of this market, and I would prefer not using it at all, if that were reasonable.	92	9
201406	1578	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Over the transition period, while we renormalize our policy settings, the overnight program can be an insurance policy that helps us to hit a target for the funds rate, and that is an important benefit.	92	9
201406	1579	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	As long as we take prudent actions to minimize financial instability risks over this transition period, I can see some benefits to using the program temporarily.	92	9
201406	1580	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But over the longer term, I don’t see the benefits, certainly not relative to the possibly large costs of increased financial instability.	92	9
201406	1581	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	If anyone thinks there is a big payoff to having a permanent overnight RRP program, now is the time to provide that important quantitative and persuasive analysis.	92	9
201406	1582	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Maybe I’m overly risk averse, and there are actually important benefits.	92	9
201406	1583	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But I think a compelling affirmative case still needs to be made for this program to be used permanently.	92	9
201406	1584	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	As the briefing memos discuss, there is a potential for the overnight RRP program to generate financial instability problems.	92	9
201406	1585	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	For example, during a period of heightened risk aversion, a full-allotment program could lead to destabilizing withdrawals of funding from money funds and other lending institutions to avoid exposure to credit instruments with even modest credit risk.	92	9
201406	1586	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	To address these risks, the memos discussed aggregate caps, individual caps, dynamic and flexible caps, and other circuit breakers.	92	9
201406	1587	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	These discussions did an unusually good job of convincing me that this new financial instrument is much too complicated.	92	9
201406	1588	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We just don’t know how it’s going to interact with other short-term funding markets during times of stress.	92	9
201406	1589	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	For a temporary implementation of this program, I would favor an aggregate static cap for simplicity.	92	9
201406	1590	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Before we find ourselves endgamed with a permanent overnight RRP instrument for monetary policy, we simply need more analysis of how such an interest rate tool would affect our policy effectiveness during normal times under various stress scenarios—that is, during normal times when the funds rate is 4 percent or more, but we face a stress scenario.	92	9
201406	1591	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Obviously, I am focusing a lot of my attention on the possibility that this program will be around 5 or 10 years from now.	92	9
201406	1592	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	My misgivings mean that I have to know one heck of a lot more about the effectiveness of this new policy tool, its social value, and its use as a new financial product before I can imagine undertaking actions today that would likely lead to it becoming a permanent operational fixture.	92	9
201406	1593	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In the absence of a strong and compelling case for a longer-term floor system, I favor only a temporary use of this program.	92	9
201406	1594	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	At the time we invoke our normalization strategy, we should authorize its use either for one year or until a date in the future when we estimate our SOMA balance sheet will approximately return to normal, and no longer than that.	92	9
201406	1595	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Now, let me turn to reinvestments.	92	9
201406	1596	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I prefer changing our strategy so that we continue reinvesting maturing proceeds until well after we begin our interest rate tightening.	92	9
201406	1597	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Given the long duration of our SOMA portfolio, I don’t believe there is a material change in the degree of accommodation that is provided under the various timing possibilities for reinvestments.	92	9
201406	1598	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think signaling our policy intentions is simpler and cleaner if we reduce the list of policy watch variables to just the interest rate liftoff decision itself.	92	9
201406	1599	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Putting this all together for the sake of being clear about my preferred approach, here is how I could see the FOMC policy statement emerging.	92	9
201406	1600	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Key ingredients are found in paragraph 3 of the illustrative liftoff policy statement example in the planning memo.	92	9
201406	1601	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	At the appropriate time, I would state that the Committee decided to increase its target funds rate to 0.25 percent.	92	9
201406	1602	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	But due to large excess reserves during our extended policy normalization period, the effective funds rate may range from 15 to 40 basis points, perhaps.	92	9
201406	1603	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So this is like paragraph 3 but with a target federal funds rate and an expected trading range.	92	9
201406	1604	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Basically, we announce the target funds rate, and we admit upfront that during the normalization process trading may occur in the range around the target.	92	9
201406	1605	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Now, I have heard all the conversation so far, and it strikes me that a range is what is going to be the consensus for the funds rate.	92	9
201406	1606	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So that is okay.	92	9
201406	1607	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In this case, I am okay with using the existing language in paragraph 3 on the Committee authorizing the overnight RRP rate to be within a range of 15 to 25 basis points and setting the IOER rate to 40 basis points.	92	9
201406	1608	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	However, I would hope that IOER alone could do most of the tightening work for us, and I would favor starting out with the overnight RRP rate at 15 basis points and not being that anxious to increase it if the funds rate trades a little below 25 basis points.	92	9
201406	1609	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Of course, if the funds rate was persistently far below 25 basis points, we could raise the overnight rate somewhat.	92	9
201406	1610	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let me add that I have not come to a firm view about whether we should target an expanded version of the funds rate that includes Eurodollars.	92	9
201406	1611	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I am open to arguments from the technical experts.	92	9
201406	1612	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Finally, let me conclude by saying that I think it’s obvious that engineering a smooth increase in short-term policy rates with our enormous balance sheet will be fraught with temporary obstacles and challenges.	92	9
201406	1613	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think we need to be very explicit in accepting that at various times we will see markets both overreact and underreact to our policy-tightening moves.	92	9
201406	1614	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	It’s going to happen.	92	9
201406	1615	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let’s not compound the challenges of our task with an unrealistic expectation that policy adjustment will go 100 percent as we draw it up on the board.	92	9
201406	1616	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let’s deal with the known unknowns as best we can and react as prudently as possible when the unknown unknowns arise.	92	9
201406	1617	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1618	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1619	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92	9
201406	1620	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1621	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I generally support what the Chair referred to at the outset as the centrist approach for liftoff and for the early stages of normalization, of managing short-term rates with IOER pulling up from above and the ON RRP facility available to provide a floor and push up from below, if needed.	92	9
201406	1622	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Today, IOER is at 25 basis points, federal funds are trading around 10 basis points, and the ON RRP rate is set at 5 basis points.	92	9
201406	1623	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So this really just means moving the whole structure upward as the Committee tightens policy, and it ought to give the Committee a reasonable level of control over short-term rates.	92	9
201406	1624	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Of course, that remains to be seen.	92	9
201406	1625	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It also seems likely—and I take it as a given for purposes of this discussion—that the Committee will support development of an improved measure for the federal funds rate based on the FR-2420 data and including Eurodollar transactions.	92	9
201406	1626	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And I assume—I had assumed, anyway—that if we go to the trouble of creating this rate, and then choose to target a federal funds rate, that is the one we would target.	92	9
201406	1627	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I would find it odd that we would do all the work to create this thing and put it out there and then not have the confidence to target it, but instead target the old one.	92	9
201406	1628	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’m not sure how we would explain that.	92	9
201406	1629	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So that’s going to be my assumption for this purpose.	92	9
201406	1630	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I also have to say that I share the discomfort with the potential for the RRP facility to get very large very quickly.	92	9
201406	1631	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	For me, the facility is just a tool to provide a floor for rates, and it need not be a perfect floor.	92	9
201406	1632	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Nothing more.	92	9
201406	1633	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	As I said at the last meeting, I have been thinking that it could be small and tailored for that limited purpose.	92	9
201406	1634	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Really, though, the question that has been raised is, is that possible?	92	9
201406	1635	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	If you go back to what’s discussed in the memo, a facility that is sized off a trailing one-week average of usage volume with a $300 billion cushion could grow enormously very quickly, obviously.	92	9
201406	1636	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And even if you lengthened the averaging period and lowered the surge capacity, it still could get very large, and the effect on industry structures would be unpredictable at best.	92	9
201406	1637	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I also don’t know that there is any real answer to the fact that the caps would come under huge pressure in a crisis—I would characterize them as speed bumps, others have called them circuit breakers—and that the market will see that in advance and plan on it.	92	9
201406	1638	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So I have those concerns, and from the standpoint of the counterparties, I would prefer to choose the first option, which is to say, let’s wait to make decisions about counterparties until there is significantly more discussion on how we can create an ON RRP facility that will do what we need it to do, but not threaten to become something that we really don’t want—that I don’t want, let’s say.	92	9
201406	1639	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Within that general framework, with a role for IOER, for the federal funds rate, and for the ON RRP facility, there are some choices to be made, and the first is whether to target the improved federal funds rate as either a point or a range or, instead, to target short-term rates.	92	9
201406	1640	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	"The options are there in paragraphs 3, 3', and 3"", and—no surprise—my desire would be to use the ON RRP facility only as needed, and that pushes me in the direction of 3'."	92	9
201406	1641	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I would echo what President Evans was perhaps suggesting, though—that a point target with expected volatility around it kind of approaches a range in the limit.	92	9
201406	1642	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And also, in these formulations, in 3 and 3', the communication is around the federal funds rate, and the tools are there as supporting characters.	92	9
201406	1643	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	"In option 3"", the communication is very different and is really focused on the administered rates, and the general level of short-term rates, including the federal funds rate, is kind of an afterthought."	92	9
201406	1644	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Let me say that I find it a plausible idea to target the general level of short-term rates including the federal funds rate, but I don’t like the idea of featuring the administered rates as the primary actors in the play, if you will.	92	9
201406	1645	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And I would say that I do like the idea of thinking of IOER as the principal tool.	92	9
201406	1646	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The second issue is whether to continue to publish the old federal funds rate alongside the new and improved version or to just publish the improved version and call it the federal funds rate, and take the old federal funds rate off the market, put it out to pasture—pick your metaphor—but have it out there in case we need it later.	92	9
201406	1647	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	My preference is what I would call the one-rate solution, which is to publish the new rate and call it the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1648	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The work of the LIBOR reform effort covers some of these same issues, and maybe it can shed some light by analogy.	92	9
201406	1649	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The LIBOR reform effort has included a Market Participants Group established by the Official Sector Steering Committee (OSSC) of the FSB and led by Darrell Duffie, a well-known academic, and it included financial market participants of all different varieties.	92	9
201406	1650	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Noting the current state of play in the federal funds market, the Market Participants Group said that “it would hesitate to recommend the federal funds rate as a reference rate without an improved fixing.”	92	9
201406	1651	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And one critical test that the federal funds rate is at risk of not meeting the standards for a reference rate is that principle 7 of the IOSCO benchmark principles requires that a benchmark be anchored in real transactions in an active market.	92	9
201406	1652	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the LIBOR Market Participants Group recommended—and the OSSC agrees—that the definition of LIBOR should be broadened to include a wider range of transactions and counterparties, and that it be anchored in real transactions.	92	9
201406	1653	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And this is kind of a direct parallel to federal funds reform.	92	9
201406	1654	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Market participants did not prefer an option that kept the old LIBOR alive and created a new rate with these improved characteristics.	92	9
201406	1655	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Instead, they preferred a rate that is called LIBOR, but that is no longer limited to London or to interbank lending, and it’s not an offered rate either [laughter] but, rather, is anchored in real transactions.	92	9
201406	1656	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I don’t say this is dispositive, but it suggests to me that market participants have concerns about the federal funds rate as a reliable benchmark and would probably like to see it reformed, which I believe would mean changing the definition of the federal funds rate, rather than creating a new rate and naming it something else.	92	9
201406	1657	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In addition, I don’t really think it’s less confusing or easier for market participants to have two rates out there.	92	9
201406	1658	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know how you explain that.	92	9
201406	1659	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It’s just a level of complexity that I don’t think we need.	92	9
201406	1660	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The other issue we talked about earlier is the contract frustration issue, which, as I mentioned, I don’t see as a serious concern and shouldn’t be the thing that pushes us around in this issue.	92	9
201406	1661	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So where that leaves me is, I favor one rate to be called the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1662	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It will include Eurodollars and the FR-2420 transactions.	92	9
201406	1663	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Turning to the second question from the appendix, as I mentioned, I’m less sure that circuit breakers can be successful in limiting the size and effect of the facility over time.	92	9
201406	1664	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But, nonetheless, this is how I would make the tradeoffs.	92	9
201406	1665	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’d like an aggregate cap with a single-price auction to allocate capacity if the cap is hit.	92	9
201406	1666	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’d like that cap to be rigid.	92	9
201406	1667	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I think I’d like it to be static.	92	9
201406	1668	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’d like X, which is to say the surge capacity, to be low—no more than $50 billion.	92	9
201406	1669	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And I would allow indulgences for quarter-end and other scheduled events like that.	92	9
201406	1670	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I don’t think I would see those as reasons to trip the surge capacity.	92	9
201406	1671	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I would look more for changes in capacity.	92	9
201406	1672	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Finally, moving to reinvestment, I’ve got several concerns about ceasing reinvestments soon after the taper ends.	92	9
201406	1673	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	First, I think this could correctly be seen as the beginning of tightening, and there is a risk of a market reaction that might actually have the effect of pushing out the liftoff date.	92	9
201406	1674	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Now, I don’t know that, but let me say that after the last two major decisions it is very hard for me to feel like I have a lot of confidence in predicting how the market would take this signal.	92	9
201406	1675	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	If you look back to, for example, the June meeting last year, I think people pretty widely underestimated the market reaction.	92	9
201406	1676	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Then comes the actual taper at the end of the year, and I will say I overestimated what would happen.	92	9
201406	1677	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I think that taper was clearly well justified on the economics, but not at all expected by the market.	92	9
201406	1678	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But who thought that the stock market would close up 300 points?	92	9
201406	1679	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So, I would say, same lesson, different sign, in both cases.	92	9
201406	1680	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But in any case, there is the possibility of a market reaction that might push out the liftoff date.	92	9
201406	1681	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Second, even if that doesn’t happen, to me the highest priority when it is time to tighten policy is to get away from the effective lower bound.	92	9
201406	1682	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And so for any given amount of tightening, using both tools by definition means that we’ll be raising rates less.	92	9
201406	1683	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Third, I think that using both tools at the same time can be confusing.	92	9
201406	1684	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And, finally, I am concerned that terminating our reinvestments in MBS, which amount to a substantial part of projected gross issuance, could well flow through into higher mortgage rates, albeit probably at a modest amount, and I just don’t think that higher mortgage rates are what we need right now in the economy.	92	9
201406	1685	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	For that reason, I am open to the idea of smoothing the taper.	92	9
201406	1686	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I also think that the idea of creating an agreed path for the taper is a good one.	92	9
201406	1687	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know that I have a great answer on that one.	92	9
201406	1688	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I would prefer to stop reinvestments well after liftoff, and I would avoid hard and complex triggers.	92	9
201406	1689	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	One approach would be to state an intention to hold the balance sheet stable at least until the target rate is, for example, 1 percent, which feels like about the end of 2015 in that case.	92	9
201406	1690	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Or you could take a softer approach and defer to Committee judgment as to when is the appropriate time.	92	9
201406	1691	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But I do think it would be helpful to take it off the table for now, focus on raising rates and getting away from the zero lower bound, and return to it near the end of 2015.	92	9
201406	1692	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1693	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1694	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201406	1695	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1696	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s probably appropriate for me to begin with the issue of reinvestment.	92	9
201406	1697	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted in a speech last month, I think there are some compelling reasons for ending reinvestments sometime after liftoff of short-term rates rather than before or coincident with liftoff.	92	9
201406	1698	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, ending reinvestments later, after liftoff, serves four purposes.	92	9
201406	1699	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	First, it lessens the risk of foreshortening the entire tightening process.	92	9
201406	1700	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If we were to end reinvestments before liftoff, then the end of reinvestments would be viewed as the beginning of the tightening process.	92	9
201406	1701	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That runs the risk of both raising long-term rates, especially to the extent that people emphasize flows rather than stocks, and also raising the expected trajectory of short-term rates because it would pull forward people’s expectations in terms of the probability of liftoff, and the timing of liftoff would be pulled forward in time.	92	9
201406	1702	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, I think ending reinvestments first could lead to a significant tightening of financial conditions that might be more than we desire or anticipate.	92	9
201406	1703	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That could disrupt the economic expansion, and that could actually delay the liftoff of short-term interest rates.	92	9
201406	1704	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Similarly, if we end reinvestment and commence liftoff together, the effect could be greater than we anticipate, and if it was greater than we desired, it might be awkward, if we’re doing both together, to then reverse course.	92	9
201406	1705	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think separating the two decisions reduces the risk of an overly-large market response.	92	9
201406	1706	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, because ending reinvestments first could conceivably delay liftoff in certain states of the world, it is inconsistent with our goal of getting off the zero lower bound as soon as possible in order to regain monetary policy flexibility.	92	9
201406	1707	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that getting off the zero lower bound as soon as possible, consistent with our dual-mandate objectives, should be a goal of policy, as that would provide greater flexibility in terms of responding to future shocks.	92	9
201406	1708	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, I think delaying the end of reinvestments also should simplify our communications as we lift off.	92	9
201406	1709	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	There will be one moving part—short-term interest rates—rather than two.	92	9
201406	1710	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, if we’re adjusting both short-term rates and the size of the balance sheet at the same time, I think it would be more difficult for us to assess what the particular effect is of each instrument.	92	9
201406	1711	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And, fourth, ending reinvestments later also strikes me as a better risk-management strategy.	92	9
201406	1712	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s compare two scenarios:  reinvestments end before liftoff versus the end of reinvestments is delayed until after liftoff.	92	9
201406	1713	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, assume that, in these two scenarios, the economy subsequently disappoints.	92	9
201406	1714	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the first case, when we end reinvestments first, we might have to reverse course.	92	9
201406	1715	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the second case, ending reinvestments later, disappointment about the outlook would cause expectations about the end of reinvestments to be pushed out.	92	9
201406	1716	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That would keep the balance sheet larger for longer, and that would act as an automatic stabilizer in terms of supporting economic activity, which I think would be desirable.	92	9
201406	1717	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of how to specify the end of reinvestments, my original thinking was maybe to specify a level of interest rates as a threshold or a trigger, but after talking to the Vice Chairman—not myself, but Stan—I concluded that retaining some flexibility was a better approach.	92	9
201406	1718	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would favor general language to the effect that reinvestment is expected to continue until short-term interest rates are raised significantly above zero and the FOMC is significantly closer to meeting its dual-mandate objectives.	92	9
201406	1719	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not wedded to any particular language, but I think keeping it relatively vague so we have some flexibility makes more sense.	92	9
201406	1720	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So, Stan, you did convince me.	92	9
201406	1721	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of ending reinvestments all at once or more gradually, I think that depends on timing and circumstances.	92	9
201406	1722	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If you were to adjust reinvestment in 2015, you probably would end it outright because the amount of maturing agency MBS is pretty modest, about $20 billion per month.	92	9
201406	1723	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the end of reinvestment doesn’t occur until 2016, then you’re talking about a much bigger end, and so in that case you might want to taper it because you’re not really sure what such a large end might mean.	92	9
201406	1724	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the particular circumstances of the economy at the time would be very important.	92	9
201406	1725	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t think we have to really foreshadow exactly how we would do it at this point in time.	92	9
201406	1726	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The second issue I want to focus on is the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1727	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Here I have a strong preference for revamping how we calculate the effective funds rate, adding the overnight Eurodollar borrowing as part of the calculation, and I want to substitute this new methodology for the current effective federal funds rate rather than having a new rate and an old rate.	92	9
201406	1728	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I favor moving to a single improved rate.	92	9
201406	1729	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As Governor Powell has pointed out, moving to a single improved rate helps us considerably with the federal funds rate as a reference rate.	92	9
201406	1730	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If we make the switch, then we have a rate that’s more robust that trillions of dollars of derivatives contracts reference.	92	9
201406	1731	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If we keep the old rate and have a new rate, we still have this problem that we have all of these derivative contracts referencing this old, infirm rate.	92	9
201406	1732	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we found with LIBOR that there’s a tremendous amount of inertia.	92	9
201406	1733	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Everyone knows LIBOR is a troubled reference rate, yet people are still using LIBOR in all of their derivatives contracts.	92	9
201406	1734	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would prefer to avoid the problem of forcing the transition to the new reference rate by just actually giving people an improved reference rate, and then it happens simultaneously and we’re done with that problem.	92	9
201406	1735	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I view the benefits of forcing the switch as large, relative to the risks of contract frustration.	92	9
201406	1736	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	My reading is that the contract frustration risks are very low because most contracts simply say the effective federal funds rate is what the Federal Reserve says the effective federal funds rate is.	92	9
201406	1737	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And, second, in terms of the substance, the new rate will be very close.	92	9
201406	1738	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Over the past four years, it averages less than 1 basis point difference from the old federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1739	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So both in terms of the legal reading but also in terms of the difference in the two rates, it seems like just moving to the new rate makes the most sense.	92	9
201406	1740	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the issue that changing to the new rate will make it hard down the road to move back to the old definition of the federal funds rate—I heard people express that as a concern once our balance sheet normalizes—I think this exaggerates the degree of difficulty of going back to the old federal funds rate sometime in the future.	92	9
201406	1741	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If the federal funds rate market deepens again as our balance sheet normalizes, I think it wouldn’t be that hard to move back to the old definition and just explain that we’re now moving back to the old definition because the funds market is much deeper now.	92	9
201406	1742	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a much better reference rate.	92	9
201406	1743	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s much less idiosyncratic.	92	9
201406	1744	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And so we’re moving back for those reasons.	92	9
201406	1745	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that constrains us very much.	92	9
201406	1746	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The third issue I want to discuss is the issue of our target.	92	9
201406	1747	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that we should be targeting the general level of money market rates rather than the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	1748	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The federal funds rate has gotten pretty idiosyncratic.	92	9
201406	1749	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m with Governor Fischer on this—why are we holding onto this thing as a vestige of times past when what we really care about in terms of setting monetary policy is setting the general level of money market rates to actually influence financial market conditions?	92	9
201406	1750	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would prefer to emphasize the general level of money market rates—and we could keep the federal funds rate around, you know, we don’t have to throw it out, but I would emphasize general money market rates.	92	9
201406	1751	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think I’d prefer that over actually emphasizing the IOER rate or the overnight RRP rate, because those are administered rates.	92	9
201406	1752	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing I do want to avoid, though, is having the Desk try to pin the federal funds rate to a particular level and moving the overnight RRP and IOER rates around on a day-to-day basis.	92	9
201406	1753	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t really see the benefit, in terms of affecting financial conditions, of small movements of these administered rates just to try to pin the federal funds rate to a particular rate.	92	9
201406	1754	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that what we really have to emphasize here is the control of financial market conditions, and so the simplest regime that generates good control of financial market conditions is what I’m for.	92	9
201406	1755	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So that means a range for general money market rates, and as long as the rates stay within that range, then I wouldn’t see that you’d need to adjust the administered rates except when you’re trying to implement a policy change.	92	9
201406	1756	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth issue is with respect to caps on the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	1757	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the staff made it very clear there are lots of ways to do it.	92	9
201406	1758	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	My emphasis would be on having caps that do not bind in peacetime, or noncrisis periods, but bind in wartime—crisis periods when we want to limit the inflow into the overnight RRP facility, to limit the upward spikes in riskier money market rates.	92	9
201406	1759	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I want a regime that’s well designed for the most common case, peacetime, rather than overengineered in a way that creates unnecessary frictions in peacetime just to be slightly better in wartime situations that might never occur.	92	9
201406	1760	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’re overemphasizing, a little bit, the risk of this future financial crisis, and I don’t want to design a very complex mechanism that only is relevant on one day out of 1,000 days.	92	9
201406	1761	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It just seems sort of backward.	92	9
201406	1762	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, an ideal regime would have no caps in peacetime, except for a high overall limit that you would never expect to reach, and then in wartime a system of caps that was automatically triggered by market conditions when stress conditions developed.	92	9
201406	1763	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, what I’d prefer to have is an arrangement in which the caps automatically get triggered by a spread in interest rates.	92	9
201406	1764	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the spread between risky rates and risk-free rates widens, the caps automatically come into place.	92	9
201406	1765	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I know the staff hasn’t proposed this.	92	9
201406	1766	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s probably too complicated to be easily realized.	92	9
201406	1767	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d always have the risk that you might not be sure that the caps would be forthcoming in all circumstances.	92	9
201406	1768	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would encourage the staff to consider whether a regime like this was feasible, but I’m going to confine my remaining comments to the construct as outlined in the staff memo.	92	9
201406	1769	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would generally be pretty indifferent between individual caps and aggregate caps.	92	9
201406	1770	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems like the staff nailed the distinction.	92	9
201406	1771	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Individual caps have the benefit of certainty for the investor.	92	9
201406	1772	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The aggregate caps have the value that you get the pooling advantage, and so they’re more efficient in that sense.	92	9
201406	1773	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I get the sense from reading the staff’s report that they lean in the direction of aggregate caps.	92	9
201406	1774	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly get a sense around the table that we as a collective group lean in favor of aggregate caps.	92	9
201406	1775	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m perfectly happy to go with the sense of the Committee and go with an aggregate cap.	92	9
201406	1776	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I have just a few thoughts on the whole issue of the overnight RRP facility, which has gotten a lot of comments today.	92	9
201406	1777	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the consensus around the table, as I hear it, is that we want to use the overnight RRP facility to establish a floor on rates to enhance our credibility in terms of monetary policy control, but we want to keep it pretty small in terms of its footprint in the market.	92	9
201406	1778	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And so that implies that we’re going to have to keep the spread relatively wide to limit take-up.	92	9
201406	1779	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	My view is that a spread of 20 or even 30 basis points would probably be effective in terms of setting a floor and maintaining monetary policy control.	92	9
201406	1780	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think if we did that we could be pretty comfortable that we weren’t going to get a facility that was large in some sense.	92	9
201406	1781	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t view, in the context of the US financial system, a facility that is $200 billion or $300 billion as large.	92	9
201406	1782	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know what the total amount of financial assets outstanding in the United States is, but it’s probably $60 trillion.	92	9
201406	1783	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you had a facility that was $200 billion, I think that would be not large but pretty trivial in the context of the US economy.	92	9
201406	1784	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think we should make no commitment to making it permanent, but I would prefer not to make a commitment to making it temporary, either.	92	9
201406	1785	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would just keep it open.	92	9
201406	1786	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’re going to learn by having this facility in place, and maybe it will work better, in more miraculous ways, than we anticipate, or maybe it will work worse, and I don’t think anything we say today is really going to bind future Committees.	92	9
201406	1787	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And so I think I’d keep it open and not lean one way or the other in terms of what’s going to happen over the longer term.	92	9
201406	1788	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1789	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1790	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92	9
201406	1791	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1792	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Like others, I found the discussion from April and again today to be very helpful, and I remain open to considering this mix of tools as we go through normalization.	92	9
201406	1793	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I am very comfortable with how the Chair has described a centrist approach in thinking about this.	92	9
201406	1794	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I do think, though, that we’ll need to be clearer about our intentions regarding the ultimate size of the balance sheet.	92	9
201406	1795	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	When I look at the draft that the staff included of possible revised policy normalization principles, the phrase that indicates we will hold no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively is in brackets, which suggests it’s an issue that we’re going to need to discuss.	92	9
201406	1796	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	My own view remains generally consistent with the 2011 principles that we affirmed just last year, which say that we intend to eventually hold no more securities than needed and reduce reserves to the smallest levels consistent with the efficient implementation of policy.	92	9
201406	1797	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	One aspect of the normalization discussion and this use of overnight RRPs that makes me uncomfortable, as others have noted, is the substantially larger footprint we could have outside of the banking system, and I would align myself with Governor Tarullo’s views and counsel in this regard.	92	9
201406	1798	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Transacting directly with nonbank counterparties raises concerns about where we would draw the line, and while money market funds seem a natural boundary today, I could see over time that this pressure around fairness could grow and cause us to consider insurance companies, nonfinancial corporations, and pension funds as direct counterparties.	92	9
201406	1799	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	So, although as a practical matter the footprint may need to expand in the near term, I think steps to reduce the size of our balance sheet should remain a central tenet of our normalization strategy.	92	9
201406	1800	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	To address the specific questions, in terms of the federal funds rate, returning the balance sheet to its pre-crisis levels relative to GDP with a small amount of excess reserves calls, I think, for maintaining a role for the federal funds rate throughout the normalization process.	92	9
201406	1801	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	At the same time, control of overnight rates will require, at least for a time, the use of an ON RRP facility.	92	9
201406	1802	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of communications, I think continued reference to the federal funds rate is appropriate even though it may not serve as the primary tool during the early stages following liftoff.	92	9
201406	1803	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	As a practical matter, the ON RRP rate will need to serve that purpose given the size of our balance sheet and the use of IOER, but I would prefer to take an approach that maintains a wide spread in relation to the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	1804	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I also support the development of an expanded federal funds rate, though I would prefer that we move cautiously before adopting it as any kind of formal target of policy.	92	9
201406	1805	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding circuit breakers, I am comfortable with aggregate caps, with a market-based pricing mechanism designed to become activated when the cap is reached.	92	9
201406	1806	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	However, again, I think a smaller balance sheet will naturally take us in this direction, and so, for that reason, I think we should remain focused on steps to reduce that balance sheet.	92	9
201406	1807	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	And, finally, regarding reinvestment policy, it seems to me that the economy has not disappointed relative to our expectations last June when we reaffirmed the plan to cease reinvestments prior to liftoff.	92	9
201406	1808	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	If you remember, last June, the midpoint of our SEPs projected headline PCE inflation to be 1 percent in 2013 and the unemployment rate to be 7¼ percent.	92	9
201406	1809	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, unemployment fell more quickly, and inflation was above these projections, and given subsequent improvement in the unemployment rate and increased inflation, I don’t see a compelling reason to deviate from the plan of ceasing reinvestments prior to liftoff.	92	9
201406	1810	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	However, given that the primary dealer survey shows market expectations have shifted, we might consider redirecting maturing Treasury and MBS securities into shorter-dated Treasury securities.	92	9
201406	1811	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	That would allow us to maintain an elevated level of the balance sheet, but also provide for a more rapid runoff after liftoff.	92	9
201406	1812	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Could I just ask a question?	92	9
201406	1813	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Did you say that last June we had reiterated something about ceasing reinvestments?	92	9
201406	1814	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	We affirmed the broad principles around our 2011—	92	9
201406	1815	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But not the specifics around that.	92	9
201406	1816	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We said—	92	9
201406	1817	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	That’s right.	92	9
201406	1818	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The tactics—in the press conference, it was clear that they were sort of suspended.	92	9
201406	1819	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	And without distinguishing which were principles and which were tactics, the sequencing I saw as being the broad outlines of the principles that we had laid out in that exit strategy of 2011.	92	9
201406	1820	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The Chairman, though, explicitly said something about agency MBS being—	92	9
201406	1821	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I believe the Chairman said we would not sell MBS, and I think he said eventually we would have a smaller balance sheet, but that other aspects of it were up for reconsideration.	92	9
201406	1822	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	92	9
201406	1823	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If I remember correctly, Chairman Bernanke was very explicit that the sense of the Committee was not to sell the agency MBS.	92	9
201406	1824	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Absolutely.	92	9
201406	1825	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	But he didn’t take off the table that we would stop reinvestments.	92	9
201406	1826	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	He didn’t disavow anything else in that statement.	92	9
201406	1827	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re correct.	92	9
201406	1828	2014-06-18	meeting		[Simultaneous conversation]	92	9
201406	1829	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	He didn’t avow it.	92	9
201406	1830	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	He said we need to reconsider many aspects of the exit principles.	92	9
201406	1831	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	They were essentially no longer—	92	9
201406	1832	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The way market participants read it is that these principles were sort of in suspension.	92	9
201406	1833	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92	9
201406	1834	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Well, I believe we used the word “affirm” around broad principles in our statement, noting that many of the details might be reconsidered.	92	9
201406	1835	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	But it depends what a “detail” is, I guess.	92	9
201406	1836	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201406	1837	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1838	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201406	1839	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1840	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the opportunity of joining this august group.	92	9
201406	1841	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Of course, as the Chair noted, I have attended quite a few of these meetings during my career, but up to now that was as a policy adviser, not as a policymaker.	92	9
201406	1842	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As if there were any doubt, preparing for this meeting underscored the fact that while the physical distance from my former chair behind President Plosser to my current seat beside him is only a couple of feet, the real distance is far greater.	92	9
201406	1843	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	So I’m looking forward to contributing what I can to the discussions and formulation of monetary policy, to learning from all of you, and to working with you in my new role.	92	9
201406	1844	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	To that end, I want to add my thanks to the staff for the very helpful memos this time and last time on normalization.	92	9
201406	1845	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	It was a heroic task to find the common ground in the discussion at the previous meeting, but you did it.	92	9
201406	1846	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And I found the memos helped both me and my staff focus on the open issues.	92	9
201406	1847	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Now, in thinking through the issues, it became clear to me that the communications surrounding the choices we make about normalization are going to be nearly as important, if not equally important, as the economics behind the choices.	92	9
201406	1848	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	In many cases, there is going to be a tradeoff.	92	9
201406	1849	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The more complex methods of conducting policy might afford tighter control of interest rates, but they are going to be considerably more difficult to explain to the public, which in my view mitigates the benefits of more complicated methods.	92	9
201406	1850	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	It also seems clear that there is going to have to be learning by doing.	92	9
201406	1851	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Although we have been testing our tools, which is prudent, the testing is, by necessity, small and in an environment in which we haven’t been raising interest rates.	92	9
201406	1852	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	There are going to be surprises along the way.	92	9
201406	1853	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I am confident we will be able to raise interest rates with our tools, but precisely how much control of interest rates our tools provide, or how much we want to achieve as we begin raising rates, is unknowable until we are doing it.	92	9
201406	1854	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	So I think we need to be guided by experience as we implement the transition back to more-normal policymaking.	92	9
201406	1855	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	These considerations make me think it’s better to start with simpler methods, and then, as we gain more experience and we find those methods aren’t working quite the way we’d like, we can add complexity.	92	9
201406	1856	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As a contingency, I think we need to be prepared to use the full range of our tools, including term deposits and asset sales as needed.	92	9
201406	1857	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the questions, on question 1, my preference is that we communicate the stance of policy in terms of a range for the federal funds rate, or an expanded measure of it, rather than by administered rates.	92	9
201406	1858	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Communicating in terms of market rates rather than administered rates makes clear that it’s the effect of monetary policy on market interest rates and the transmission of those to the economy that’s important.	92	9
201406	1859	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	While we can trivially hit an IOER rate target, since we set the IOER rate, this doesn’t solve the problem of what IOER target will produce the effect on the economy that we are seeking.	92	9
201406	1860	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Another reason I favor communication based on a target funds rate range is that it will provide continuity as we transition from the period of normalization into a longer-run framework in which policy is formulated in terms of a fed funds rate target or similar market rate.	92	9
201406	1861	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Such a framework is my preference at this point.	92	9
201406	1862	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	That said, I realize there are measurement challenges with the federal funds rate as currently formulated.	92	9
201406	1863	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	With little trading in the market, the rate can be idiosyncratic and could be decoupled from other market rates.	92	9
201406	1864	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	So I’m open to thinking about an expanded version that would take into account a broader set of trades like Eurodollar transactions.	92	9
201406	1865	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	But if we go in that direction, I think it’s going to be important for us to explain carefully why we are doing it, and to explain this earlier rather than later, along the suggested time frame in the memo.	92	9
201406	1866	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	We certainly need to do it before liftoff to avoid the appearance that we are redefining the target just because we failed to hit it, which would undermine our credibility.	92	9
201406	1867	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I prefer setting a range for the funds rate target at this point and communicating that we will be using IOER and ON RRP as the tools to support achieving that target range.	92	9
201406	1868	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	We can add term deposits or asset sales if we find we need more control over market rates.	92	9
201406	1869	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I note that we are currently formulating policy using a target range rather than a point target.	92	9
201406	1870	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The public has accepted it.	92	9
201406	1871	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And the economic benefit of hitting a point target would seem to be swamped by the potential credibility issues posed if we consistently missed the point target, and by the complexity or size of operations that might be needed to hit the point target.	92	9
201406	1872	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	So I don’t see any advantage at this point of moving back from a range to a point target, especially at the early stage of normalization.	92	9
201406	1873	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	We can always narrow the range as normalization proceeds and the balance sheet is reduced to a size that gives us more control over the rate.	92	9
201406	1874	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	On question 2, regarding the overnight RRP program, I do have some concerns about the full-allotment facility.	92	9
201406	1875	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Even aside from the financial-stability concerns during times of financial stress, during normal times a full-allotment facility would decrease the potential for a revival of the funds market over the longer run.	92	9
201406	1876	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And I think it will be very difficult to turn back once we go to a large-scale facility.	92	9
201406	1877	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	In addition, such a facility implies a sizable expansion of implementation of policy through nonbank counterparties, including money market mutual funds, whose accounting rules we have criticized.	92	9
201406	1878	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	So my preference would be to limit the size of the program and avoid committing at this point to a permanent ON RRP facility.	92	9
201406	1879	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I would also favor imposing aggregate caps that would be binding more often than not, even in normal times, but particularly as we start the normalization process.	92	9
201406	1880	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Such a binding limit on the size during normal times could have an additional benefit during times of financial stress—namely, having seen binding size limits during normal times, market participants may view any circuit breakers we choose to impose to limit inflows during times of financial stress as being more credible.	92	9
201406	1881	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And then they might make contingency plans for binding caps and rely less on the RRPs.	92	9
201406	1882	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	On question 3, given the estimated effects, it probably doesn’t make that much difference economically whether reinvestments are simply stopped or gradually reduced once a decision is announced.	92	9
201406	1883	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Regarding timing relative to the first rate increase, the exit-strategy principles of June 2011 indicated the Committee would likely first stop buying assets, then stop reinvesting, and then begin raising interest rates.	92	9
201406	1884	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And I guess there is a certain salience to that given that the size of the balance sheet is related to the degree of accommodation.	92	9
201406	1885	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	But that timing presents a communications challenge.	92	9
201406	1886	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I think it would be hard to announce an end to reinvestments without bringing forward market expectations of liftoff.	92	9
201406	1887	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The cessation of reinvestments would essentially be the first tightening move, if it came before liftoff.	92	9
201406	1888	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And since my preference would be to use interest rates as our main policy tool, I would prefer to end reinvestments either at the time of the first increase in short-term interest rates or, if the other participants preferred, after the first rate increase.	92	9
201406	1889	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	On question 4, as I indicated earlier, I’m open to thinking about an expanded version of the funds rate.	92	9
201406	1890	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	But if we do redefine it, it’s going to be important to explain why we are doing it and to do it well before liftoff.	92	9
201406	1891	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Coming into the meeting, I didn’t have strong feelings about whether to rename the expanded rate the funds rate or to publish two rates, but I found Governor Powell’s and Vice Chairman Dudley’s discussion persuasive that it may be better just to publish one rate.	92	9
201406	1892	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I would prefer that we base the expanded rate on the FR-2420 data when those data become available to avoid the perception that we are targeting borrowing costs associated with foreign entities or money market mutual funds.	92	9
201406	1893	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Let me end with a final thought.	92	9
201406	1894	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Clear communications are an essential ingredient in a smooth transition process.	92	9
201406	1895	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Our communications need to be as clear as possible about what methods we plan to use and why.	92	9
201406	1896	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	They also need to convey the idea that, as we gain experience through the normalization process, we are going to make adjustments to the mix of our tools as needed in order to achieve our mandated goals.	92	9
201406	1897	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As I said, the communications issues are not trivial.	92	9
201406	1898	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	To help, I think we might consider asking the staff to issue a working paper that lays out some of the normalization considerations.	92	9
201406	1899	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	This could be similar to the working-paper primer the Board staff issued early last year about projections for the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and income.	92	9
201406	1900	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As a Reserve Bank staffer, I found it helpful to refer people to this paper when they had questions.	92	9
201406	1901	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Of course, such a working paper would not replace any official communications by the Committee and the Chair, but it might be a useful way to convey the idea that we are aware there are different approaches and several considerations when selecting an approach to normalization, and that adjustments could very well be necessary as we proceed.	92	9
201406	1902	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1903	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	1904	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201406	1905	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	1906	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	First, a couple of general remarks.	92	9
201406	1907	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	After listening carefully to the rich discussion at our previous meeting and digesting a rich array of memos for this meeting, I remain unconvinced that we are going to need an overnight RRP program to ensure market rates rise when we raise the interest rate on excess reserves and the funds rate target.	92	9
201406	1908	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We rely on some obvious arbitrage relationships for the vast majority of the links in the chain of economic relationships that make up the monetary policy transmission mechanism.	92	9
201406	1909	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And I don’t see any reason why arbitrage isn’t going to work to keep the RP rate aligned with interbank rates like the IOER rate and the fed funds rate, and the staff hasn’t really explained a theory about why that wouldn’t happen, at least to my knowledge.	92	9
201406	1910	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, I think routine use at a scale like what we’ve seen runs the risk of inducing significant restructuring of money markets, a concern many have alluded to here.	92	9
201406	1911	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think flows into the ON RRP facility are going to be potentially unpredictable both in normal times and in times of stress, as Governor Tarullo has emphasized.	92	9
201406	1912	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we are close to understanding them.	92	9
201406	1913	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d point to one question that remains open.	92	9
201406	1914	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The staff, particularly in New York, documented shifts in funding in the sense of cash lending that seemed to be a response to our program.	92	9
201406	1915	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	What is happening on the collateral financing side remains a mystery, and there doesn’t seem to have been much staff work into where the collateral that might otherwise have been financed by the money market funds that are lending to us now is being financed or held.	92	9
201406	1916	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I would prefer to use an overnight RRP facility only as a temporary contingency program.	92	9
201406	1917	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In my view, we should start raising rates the usual way.	92	9
201406	1918	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We should raise the interest rate on excess reserves by 15 or 25 basis points—so, take it to 40 or 50 basis points.	92	9
201406	1919	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We should raise the upper end of the range of the target federal funds rate accordingly to either 40 or 50 basis points.	92	9
201406	1920	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We should leave the overnight RRP rate at 5 or maybe 10 basis points— maybe increase it 5 basis points.	92	9
201406	1921	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And when we did that, we would say that we may increase the ON RRP rate at future meetings.	92	9
201406	1922	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We’d leave ourselves open with that option.	92	9
201406	1923	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We would just leave that on the table.	92	9
201406	1924	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Now, we will learn in short order whether the obvious arbitrage relationship is effective or not.	92	9
201406	1925	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If it is, we can keep the overnight RRP rate at a deep backstop of 50, maybe 75 basis points below the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	1926	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And the concerns everyone has about an excessively large program will be answered.	92	9
201406	1927	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It will be a relatively small backstop, just in case it’s necessary.	92	9
201406	1928	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So what if that doesn’t happen?	92	9
201406	1929	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	What if the RP rate doesn’t rise—that’s the possibility to think about.	92	9
201406	1930	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Well, at the next meeting, we raise the overnight RRP rate to 20 basis points below the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	1931	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	For our macroeconomic objectives, our mandate objectives, the delay is going to be inconsequential.	92	9
201406	1932	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think one meeting, in terms of the liftoff date, is going to matter much one way or another.	92	9
201406	1933	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The big risk is what I’d call the egg-on-the-face risk.	92	9
201406	1934	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think Bill English used this term, but this is the idea that we announce we are tightening conditions, and some market conditions don’t tighten.	92	9
201406	1935	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Well, I don’t think D-Day is the right way to approach this first increase.	92	9
201406	1936	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If we held it in suspense, made it a big surprise, and then attacked financial markets with overwhelming force—I don’t think that’s the way to do it.	92	9
201406	1937	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	1938	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Instead, we could do something a little more modest.	92	9
201406	1939	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We could just say we are making an adjustment in preparation for a plan to raise interest rates and adjust financial conditions.	92	9
201406	1940	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We could do it without saying, “This is the big day, everybody.”	92	9
201406	1941	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	When I was a kid, we’d get the TV and we’d watch John Glenn lift off and everything—T would get to zero, and the rocket would light up, but it would just stay there for 5 or 10 seconds before it started moving up.	92	9
201406	1942	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter].	92	9
201406	1943	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think we’ll get the rocket up.	92	9
201406	1944	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If we do this, I think we’ll learn pretty quickly whether we need a big-scale program, a medium-scale program, or what.	92	9
201406	1945	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And given everyone’s discomfort around here with a big program, I think we’d want to do the learning sooner rather than later.	92	9
201406	1946	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Let’s get our learning done right at the beginning, and it’s just going to take one move and we’ll figure it out.	92	9
201406	1947	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So that’s just a general comment.	92	9
201406	1948	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Let me grind my way through the questions here.	92	9
201406	1949	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On the question about how we communicate, given the configuration toward which I think we are going to head—IOER and a target federal funds rate that is anchored at the top by the IOER rate of, say, 25 basis points— there is an equivalence between describing things in terms of IOER and describing things in terms of the funds rate.	92	9
201406	1950	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We can even describe it in terms of the discount rate, for that matter.	92	9
201406	1951	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But I think the logical thing, given the governance reality that the Committee controls the funds rate target, is that we continue to describe policy in terms of the funds rate or some suitably defined interest rate and let the IOER rate be set by the Board in a related action.	92	9
201406	1952	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That formulation has worked very well for the discount rate, and I think we should continue doing that.	92	9
201406	1953	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On the question about a point versus a range, unless the range gets much smaller, I think we should stick with a range.	92	9
201406	1954	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Later on, when reserves get smaller, we can shift to a point.	92	9
201406	1955	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d be against stating a target in terms of general money market rates.	92	9
201406	1956	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And I’d just remind you of a bit of history: We started targeting the funds rate because of controversy surrounding the accountability of the System Open Market Account manager and disputes about whether they were faithfully executing the charge we had given them.	92	9
201406	1957	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I trust the System Open Market Account manager.	92	9
201406	1958	2014-06-18	meeting		[Laughter]	92	9
201406	1959	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	With all due respect—There’s an important element of what are we asking them to do, how do we know they’re doing what we have asked them to do, and so on, so I think it is important to keep a specific range that we can monitor.	92	9
201406	1960	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On the question about circuit breakers, I don’t think circuit breakers on a fixed rate, full- allotment overnight RRP program are capable of addressing the financial-stability issues that some have raised in this context.	92	9
201406	1961	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If investors want to flee a particular counterparty, or a particular class of counterparties, depriving them of the option of Federal Reserve Bank overnight RRP investments is hardly going to stop them.	92	9
201406	1962	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They have short-term Treasury securities.	92	9
201406	1963	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They have money market funds.	92	9
201406	1964	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They’ve got bank deposits.	92	9
201406	1965	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And that is just in the United States.	92	9
201406	1966	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, most of the bank runs in 2008 were from one bank to another or from one counterparty to another in the same asset class.	92	9
201406	1967	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So I just don’t think this is worth troubling ourselves about.	92	9
201406	1968	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Now, on the other hand, I do think we should limit the size of the program, if we’re going down that road, and so I think we should impose an explicit quantitative limit on the size of the program, if only because of the finite size of our balance sheet.	92	9
201406	1969	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I mean, if we go to full allotment, it would raise questions, what do we do if we get everybody showing up, and  running an auction like that described under option 2?	92	9
201406	1970	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In our earlier discussion, we had a really interesting exchange about interest rates.	92	9
201406	1971	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Stopping out at the cap and then having an auction that drives interest rates down—this would be a mechanism to reduce the rate of return on ON RRPs in order to discourage people from shifting into them.	92	9
201406	1972	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The obvious question is, why don’t we just reduce interest rates if we don’t want investors fleeing the assets they’re in?	92	9
201406	1973	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That’s what we usually do in a crisis anyway.	92	9
201406	1974	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So I’m not sure that’s germane here.	92	9
201406	1975	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On the question about reinvestment, I’m in President George’s camp of viewing elements of the exit strategy that we articulated in 2011 that have not been specifically refuted as standing as implicit commitments of ours.	92	9
201406	1976	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We indicated that we’d begin normalization by ending reinvestments and only later raising interest rates.	92	9
201406	1977	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think the macroeconomic implications of whether we start running off our portfolio several months before or several months after we start raising rates are likely to be negligible.	92	9
201406	1978	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And I think that the staff’s analysis supported the idea that this is not terribly consequential.	92	9
201406	1979	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But I do think it would erode our credibility to fail to follow through on the guidance we provided several years ago.	92	9
201406	1980	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Forward guidance is really central to how we conduct policy these days.	92	9
201406	1981	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I would think that at the margin we would always be reluctant to renege on past statements.	92	9
201406	1982	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think, as a general principle, there ought to be something at stake.	92	9
201406	1983	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And to me, the macroeconomic difference doesn’t seem to be worth it.	92	9
201406	1984	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It just seems like there is little to gain there.	92	9
201406	1985	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On the question about an expanded federal funds rate, I came in having been left with the impression by some staff memo—I can’t remember which one—that there were enough legal differences between federal funds and Eurodollars to make it important to establish a new rate, but Governor Powell and Vice Chairman Dudley seemed persuasive about those issues, so I could easily be persuaded that we go with a single new rate.	92	9
201406	1986	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I have two final thoughts.	92	9
201406	1987	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The staff has spent an enormous amount of time and effort on these memos, and I greatly appreciate all the time and energy they have devoted to this.	92	9
201406	1988	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We have spent a great deal of time on this as well.	92	9
201406	1989	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Not as much as they have.	92	9
201406	1990	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	First, there’s a sense in which the memos have been focused on a narrow perspective.	92	9
201406	1991	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The issues we’re talking about—should the central bank offer moneylike liabilities to counterparties outside the banking industry—this goes back a couple of centuries to the debates about the banking school and the currency school, 100 percent reserves, narrow banking, and the like, and there is a broader debate here and a broader set of economic issues about how central banks should be structured that we haven’t really touched on.	92	9
201406	1992	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Second—and this is my last thought—I’m sure there are market participants who are dying to know about the operational mechanics of our exit.	92	9
201406	1993	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But the closer I get to September, the more I think that the operational mechanics are not what most Americans want to know about our exit strategy.	92	9
201406	1994	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think they are interested in when it’s going to happen.	92	9
201406	1995	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think they will believe us when we say it depends.	92	9
201406	1996	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But I think they are going to want to know what it depends on—is it the level of resource utilization?	92	9
201406	1997	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Is it the rate of change of resource utilization, or consumption, or output, or the like?	92	9
201406	1998	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	How does inflation figure in?	92	9
201406	1999	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Does inflation have to get high first, or are we going to nip incipient pressures in the bud?	92	9
201406	2000	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I worry that the time we are spending on the mechanics of our exit are detracting from useful work that we could and perhaps should be devoting to the macroeconomics of our exit.	92	9
201406	2001	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	2002	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	2003	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201406	2004	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	2005	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to start by echoing your welcome to Governor Fischer, Governor Brainard, and President Mester.	92	9
201406	2006	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you said, Madam Chair, I look forward to working with all of you and learning from you.	92	9
201406	2007	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One thing I have already learned is that the name “Fisher” is surprisingly popular among central bankers.	92	9
201406	2008	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Look at our Committee.	92	9
201406	2009	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Look at the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England.	92	9
201406	2010	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m tempted to say that “Fisher” is to central banking as “Williams” is to NBA basketball, but perhaps that stretches it too far.	92	9
201406	2011	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	2012	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my remarks I am going to have three themes.	92	9
201406	2013	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is that we haven’t seen much analysis concerning the dual-mandate benefits of the overnight RRP facility.	92	9
201406	2014	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And my own assessment, in the absence of that analysis, is that the dual-mandate benefits of the facility are likely to be small.	92	9
201406	2015	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In contrast, as some around the table have already alluded to, I think that there are very likely to be big effects on the industrial organization of short-term funding markets.	92	9
201406	2016	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s hard to predict what those effects will be, but I think it is safe to say that they might well be large.	92	9
201406	2017	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those two considerations together give rise to a sense of uneasiness for me about this decision being taken by this Committee—whether or not this decision is rightly seen as being one that is in the purview of the FOMC.	92	9
201406	2018	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not talking in a legal sense, but more in the sense of appropriateness.	92	9
201406	2019	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to my dual-mandate point first.	92	9
201406	2020	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This will echo some of the remarks that President Lacker made last time.	92	9
201406	2021	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the absence of the overnight RRP facility, there will of course be gaps between short-term market interest rates and the interest rate being paid on excess reserves.	92	9
201406	2022	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As President Lacker emphasized in our previous meeting and mentioned again today, the forces of arbitrage are going to serve to keep those gaps finite and well defined.	92	9
201406	2023	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some admittedly simple calculations by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis staff support President Lacker’s point.	92	9
201406	2024	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those calculations suggest that a bank borrowing federal funds and investing in reserves could earn a risk-free return of more than 7 percent if that spread between the IOER rate and the fed funds rate reached 40 basis points.	92	9
201406	2025	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is taking into account things like the bank leverage ratio and the FDIC assessment fee.	92	9
201406	2026	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s worth emphasizing that the calculations suggest that the arbitrage would be even more effective if the System were to exempt bank reserves from the 4 percent floor imposed on bank leverage.	92	9
201406	2027	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I talked about a 40 basis point spread being consistent with a risk-free rate of return of 7 percent.	92	9
201406	2028	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Using the overnight RRP facility actively could close this gap further.	92	9
201406	2029	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But this is really a question about the benefits, I think.	92	9
201406	2030	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How much would our standard measures of quadratic loss, in terms of deviations from our inflation and employment goals, rise if there were a gap of 40, 50, or 60 basis points from the IOER rate and other short-term funding rates, as opposed to the gap of, say, 20 basis points that Governor Tarullo mentioned?	92	9
201406	2031	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will repeat this, just to try to be as clear as I can be:  If we just used IOER and did not have the overnight RRP facility, I would anticipate gaps that could be as large as 40, 50, or 60 basis points emerging between the IOER rate and other short-term funding rates.	92	9
201406	2032	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How would that magnitude of gaps affect the quadratic loss in terms of our macroeconomic objectives relative to a smaller gap of, say, 20 basis points?	92	9
201406	2033	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As far as I know, we haven’t seen any specific staff work on this point.	92	9
201406	2034	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own assessment, in the absence of that work, is that the increase in quadratic loss would be de minimis.	92	9
201406	2035	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this again goes back to a point that President Lacker made at our previous meeting.	92	9
201406	2036	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Making monetary policy is not about hitting a particular target for some short-term interest rate.	92	9
201406	2037	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Making monetary policy is about influencing the public’s beliefs about the evolution of financial conditions over the next few years.	92	9
201406	2038	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I believe that we can just as effectively communicate this information through changes in a single administered rate like the IOER rate as opposed to changes in the target, or target range, for a market short-term interest rate—or as opposed to changes in multiple administered rates.	92	9
201406	2039	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this belief is supported through the experience of other central banks that use different operating procedures.	92	9
201406	2040	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that is on the benefit side.	92	9
201406	2041	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What about on the cost side?	92	9
201406	2042	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s very hard for us to know the ultimate effect of this facility on the industrial organization of short-term funding markets.	92	9
201406	2043	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we can say we’ll start small, but I think there will be a lot of demands on the outside from other counterparties that want to have access.	92	9
201406	2044	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the fairness criterion that the Desk has suggested using is going to force us to expand this.	92	9
201406	2045	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s really hard for us to predict how the structure of money market funds will change and what that change will mean for the funding of other financial institutions.	92	9
201406	2046	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We could use the best modeling and analysis available between now and September, but I think even with that, the answer to this question is going to be highly uncertain.	92	9
201406	2047	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we’ve got limited dual-mandate benefits, and then big-time effects on financial markets.	92	9
201406	2048	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My last comment, then, along these lines concerns the role of the Congress and the public in making decisions about this facility.	92	9
201406	2049	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The way we operate is, we deliberate in secret without much in the way of direct oversight or input from the public.	92	9
201406	2050	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think that form of decisionmaking is well designed and appropriately designed to prevent political considerations from influencing the course of monetary policy.	92	9
201406	2051	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Should we be using that same closed-door process to reshape the structure of the financial industry in possibly very fundamental ways— especially in the absence of being able to point to very convincing and compelling dual-mandate benefits?	92	9
201406	2052	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Congress originally granted us the power to pay interest on reserves to depository institutions after deliberating for at least three years—probably those of you who know the history can say it was much longer than that, but I’ll say for at least three years.	92	9
201406	2053	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Should the Congress not have a say in whether we can essentially pay interest on reserves to other financial entities?	92	9
201406	2054	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At a minimum, it would seem to me that representatives of the public should be able to provide public input on the potential effect of this potentially far-reaching decision.	92	9
201406	2055	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So those are my general comments.	92	9
201406	2056	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see the dual-mandate benefits of this facility as small in the absence of a more detailed analysis, and I see these costs on the industry structure side as being such that it is sort of outside the purview of our usual kinds of decisionmaking in this closed-door forum.	92	9
201406	2057	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to a couple of the questions.	92	9
201406	2058	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that Governor Fischer’s line of comments about the fed funds rate were very apt.	92	9
201406	2059	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And to quote a Ninth District resident, “There is no need to go back to making monetary policy like it’s 1999.”	92	9
201406	2060	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	2061	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a quote from Prince, for those of you who are not tracking the Ninth District closely.	92	9
201406	2062	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You know, we were all much younger in 1999.	92	9
201406	2063	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Everything was a lot better in 1999.	92	9
201406	2064	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But that doesn’t mean we have to make monetary policy that way.	92	9
201406	2065	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To get serious about this, I think we can communicate effectively about the evolution of financial conditions through a single administered rate, the rate of interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201406	2066	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Governor Tarullo raised a great way of thinking about this.	92	9
201406	2067	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should just be monitoring short-term interest rates.	92	9
201406	2068	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	They are just one more indicator among a host of other indicators we can keep track of and we can be responsive to.	92	9
201406	2069	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we thought short-term interest rates were too low, for some reason, relative to what we’re trying to achieve, we could raise the rate of interest on excess reserves.	92	9
201406	2070	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, Governor Stein raised this way of thinking about things with respect to long-term interest rates.	92	9
201406	2071	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is just extending his thinking to short-term interest rates.	92	9
201406	2072	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The other point I wanted to comment on has to do with reinvestment.	92	9
201406	2073	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought there was a great conversation about this.	92	9
201406	2074	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was drawn to Vice Chairman Dudley’s language, which was more flexible, for the exit-strategy principles.	92	9
201406	2075	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you wanted a set of principles to enunciate in September, I thought Vice Chairman Dudley was right—we should be flexible in that.	92	9
201406	2076	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When it actually comes to the time of trying to communicate something more specific about the likely path of the balance sheet, I liked Governor Powell’s language, which actually might also have been Vice Chairman Dudley’s at some other point.	92	9
201406	2077	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in any event, I thought it was a very nice idea that the change in our reinvestments will begin when the fed funds rate gets to 1 percent.	92	9
201406	2078	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	After that, I think that we should have a deterministic path for the balance sheet, under which it evolves slowly over time.	92	9
201406	2079	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that would mean smoothing out paydowns due to reinvestments and Treasury fluctuations.	92	9
201406	2080	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We think of the balance sheet as exerting force in terms of our policy, so it makes sense for us to be thinking about a deterministic path for the balance sheet, and then using the IOER rate as our main policy tool.	92	9
201406	2081	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	2082	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have been relatively lengthy in my remarks, but I will not commit, as Governor Tarullo did, to making my future remarks short.	92	9
201406	2083	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you for that.	92	9
201406	2084	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201406	2085	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks very much, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	2086	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We all benefited from the excellent staff work and preparation of papers.	92	9
201406	2087	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I benefited even more than most of you, because I was force fed [laughter] this diet of papers, and it was very, very helpful.	92	9
201406	2088	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I almost understand some of the issues now.	92	9
201406	2089	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I was required to read the transcript of last time’s discussion, and it was impressive, actually.	92	9
201406	2090	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It was very serious.	92	9
201406	2091	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It was even interesting.	92	9
201406	2092	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	2093	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And I thought it was at a high level.	92	9
201406	2094	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I thought the staff uncharacteristically made a mistake in this list of five possibilities, because when there are three you know which one to go for.	92	9
201406	2095	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	This time you had to choose between three in the middle, options 2, 3, and 4.	92	9
201406	2096	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It couldn’t possibly be 1 or 5.	92	9
201406	2097	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So we got to options 2 and 3, and options 2 and 3 barely differ.	92	9
201406	2098	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	In option 2, the policy rate is a market or administered rate.	92	9
201406	2099	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think it should say “or rates.”	92	9
201406	2100	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And in option 3, the federal funds rate is how you describe the policy.	92	9
201406	2101	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure that it’s a policy rate, but we’ll come to that in a minute.	92	9
201406	2102	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now, as I first heard about this, I thought what we had was a corridor system in which the IOER rate was the top of the corridor and the ON RRP rate was the bottom of the corridor.	92	9
201406	2103	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But, if so, it’s a very complex one, because in most corridor systems the upper rate is the borrowing rate from the central bank and the lower rate is the deposit rate at the central bank.	92	9
201406	2104	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And here the upper rate is the deposit rate—	92	9
201406	2105	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201406	2106	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	This almost sounds like the difference between Britain and the United States—up is down and down is up, and things like that, on most issues.	92	9
201406	2107	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But the difference arises primarily from the fact that the US banks are not currently active in the federal funds market.	92	9
201406	2108	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	At least that’s how I understand this issue.	92	9
201406	2109	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And that really brings us to an issue that bothers a lot of people, including me, and that issue—it was put too strongly as, is it our job to enable nonbanks to indirectly receive interest payments from the Fed?	92	9
201406	2110	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And while President Kocherlakota raised very valid issues, I think the answer is, it would be preferable if that didn’t happen and we didn’t have to go to the Congress for a discussion on this issue, which would probably end up with us getting a triple mandate or something else.	92	9
201406	2111	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	You don’t go to the Congress lightly, in any case.	92	9
201406	2112	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It does seem to me really problematic that we would be spreading seigniorage much more widely than we want to, and we need to think about that.	92	9
201406	2113	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Before I answer the questions, I just want to raise three issues.	92	9
201406	2114	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	First of all, how confident are we that we can run this system smoothly and successfully?	92	9
201406	2115	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Who was on the other side—this is a question for Simon and the people on the Desk—who was on the other side of the reverse repos all the time?	92	9
201406	2116	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Was it American money market funds?	92	9
201406	2117	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Was it European banks, as I was originally told?	92	9
201406	2118	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Who was it, and how robust is the behavior of this system?	92	9
201406	2119	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Second, a related question:  A lot of people have been in favor of the IOER-only system—don’t bother with the ON RRP program, and just hope that the federal funds rate would trade close to the IOER rate.	92	9
201406	2120	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think that might happen when there are very few reserves in the system, but it probably wouldn’t happen right now.	92	9
201406	2121	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But it would be interesting if we could have from the staff their view on whether there is any prospect of such a system succeeding.	92	9
201406	2122	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If so, it would deal with a lot of problems that some people have with using the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	2123	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The third issue—and this is one that bothers me more generally, but it applies also in this context—is that I am much less fond of trying to fix a deterministic path for what we are going to do two or three years down the road.	92	9
201406	2124	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we know.	92	9
201406	2125	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We can say what we think today we are going to do two or three years down the road.	92	9
201406	2126	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But if I look back at the 2011 exit-strategy principles, they are all about the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	2127	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, now we are considering whether to make that the way we do monetary policy.	92	9
201406	2128	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And if we watch what happened to the British with their forward guidance, which didn’t hold up, I don’t see that they have suffered a huge loss in credibility as of now, but that may have to do with the fact that the person who changed it wasn’t the person who said it.	92	9
201406	2129	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And it may be more complicated for us.	92	9
201406	2130	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So I would prefer to retain some more flexibility, and I’ll come to that in a moment.	92	9
201406	2131	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Let me try to answer these questions.	92	9
201406	2132	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The first one is, during normalization, do you want to communicate the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate or by emphasizing administered rates?	92	9
201406	2133	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I would like to do it by targeting the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	2134	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	As Bill English said, that system seemed to work fairly well.	92	9
201406	2135	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But it doesn’t seem to be something we could do right now.	92	9
201406	2136	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We would have to go to at least the IOER rate and, I think, the overnight reverse repo rate.	92	9
201406	2137	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	By the way, I have a suggestion that President Lockhart would like.	92	9
201406	2138	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	ON-blank-RRP is a very long name for something.	92	9
201406	2139	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think if you wrote “ONRRP,” without a blank, you would save paper [laughter] and you’d save ink.	92	9
201406	2140	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not volunteering to join your committee, but may I propose that as a possibility?	92	9
201406	2141	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If we continue to target the federal funds rate—well, that’s one possibility—should it be a point target or a target range?	92	9
201406	2142	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	From what I understand now, if we made it a point target, we’d miss it significantly.	92	9
201406	2143	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If we wouldn’t, then I don’t know why we’re not doing it now and why we don’t just go with that.	92	9
201406	2144	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Everything I’ve read suggests we would have trouble hitting it, so I think a target range would be preferable.	92	9
201406	2145	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If we communicate the stance of policy using the overnight RRP and IOER rates, we should, I think, refer to the federal funds rate for the reason that the public knows about it.	92	9
201406	2146	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It has the attraction that as we get to a much smaller size of the balance sheet, we could probably run this system operating via the banks, and we’d solve the issue of spreading the seigniorage around too widely.	92	9
201406	2147	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	In terms of the circuit breakers, you don’t want those to be so tough that you can’t act as lender of last resort in a crisis.	92	9
201406	2148	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And we’re all thinking that everybody wants to pour their money into the United States.	92	9
201406	2149	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It has happened that everybody wanted to get their money out of here sometimes.	92	9
201406	2150	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And we have really got to think about keeping those caps flexible because they are caps on what we can do with our portfolio.	92	9
201406	2151	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to retain that flexibility, and that would certainly involve interest rate movements, and we’d have to be ready to move interest rates.	92	9
201406	2152	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Should there be limits on the size of the overnight program?	92	9
201406	2153	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, because if we got close to the size of the portfolio, we’d be well into an area in which we would be operating with no knowledge of how the system would work, and we really need a constraint on allowing ourselves to get anywhere close to that point.	92	9
201406	2154	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	On the reinvestment of principal, when I wrote this the other day, I said, “By the way, what is the circumstance under which we would run off the size of the portfolio before raising the short rate?”	92	9
201406	2155	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Having listened to the discussion, I think we shouldn’t, and that we should raise the rate first and then start thinking about the size of the portfolio.	92	9
201406	2156	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know that we should try to fix a date for that.	92	9
201406	2157	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think we need to retain flexibility, both on the composition of the portfolio and on the timing of beginning to run it off.	92	9
201406	2158	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And on the composition, somebody already mentioned the real estate problem.	92	9
201406	2159	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Real estate is much weaker now than we thought it would be, and I expect it is going to straighten out.	92	9
201406	2160	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If it doesn’t straighten out, I don’t think we want to be selling off MBS at the time that we have decided we should be beginning to reduce the size of the portfolio.	92	9
201406	2161	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	A final thought—if the Fed constructs this index of the federal funds rate and the Eurodollar rate, then we have really got ourselves into a case in which we’re targeting a rate which we don’t have a heck of a lot of influence over, and we’re relying on the market keeping them together.	92	9
201406	2162	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Sometimes those arbitrages work, and then sometimes some strange thing happens and they break.	92	9
201406	2163	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	So I think we should say we target a measure like that, but I would prefer to actually publish the federal funds rate.	92	9
201406	2164	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think the Eurodollar rate is pretty far from us.	92	9
201406	2165	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It looks like it has been tight for quite a while, but it doesn’t feel to me, given all the things that influence Eurodollars, that we can rely on that.	92	9
201406	2166	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	92	9
201406	2167	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	2168	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201406	2169	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Well, first of all, Madam Chair, it is delightful to be here, and I look forward to working with all of you.	92	9
201406	2170	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to compliment the staff on their analysis, which I found very informative.	92	9
201406	2171	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to have exposure to this very excellent analysis until yesterday [laughter], and in light of that, and of the very consequential nature of the questions on the table, I am going to reserve my comments until the next meeting.	92	9
201406	2172	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ll tip my hand a little bit, particularly in response to President Kocherlakota’s comments, and just say I would put a priority on demonstrating credibly to the markets that the Fed is going to be able to exercise effective control over financial conditions in the very unprecedented circumstances in which we find ourselves.	92	9
201406	2173	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But I will reserve comment on the more detailed questions about exactly what that means until next time.	92	9
201406	2174	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201406	2175	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201406	2176	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve come to the conclusion of our discussion on normalization, and I suggest we take a very short break.	2	2
201406	2177	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Since it’s my job to crack the whip, why don’t I say 10 minutes—after having given you an incredibly generous lunch break.	2	2
201406	2178	2014-06-18	meeting		[Laughter]	2	2
201406	2179	2014-06-18	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201406	2180	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks to everybody for an excellent discussion.	2	2
201406	2181	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think we did succeed in further narrowing the range of possibilities here, and we will try to come back to you with something that we think maybe represents where we might go in a consensus set of exit principles that we can discuss at our next meeting.	2	2
201406	2182	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me also make clear that the Board meeting has now concluded, so we’re in an FOMC meeting.	2	2
201406	2183	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	And let me turn the floor over to Jeremy Rudd for the presentation on the economic situation.	11	1
201406	2184	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Thank you.	11	1
201406	2185	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Our exhibits are in the packet titled “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11	1
201406	2186	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Your first exhibit gives an overview of near-term domestic economic developments.	11	1
201406	2187	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As shown by the leftmost blue bar in panel 1, we have cut our estimate of first-quarter real PCE growth by nearly 1 percentage point relative to the forecast that we delivered to you in last Wednesday’s Tealbook.	11	1
201406	2188	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The downward revision is concentrated in spending on medical services, which the BEA had expected to jump as a result of the Affordable Care Act.	11	1
201406	2189	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In the event, the first-quarter source data that became available last week actually implied a decline in medical spending, though we still expect an increase to occur sometime this year.	11	1
201406	2190	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We expect that real PCE will accelerate over the remainder of this year, partly reflecting the anticipated step-up in medical services outlays and partly based on our read of available spending indicators—such as motor vehicle sales—and fundamentals such as wealth and income.	11	1
201406	2191	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The incoming data on housing activity, including today’s report for May, have continued to be soft.	11	1
201406	2192	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In particular, single-family housing starts—the red line in panel 2—have changed little, on net, over the past year or so.	11	1
201406	2193	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The same is true for housing permits (the black line), which provide a better gauge of the underlying trend of construction activity than starts.	11	1
201406	2194	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	With little evidence that the housing sector has resumed its upward trajectory following last year’s sharp rise in mortgage rates, we have made noticeable downward revisions to our projection of real residential investment growth over the remainder of the near term.	11	1
201406	2195	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Turning to the business sector, panel 3 plots the latest data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods.	11	1
201406	2196	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The three-month moving averages of new orders (the red line) and shipments (the black line) have come in above our expectations; with orders running ahead of shipments, we continue to expect that growth in real spending on equipment and intangibles will rebound in the second quarter from its disappointing first-quarter pace.	11	1
201406	2197	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 presents the recent data on manufacturing output, including the May reading that was released yesterday.	11	1
201406	2198	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As shown in the inset box, factory output posted a solid gain in May following swings in earlier months that we attribute to the effects of unusually severe winter weather.	11	1
201406	2199	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Smoothing through some of this monthly volatility, the chart plots the three-month moving average of manufacturing IP.	11	1
201406	2200	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As you can see, the average pace of recent gains has been about the same as what we have seen over the past few years; assuming a similar rate of increase in June, manufacturing output is on track to rise at an annual rate of 5¾ percent in the second quarter.	11	1
201406	2201	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Panel 5 summarizes our near-term outlook.	11	1
201406	2202	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	After folding in the retail sales, services, and government spending data that we received after the June Tealbook closed, we project that real GDP—line 1—will rise 4¼ percent at an annual rate in the current quarter following a 2 percent decline in the first quarter.	11	1
201406	2203	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Part of the rationale for this projected second-quarter rebound is that the first-quarter drop in GDP was led by unexpectedly steep declines in inventory investment and exports— two spending categories that carry little information for the future level of GDP.	11	1
201406	2204	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In addition, as Jeremy Nalewaik discussed in his pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, other indicators of real activity give us reason to question the first-quarter output estimate.	11	1
201406	2205	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As another way of assessing the implications of the incoming data, the solid line in panel 6 shows forecasts for near-term real GDP growth derived from our suite of factor models.	11	1
201406	2206	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Starting from the published first-quarter figure, the model projections imply a sizable rebound in growth, with an average pace in the second and third quarters that is not markedly different from the staff forecast (the dashed line).	11	1
201406	2207	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Your next exhibit summarizes the medium-term outlook.	11	1
201406	2208	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I will focus here on comparisons between the June Tealbook and our forecast from last December, both because December was the date of the last chart show and because the past six months have seen us significantly rethink our supply-side assumptions.	11	1
201406	2209	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As reflected in panel 1, relative to December, we have lowered 2014 and 2015 GDP growth by ½ percentage point and have lowered 2016 growth by ¼ percentage point.	11	1
201406	2210	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The factors contributing to these revisions are listed in panel 2; specifically, upward revisions to wealth and some momentum from stronger-than-expected output growth last year have added a little to projected GDP growth, while a higher exchange value of the dollar has reduced projected growth.	11	1
201406	2211	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	However, the largest cumulative revision to the medium-term outlook comes from the last item on the list—namely, the sizable reduction we have made to projected potential output growth since December.	11	1
201406	2212	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As you know, these revisions to potential reflect changes that we have made to our supply-side assumptions that allow us to better explain the joint behavior of the unemployment rate and actual output through the lens of Okun’s law.	11	1
201406	2213	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Over the forecast period, we typically pass the bulk of any potential output revision through to aggregate demand on the grounds that it will affect households’ permanent income growth and firms’ expected sales growth.	11	1
201406	2214	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In quantitative terms, therefore, the downward revisions that we have made to projected potential GDP growth from 2014 to 2016—which are summarized in panel 3— explain the lion’s share of the reduction in our forecast for actual GDP over this period.	11	1
201406	2215	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Turning to some of the components of spending, our current expected contour for real PCE growth—shown by the gray bars in panel 4—has been revised a little lower in 2015 and 2016 in response to the downward revisions to potential.	11	1
201406	2216	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Similarly, we now have a flatter contour of business investment growth—panel 5—and largely for the same reason.	11	1
201406	2217	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We have made a more noticeable downward revision to our outlook for residential investment relative to December (panel 6).	11	1
201406	2218	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We still believe that the projected continued improvement in the broader economy implies that the longer-term fundamentals for the housing sector are sound.	11	1
201406	2219	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	However, the puzzling weakness we have seen in housing construction in recent quarters has led us to significantly delay our anticipated recovery in residential investment.	11	1
201406	2220	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As we discussed in the Tealbook, this round we made some small but important changes to our longer-term outlook; specifically, we reduced both longer-run potential output growth and the long-run equilibrium real federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point relative to our previous assumptions.	11	1
201406	2221	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	These changes had little net influence on the medium-term output forecast, as the boost from lower real long- maturity yields was basically offset by the effect of lower real growth prospects.	11	1
201406	2222	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Your third exhibit gives an overview of the labor market.	11	1
201406	2223	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The two employment reports that we received over the intermeeting period suggest that conditions in the labor market have been improving at a slightly faster pace than we anticipated in April.	11	1
201406	2224	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As shown in panel 1, total nonfarm payroll growth (the solid line) averaged 235,000 jobs per month over the three months ending in May, 30,000 more than we had expected.	11	1
201406	2225	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The unemployment rate—shown in the inset box—came in at 6.3 percent in both April and May, ¼ percentage point below our April Tealbook forecast.	11	1
201406	2226	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The black line in panel 2 gives our medium-term outlook for the unemployment rate, while the red line gives our December Tealbook projection.	11	1
201406	2227	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Relative to December, the expected path of the unemployment rate is ½ percentage point lower, on average, over the 2014 to 2016 period; as we have made only small revisions to our estimate of the natural rate—the green line—over this period, the downward revision to our unemployment rate forecast mostly yields a narrower projected unemployment gap.	11	1
201406	2228	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Indeed, by the end of 2016, the unemployment rate is expected to be slightly below our estimate of the natural rate.	11	1
201406	2229	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As of May, the unemployment rate stood about 1 percentage point above our estimate of its natural rate.	11	1
201406	2230	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	While we generally view the unemployment gap as the best single indicator of labor market slack, we also examine a number of other indicators to try to assess the overall degree of labor underutilization in the economy.	11	1
201406	2231	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For example, as panel 3 shows, the labor force participation rate remains noticeably below our estimate of its trend; moreover, there has been little net progress in closing the gap between actual and trend participation since the first half of last year.	11	1
201406	2232	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 combines the information in the unemployment and participation rate gaps by comparing the employment-to-population ratio with the staff’s estimate of its trend, which is in turn derived from our estimates of the natural rate and trend participation.	11	1
201406	2233	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	On this basis, the employment-to-population ratio is currently about 1¼ percentage points below its trend.	11	1
201406	2234	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Another measure of underutilization—the share of those employed who are working part time for economic reasons—is plotted by the black line in panel 5.	11	1
201406	2235	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	This series has retraced less than half of its run-up over the last recession and, as a comparison with the blue line shows, remains above the level that is implied by its historical relationship with the unemployment gap.	11	1
201406	2236	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Finally, panel 6 plots three measures of wage inflation, which we would expect to increase in a tight labor market.	11	1
201406	2237	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	After declining during the recession, wage inflation appears thus far to have stayed relatively subdued.	11	1
201406	2238	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Taken as a whole, we see these and other pieces of evidence as suggesting that a significant margin of slack remains in the labor market.	11	1
201406	2239	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Your final exhibit discusses the outlook for price inflation.	11	1
201406	2240	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As shown in the table in panel 1, the data we had in hand for the June Tealbook point to second-quarter PCE inflation that is a little higher than we expected in April.	11	1
201406	2241	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	This morning we received the CPI for May, which again surprised us to the upside, with larger-than- expected increases in the food, energy, and core components.	11	1
201406	2242	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For food, we believe that the supply disruptions that have recently boosted consumer food prices are likely to be temporary.	11	1
201406	2243	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For core inflation, much of the surprise has been in categories from which we take little signal for future inflation.	11	1
201406	2244	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Incorporating today’s CPI release, the May PPI data we received last Friday, and recent oil price developments, we now project total PCE inflation of 2.3 percent in the current quarter and 1.9 percent next quarter; our updated forecast for core PCE inflation is 1.9 percent in the second quarter and 1.6 percent in the third quarter.	11	1
201406	2245	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Median longer-term inflation expectations from the preliminary June Michigan survey (the black line in panel 2) remain within the range seen over the past several years, while 10-year expectations from the second-quarter SPF (the blue line) were flat at 2 percent for a sixth consecutive quarter.	11	1
201406	2246	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Turning to the medium-term inflation outlook, since the December Tealbook, we have made essentially no change to our forecast for total PCE inflation (panel 3) or core inflation (panel 4) in the outyears of the projection despite a narrower projected margin of slack.	11	1
201406	2247	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	This is because we have also slightly revised down our estimate of the level of PCE inflation that would obtain in the absence of economic slack and other shocks and if the current level of longer-run inflation expectations were maintained.	11	1
201406	2248	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Specifically, for the June projection, we decided to lower our judgmental estimate of this level, which we have dubbed “underlying inflation,” from 1.9 percent to 1¾ percent.	11	1
201406	2249	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Some of the empirical evidence that informed this decision—which was reviewed at greater length in a memorandum by Deb Lindner that was sent to the Committee earlier this month—is summarized in panel 5.	11	1
201406	2250	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As can be seen from the first column of figures, point estimates of underlying core PCE inflation from the reduced-form Phillips curves that the staff uses in the judgmental forecast (lines 1 and 2) and stochastic trends from various other time-series models (lines 3 through 5) currently run from 1.3 to 1.8 percent.	11	1
201406	2251	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As the second column of figures indicates, these point estimates are not tied down with much precision.	11	1
201406	2252	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Nevertheless, we felt that a small reduction in our judgmental estimate of underlying inflation would result in a more balanced inflation forecast.	11	1
201406	2253	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As shown in panel 6, which decomposes the determinants of our medium-term core inflation contour, because we assume that longer-run inflation expectations will remain unchanged over the medium term, we expect core inflation to move up toward this underlying pace—the blue bars—as the contribution of slack—the red bars—and other influences gradually diminishes.	11	1
201406	2254	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	After the medium term, we project that, in order to bring inflation back to its 2 percent longer-run objective, you will need to push the unemployment rate below its natural rate for several years, thereby inducing longer-run inflation expectations to edge higher.	11	1
201406	2255	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Beth Anne will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201406	2256	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Not to diminish the excitement of this moment, but, as presented in the top lines in exhibit 5, the contour of our forecast for total foreign growth is almost completely unchanged from the April Tealbook.	11	1
201406	2257	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	After a relatively robust performance in the second half of last year, GDP growth turned sharply south, barely surpassing 2 percent in the first quarter.	11	1
201406	2258	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As panel 2 shows, this decline was concentrated in the emerging market economies (EMEs).	11	1
201406	2259	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	We continue to view the first-quarter drop as a pothole rather than a slippery slope and now have some evidence to back that up.	11	1
201406	2260	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As seen in the black line of panel 3, after falling precipitously in the first quarter, EME exports bounced back in April, led by China and in line with a pickup in US imports.	11	1
201406	2261	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Another source of first-quarter weakness was the high-tech sector, and recent indicators, including high-tech export orders for Taiwan (the green line), also point to recovery.	11	1
201406	2262	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In China, supportive macroeconomic policies as well as trade seem to be lifting growth this quarter, as evidenced by a turnaround in industrial production (panel 4).	11	1
201406	2263	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	We have Chinese growth (line 3 of the table) climbing further in the second half and moderating thereafter.	11	1
201406	2264	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Our baseline assumes that Chinese authorities are able to suppress financial excesses while maintaining growth near 7 percent.	11	1
201406	2265	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	But this path is far from certain.	11	1
201406	2266	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Over the past few years, as the economy has decelerated, we have wrestled with where the new normal is for China, and the weak first-quarter figure may indicate a slower underlying pace of growth than we’ve assumed.	11	1
201406	2267	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In addition, we are carefully watching the property sector, in which a sharp deceleration in house prices (panel 5) and a falloff in sales (not shown) may presage a sustained downturn in housing investment or, worse, significant financial stress.	11	1
201406	2268	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Latin America continues to disappoint.	11	1
201406	2269	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In Mexico (line 5 of the table), any nascent benefits of the government’s well-intentioned long-term structural reforms have been overshadowed by near-term tax hikes and a collapse in construction.	11	1
201406	2270	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	We assume the Mexican malaise began to lift this quarter.	11	1
201406	2271	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Indeed, consumer confidence (the red line in panel 6) has snapped back, and a surprise interest rate cut by the Bank of Mexico last week should provide support.	11	1
201406	2272	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In contrast, in Brazil, it’s still more stumble than samba.	11	1
201406	2273	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Years of overregulation, underinvestment, and inefficient government spending have left the country in desperate need of structural and fiscal reform.	11	1
201406	2274	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Consumer confidence (the orange line in panel 6) plunges on, and inflation (not shown) remains stubbornly high.	11	1
201406	2275	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	We have penciled in a modest pickup (line 6 of the table), but Brazil will need to play a beautiful game in many arenas to avoid further disappointment.	11	1
201406	2276	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Finally, as we pass the first anniversary of the “taper tantrum,” it bears noting that financial conditions (panel 7) have improved for most EMEs since the turn of the year, with credit spreads falling, capital inflows returning, and currencies (not shown) strengthening.	11	1
201406	2277	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	This is positive for EME growth, but we can’t always count on investors’ reach for yield overcoming their fear of vulnerabilities.	11	1
201406	2278	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Bouts of renewed financial stress down the road, perhaps as advanced economies normalize monetary policy, would not be surprising.	11	1
201406	2279	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	I would add that besides emerging market stresses, another risk to the outlook is the deepening conflict in Iraq.	11	1
201406	2280	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Although oil prices are up only $3 per barrel since last week, they could go much higher if the conflict is not contained.	11	1
201406	2281	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Turning to exhibit 6 and the outlook for the advanced foreign economies (AFEs), we have aggregate growth (line 1) holding at a steady and above-potential pace of 2¼ percent.	11	1
201406	2282	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	The path looks unexciting, but it may require some pretty bold monetary policies in Japan and the euro area to achieve.	11	1
201406	2283	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In Japan, central bank holdings (shown in panel 2) now amount to 50 percent of GDP and are expected to rise to nearly 75 percent by the end of 2015.	11	1
201406	2284	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As seen in line 2 of the table, smoothing through the wiggles caused by tax hikes this year and next, we expect this monetary support to help sustain Japanese growth at near 1 percent.	11	1
201406	2285	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Accommodative monetary policy is also the talk of the euro area.	11	1
201406	2286	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As Lorie discussed, the ECB took a number of steps this month to bolster recovery.	11	1
201406	2287	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	These moves were motivated by conditions that still look shaky.	11	1
201406	2288	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In particular, first-quarter GDP growth (line 3 of the table) was below 1 percent, and, as panel 3 illustrates, a number of countries posted negative growth.	11	1
201406	2289	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Moreover, bank lending (shown in panel 4) has yet to perk up.	11	1
201406	2290	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	While the unemployment rate for Germany (the blue line in panel 5) has reached historic lows, unemployment rates elsewhere remain supremely and stubbornly elevated.	11	1
201406	2291	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Divergent unemployment rates have not resulted in divergent inflation rates (shown in panel 6).	11	1
201406	2292	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Inflation for Germany has been falling alongside that of the other countries, not only contributing to overall euro-area disinflation, but also limiting the ability of the peripheral economies to gain competitiveness.	11	1
201406	2293	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Accordingly, we forecast only a gradual firming in output and a rise in inflation to 1½ percent by the end of 2016—a forecast that has been revised up just a touch on the latest ECB announcements.	11	1
201406	2294	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As shown in panel 1 of exhibit 7, we expect policy rates in both Japan and the euro area to remain near zero throughout the forecast period, whereas policy normalization is expected to start in the United Kingdom and Canada over the next year or so.	11	1
201406	2295	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Even for the United Kingdom and Canada, we expect that policy rates at the end of 2016 will be well below pre-crisis levels, despite the expectation that inflation (shown in panel 2) will be near target and output gaps (panel 3) closed.	11	1
201406	2296	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Over the next two and a half years, we still see a number of headwinds to AFE growth that depress equilibrium interest rates and help motivate relatively accommodative monetary policy.	11	1
201406	2297	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	First, as seen in panel 4, in most AFEs, fiscal policy will continue to hinder growth.	11	1
201406	2298	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Second, there remains some need for further post-crisis financial healing.	11	1
201406	2299	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In particular, corporate spreads (panel 5) are still elevated, as are household debt levels (panel 6).	11	1
201406	2300	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Finally, for most AFEs, investment (panel 7) plunged in the wake of the financial crisis and, as measured relative to pre- crisis peaks, continues to be depressed.	11	1
201406	2301	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Moreover, as discussed in your next exhibit and earlier by Lorie, markets appear to be betting that, after these headwinds fade, very low interest rates will persist.	11	1
201406	2302	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Since January, 10-year yields (panel 1) have declined across the advanced economies, driven by expectations of lower rates in the longer run—shown by the 1-year forward rates 9 years ahead in panel 2.	11	1
201406	2303	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As outlined in the bullets in panel 3, against the backdrop of rising concerns over “secular stagnation,” market participants and policymakers have speculated that the fall in long-term rates may reflect, among many factors, a reassessment of long-run potential growth in these economies and, consequently, a decline in the equilibrium interest rate that prevails in the long run.	11	1
201406	2304	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	As was raised in the Tealbook box “Changes to the Longer-Run Outlook in the United States,” we see US potential growth (the red line in panel 4) averaging 2 percent over the next decade or so, down from 3 percent between 1997 and 2005.	11	1
201406	2305	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	The staff estimates that this decline in potential growth will, all else being equal, engender a decline in the value of the real equilibrium interest rate compared with pre-crisis levels.	11	1
201406	2306	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	However, as also raised in the Tealbook box, two international factors mitigate the size of the downward revision to rates.	11	1
201406	2307	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	First, in an open economy setting, equilibrium interest rates in the United States may be affected not just by domestic potential output growth, but also by equilibrium interest rates and potential growth in the rest of the world.	11	1
201406	2308	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In contrast to the United States, total foreign potential growth (the black line in panel 4) is projected to be higher in the coming decade than in pre- crisis years, a factor that could support foreign and US interest rates in the period ahead.	11	1
201406	2309	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Interestingly, this shift up in growth occurs despite the fact that, over the next decade, potential growth in the AFEs (the blue line in panel 5) remains below its pre- crisis pace and EME potential growth is expected to steadily decline.	11	1
201406	2310	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Offsetting these declines, however, as seen in panel 6, is the fact that the share of world GDP represented by the EMEs is rising over time, increasing the weight of these faster- growing economies in total foreign potential growth.	11	1
201406	2311	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	The second factor mitigating a decline in the US equilibrium interest rate is discussed in the bullets of your last exhibit.	11	1
201406	2312	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	Before the global financial crisis, especially in the mid-2000s, countries with large current account surpluses (panel 2) were exporting their savings to advanced economies, particularly the United States, which ran current account deficits.	11	1
201406	2313	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	These flows from the “savings glut countries”—	11	1
201406	2314	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	China, Japan, other emerging Asian economies, and the oil exporters—put downward pressure on US interest rates.	11	1
201406	2315	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	For the period ahead, we anticipate that the negative pressure on US interest rates from these economies will ease from its peak immediately prior to the global financial crisis.	11	1
201406	2316	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	For starters, our projection of declining oil prices (shown in panel 3) implies that the current account surpluses of the oil exporters are likely to narrow.	11	1
201406	2317	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In addition, we anticipate that the Asian economies will rebalance some toward domestic demand, leading to an appreciation of their exchange rates (as indicated by the projected fall in the dollar against the EME currencies, the green line in panel 4) and a diminution of their current account surpluses.	11	1
201406	2318	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	An alternative simulation in the Tealbook explores the implications for US output and policy rates should EMEs promote greater rebalancing away from export- led growth.	11	1
201406	2319	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	In particular, in this scenario EME growth is assumed to be 2 percentage points higher than baseline in the next two years, driven by stronger domestic demand and with the authorities allowing their currencies to rise in response.	11	1
201406	2320	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	The higher growth and more appreciated currencies of the EMEs reduce the US net export deficit as a share of GDP (panel 5) and boost US GDP (not shown).	11	1
201406	2321	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	This leads to a federal funds rate path (the red line in panel 6) that rises more rapidly after liftoff and remains more elevated even after US GDP has returned to baseline, as higher net exports are offset by lower US domestic demand.	11	1
201406	2322	2014-06-18	meeting	WILSON	These results, although illustrative, do suggest that actions by the emerging market economies to achieve stronger and more balanced growth would raise US output and interest rates.	11	1
201406	2323	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201406	2324	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Exhibit 1 shows the broad trajectories of your forecasts for key economic variables under the assumption of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201406	2325	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The top panel shows a modest slowdown in real GDP growth this year followed by a notable pickup in 2015.	11	1
201406	2326	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Subsequently, in 2016, real GDP growth begins to move back toward its longer-run rate.	11	1
201406	2327	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Your projections for the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, decline gradually over the forecast period and, by the fourth quarter of 2016, reach levels that most of you view as broadly in line with your individual judgments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	11	1
201406	2328	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The bottom two panels show inflation gradually rising over the next few years, although almost all of you see it remaining at or below the Committee’s 2 percent objective throughout the period.	11	1
201406	2329	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the March Summary of Economic Projections and the March Tealbook.	11	1
201406	2330	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the top panel, you revised down your forecasts for real GDP growth in 2014 but left forecasts for the remainder of the projection period largely unchanged.	11	1
201406	2331	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The downward revision to GDP growth in 2014 is the result of your incorporating the unexpectedly weak first quarter that was viewed as likely to be transitory.	11	1
201406	2332	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Indeed, all of you continue to anticipate that real GDP will increase at a rate of 3 percent or better in the second half of this year.	11	1
201406	2333	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the second panel, nearly all of you made a modest downward revision to your projected path for the unemployment rate this year and next, noting the greater-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate in recent months.	11	1
201406	2334	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Moving to the bottom two panels, a number of you marked up a bit your total PCE inflation forecasts for 2014, but the central tendencies over the projection period are similar to those in March.	11	1
201406	2335	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The Tealbook forecast for economic growth is slightly above the upper end of your central tendencies for 2014 and 2016, but at or slightly below the lower end of your central tendencies for 2015 and in the longer run.	11	1
201406	2336	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The Tealbook projections for the unemployment rate and for inflation are at or slightly below the lower end of your central tendencies throughout the projection period.	11	1
201406	2337	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for the target federal funds rate.	11	1
201406	2338	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the top panel, most of you continue to think that it will be appropriate to begin raising the federal funds rate in 2015.	11	1
201406	2339	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The middle panel of the exhibit provides your current assessments of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201406	2340	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Although your expectations about the year in which it will be appropriate for the federal funds rate to leave the effective lower bound are little changed, a few of you marked up your target funds rates over the projection period, while a couple marked them down:  The median funds rate projection now stands at 1.13 percent in 2015 and 2.50 percent in 2016, compared with 1 percent and 2.25 percent, respectively, in your March projections.	11	1
201406	2341	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The mean projections also rose, albeit by less, from 1.11 percent to 1.18 percent in 2015 and from 2.42 percent to 2.53 percent in 2016.	11	1
201406	2342	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The distribution of projections for the funds rate at the end of 2016 widened out a bit, with the range now from 0.5 to 4.25 percent.	11	1
201406	2343	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	A substantial majority of you judged that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2016 will still be at least 100 basis points below your assessment of its longer-run normal level.	11	1
201406	2344	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	For some of you, the low level of the federal funds rate at that time was associated with an assessment that inflation would remain well below your 2 percent objective at the end of 2016.	11	1
201406	2345	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	In contrast, another five of you saw the funds rate at the end of 2016 as still significantly below despite your forecasts that the unemployment rate would be within 0.2 percentage point of your projections for its long-run normal level and that inflation would be at or above 1.8 percent at that time.	11	1
201406	2346	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	These participants cited a combination of a lower equilibrium real rate, continuing headwinds from the financial crisis and recession, and a desire to raise the federal funds rate at a gradual pace after liftoff as explanations for the still-low level of the projected federal funds rate at the end of 2016.	11	1
201406	2347	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	A couple of you also mentioned measures of labor market slack that may take longer to return to their normal levels than the unemployment rate.	11	1
201406	2348	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Compared with March, six projections now show lower values for the longer-run federal funds rate, with a lower potential growth rate cited as the contributing factor for half of those revisions.	11	1
201406	2349	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As a result, the median longer- run rate shifted down to 3.75 percent from 4 percent in March.	11	1
201406	2350	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	With regard to securities purchases, most of you indicated that your assessment of appropriate policy was in line with the assumption in the Tealbook baseline forecast, which has purchases continuing to slow in measured steps and concluding before the end of this year.	11	1
201406	2351	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Two of you thought it appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases more rapidly and end the purchase program somewhat sooner than assumed in the Tealbook.	11	1
201406	2352	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Exhibit 4 depicts the economic conditions that you anticipate at the end of the year in which you judge that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate above its effective lower bound.	11	1
201406	2353	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Because liftoff likely won’t occur at year-end, the chart shown is only illustrative of the market conditions around the time of liftoff.	11	1
201406	2354	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Your projections for the unemployment rate at the end of the year of liftoff range from about 5 to 5¾ percent, with a median near 5½ percent, while your inflation projections are clustered between 1½ and 2 percent, with a median of about 1¾ percent.	11	1
201406	2355	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	For the 12 participants who view it as appropriate to first raise the target for the federal funds rate in 2015 (shown by the white diamonds), all project that the unemployment rate at the end of the year will be below 6 percent, and all but 1 judge that inflation will be at or below the Committee’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.	11	1
201406	2356	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	The final exhibit reviews your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201406	2357	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the figures to the left, most of you judge the current level of uncertainty about real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation to be broadly similar to the average level of the past 20 years.	11	1
201406	2358	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the top two panels in the column on the right, as in March, most of you judge the risks to real GDP growth and unemployment to be broadly balanced, but four of you now see the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside, two more than in March.	11	1
201406	2359	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	As shown in the bottom two panels in the right-hand column, the majority of you continue to see the risks to inflation as balanced.	11	1
201406	2360	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Those of you who saw risks to growth or inflation as weighted to the downside noted concerns about the limited ability of monetary policy at the zero lower bound to respond to negative shocks to the economy as well as external economic and geopolitical risks.	11	1
201406	2361	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	Thank you.	11	1
201406	2362	2014-06-18	meeting	WEI	That concludes the staff presentations.	11	1
201406	2363	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	11	1
201406	2364	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for the staff?	12	1
201406	2365	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12	1
201406	2366	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201406	2367	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I have a question for Jeremy Rudd, and it’s about your underlying inflation forecast.	12	1
201406	2368	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	First, I really appreciate Deb Lindner’s memo—and not just because we were classmates at Wisconsin.	12	1
201406	2369	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s why we had her write the memo.	12	1
201406	2370	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	That may work.	12	1
201406	2371	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	12	1
201406	2372	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It showed a lot about the ingredients of your thinking, and that’s really beneficial to us.	12	1
201406	2373	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You have an exhibit 4, and, in panel 5, you’ve got your estimates of underlying inflation.	12	1
201406	2374	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In her memo, it’s page 7—there’s a figure 4 that shows, I think, some of the same things.	12	1
201406	2375	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You’ve got these statistical models of stochastic trends.	12	1
201406	2376	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You’ve got the Stock-Watson unobserved components−stochastic volatility model, the Cogley- Sargent model, and this time-varying parameter−stochastic volatility VAR.	12	1
201406	2377	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In figure 4, it’s pretty clear that those estimates jump off from the fourth quarter of 2013.	12	1
201406	2378	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They’re estimated on data through the fourth quarter of 2013, and they take off from there.	12	1
201406	2379	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Some are just straight lines from there, and some gradually go up a little.	12	1
201406	2380	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Now, that’s the natural property of these things because, just as a matter of arithmetic, if you’re forecasting the future and you’ve got this unobserved trend, the last data observation is the most important one.	12	1
201406	2381	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It’s at least as important as any other, and, in most cases, it’s more important than any other single observation.	12	1
201406	2382	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So there’s an intuitive reason why the most recent data are more informative.	12	1
201406	2383	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But I noticed that your forecast for core inflation for the second quarter of this year is higher.	12	1
201406	2384	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think that in the Tealbook, it was 1.8 percent.	12	1
201406	2385	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But did you say that you’re now thinking 1.9 percent, having seen the CPI data?	12	1
201406	2386	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For Q2 or Q3?	12	1
201406	2387	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For Q2, it’s 1.9 percent for core PCE.	12	1
201406	2388	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	All right—1.9 percent for Q2.	12	1
201406	2389	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Now, I realize that your underlying inflation is a judgmental assessment.	12	1
201406	2390	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I respect that.	12	1
201406	2391	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	You described it as informed by these statistical trend estimation mechanisms.	12	1
201406	2392	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But if that forecast for Q2 comes true and you re- estimated those trends using data through Q2, wouldn’t they jump off from Q2’s core inflation rate of 1.9 percent?	12	1
201406	2393	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They might trend down a little, but wouldn’t they all be higher than the estimates that you show in Deb Lindner’s memo?	12	1
201406	2394	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In figure 4 in her memo, showing forecasts, although the forecasts are jumping off of the current inflation rate, some of the trends are going to be less susceptible to influence by the last observation.	12	1
201406	2395	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So in some sense, I think what you’re alluding to is that when you’ve got one-sided estimates at the end of your sample, you worry that those observations are more influential.	12	1
201406	2396	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I think that in most of these cases, the trends probably wouldn’t change all that much, and what will happen is that the inflation forecast will still converge to some of these trends from a different jumping-off point.	12	1
201406	2397	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	You can see it in the sense that, in Deb’s figure 4, we’re below the trends and we’re converging up to the trends.	12	1
201406	2398	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s not that the trend has been pulled down unduly.	12	1
201406	2399	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Rather, it’s that we’re converging up to these trends from a lower level.	12	1
201406	2400	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	And if we started from a higher level, we’d probably converge from a little bit higher.	12	1
201406	2401	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In particular, the time-varying parameter−stochastic-volatility VAR is going to be least susceptible.	12	1
201406	2402	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That trend looks extremely flat over the period that we think expectations were anchored—over the past 15 or so years.	12	1
201406	2403	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Is that in figure 4?	12	1
201406	2404	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	No, that’s not, because it’s hard to do forecasts off of that model.	12	1
201406	2405	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s a complicated model to run.	12	1
201406	2406	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So for a whole host of reasons, we didn’t do it.	12	1
201406	2407	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	But the trend estimates in panel 5 of the briefing, which was actually taken from the memo, are different from the forecasts that are shown in figure 4.	12	1
201406	2408	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The last point I’d make is that the two Phillips curve models that we show here aren’t going to change much at all.	12	1
201406	2409	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Those are keyed off of survey measures of expectations, which haven’t changed.	12	1
201406	2410	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We basically forecast those as a random walk process.	12	1
201406	2411	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So the survey measures are constant at their current level, which has been pretty much the same for a fairly long time— plus or minus one-tenth for the Michigan measure.	12	1
201406	2412	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Those estimates aren’t really going to change, given the current observation, and we’d probably get a pretty similar forecast a few years out—that is, what we got from 2013:Q4.	12	1
201406	2413	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Well, let me just make sure I understand.	12	1
201406	2414	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	These statistical models, holding aside the Phillips curve models, would all go up, right?	12	1
201406	2415	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Models 3 through 5, say, in the panel.	12	1
201406	2416	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If you re-estimated them through Q2, all of the estimates would go up.	12	1
201406	2417	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Well, the trend estimates may or may not change very much.	12	1
201406	2418	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t ask how much.	12	1
201406	2419	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I asked whether they’d go up.	12	1
201406	2420	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	None of them would go down.	12	1
201406	2421	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They’d all go up, right?	12	1
201406	2422	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The time-varying parameter−stochastic-volatility VAR might not change much at all.	12	1
201406	2423	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The Stock-Watson model is very close to an accelerationist model but with a very long lag right now, so that might actually pick up a tiny bit.	12	1
201406	2424	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	For the Cogley-Sargent model, I don’t know, because that model allows for possibly sluggish deviations from its trend, and it could interpret a surprise as being a relatively transitory movement away from the trend.	12	1
201406	2425	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The trend itself might be better anchored than in, say, the Stock-Watson model.	12	1
201406	2426	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So I think, in order of precedence, Stock-Watson is going to react the most, and the time-varying parameter/stochastic-volatility VAR is probably going to react the least.	12	1
201406	2427	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The Stock-Watson model’s trend looks like a random walk.	12	1
201406	2428	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The forecast is right where it is now.	12	1
201406	2429	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The forecast is basically a random walk.	12	1
201406	2430	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12	1
201406	2431	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So it would go up the whole way, right?	12	1
201406	2432	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It would go up to 1.9 percent or close to it.	12	1
201406	2433	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	No, if the trend doesn’t change, what will happen is, it will reverse a lot of the current shock in the next quarter and then keep going at the trend.	12	1
201406	2434	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The idea is that the Stock-Watson model sees most shocks nowadays to inflation as basically transitory shocks that are reversed very quickly, and so it would probably pass through some of that and reverse some of the shock pretty quickly.	12	1
201406	2435	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The trend itself is not necessarily going to move very much.	12	1
201406	2436	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s more like a very long moving average.	12	1
201406	2437	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The current data will only have a tiny influence.	12	1
201406	2438	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	No, I understand.	12	1
201406	2439	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I understand.	12	1
201406	2440	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So the question is your underlying inflation in the memo sounded like it was based on this stuff, and I’m wondering—you were sort of silent on whether your forecast for second-quarter inflation, which takes on board some high- frequency observations that aren’t a part of the analysis in Deb’s memo, incorporates that or not.	12	1
201406	2441	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If Q2 comes true, will you revise up your underlying inflation forecast?	12	1
201406	2442	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Probably not, because we think that, ultimately, what drives that object is inflation expectations, and we don’t have evidence that longer-run inflation expectations have moved.	12	1
201406	2443	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We think that changes in underlying inflation as we’ve defined it are basically driven by changes in longer-term inflation expectations.	12	1
201406	2444	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	And those, we think, are still pretty anchored.	12	1
201406	2445	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So in our staff forecast, we would probably keep our 1¾ percent assumption and then see what the dynamics of the model implied for our response to the Q2 data.	12	1
201406	2446	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	12	1
201406	2447	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	I would interject only the rather obvious observation that, relative to the estimates that are provided by our suite of models, we put our judgmental assumption pretty close to the upper end of the envelope of those estimates.	12	1
201406	2448	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	So I think if those estimates moved up, we wouldn’t feel much compulsion to adjust up our judgmental assumption.	12	1
201406	2449	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Let me reiterate as well that figure 4 in the memo is not the trends.	12	1
201406	2450	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s the forecasts that are generated by models that have these underlying trends.	12	1
201406	2451	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12	1
201406	2452	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201406	2453	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, just to follow up on this, though, one thing about inflation expectations is, you’re using survey measures.	12	1
201406	2454	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Why not use TIPS-based measures?	12	1
201406	2455	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’d prefer five-year TIPS.	12	1
201406	2456	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think we can control inflation over a period of five years.	12	1
201406	2457	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In the memo, there was a discussion about that, and, in the previous memo that we sent to the Committee in January about the staff’s inflation framework, we talked about that as well.	12	1
201406	2458	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	More broadly, some of the forecasts that you get of inflation from financial-market- based measures—I think Deb cites one in her note—also imply that inflation is not coming back.	12	1
201406	2459	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But they shift around more than—especially the Michigan survey, which has been misforecasting inflation for more than two decades.	12	1
201406	2460	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I think the problem we have with the financial-market-based measures is that, first of all, they don’t extend through long samples.	12	1
201406	2461	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	So it’s hard to build a model around them.	12	1
201406	2462	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	And, second, weird things can happen in Treasury markets that make those estimates move in ways that we probably wouldn’t attribute to inflation expectations.	12	1
201406	2463	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	When people actually back out inflation expectations from those measures, they often do so with reference to things like the Blue Chip or the SPF or some other measure of inflation expectations to tie down the component of movements in the financial-market-based measures that they think is really and truly reflecting inflation expectations as opposed to other things.	12	1
201406	2464	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I’d prefer you switch.	12	1
201406	2465	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The Michigan measure has been off for decades.	12	1
201406	2466	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The model does pretty well, though—the model based on the Michigan survey has actually done pretty well at forecasting inflation.	12	1
201406	2467	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	President Bullard, it’s true that the level of inflation expectations has been off.	12	1
201406	2468	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	If you forgive a constant, that survey measure, the median expectation of longer-term inflation expectations, actually does quite well.	12	1
201406	2469	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I didn’t get that out of the memo.	12	1
201406	2470	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t have the memo in front of me.	12	1
201406	2471	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s actually the adjustment that’s being made to get the point estimate that’s backed out of the models.	12	1
201406	2472	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The same is true for the SPF.	12	1
201406	2473	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	One of the points that Deb makes in the memo is that the SPF, to the extent that it did well over recent history—the last decade or so—it was lucky.	12	1
201406	2474	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It was because, basically, they didn’t see the oil price shock coming.	12	1
201406	2475	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201406	2476	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Here’s TIPS from your memo—2.5 percent over the period up to 2004:Q1.	12	1
201406	2477	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Actual headline CPI was 2.5 percent.	12	1
201406	2478	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In 2009:Q1, TIPS said 2.7 percent.	12	1
201406	2479	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Actual headline was 2.6 percent.	12	1
201406	2480	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So it was right on the button both times.	12	1
201406	2481	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It did get it wrong for 2014:Q1, but that includes the period of the crisis.	12	1
201406	2482	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Headline CPI came in at 2.1 percent.	12	1
201406	2483	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	TIPS said 2.7 percent.	12	1
201406	2484	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It’s been superaccurate.	12	1
201406	2485	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It’s CPI based.	12	1
201406	2486	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So you’d have to adjust to get to PCE.	12	1
201406	2487	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I have another question on this.	12	1
201406	2488	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	On the decomposition of core PCE inflation, what always gets me—and we’ve talked about this picture before—is the huge fraction of the forecast that’s coming from this underlying inflation measure is really practically the entire picture here.	12	1
201406	2489	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So how should I interpret that?	12	1
201406	2490	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If inflation comes in at 1.9 percent and we’ve got underlying inflation at 1.75 percent, then should I say that we’ve got above-normal or above-trend inflation, or am I supposed to compare it with 2 percent, which is the Committee’s official target?	12	1
201406	2491	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In our judgment, you should be comparing it with 1.75 percent.	12	1
201406	2492	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We think 1¾ percent is the underlying rate of inflation, and that this is a relatively well-anchored level around which other influences like slack or supply shocks can—	12	1
201406	2493	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201406	2494	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So 2 percent is above.	12	1
201406	2495	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m interpreting this to be, 1.75 percent is the new 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2496	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Well, as we pointed out in the Tealbook extension, if you want to get to 2 percent, you’ll have to do something.	12	1
201406	2497	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Right now, we think that if you want to get inflation to 2 percent, you’re going to have to push the unemployment rate below the natural rate for an extended period and prove to people that you’re serious about 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2498	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Well, are you saying that the credibility of the Committee is eroding, and that, therefore, the world now expects only 1¾ percent from the Committee?	12	1
201406	2499	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s not clear they ever expected 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2500	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s not clear they really even know what the PCE is, for one thing.	12	1
201406	2501	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	[Laughter]	12	1
201406	2502	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I suppose a lot of things aren’t clear, but you do have inflation expectations here and, for instance, the SPF is right at 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2503	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Well, but the SPF is saying 2 percent over the next 10 years.	12	1
201406	2504	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	If you back out what the SPF is saying for the 5-year-forward period—in other words, 5 years down the line, what it says about the next 5 years—it’s above 2 percent, and it has been ever since the 10-year average has been 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2505	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s never been 2 percent for 5 years, 5 years forward, which suggests to me that you have to be a little careful about interpreting even the SPF’s 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2506	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201406	2507	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But I’d be willing to interpret that over a 5-year period.	12	1
201406	2508	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think we can control inflation over a 5-year period.	12	1
201406	2509	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If the market doesn’t expect 2 percent, then maybe we’re not doing our job.	12	1
201406	2510	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, I think that’s a version of what we’re saying:  The proposition underlying this memo is that it could perfectly well be the case that inflation expectations are anchored.	12	1
201406	2511	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	It doesn’t need to be the case that they’re anchored at 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2512	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	And, as best we can tell, the burden of evidence leans slightly toward inflation expectations being anchored at a modestly lower rate of inflation.	12	1
201406	2513	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the statement that’s being made.	12	1
201406	2514	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	David, where were inflation expectations before 2008?	12	1
201406	2515	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Inflation expectations have basically been pretty stable since the late 1990s.	12	1
201406	2516	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	There’s only one small hint that things were coming a bit unglued around 2008 in the Michigan survey, when, at the apotheosis of the run-up in oil prices and other commodity prices right before the crash, there was a hint of evidence that maybe long-run expectations were starting to react slightly.	12	1
201406	2517	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I should point out that these are longer-term expectations.	12	1
201406	2518	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Short-term expectations from the Michigan survey go all over the place.	12	1
201406	2519	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	When there was the economic collapse, nothing happened to expected inflation at the beginning of 2009?	12	1
201406	2520	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	Not to speak of.	12	1
201406	2521	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s the remarkable thing.	12	1
201406	2522	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	One of the things that led us to conclude— and I was a very grudging convert to this view—that inflation expectations were extremely well anchored was that, in the face of the 2007 to 2009 recession—one of the deepest recessions we’d ever seen, with massive swings in commodity prices and a big increase in unemployment that we think was cyclical—longer-term inflation expectations didn’t budge.	12	1
201406	2523	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	There’s almost no movement in the survey measures that we look at.	12	1
201406	2524	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12	1
201406	2525	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Again, the survey-based measures don’t change.	12	1
201406	2526	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If you look at the TIPS-based measures, they were very tight before the crisis—2-year; 5-year; 5-year, 5-year forward; and 10-year.	12	1
201406	2527	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	They’re all very tight around 2 percent or maybe even a little higher.	12	1
201406	2528	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	They blew out during the crisis.	12	1
201406	2529	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	People didn’t know what to think.	12	1
201406	2530	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	They did come back together after the crisis, but there was a lot of variance—a lot more than there was before the crisis—and that’s never really gone away completely.	12	1
201406	2531	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	So I would say the character of inflation expectations was damaged somewhat during the crisis, although, generally speaking, it was pretty stable.	12	1
201406	2532	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I’d have to worry about things that happened in financial markets in that period, too, though.	12	1
201406	2533	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Only during the period of the crisis itself, but then you’re talking about a couple of years afterward when—	12	1
201406	2534	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Well, we had the European crisis leading to flight-to-safety flows and things that were affecting Treasury markets in ways that, again, make me worried about using these TIPS-based measures.	12	1
201406	2535	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	These are normal shocks—	12	1
201406	2536	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The inflation compensation measures have been remarkably stable for the past year or so.	12	1
201406	2537	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The last time they moved a lot was probably September 2012, in reaction to things that we did.	12	1
201406	2538	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	And we’re definitely not arguing about that.	12	1
201406	2539	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	As David said, we still think inflation expectations are anchored.	12	1
201406	2540	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s a fundamental cornerstone of our forecast.	12	1
201406	2541	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	The question is, what are they anchored to?	12	1
201406	2542	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s where it gets a lot harder for us to back out something specific.	12	1
201406	2543	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a fundamental issue, because what you’re really saying is that, to get inflation to 2 percent, you’ve got to shift longer-term expectations somehow.	12	1
201406	2544	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	And I don’t think the Committee is even thinking about that.	12	1
201406	2545	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The discussions I’ve heard, anyway, have not really talked in those terms since September 2012, when we undertook QE3.	12	1
201406	2546	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	I’m not convinced that there’s a real issue here, but, to have recourse to facts, I direct you to page 26 in the data sheets in the back of the Tealbook volume, which shows both inflation compensation from TIPS, down in the lower panel, and the survey-based measures, in the upper-left panel.	12	1
201406	2547	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	What is shown there is that the 5- to 10-year-ahead inflation compensation measure has been running consistently above 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2548	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	That’s for CPI.	12	1
201406	2549	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	And, consistent with Jeremy’s description, the median 5- to 10-year Michigan survey, in the upper-left panel, has just been remarkably flat, I would say, since the late 1990s.	12	1
201406	2550	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair?	12	1
201406	2551	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Inflation itself has averaged closer to 2 percent than 1¾ percent over the past 20 years, as I recall.	12	1
201406	2552	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Is that your understanding of the PCE?	12	1
201406	2553	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Headline inflation.	12	1
201406	2554	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	An average of 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2555	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	We’ve got all of these expectations measures, which you say indicate strong anchoring of inflation.	12	1
201406	2556	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Actual inflation has averaged 2 percent, and you think it’s anchored to 1¾ percent.	12	1
201406	2557	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Well, for two reasons.	12	1
201406	2558	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	One is, when we put those measures into our models of core inflation, we don’t find that they’re saying the underlying inflation rate is 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2559	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	One of the things Deb talked about at some length in the memo is that, if you think the SPF got it right, it looked as though the SPF was just wrong about the oil shocks.	12	1
201406	2560	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	They were behind the curve, as were futures markets, and so they didn’t really anticipate shocks that occurred that boosted actual inflation.	12	1
201406	2561	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	When we put these measures into our core inflation models—that’s what the first two models in panel 5 of exhibit 4 are doing—they spit out levels of inflation—underlying inflation, as we’ve called it—that are lower than 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2562	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	In other words, looking at the historical behavior of inflation, the historical behavior of supply shocks, the historical behavior of slack, and the historical behavior of these survey-based expectations measures, the survey-based measures have been consistent with inflation rates, in the absence of those other factors, that aren’t equal to 2 percent—even the SPF, whose reported level over the next 10 years is given as 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2563	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	You have to be careful, too, about evaluating that forecast.	12	1
201406	2564	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	That’s a 10-year-ahead forecast.	12	1
201406	2565	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We’re not really evaluating how well that did 10 years later.	12	1
201406	2566	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We’re just saying, over some longish average period, what happened, but we haven’t really done the exercise of saying we’ve looked to evaluate how well the SPF did 10 years ahead.	12	1
201406	2567	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	What we did do is to back out what they’re saying between years 5 and 10, and there you don’t get 2 percent, which I think is interesting.	12	1
201406	2568	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	This thing about the oil shock last decade has always confused me.	12	1
201406	2569	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Let’s say it’s unexpected, the SPF is consistent with 1.75 percent, and it’s just been chance that we’ve gotten 2 percent instead of 1.75 percent—it’s this extra factor, right?	12	1
201406	2570	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	1.75 percent for core.	12	1
201406	2571	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Right.	12	1
201406	2572	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s—	12	1
201406	2573	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Move on [Laughter]	12	1
201406	2574	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota, did you have a—	12	1
201406	2575	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a two-hander.	12	1
201406	2576	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to ask a quick question.	12	1
201406	2577	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a result of the Lindner memo, the staff has lowered its measure of underlying inflation from 1.9 percent to 1.75 percent.	12	1
201406	2578	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I haven’t been keeping track of where it was before it was 1.9 percent.	12	1
201406	2579	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If I go back, say, two years, what was the staff’s measure of underlying inflation?	12	1
201406	2580	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	We changed it around the time of the last big revision of the NIPA statistics because it looked as though average inflation over history, because of the new methodologies the BEA was using, was down one-tenth.	12	1
201406	2581	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I can’t remember the exact date though.	12	1
201406	2582	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201406	2583	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So it was at that time.	12	1
201406	2584	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It went from 2 percent down to 1.9 percent.	12	1
201406	2585	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	Then in January, I believe, when we sent the inflation memo forward to the FOMC, Mr Wilcox briefed, and I remember there was a kerfuffle about 1.9 percent.	12	1
201406	2586	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	12	1
201406	2587	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	12	1
201406	2588	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you very much.	12	1
201406	2589	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams, did you have a question?	12	1
201406	2590	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I did.	12	1
201406	2591	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, unbelievably, it’s on the same subject.	12	1
201406	2592	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12	1
201406	2593	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve actually thought about and discussed this at length, so I really do want to just very briefly comment on this and not on the issues that have already been mentioned.	12	1
201406	2594	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is a serious issue.	12	1
201406	2595	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Your forecast now tells us that we have to create a substantial and sustained overshoot of maximum employment to reach our 2 percent goal.	12	1
201406	2596	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is consequential.	12	1
201406	2597	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a bigger issue than just one-tenth in a forecast.	12	1
201406	2598	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you say it’s—let me just finish—in the actual anchoring of inflation, you’ve got to get that anchor back up.	12	1
201406	2599	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should think seriously about how we interpret this in terms of what it means for policy over the next few years.	12	1
201406	2600	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually thought Deb’s memo was really interesting.	12	1
201406	2601	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought it was a great box on a contrarian risk to the forecast.	12	1
201406	2602	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I wasn’t convinced at all by the analysis—the points have already been made.	12	1
201406	2603	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation over the past two years has been almost exactly 2.0 percent.	12	1
201406	2604	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	SPF is exactly at 2 percent for the 10-year ahead.	12	1
201406	2605	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you really get into thinking about what’s a good measure of underlying inflation, why not look at the Dallas Fed trimmed mean?	12	1
201406	2606	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s building up—I’ve been in the Fed a long time, and I’ve done these inflation models myself, and I know this is not the only way to think about this.	12	1
201406	2607	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you go from the top down, the FOMC has committed to a 2 percent inflation objective.	12	1
201406	2608	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not serendipity that we’ve gotten 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2609	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	You could think of this as our goal.	12	1
201406	2610	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The fact that inflation ex food and energy runs under 2 percent is a reflection that, given the relative price movements over the past 15 years, you had to have core be below 2 percent.	12	1
201406	2611	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I look at the Dallas Fed trimmed mean and some other measures of underlying inflation, and they’re not nearly that different.	12	1
201406	2612	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I guess my challenge to you is to maybe distance yourself a little bit from just building up core and then saying relative prices must be flat over the next 10 years.	12	1
201406	2613	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Think about this analysis from a different perspective.	12	1
201406	2614	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I thought the analysis was good and interesting.	12	1
201406	2615	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s important, and I’m not quibbling over the facts in the models.	12	1
201406	2616	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is consequential, and it’s worthy of further discussion and analysis—but not necessarily right now.	12	1
201406	2617	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12	1
201406	2618	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	We recognize that it’s consequential.	12	1
201406	2619	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	We discussed all of those factors that you raise.	12	1
201406	2620	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	I would be the first to acknowledge that the confidence intervals encompass a wide range of possibilities.	12	1
201406	2621	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	But, in the end, after having argued about this at great length ourselves as well, we came to the judgment that the weight of the evidence was a little more in favor of a resting point for inflation that was a bit south of 2.	12	1
201406	2622	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	I wouldn’t want to put up a harder front than that, but I felt that we owed it to you to reflect that judgment on our part.	12	1
201406	2623	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, the good news is, I finally heard Jeremy Rudd, after some 15 years, say that he has embraced the anchoring of inflation expectations.	12	1
201406	2624	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just not at 2.	12	1
201406	2625	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	12	1
201406	2626	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	President Williams, consider the following thought experiment.	12	1
201406	2627	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	As to the sanctity of 2 percent, if the Committee were, for whatever reason, to announce that your objective had been revised from 2 to 2½ percent, one could introspect about what the effects of that would be.	12	1
201406	2628	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	A consequence and implication, a corollary of the perspective that we’ve taken, is that you might not get all of the way from, say, 2 to 2½ just on the basis of words alone, and that you might need to back that up with some actual behavior.	12	1
201406	2629	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the basic proposition.	12	1
201406	2630	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	Now, if one takes the view that, through communication alone, you could get wage and price setters, who are actual flesh-and-blood people engaged in the acts of setting wages and prices, to conform their behavior to your announcement without running the economy a little hotter for a period of time, then you could take the view that 2 percent itself is a natural attractor.	12	1
201406	2631	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	That informs my judgment that it’s entirely plausible for inflation expectations right now to be anchored at something that’s just a little different from what the Committee has in mind as its objective.	12	1
201406	2632	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201406	2633	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We will probably continue to discuss this, I think it’s fair to say.	12	1
201406	2634	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our go-round?	13	1
201406	2635	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’re probably going to break around 6:00 for dinner, so if we could get through a reasonable amount of this, it would be good.	13	1
201406	2636	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201406	2637	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2638	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with the assumed strong second quarter, real GDP growth for the first half of this year has been quite disappointing.	13	1
201406	2639	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	My December submission expected growth for 2014 of 3.1 percent, and I now expect 2014 real GDP growth of only 2.1 percent.	13	1
201406	2640	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While some of this can be attributed to temporary factors, from bad weather to unusual trade and inventory patterns, I am concerned that the economy is proving to be weaker than I had previously expected.	13	1
201406	2641	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Several sectors of the economy explain my reduced optimism for this year.	13	1
201406	2642	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, over the past six months, I have lowered my forecast for residential investment and business fixed investment, even for the second half of this year.	13	1
201406	2643	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The scars from the recession appear to be causing more cautious behavior by both households and firms than I expected earlier, so I am now expecting less of a rebound in residential investment and business investment than we would normally forecast as the economy improves.	13	1
201406	2644	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I also remain concerned about slack in the labor market.	13	1
201406	2645	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I assume that some of the labor market slack reflected in the unusually wide spread been the U-6 and U-3 measures of unemployment implies that the U-3 unemployment rate will be less responsive than normal to the pickup in growth I anticipate for the remainder of this recovery.	13	1
201406	2646	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Specifically, I have in mind that, as we approach full employment, more of the workers marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons will return to the labor market as full-time employees.	13	1
201406	2647	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, I was a bit surprised that the unemployment rate remained at 6.3 percent in May and did not reverse some of the decline from the previous employment report.	13	1
201406	2648	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The labor force participation rate continues to be a bit of a puzzle.	13	1
201406	2649	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Throughout the recession and the early recovery, even the more pessimistic projections for labor force participation have missed on the upside.	13	1
201406	2650	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the staff, I have lowered my estimate of the steady-state labor force participation rate because of the continued one-sided misses, but I will need more evidence about the reason for this decline, particularly in the 25-to-34 age group, before I lower my steady-state estimate to reflect the more recent developments in participation.	13	1
201406	2651	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	My suspicion that some of the recent drop in the rate of labor force participation is overstated provides another reason why I do not expect to see the unemployment rate fall quite as quickly as we might otherwise have expected as real GDP grows faster than potential.	13	1
201406	2652	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given my forecast of slower 2014 growth and a less responsive unemployment rate, I now expect to reach my estimate of full employment of 5¼ percent in early 2017.	13	1
201406	2653	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the low inflation rate and my view that we should not be lifting off interest rates until full employment is clearly in our forecast horizon, I expect the liftoff to occur in early 2016.	13	1
201406	2654	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I end my comments with a little trepidation about discussing the Deb Lindner model.	13	1
201406	2655	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	One interpretation of her data analysis is that inflation expectations have gradually slipped down because of unemployment systematically being above our target, and inflation being well below our target, since the Great Recession began.	13	1
201406	2656	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, contrary to the concerns of some about unanchored expectations on the upside, our systematic and persistent inflation outcomes below our 2 percent target are in danger of unanchoring expectations on the downside.	13	1
201406	2657	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would occur at a time when Europe is increasingly concerned about deflation and Japan has been forced to take drastic actions to increase inflation expectations.	13	1
201406	2658	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should the results in this memo continue to be borne out by the data, the result is that we will need to overshoot full employment in order to bring long-run expectations back to target and then to drive realized inflation to our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201406	2659	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This has implications for the timing of our liftoff of short-term rates that we will be discussing tomorrow.	13	1
201406	2660	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2661	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2662	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	13	1
201406	2663	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2664	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As to the dots in the economic projections, I regret to inform you that I am in the central tendency for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and headline and core inflation in every year and in the long run.	13	1
201406	2665	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And I am not the dot that expects that the fed funds rate will be raised in 2014.	13	1
201406	2666	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I am fourth highest in 2015 and third highest in 2016.	13	1
201406	2667	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I do expect the federal funds rate to reach 4 percent in my lifetime, however, even though I’m older than Ben Bernanke.	13	1
201406	2668	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As for the Eleventh District—in response to Governor Fischer’s question during the break—one statistic says it all:  Payroll employment last month grew at 5.7 percent, led by energy, professional business services, and construction.	13	1
201406	2669	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Manufacturing in this quarter has grown faster than in the first quarter.	13	1
201406	2670	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Service-sector growth has picked up.	13	1
201406	2671	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Single-family and multifamily housing starts rose, as did existing home sales, in April.	13	1
201406	2672	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The inventory of unsold homes in the entire state of Texas is 3.6 months.	13	1
201406	2673	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	In Dallas, Houston, and Austin, it’s 2.6 months or less.	13	1
201406	2674	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Unemployment fell to 5.2 percent, its lowest level since September 2000.	13	1
201406	2675	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	When you look at our District economy, you have to separate out deep South Texas, which has dodgy data.	13	1
201406	2676	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	If you take that out of the unemployment statistic, we’re 5 percent for the state.	13	1
201406	2677	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Wage pressures are rising in every single sector.	13	1
201406	2678	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We actually took a special survey in May, asking about this and employment conditions.	13	1
201406	2679	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Seventy percent of the respondents reported problems finding qualified workers, citing a lack of hard and soft skills as well as an insufficient number of applicants.	13	1
201406	2680	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Ninety-eight percent of hospitals so reported, as did 90 percent of car dealers; 80 percent of hotels, restaurants, and bars; 80 percent of those needing administrative and supportive services; and 60 percent of food manufacturers.	13	1
201406	2681	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	These shortages are drawing large numbers of immigrants.	13	1
201406	2682	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As I reported at the last meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the number of employable people in Texas— that is, the denominator to our unemployment statistic—has grown 10.3 percent since 2008, whereas for the nation ex Texas, it’s grown 0.3 percent.	13	1
201406	2683	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Still, the state’s unemployment rate is approaching 5 percent.	13	1
201406	2684	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Nationally, I don’t find much change among my interlocutors.	13	1
201406	2685	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	For the purposes of Governor Fischer and Governor Brainard, I do take my own survey of roughly 50 CEOs and private.	13	1
201406	2686	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I also watch carefully the data that we collect at the Dallas Fed.	13	1
201406	2687	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Generally, my interlocutors are optimistic about the condition of the United States despite uniform concern about what they call counterleadership from the Congress of the United States and from the executive.	13	1
201406	2688	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The rails are back to 2006 levels.	13	1
201406	2689	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Advanced bookings for the airlines are up 7 percent.	13	1
201406	2690	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	And, in most of the large businesses at least, the emphasis remains on financial engineering while preparing what I have referred to before in these meetings as their growth muscle—that is, rebuilding the managerial capacity for top-line growth someday rather than managing to cost and expense containment and margin enhancement.	13	1
201406	2691	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The reach of technology continues to amaze me.	13	1
201406	2692	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’ll give you the most extreme example that I just came across, which is a metal-bending firm in Florida with $200 million a year in revenue created by three employees.	13	1
201406	2693	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	This is a firm that makes garden furniture out of steel and metal products.	13	1
201406	2694	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	There is one $300,000 engineer that comes in and programs the robot in the morning, and then there are two sweepers who sweep up the shavings at the end of the day.	13	1
201406	2695	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	They’re paid $10 an hour.	13	1
201406	2696	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I asked the operator of the facility—that is, the manager in charge of it—what would happen if those $10-an-hour workers increase their wage to $12 an hour, and the response was, “We will replace them with robots at $12 an hour.”	13	1
201406	2697	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	This is very worrisome to me, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2698	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We have hollowed out the middle-income quartiles in our country, and I don’t believe that monetary policy is effective in addressing that issue.	13	1
201406	2699	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Nonetheless, my interlocutors confirm what we see in the data.	13	1
201406	2700	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	That is, payroll data continue at a steady pace.	13	1
201406	2701	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Nonfarm payrolls grew 282,000 in April and 217,000 in May, which is the average for the year.	13	1
201406	2702	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	If that pace continues, payroll gains will be 2.56 million, which will make for the best year for payroll gains since 1999.	13	1
201406	2703	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	My interlocutors report greater incidence of capable workers leaving for other jobs, greater turnover in keeping with the recent quit-ratio reports.	13	1
201406	2704	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Just last week, as far as large companies are concerned, the Business Roundtable met, and 80 percent of their members expect top-line growth over the next six months, 44 percent expect to increase cap-ex, and 43 percent expect to increase their hiring.	13	1
201406	2705	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	So there is positive momentum in the economy.	13	1
201406	2706	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Regarding small businesses, as you know and as I reported at previous meetings, I like to look at the telephonic companies, in particular, in terms of their activity with small businesses and what they’re providing.	13	1
201406	2707	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	For five months in a row, they’ve had upticks, and you’re seeing this confirmed by the surveys of small businesses.	13	1
201406	2708	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As far as negative factors are concerned, first, even before the election in Virginia, all the defense and other large lobbying firms—one of my favorites to talk to is Anheuser-Busch InBev because no congressperson will resist a beer vendor—were predicting that the Ryan–Murray budget agreement was evaporating, and all expressed fears, even before the Cantor election, that sequestration would kick back in.	13	1
201406	2709	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	That is worrisome because, thus far, we have not been experiencing much fiscal drag since that agreement was reached.	13	1
201406	2710	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Second, almost everybody I talked to is negative on China.	13	1
201406	2711	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	For example, J.C.	13	1
201406	2712	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Penney used to derive 80 percent of their production from China.	13	1
201406	2713	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Now it’s 18 percent.	13	1
201406	2714	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	They’ve priced themselves out of the market.	13	1
201406	2715	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Looking ahead, the balance of risks, if anything favors an acceleration in GDP—and, again, respectful disagreement to my colleague from Boston, with whom I recently agreed on almost everything, much to his embarrassment.	13	1
201406	2716	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I think that’s important because, however disappointing and uneven output growth may have been over the course of the recovery and recently, the unemployment rate has so far declined with remarkable consistency, falling by just shy of 1 percentage point per year.	13	1
201406	2717	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With real growth prospects improving, the probability is high that, one year from now, the unemployment rate will be within the central tendency of SEP natural rate estimates.	13	1
201406	2718	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	On the inflation front, research that suggests that the unemployment rate has lost its usefulness as an indicator of near-term wage and price pressures is not compelling to me.	13	1
201406	2719	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The modest increase that we’ve seen in wage inflation so far in this recovery is completely consistent with past experience.	13	1
201406	2720	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We can expect significantly faster wage increases as the unemployment rate moves down.	13	1
201406	2721	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Again, we’re seeing a little microcosm of that in my District.	13	1
201406	2722	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The trimmed mean PCE inflation measure, which President Williams kindly referred to, captures medium-term headline inflation trends, I believe, better than the conventional PCE inflation measure and responds to changes in unemployment as well as to the level of unemployment.	13	1
201406	2723	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thanks partly to this effect, my inflation projection rises to 2 percent in 2016 and, particularly if we adopt the suggestion in Deb’s memo—I’ll come to this in just a minute— to above 2 percent thereafter.	13	1
201406	2724	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Now, I’m convinced that, in the near term, inflation responds to changes in slack as well as the level of slack.	13	1
201406	2725	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	For these reasons, I see inflation rising further over time and more quickly than does the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	2726	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	At the same time, I believe that increases in the unemployment rate are very difficult to contain once they begin.	13	1
201406	2727	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It’s proven nearly impossible historically for policymakers to nudge the unemployment rate upward to restrain inflation.	13	1
201406	2728	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	An implication is that the risks to mis-estimating slack are asymmetric, and it’s substantially more dangerous, in our view at the Dallas Fed, to overestimate slack than to underestimate it.	13	1
201406	2729	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I think—and I may be wrong here—the models used by the Board staff do not appear to recognize the nonlinearity in the economy’s dynamics.	13	1
201406	2730	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I go back to the work by Neftçi in 1984.	13	1
201406	2731	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It almost seems as though every five years after that, more work was done on this issue.	13	1
201406	2732	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Basically, he shows that the unemployment rate tends to drift downward gradually but to increase rapidly.	13	1
201406	2733	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I conclude that one does not want to overshoot the full-employment unemployment rate willy-nilly, because after crossing that threshold it becomes nearly impossible to tap on the brakes without engineering a recession.	13	1
201406	2734	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Again, I thought Deb’s memo was excellent.	13	1
201406	2735	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Woody Allen used to say that the most felicitous words in the English language were not “I love you” but, instead, “It is benign.”	13	1
201406	2736	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But in the monetary lexicon, the most dangerous words I’ve read recently, David, were at the end of your memo, which says that, “in order for the Committee to achieve its 2 percent objective, a period of some overshooting of full resource utilization may be required.”	13	1
201406	2737	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	To me, Madam Chair, that evokes Arthur Burns.	13	1
201406	2738	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But I admit, having served in the Carter Administration, that I bear deep scars, and I may be too sensitive to that matter.	13	1
201406	2739	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2740	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, President Fisher.	13	1
201406	2741	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	13	1
201406	2742	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2743	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to grow at or slightly above its longer-term trend, and many business contacts remain optimistic.	13	1
201406	2744	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Bank lending has shown improvement, particularly C&I loans.	13	1
201406	2745	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Auto sales for the month of May were termed “phenomenal” by one of our contacts.	13	1
201406	2746	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	With the exception of the three MSAs in southern New Jersey, all of our MSAs report unemployment rates below 6 percent.	13	1
201406	2747	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	In Philadelphia’s Business Outlook Survey, indexes of general activity, new orders, and shipments all remain solidly in positive territory.	13	1
201406	2748	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The latest survey, which is to be released this Thursday and remains confidential until then, shows that the general activity index improved in June to 17.8 from a reading of 15.4 in May.	13	1
201406	2749	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The index has remained positive for four consecutive months following the winter freeze in February.	13	1
201406	2750	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Further, the future activity index— that is, the expected activity index for six months ahead—rose sharply by 14.6 points and now stands at 52.	13	1
201406	2751	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Historically, this future index actually has predictive content for the current index six months ahead, and so it’s a very positive reading.	13	1
201406	2752	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	In addition, regional manufacturers reported a sharp increase in prices paid but a slight decline in prices received.	13	1
201406	2753	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The prices paid index was 35 in June, up from 23 in May, and expectations for future price increases, both paid and received, in the second half of the year rose and are at elevated levels.	13	1
201406	2754	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The employment index in the BOS improved again in June, and the future measure increased as well.	13	1
201406	2755	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Also, the workweek increased, as did the future workweek.	13	1
201406	2756	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As in the nation as a whole, we are seeing growth in the construction of multifamily housing units, but single-family housing remains soft.	13	1
201406	2757	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Permits for single-family homes declined for the third straight month in April.	13	1
201406	2758	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, the weakness in single-family construction in the region may be related to more than just the severe weather.	13	1
201406	2759	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Factors such as the suitability of building lots or an overhang of student loans may be partially responsible.	13	1
201406	2760	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it may also reflect the changing trend in housing preferences.	13	1
201406	2761	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Young people may be driving housing toward multi-unit rentals and condos near urban centers, forgoing the house in the suburbs and the associated long commutes.	13	1
201406	2762	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Realtors in my District confirm this trend.	13	1
201406	2763	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	This may be related to the trend to have children later, maybe the desire to bike to work, and so forth.	13	1
201406	2764	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The demographic reality of a growing number of retiring baby boomers who are empty nesters seeking to downsize and move into smaller urban units may also be contributing to this trend.	13	1
201406	2765	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thus, too much focus and consternation over single-family housing and those construction numbers may be somewhat misplaced given the possibility of the changing dynamics of the housing market.	13	1
201406	2766	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	On the nonresidential side, activity remains somewhat weak.	13	1
201406	2767	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Our contacts appear to be optimistic, and, in the Philadelphia region, as I’ve reported before, there are several very large projects about to break ground in Center City.	13	1
201406	2768	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Overall economic activity reflects steady, if unremarkable, growth in the District, and my contacts are optimistic about a continuing pickup in activity in the coming months.	13	1
201406	2769	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	My medium-term outlook for the national economy remains fairly upbeat.	13	1
201406	2770	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The incoming data appear consistent with my outlook that growth will be about 3 percent, which is a bit above trend, over the remainder of this year and next before returning to its steady state of about 2.4 percent in 2016.	13	1
201406	2771	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Labor markets continue to improve steadily.	13	1
201406	2772	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Payrolls rose 217,000 in May, and this is the fourth consecutive month that payroll growth has been above 200,000.	13	1
201406	2773	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The unemployment rate remained steady at 6.3 percent in May.	13	1
201406	2774	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The continued low labor force participation rate has been a contributing factor.	13	1
201406	2775	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The declining participation rate over recent years appears to be mostly due to demographic factors as well as an increase in retirements, disability claims, and other such things.	13	1
201406	2776	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	These factors suggest that there will not be a strong bounceback in the participation rate.	13	1
201406	2777	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I expect the unemployment rate to continue its decline and fall below 6 percent to about 5.8 percent by the end of this year and to 5.6 percent by the end of 2015 through 2016—5.6 percent is roughly my guess of the steady-state natural rate.	13	1
201406	2778	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I would add that other aspects of the labor market are also improving.	13	1
201406	2779	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Long-term unemployment is falling.	13	1
201406	2780	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The U-6 unemployment rate is falling.	13	1
201406	2781	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Wage growth has firmed a bit, and new claims for unemployment insurance are at pre-recession levels.	13	1
201406	2782	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Inflation appears to be moving up, with the three-month core PCE increasing 1.8 percent.	13	1
201406	2783	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s a bit early to tell whether this will be sustained and continue for the rest of the year, but it’s still trending upward at this point toward the Committee’s target.	13	1
201406	2784	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Anecdotal evidence and information I’ve received from our business contacts, including the BOS, seem to indicate that inflation is firming and no longer weakening.	13	1
201406	2785	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	All told, I see inflation moving back to target, perhaps a bit faster than I did in my previous forecasts and considerably faster than in the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	2786	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	In my view, economic performance and the outlook indicate that it’s appropriate not only to continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases, with the program ending this fall, but also to begin contemplating ending the reinvestment of our principal payments—at least some portion of it—and to start the process of normalizing the balance sheet.	13	1
201406	2787	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I expect we will need to begin raising the funds rate sooner than is implied by our previous statement language and perhaps as early as the fourth quarter of this year.	13	1
201406	2788	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, I say that because my path for appropriate policy, as I fill out the SEP, is informed by the rules described in the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	2789	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, if you look at the rules described in the Tealbook B, and drop the highest one and the lowest one, the rate implied by these rules suggests a fed funds rate of about 1 percent by the end of this year.	13	1
201406	2790	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Let me hastily add:  Don’t confuse this 1 percent with my forecast of what this Committee is likely to do.	13	1
201406	2791	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As, I think, President Kocherlakota informed us—maybe it was the last time or the time before that—don’t confuse my forecast with reality.	13	1
201406	2792	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2793	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	On the other hand, this is an exercise, as we all recall, about what each of us thinks appropriate policy is, and, again, my appropriate policy is informed by the rules that we look at.	13	1
201406	2794	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy is showing good signs of resilience.	13	1
201406	2795	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Solid employment gains, coupled with reduced drag from fiscal policy and household deleveraging, make it conceivable that growth could come in stronger than we are currently forecasting, and rates may have to rise faster than our current assessment.	13	1
201406	2796	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Should we choose to ignore this ongoing progress toward our goals and continue our policy of keeping the real funds rate in negative territory as we approach these goals, I believe we will run real risks of having to raise rates much faster in the future than we are likely to prefer.	13	1
201406	2797	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	This could result in a very disruptive exit or, perhaps, a much higher rate of inflation.	13	1
201406	2798	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It would return us and this Committee to the old “go–stop” policies of the past that we know can result in instability and unnecessary and inefficient volatility.	13	1
201406	2799	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2800	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2801	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201406	2802	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2803	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a modest pace.	13	1
201406	2804	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Business contacts continue to suggest that underlying demand remains reasonably strong, and that the outlook for the second half of 2014 is for relatively good performance.	13	1
201406	2805	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The District continues to add jobs but at a somewhat slower pace than in the nation as a whole.	13	1
201406	2806	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The District unemployment rate measured across metropolitan statistical areas stands at 6.8 percent on the most recent reading, somewhat elevated when compared with the nation as a whole.	13	1
201406	2807	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, the rate has been falling, and business contacts expect further labor market improvement in the months ahead.	13	1
201406	2808	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	During the intermeeting period, I’ve been concerned about the first-quarter reading on US GDP growth, which was initially weaker than expected and has since been revised down substantially.	13	1
201406	2809	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think I share this concern with President Rosengren, who noted it in his comments earlier.	13	1
201406	2810	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I asked my staff how often we see quarters of negative GDP growth in the middle of an expansion, and the answer I got was, very rarely in the post-1984 experience.	13	1
201406	2811	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This made me worry that this Committee, as well as nearly all financial market participants, might be overemphasizing the special factors/inventory/weather narrative concerning Q1 GDP growth.	13	1
201406	2812	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I asked my business contacts specifically whether they saw marked improvement in the current quarter and whether they expected improved business conditions in the second half of this year.	13	1
201406	2813	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The response was quite clear that business leaders saw the first quarter as an aberration and had plans and expectations for relatively strong economic performance through the rest of the year.	13	1
201406	2814	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In this respect, I agree.	13	1
201406	2815	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I guess I got the same reading as President Fisher did from his contacts.	13	1
201406	2816	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe I called all of the same people.	13	1
201406	2817	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2818	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	There’s no control for that around here.	13	1
201406	2819	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, in my forecast, I have penciled in a relatively rapid real GDP growth of over 3 percent for the current quarter, during the second half of 2014, and through 2015.	13	1
201406	2820	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In tandem with this outlook, I expect unemployment to continue to decline, averaging 5.8 percent by the fourth quarter of this year.	13	1
201406	2821	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I tried to get to the lowest number on the Committee, but I see that Charlie Plosser tied me on this dimension.	13	1
201406	2822	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I interpret the continuing declines in unemployment as indicative of a clearly improving labor market.	13	1
201406	2823	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My reading of the literature on labor force participation leads me to view the participation rate as on a long-term, demographically driven decline since 2000 that will likely leave the rate below 60 percent a decade from now.	13	1
201406	2824	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I see it as unlikely that this secular decline will be interrupted in a lasting way in the medium term.	13	1
201406	2825	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I continue to forecast relatively rapid declines in the unemployment rate, and I continue to interpret those declines as indicating improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201406	2826	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	This interpretation of unemployment declines is consistent with the payroll jobs numbers, which have averaged better than 200,000 per month since the Committee began the open-ended asset purchase program in September 2012, more than 18 months ago.	13	1
201406	2827	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Similarly, hours worked year to date in 2014 are up about Furthermore, I see an end-of-year unemployment level around 5.8 percent as actually below the medium-term natural level of unemployment, which I have at 6 percent.	13	1
201406	2828	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My view on this issue is that the US labor market was likely badly damaged during the past five years and, furthermore, has well-known and lasting structural problems, suggesting that the natural level of unemployment is higher today than it has been in recent decades.	13	1
201406	2829	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, my forecast this round calls for inflation to continue to rise through 2014 and to exceed the inflation target of 2 percent by the end of 2015.	13	1
201406	2830	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Specifically, both core and headline inflation are forecast to be 2.4 percent by the end of 2015 on a year-over-year basis.	13	1
201406	2831	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	You heard it here first, as I told you last time.	13	1
201406	2832	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I believe that I am in a small minority among SEP participants in making this forecast—possibly a minority of one.	13	1
201406	2833	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But the empirical models we use to generate baseline forecasts consistently predict oscillatory rather than monotonic convergence of inflation to the inflation target from current levels, given the current level of the policy rate.	13	1
201406	2834	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We have simply taken this empirical summary of historical experience at face value and incorporated it into our near-term forecast of inflation with only modest judgmental adjustment.	13	1
201406	2835	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Globally, I see continuing stabilization and modest growth in the euro area as helpful to US macroeconomic performance.	13	1
201406	2836	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation is disturbingly low in the euro area, and inflation expectations by some metrics have begun to sink well below the ECB’s stated inflation target.	13	1
201406	2837	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Market-based measures of German inflation expectations, for instance, suggest that markets view German inflation of less than 1 percent as a likely outcome over the next five years.	13	1
201406	2838	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that the ECB should be able to hit its inflation target of 2 percent over a period as long as five years, and I have at times advocated that Europe should be more open to undertaking a quantitative easing program similar to ours in an attempt to move inflation back toward target.	13	1
201406	2839	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I attended the recent ECB conference in Sintra, Portugal, during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201406	2840	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Be careful, Kansas City—they are gunning for us.	13	1
201406	2841	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	They’re trying to create a conference equivalent to or better than Jackson Hole.	13	1
201406	2842	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	At the Sintra conference, the discussion of unconventional monetary policy was paramount.	13	1
201406	2843	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The Governing Council stopped short of full- blown QE a few days later, but my interpretation is that the ECB’s willingness to contemplate aggressive, unconventional monetary policy has been the key factor driving the global bond rally during the first half of 2014.	13	1
201406	2844	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	All else being equal, this rally should help US macroeconomic prospects, and I fed that into the optimistic cyclical dynamics I described earlier.	13	1
201406	2845	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If the economy continues to move in the direction I’m describing during 2014, the Committee may have to rethink its baseline scenarios for policy tightening.	13	1
201406	2846	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	However, I would be reluctant at this point to advocate a rethink until we receive hard evidence that the scenario I’m describing is actually playing out.	13	1
201406	2847	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, I would feel more confident that economic developments are proceeding along this line once we have the Q2 GDP report and the associated jobs numbers fully in the bag.	13	1
201406	2848	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2849	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2850	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201406	2851	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2852	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Anecdotal reports in the Fifth Federal Reserve District are very similar to what we heard prior to the last meeting.	13	1
201406	2853	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	They indicate continued moderate growth overall, but with significant variations across the region.	13	1
201406	2854	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	One director observed that the conditions seem to depend on whether you are above or below what people call the “sweet tea” line.	13	1
201406	2855	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	This is an imaginary boundary that runs east to west through southern Virginia, somewhat south of Richmond and north of the North Carolina border.	13	1
201406	2856	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	If you order iced tea and you aren’t asked what kind you’d like, above the line, the default is unsweetened tea, and, below the line, the default is sweetened.	13	1
201406	2857	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2858	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, if you’re asking about economic conditions above the sweet-tea line, reports tend to be quite discouraging, while prospects are much brighter below the line.	13	1
201406	2859	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	However, I’m not sure this says anything about the causal effects of drinking sweet tea.	13	1
201406	2860	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Weakness north of the sweet-tea line seems to reflect the fallout of declining federal spending on the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area and the Hampton Roads metropolitan area, and the depressed coal market in West Virginia.	13	1
201406	2861	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The Carolinas, though, are seeing a pickup in loan growth and investment.	13	1
201406	2862	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	A banker in South Carolina, for example, says they’ve seen increased business optimism this year and organic loan growth reflecting expansion-related investments.	13	1
201406	2863	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In North Carolina, bankers said that credit quality is getting better and better.	13	1
201406	2864	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national outlook, some changes in the Tealbook brought the staff’s forecast closer to my own projection.	13	1
201406	2865	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The estimate of the long-run growth rate of real GDP has been lowered ¼ percentage point, the forecast for growth in residential investment this year has been reduced 3½ percentage points, and the forecast for this year’s growth in nonresidential structures has been cut 3¼ percentage points.	13	1
201406	2866	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	My own projection has not materially changed since our March submission, aside from lowering GDP growth and raising inflation in the first half as a result of the significant new data we’ve received since then.	13	1
201406	2867	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	There were times over the intermeeting period when I was tempted to make a meaningful upward revision to my projection for consumer spending, which would have pushed my GDP projection higher.	13	1
201406	2868	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The temptation was based on the fact that consumption came in pretty strong for the fourth quarter.	13	1
201406	2869	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It seemed on track for similar gains earlier this year despite the weather.	13	1
201406	2870	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	But recent reports on health-care expenditures and retail sales paint a different picture, making the strength in fourth-quarter consumption growth look more temporary than permanent.	13	1
201406	2871	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t see household spending picking up much momentum in the second half of this year.	13	1
201406	2872	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m also less optimistic than the Tealbook about the outlook for residential investment.	13	1
201406	2873	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Five years on from the recession, that experience seems to have left a large segment of the population much less inclined to make major housing investments than in previous expansions.	13	1
201406	2874	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Like President Plosser, I view this as less a cyclical phenomenon than a fairly fundamental structural shift in the housing market.	13	1
201406	2875	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	People are bound to place greater weight now on the possibility of large declines in home values and in their ability to repay.	13	1
201406	2876	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	On top of that, tightening credit availability reduces financing opportunities and provides another good reason for caution in household financial planning.	13	1
201406	2877	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	In addition, there remains a substantial overhang of homes associated with foreclosures or seriously delinquent mortgages.	13	1
201406	2878	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	So my sense is that the sluggishness in single-family starts will be fairly persistent, and that a burst of residential investment—like that in the Tealbook, albeit delayed—is relatively unlikely.	13	1
201406	2879	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	The other difference I’d highlight concerns inflation.	13	1
201406	2880	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I really appreciated, as I said, the latest memo providing details of the staff’s thinking on inflation forecasts, but I’m not completely convinced that it will take so long for inflation to get to 2 percent.	13	1
201406	2881	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	President Williams raised some excellent points about interpreting relative price changes and the approach of relying so heavily on core for underlying inflation trends.	13	1
201406	2882	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think the firmer inflation readings we’ve seen of late raise for me the serious likelihood that inflation has bottomed out in this current little dip we’ve seen, and that we’re going to see reasonable progress toward our 2 percent target this year.	13	1
201406	2883	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	And, while the staff rightly argues against putting excessive weight on the most recent observations, surely the optimal weight is greater than zero.	13	1
201406	2884	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2885	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2886	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201406	2887	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2888	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll start with feedback from Sixth District contacts.	13	1
201406	2889	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We call them “inter-Lockhart-ors.”	13	1
201406	2890	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2891	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In general, business activity appears to have strengthened after the first quarter, and sentiment remains positive.	13	1
201406	2892	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Consumer spending continues to rise.	13	1
201406	2893	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Spending on autos and the associated production activity of plants in the Southeast are particularly robust.	13	1
201406	2894	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	A director on the manufacturing side believes auto assembly plants are operating at or near capacity.	13	1
201406	2895	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Most of our banker contacts say that loan demand is improving.	13	1
201406	2896	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Pipelines are pretty strong.	13	1
201406	2897	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	But demand varies considerably by loan category and geography.	13	1
201406	2898	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Commercial lending is picking up across the District.	13	1
201406	2899	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Line utilization is rising, but mortgage refinance is low, and purchase mortgage application activity is mixed.	13	1
201406	2900	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The relative weakness of the housing sector is getting a lot of attention, so we focused some effort on that sector with District contacts.	13	1
201406	2901	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The sales activity picture is mixed across the Sixth District, with Miami, for example, enjoying a boom driven by foreign investors; with southern Louisiana also being very active, underpinned by energy-sector employment; and with home sales and construction in an otherwise solidly performing Tennessee being characterized as soft.	13	1
201406	2902	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard many explanations for the softening real estate sales, but no common theme emerged.	13	1
201406	2903	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	High student debt burdens of young people and a bifurcated employment market recovery are thought to be weighing on household formation and first-time buyer demand.	13	1
201406	2904	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Constrained access to financing for lot development and rising construction costs were cited as restraints on residential construction.	13	1
201406	2905	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the sector bears close monitoring.	13	1
201406	2906	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Neither our contacts nor our sector specialists in the Atlanta Fed put forth a firm opinion on whether the softness is temporary or likely persistent.	13	1
201406	2907	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Now let me comment on my outlook and how it compares with the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	2908	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	It appears quite likely that the final reading on first-quarter GDP growth will show a large negative number.	13	1
201406	2909	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	This pushed me in the recent forecast submission to lower once again my 2014 growth estimate.	13	1
201406	2910	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If the first quarter comes in as the current tracking estimates indicate, I don’t expect that the economy will post much more than a 2 percent increase for the year.	13	1
201406	2911	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll insert the good news here.	13	1
201406	2912	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	My very public, at least in this body, over–under bet made last summer with David Wilcox on the growth rate of the next year and a half is really looking good.	13	1
201406	2913	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I took the “under” on 3 percent.	13	1
201406	2914	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I have not yet pre-spent my winnings, but I may spend the dollar soon to help the economy just a little.	13	1
201406	2915	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	You have a dollar in escrow, President Lockhart.	13	1
201406	2916	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2917	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Like so many others, I’m viewing the first quarter as a transitory event heavily influenced by weather.	13	1
201406	2918	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m focused more on the run rate evidenced in this and subsequent quarters than on the full-year 2014 arithmetic.	13	1
201406	2919	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I continue to believe that the current run rate is a bit above 3 percent.	13	1
201406	2920	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In that view, my forecast aligns with the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	2921	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Our soundings in the District this cycle yielded a couple of points that are supporting evidence.	13	1
201406	2922	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We surveyed a panel of 562 small businesses on their credit conditions.	13	1
201406	2923	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The survey showed notable improvement compared with recent earlier surveys in the proportion of firms reporting that they’re receiving all or most of the financing they have requested.	13	1
201406	2924	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Large corporate contacts hinted at a thawing of their attitude toward capital investment or expansion.	13	1
201406	2925	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t want to make too much of these indicators, but they’re consistent with what I interpret to be, on net, a positive stream of data suggesting a run rate of 3 percent or better.	13	1
201406	2926	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The question of the amount of remaining labor market slack will be central, obviously, to our policy deliberations in coming meetings as we think about the timing of liftoff.	13	1
201406	2927	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	My team in Atlanta is increasingly concentrating our attention on the PTER group.	13	1
201406	2928	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We’re coming to the view that the improving but still-elevated level of involuntary part-time employment is very important to the question of how much slack remains and helps explain the weakness of wage pressures.	13	1
201406	2929	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Evidence of wage growth and, more generally, continuing firming of prices, with measures approaching our 2 percent target, will be pivotal in my thinking about when to start tightening.	13	1
201406	2930	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Next I’ll comment on the risk to my outlook.	13	1
201406	2931	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m treating the risks to all of the elements in the SEP submission as basically in balance.	13	1
201406	2932	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The five alternative scenarios in the Tealbook are a good representation of the range of possibilities.	13	1
201406	2933	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I took special note of the Tealbook’s downward adjustment to potential and the staff’s inclusion of the “No Room to Grow” scenario.	13	1
201406	2934	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	At the moment, I’m agnostic on the debate around potential, but I think evidence provided by wage and price data will be telling in solving the puzzle.	13	1
201406	2935	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, I’d like to draw the attention of Nellie, Andreas, and the Committee to one particular financial-stability risk in the very near term that should literally be on our screens.	13	1
201406	2936	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In June 1974, 40 years ago, the Bundesbank allowed Bankhaus Herstatt to fail.	13	1
201406	2937	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On their last day of operation, the bank’s Frankfurt office did not complete clearing payment instructions because, according to lore, the staff left early to watch a World Cup match.	13	1
201406	2938	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	2939	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The world financial system almost cratered, but West Germany did win the World Cup.	13	1
201406	2940	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2941	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2942	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201406	2943	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2944	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	The basic contours of my outlook have not changed much since April.	13	1
201406	2945	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Like almost everyone else, we expect a bounce back in the second quarter, followed by growth somewhat above 3 percent in the second half.	13	1
201406	2946	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	This trajectory seems consistent with the reports from my directors and other business interlocutors.	13	1
201406	2947	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Basically, the reports continue to be positive, though not bubbling over with enthusiasm.	13	1
201406	2948	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In general, businesses are expecting healthy gains in sales and production over the remainder of the year.	13	1
201406	2949	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	According to some, these higher sales should spill over into some higher investment as well.	13	1
201406	2950	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	For example, at a recent manufacturing roundtable in Chicago, there was increased talk of stronger capital expansion plans.	13	1
201406	2951	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Roundtable participants primarily represent small and medium-sized manufacturers.	13	1
201406	2952	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Most of the firms planning to build additional capacity had close ties to the auto industry or energy-related infrastructure.	13	1
201406	2953	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Our private equity and insurance contacts also were relatively optimistic about the prospects for the nonfinancial companies and their portfolios.	13	1
201406	2954	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Notably, one mentioned that they are starting to see earnings coming from growth in top-line revenues as opposed to aggressive cost cutting.	13	1
201406	2955	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Although my contacts generally were optimistic, no one was expecting a breakout in activity as we move through the year.	13	1
201406	2956	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, for me, it continues to be much easier to list downside risks to the outlook than to list upside propellants.	13	1
201406	2957	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	For example, the likely large downward revision to first-quarter consumer spending based on the quarterly census service- sector data and the ho-hum retail sales report for May suggest that the momentum in household spending may not be quite as strong as we’ve assumed.	13	1
201406	2958	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Downside risks to housing remain, particularly as credit conditions still appear to be restrictive.	13	1
201406	2959	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And the global economy continues to face strong challenges, so there’s also reason to be cautious about international growth.	13	1
201406	2960	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, I expect growth over the next 18 months to be around a 3 percent pace.	13	1
201406	2961	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Turning to inflation, recent data have moved year-over-year rates off their lows.	13	1
201406	2962	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	This is a welcome development, but, even with today’s CPI data, I don’t see it as a sure sign that inflation is headed back to target at a reasonable pace.	13	1
201406	2963	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	First, I haven’t increased my 2014 inflation projection since the March SEP.	13	1
201406	2964	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I had 1½ percent then, and I still do.	13	1
201406	2965	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	The only difference is that in March, it was mostly a hope that we would get there.	13	1
201406	2966	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Now it’s in one month’s data.	13	1
201406	2967	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	This is a good development but not a reason to raise my forecast.	13	1
201406	2968	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Second, all of our analytics in Chicago continue to point to below-target inflation over the medium term.	13	1
201406	2969	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Our affine term structure model with inflation factors continues to see three- year-ahead inflation expectations below 2 percent this year and over the next four years—that is, through 2018, three years ahead.	13	1
201406	2970	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We’ve done a lot of work over the past year on our Chicago Fed DSGE model.	13	1
201406	2971	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	It now has more robust and reasonable inflation dynamics, and these result in an inflation projection that remains below 2 percent for the next several years.	13	1
201406	2972	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	My business contacts also show little worry about inflation.	13	1
201406	2973	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	They consistently note a lack of cost pressures either from wages or from materials or other inputs.	13	1
201406	2974	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the weak wage growth we continue to see certainly is an important sign of low inflationary pressures.	13	1
201406	2975	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Third, there is the notable Deb Lindner Board memo on the role of inflation expectations in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201406	2976	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That analysis suggests inflation will likely stabilize below our 2 percent target unless something else happens.	13	1
201406	2977	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Now, I have to take note of the fact that at some point in the discussion about this, someone said, “But inflation has been 2 percent for a number of years.”	13	1
201406	2978	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That led me to look up the Tealbook data on that.	13	1
201406	2979	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	If you look at total PCE inflation, in 2008, it was 1.5 percent.	13	1
201406	2980	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In 2009, it was 1.2 percent.	13	1
201406	2981	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In 2010, it was 1.3 percent.	13	1
201406	2982	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	It was 2.6 percent in 2011, but then it was 1.7 percent in 2012, and, in 2013, it was 1.0 percent.	13	1
201406	2983	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Inflation has been low.	13	1
201406	2984	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	So, what could that something else be that gets us back to target?	13	1
201406	2985	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	It could be some lucky break, or it could be something within our control, such as strong communications that the FOMC intends to get inflation back up to target quickly and is willing to overshoot in order to achieve our stated dual-mandate goals within a reasonable period of time.	13	1
201406	2986	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Personally, I’d rather bank on that than on luck.	13	1
201406	2987	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	In sum, my thinking about the macroeconomic backdrop for our policy decision tomorrow is about the same as it was in April.	13	1
201406	2988	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We appear to be seeing a welcome and long- overdue pickup in growth to a more solid pace, but this growth needs the continued support of highly accommodative policy in order to be sustained.	13	1
201406	2989	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	And, while the recent inflation news has been in the right direction, it still appears that we’re making only slow progress back toward our inflation target.	13	1
201406	2990	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	2991	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	2992	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander from Governor Fischer.	13	1
201406	2993	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	What is the inflation rate, sir, that your people expect to be 2 percent?	13	1
201406	2994	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Is that PCE, or is that CPI?	13	1
201406	2995	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Our target is for 2 percent.	13	1
201406	2996	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	The one that was alluded to before was total PCE.	13	1
201406	2997	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But in your models?	13	1
201406	2998	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Oh, in our models.	13	1
201406	2999	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Yes, we do have the PCE target.	13	1
201406	3000	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Well, we have both.	13	1
201406	3001	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We have the CPI target and PCE, and we try to take account of the wedge between them.	13	1
201406	3002	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	13	1
201406	3003	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The average gap is ¼ percent?	13	1
201406	3004	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	I think it’s wider.	13	1
201406	3005	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It’s more like 35 basis points.	13	1
201406	3006	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Yes, 35 basis points was quoted to me the last time I asked that a couple of meetings ago.	13	1
201406	3007	2014-06-18	meeting	RUDD	It sounds right to me.	13	1
201406	3008	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	13	1
201406	3009	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I defer to the inflation experts.	13	1
201406	3010	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Without having tried this out even on my close family, I would guess that if you asked people what the inflation rate is, it isn’t the PCE—I’m saying that, if we were to ask the average American, “Do you think inflation will be 2 percent?” the person would say, “Yes.”	13	1
201406	3011	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And if we asked, “Do you think inflation means the PCE?” the person would say, “The what?”	13	1
201406	3012	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Well, the CPI is closer to 2½ percent.	13	1
201406	3013	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	They’re going to get it wrong.	13	1
201406	3014	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That means that we have a big job in front of us.	13	1
201406	3015	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	13	1
201406	3016	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I don’t know what 2 percent—anyway, we’ll come back to this.	13	1
201406	3017	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I think the Fed is using a rate that people don’t relate to.	13	1
201406	3018	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with that.	13	1
201406	3019	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Are we likely to change that?	13	1
201406	3020	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We’ve ratified our longer-run policy strategy statement for monetary policy the past several years, and that’s what the number is.	13	1
201406	3021	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed.	13	1
201406	3022	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Stan, there actually is a trimmed-mean PCE.	13	1
201406	3023	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	It’s a common family.	13	1
201406	3024	2014-06-18	meeting		[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3025	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Yes, that’s what they say in Texas.	13	1
201406	3026	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201406	3027	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201406	3028	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3029	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to spend my time talking about two related topics.	13	1
201406	3030	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first is the memo on inflation by Deb Lindner, which I thought was excellent and was very informative.	13	1
201406	3031	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second topic is a couple of lessons from Japan based on conversations that my policy adviser, Kei-Mu Yi, and I had with BOJ monetary policy committee members in the intermeeting period.	13	1
201406	3032	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought the Lindner memo was important in two key respects.	13	1
201406	3033	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first has to do with how it feeds into the staff outlook for inflation.	13	1
201406	3034	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff outlook, under their best estimate for the Committee’s monetary policy reaction function, is now that inflation will return to 2 percent sometime in the early part of the next decade.	13	1
201406	3035	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, this forecast is not intrinsically inconsistent with our current longer-run goals statement.	13	1
201406	3036	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That statement makes no reference to any kind of time horizons.	13	1
201406	3037	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a result, in principle, inflation could run persistently above or below 2 percent for 5, 10, or 20 years without violating our longer-run goals statement.	13	1
201406	3038	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will make a remark on something that President Fisher alluded to.	13	1
201406	3039	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He expressed discomfort with the idea of exceeding maximum employment and having overutilization of resources in order to move up inflation expectations, if I’m interpreting correctly.	13	1
201406	3040	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If that’s a general sentiment on the Committee, then I think it’s going to be very hard for us to say that long-run inflation is under our control, as we do in our longer-run goals statement.	13	1
201406	3041	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The longer- run goals statement says that we have control over long-run inflation and we decided to make that 2 percent.	13	1
201406	3042	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if we’re uncomfortable exceeding maximum employment in order to move up inflation expectations, as the staff indicated is necessary to move inflation back up to 2 percent, then we can’t say that we’re going to hit 2 percent, because once inflation drifts down, we’re not willing to move it back up.	13	1
201406	3043	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s something we should talk about if that’s a general sentiment among Committee members.	13	1
201406	3044	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay, so the first thing is that the impact of the staff outlook is very important.	13	1
201406	3045	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second important aspect of the Lindner memo is its implication for the behavior of inflation expectations.	13	1
201406	3046	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you’ll hear, I took on board the estimates out of the econometrics models—the Cogley-Sargent and Stock-Watson models—more than I did the imputations from the SPF and Michigan surveys.	13	1
201406	3047	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The estimate of the trend component in the Cogley-Sargent and Stock- Watson models of inflation is currently less than 1½ percent.	13	1
201406	3048	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What is this telling us?	13	1
201406	3049	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This means that if people in the economy form their expectations like econometricians, inflation expectations would now be materially below target.	13	1
201406	3050	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this, I’m worrying, would, in and of itself, put further downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations.	13	1
201406	3051	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The point on which I would differ, I guess, somewhat from the thinking of the staff is, when I look at survey evidence and financial market prices, I don’t see any evidence of that downward drift in inflation expectations at this time.	13	1
201406	3052	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My interpretation is that, unlike the models that are learning only from the data, the public is listening to us talk—to the FOMC’s communications—and we continue to be credible.	13	1
201406	3053	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Even though I agree with Governor Fischer that they don’t necessarily understand what inflation rate we’re talking about, they trust us that we’re going to hit 2 percent on the inflation rate.	13	1
201406	3054	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We continue to be credible in that the public continues to trust our willingness and ability to deliver 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201406	3055	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think we should just count on this happy situation continuing indefinitely.	13	1
201406	3056	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff forecast does not have inflation returning to 2 percent for more than five years.	13	1
201406	3057	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s in the early part of the 2020s.	13	1
201406	3058	2014-06-18	meeting	WILCOX	It’s late in this decade.	13	1
201406	3059	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m sorry—late in this decade.	13	1
201406	3060	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There will be a point at which the accumulation of hard data will trump our forecast.	13	1
201406	3061	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Personally, I counsel against waiting for hard evidence of the unmooring of inflation expectations to spring into action on the inflation front.	13	1
201406	3062	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m sure that everyone around this table remembers that high inflation expectations had really become part of the American culture and psyche in the 1970s.	13	1
201406	3063	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My recent visit to Japan reminded me that the same can be true of low inflation expectations.	13	1
201406	3064	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Deputy Governor Nakaso of the Bank of Japan told me a story that powerfully illustrates this point.	13	1
201406	3065	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the past year, the Bank of Japan gave its first nominal base pay increase since 1995.	13	1
201406	3066	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I don’t want the Governors to get any ideas from this, but this was the first nominal base pay increase since 1995.	13	1
201406	3067	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s a special Japanese word for “base pay increase” that the deputy governor and the bank used to describe its compensation action.	13	1
201406	3068	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Of course, I don’t know that word.	13	1
201406	3069	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3070	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But what’s more interesting is that one of Deputy Governor Nakaso’s assistants, a young woman, came to him and asked, “What does this word mean?	13	1
201406	3071	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are you going to do to my pay?	13	1
201406	3072	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve never heard this word before.”	13	1
201406	3073	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In some sense, like Paul Volcker’s challenge, the BOJ’s challenge is not just an economic one.	13	1
201406	3074	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s really a cultural one, to change the backdrop of inflation expectations in their minds.	13	1
201406	3075	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How has the Bank of Japan tried to address this challenge?	13	1
201406	3076	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you know, the bank is pursuing an aggressive purchase program.	13	1
201406	3077	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More important, in my view, they’ve announced that the program will return inflation to 2 percent by about late 2015, and they’ve committed to take additional steps if they’re falling short of that goal.	13	1
201406	3078	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the charts Beth Anne talked about indicate, Japanese inflation has risen sharply in the past year from zero to around 1¼ percent.	13	1
201406	3079	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Would it have risen so rapidly if the Bank of Japan had stuck to their January 2013 announcement that it viewed an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run as being consistent with their mission?	13	1
201406	3080	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There’s no way to know for sure, but I believe that the 2015 deadline has been critical in their being able to make as much progress as they have on inflation.	13	1
201406	3081	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For me, the lesson from this is, there is value in making our monetary policy objectives have a deadline—in management-speak, having them be time bounded.	13	1
201406	3082	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll talk about the implications of that for monetary policy in the next go-round.	13	1
201406	3083	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3084	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3085	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201406	3086	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3087	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Economic activity in the Fourth District is showing some rebound after weather-related weakness in the first quarter.	13	1
201406	3088	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Like the nation, the regional economy is steadily adding jobs at a sufficient pace to significantly reduce the unemployment rate.	13	1
201406	3089	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As of April, the four-state unemployment rate—I gained a state when I changed Districts—stood at 6 percent, lower than the nation’s 6.3 percent rate and down 1 percentage point since the end of last year.	13	1
201406	3090	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District unemployment rate calculated by my staff based on the county-level data is also down 1 percentage point this year.	13	1
201406	3091	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	This represents considerable progress in the region.	13	1
201406	3092	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Most of the business contacts I’ve met with since coming to Cleveland two weeks ago and that my staff has talked to over the intermeeting period expect moderate growth in the Fourth District for the period ahead.	13	1
201406	3093	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	This expectation partly reflects continued gains in some of the sectors important to the District’s economy, including autos and materials manufacturing.	13	1
201406	3094	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Last week, we held a joint meeting of the boards of the Cleveland Bank and the Cincinnati and Pittsburgh Branches.	13	1
201406	3095	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Most of the directors reported they had not changed their outlook for moderate growth over the second half of the year, although a handful reported a downgrade based on the weakness seen in the first quarter.	13	1
201406	3096	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Some of the directors reported some difficulty in hiring due to a shortage of qualified workers, but perhaps no more than unusual.	13	1
201406	3097	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Others said most of the hiring they’d been doing represented the replacement of workers rather than an expansion of payrolls.	13	1
201406	3098	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	We received some welcome news on housing.	13	1
201406	3099	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	A number of the bankers reported a pickup in mortgage originations in recent weeks.	13	1
201406	3100	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	C&I lending has also been holding up.	13	1
201406	3101	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	At the national level, we had a poor negative reading on growth in the first quarter, but I attribute most of that weakness to bad weather.	13	1
201406	3102	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Our pattern of growth in the first half will be choppy before we return to a more normal pattern and continued moderate growth in the second half of the year.	13	1
201406	3103	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Save for January, when the weather was very bad, employment at the national level has grown by more than 200,000 jobs per month for the year to date.	13	1
201406	3104	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And the unemployment rate has fallen 1.2 percentage points over the past year.	13	1
201406	3105	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The broader measures of unemployment that include marginally attached workers and those working part time for economic reasons also moved down.	13	1
201406	3106	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Recently, we’ve been seeing some encouraging news on inflation.	13	1
201406	3107	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Although inflation is still running below the Fed’s 2 percent goal, there’s been some firming in recent months.	13	1
201406	3108	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Year- over-year inflation rates measured by a number of different indicators, including the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI and trimmed mean CPI—which, of course, I am very partial to—all increased since the start of the year.	13	1
201406	3109	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Now, I have the luxury of not having to compare my projections with my last projections.	13	1
201406	3110	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3111	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I realize that this is a one-time option, and I’m going to exercise it.	13	1
201406	3112	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I project that growth will be about 3 percent in the second half of this year and through 2016.	13	1
201406	3113	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	This is somewhat above trend, which I put around 2½ percent.	13	1
201406	3114	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I note I am somewhat more optimistic about trend growth than the Tealbook, which has revised it down to 2 percent.	13	1
201406	3115	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The Board staff’s judgment may prove to be right, but uncertainty around any estimate of trend growth is high.	13	1
201406	3116	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	And I’m being a bit more cautious, remembering the experience of the 1990s, when, over a period of several years, many forecasters revised down trend growth estimates, only to subsequently revise them up significantly in response to strong productivity growth.	13	1
201406	3117	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	With growth above trend, I project that the unemployment rate will continue to decline, reaching 6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year; 5.7 percent by the end of 2015; and 5½ percent by the end of 2016, which I assess to be roughly the natural rate.	13	1
201406	3118	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	With inflation expectations well anchored and core inflation firming, I project that inflation will gradually move back to our target over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201406	3119	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	My projections incorporate continued reductions in the pace of asset purchases, with the program ending in the fourth quarter of this year.	13	1
201406	3120	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	With continued steady progress in labor markets toward the Committee’s longer-run goal of maximum employment, I tie liftoff from the zero lower bound to when inflation between one and two years ahead reaches the Committee’s goal of 2 percent.	13	1
201406	3121	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	In my projection, this occurs in the first quarter of 2015.	13	1
201406	3122	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	This is a quarter earlier than the Tealbook’s liftoff date.	13	1
201406	3123	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Consistent with the Committee’s forward guidance, I project that, after liftoff, the fed funds rate will rise gradually over the rest of 2015, similar to a path suggested by a Taylor (1999) rule with inertia.	13	1
201406	3124	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As the expansion strengthens, I believe it will be appropriate to raise interest rates at a more rapid pace described by a less inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	13	1
201406	3125	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As a result of delaying liftoff until early in 2015 and the inertia in my monetary policy rule, by the end of 2016, the fed funds rate target is somewhat below its longer-run normal level, which I put at 3.75 percent, despite unemployment and inflation both being near their longer-run levels.	13	1
201406	3126	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	As with any forecast, there are risks.	13	1
201406	3127	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I view the risks, including a number of international risks, as broadly balanced at this time.	13	1
201406	3128	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3129	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3130	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201406	3131	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3132	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy continued to expand moderately since our last meeting.	13	1
201406	3133	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	District employment picked up slightly in April, and four of our seven District states now have unemployment rates at or below their pre-recession average.	13	1
201406	3134	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Service and manufacturing firms both reported stronger activity in May and remained optimistic about employment growth in coming months.	13	1
201406	3135	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	And, finally, drilling activity in the Tenth District increased further in May, driven by a rise in crude oil activity.	13	1
201406	3136	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national economy, my outlook for real growth is little changed compared with our last meeting.	13	1
201406	3137	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Like others, I expect a rebound in the second quarter from the decline we saw in the first quarter, and I have lowered the path of the unemployment rate through the end of 2015.	13	1
201406	3138	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, I continue to expect above-trend growth of around 3 percent over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201406	3139	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The fundamental factors supporting this forecast are fiscal drag ending, labor markets improving, household wealth continuing to rise, and financing conditions remaining supportive of growth.	13	1
201406	3140	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The most recent NFIB survey is consistent with my view of a gradual pickup in economic activity and inflation.	13	1
201406	3141	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Small business optimism and the percentage of small businesses expecting higher real sales in the next six months are at or tied with their post- recession highs.	13	1
201406	3142	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of labor markets, the composite labor market indicators constructed by my staff continue to show improvement in the level of labor market activity, and the momentum indicator of this survey is higher than at any time in the past two decades.	13	1
201406	3143	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Key factors contributing to the high level of momentum are the growth in aggregate weekly hours and improvement in the University of Michigan’s measure of expected job availability.	13	1
201406	3144	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I’m also encouraged by the increase in the job-finding rate for the short-term unemployed—which increased from 22 percent in January to more than 29 percent in May, a post-recession high—as well as the significant increase in job openings in the latest JOLTS data.	13	1
201406	3145	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of housing, one of my District contacts, who is a CEO of a large national realty firm, characterized the housing market as settling into a more traditional and sustainable growth pattern, even as she described a confluence of factors that currently affect the market.	13	1
201406	3146	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Low inventories, tight lending standards, elevated levels of student loan debt for first-time homebuyers, and a lack of new building were cited as weighing on housing.	13	1
201406	3147	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	And she noted that much of the available inventory is of rather low quality.	13	1
201406	3148	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The declining share of first-time homebuyers in the market was also cited as a substantial headwind.	13	1
201406	3149	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Similar to President Plosser’s observation, work by my staff has highlighted that the aging population will continue to substantially shift demand from single-family units toward multifamily.	13	1
201406	3150	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In the face of these issues, of course, housing remains extremely affordable by historic measures.	13	1
201406	3151	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I noted that the National Association of Realtors’ Housing Affordability Index shows that housing is still substantially more affordable today than at any time between 1970 and 2009.	13	1
201406	3152	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, I’m encouraged that the employment-to-population ratio for 16-to-24 year-olds has been picking up over the past 12 months, which may help foster demand for first-time buyers.	13	1
201406	3153	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	So, even as housing continues to face headwinds, I expect historic affordability and an improving labor market to lead to continued, though modest, gains over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201406	3154	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, turning to inflation, recent data releases show that the deceleration we saw last year has ended, and we’re seeing a broad-based increase in inflation over the past few months.	13	1
201406	3155	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The NFIB survey also reports that the percentage of respondents planning on raising their average selling prices and worker compensation is at or near its post-recession high.	13	1
201406	3156	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	This gives me greater confidence in my outlook for a gradual increase in inflation to reach 2 percent by the end of 2015.	13	1
201406	3157	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3158	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3159	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201406	3160	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3161	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although the first-quarter pothole keeps getting deeper, the latest data, including the significant improvements in the labor market, confirm that the recovery remains on track.	13	1
201406	3162	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, looking past the middle of this year, I made few changes to my projections for growth or inflation.	13	1
201406	3163	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I expect growth to average just above 3 percent over 2015 and 2016 and the unemployment rate to continue to decline, reaching 6 percent by the end of this year, 5.4 percent by the end of 2015, and my estimate of the natural rate, 5.2 percent, in the first half of 2016.	13	1
201406	3164	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	With output and unemployment gaps narrowing, I expect inflation to gradually move back to our 2 percent longer-run target over the next few years, although slightly faster than assumed in the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	3165	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see the risks to my projections as roughly balanced and the magnitude of those risks as similar to that of the past 20 years.	13	1
201406	3166	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	One upside risk to inflation that I think is worth mentioning in the current context is a potential for energy price increases resulting from political disruptions in Ukraine or in Iraq.	13	1
201406	3167	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The details of my projection are found in my SEP submission.	13	1
201406	3168	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m participant number 2, for those who want to have something to read tonight or who can’t sleep.	13	1
201406	3169	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In my baseline forecast, we miss on our mandates for inflation and employment on the same side.	13	1
201406	3170	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re too low.	13	1
201406	3171	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s no conflict or tradeoff regarding appropriate policy, at least in terms of our macro goals.	13	1
201406	3172	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, recent research on inflation dynamics and long-term unemployment raises the possibility of an upside risk to this forecast for inflation.	13	1
201406	3173	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	If this risk materializes, inflation could reach our target before the unemployment gap is fully closed.	13	1
201406	3174	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that would create a short-run tradeoff for monetary policy.	13	1
201406	3175	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll spend the rest of my time discussing the evidence regarding this risk and the implications for policy.	13	1
201406	3176	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not surprisingly, much of this discussion is based on a recent paper that I wrote with Glenn Rudebusch.	13	1
201406	3177	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Signed copies are also available after dinner.	13	1
201406	3178	2014-06-18	meeting		[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3179	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	To preview, if we face this tradeoff—and I understand there are people in this room who are not convinced by this, but you think of this as a risk—it would be optimal to temporarily overshoot on inflation by a modest amount.	13	1
201406	3180	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Such an outcome balances our price-stability and maximum-employment mandates, completely consistent with the FOMC longer-run policy goals and monetary strategy statement that we agreed to back in January 2012 and have since twice reaffirmed.	13	1
201406	3181	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Various Committee participants have discussed the evidence regarding the influence of long-term unemployment versus short-term unemployment on inflation.	13	1
201406	3182	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own reading of the data and research leads me to conclude that it’s hard to dismiss outright the possibility that the long-term unemployed have less effect on wage and price setting than the short-term unemployed.	13	1
201406	3183	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Estimating a standard expectations-augmented Phillips curve for the period from 1960 through 2013, Glenn and I found that the short-term unemployment gap is a far more important determinant of inflation than the long-term unemployment gap.	13	1
201406	3184	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, in our own model, after controlling for the short-term unemployment gap, the long-term unemployment gap provides no additional information.	13	1
201406	3185	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I recognize that some have argued that this aggregate type of analysis is sensitive to model and sample specification, and I have read those papers.	13	1
201406	3186	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I would mention that our findings are consistent with research by Bob Gordon, by Mark Watson, and by Alan Krueger, and they use different models and samples.	13	1
201406	3187	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Others have noted that micro studies using cross-state or cross-city variation find little differences in short- and long-term unemployment in determining inflation.	13	1
201406	3188	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think those studies are very interesting, and I’ve been following that closely.	13	1
201406	3189	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I will say that these studies are themselves not immune to some criticisms, especially around identification—basically separating causation from correlation and distinguishing between macro effects and local effects.	13	1
201406	3190	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, it is interesting to me that there is actually a very well-developed literature on this subject in the United Kingdom associated with Layard, Nickell, and Manning, which did do very careful econometrics on the British data.	13	1
201406	3191	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a different country, but they do find results similar to those we found in the United States—that the long-term unemployed have little influence on price setting in the United Kingdom.	13	1
201406	3192	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I read this evidence right now is that there’s evidence on either side, and it’s far from dispositive.	13	1
201406	3193	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	With the short-term unemployment rate close to its historical average, we should at least be open to the possibility that inflation will move up faster than expected and be prepared to respond appropriately.	13	1
201406	3194	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In other words, this is a risk to the Tealbook baseline forecast that I thought was worth investigating.	13	1
201406	3195	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The appropriate response to such an unexpected pickup in inflation depends, of course, on whether it also implies that we’re nearing full employment.	13	1
201406	3196	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The long-term unemployed are essentially disengaged from the labor market and beyond our policy reach.	13	1
201406	3197	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the short-term unemployment gap would also be a good measure of maximum employment.	13	1
201406	3198	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to say that the evidence does not support this view.	13	1
201406	3199	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, our time-series analysis in our own paper shows that the long-term unemployment share in the United States is cyclical, suggesting that, as the economy improves, the share will return to its normal level.	13	1
201406	3200	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, as I mentioned at previous meetings, the long-term unemployed are finding jobs, and the rate of reemployment has actually improved as the economy has gained strength.	13	1
201406	3201	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This implies that weak aggregate demand, rather than hysteresis or other structural factors, is behind today’s elevated rate of long-term unemployment.	13	1
201406	3202	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, the long-term unemployed look similar to the short-term unemployed across key characteristics such as educational attainment, occupation, and industry, especially by comparison with past recoveries.	13	1
201406	3203	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So overall, this evidence indicates, in terms of employability, that the long-term unemployed are, in general, not that different from the short-term unemployed—other than in the duration of their joblessness.	13	1
201406	3204	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a consequence, the total unemployment rate, rather than the short-term unemployment rate, to my mind, remains the right metric for thinking about maximum employment in our mandate.	13	1
201406	3205	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So combined, the evidence on inflation dynamics and the employment prospects of the long-term unemployed raise the risk that the resource gap for determining near-term inflation could, in fact, be different than the one associated with maximum employment.	13	1
201406	3206	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In other words, the limited impact of the long-term unemployed on inflation creates a wedge in the dual mandate—in particular, a divergence between the policy path that satisfies our inflation mandate and the one that satisfies our full-employment mandate.	13	1
201406	3207	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our paper, we actually studied this using optimal policy in a simple forecasting model, and we looked at the implications of this wedge.	13	1
201406	3208	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We find that the influence of this wedge is just like a supply shock in any other model.	13	1
201406	3209	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Appropriate policy calls for balancing the objectives of price stability and full employment by allowing inflation to temporarily overshoot its target by a modest amount.	13	1
201406	3210	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	With inflation rising more quickly, optimal policy is somewhat tighter than in the standard model that does not distinguish between short- and long-term unemployment.	13	1
201406	3211	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, from the point of view of the policy implications, it’s very much like a supply shock, and you can think of policy just responding to that as the inflation data confirm that that’s what’s going on.	13	1
201406	3212	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3213	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3214	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	It’s 6:00.	13	1
201406	3215	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to suggest we break for dinner and reconvene at 9:00 in the morning.	13	1
201406	3216	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s say 9:00 tonight.	13	1
201406	3217	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3218	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	That’s good—9:00 tonight.	13	1
201406	3219	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	We could get it all done.	13	1
201406	3220	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think 9:00 am should work, and we’ll finish up the economic go-round then.	13	1
201406	3221	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m hoping that the policy round is not too complex.	13	1
201406	3222	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Across the way, dinner will be served.	13	1
201406	3223	2014-06-18	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	13	1
201406	3224	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	June 18 Session .	13	1
201406	3225	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	13	1
201406	3226	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume our economic round.	13	1
201406	3227	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201406	3228	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3229	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	My views, like those, I think, of most people around the table, haven’t changed much since the previous meeting.	13	1
201406	3230	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We are getting the bounce in economic activity that we expected this quarter, and I think it looks mostly sustainable given the improvement in fundamentals, including the relatively strong payroll trend we have seen and supportive financial market conditions.	13	1
201406	3231	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, though, I still have considerable uncertainty about what the growth rate is going to be during the second half of the year, after the bounce.	13	1
201406	3232	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The Tealbook estimate of 3½ percent annualized growth in the second half certainly seems doable, but I also wouldn’t be surprised if we fell back into that 2 to 2½ percent range that we have averaged since the recovery began in 2009.	13	1
201406	3233	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Such a difference in the growth rate—say, 2½ percent versus 3½ percent—I think is important because it would be meaningful in driving the expected timing of liftoff.	13	1
201406	3234	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like greater clarity about that, and what the growth trend will be in the second half before making any adjustments to our communications that change expectations about the likely timing of liftoff.	13	1
201406	3235	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also view the sustained decline in the unemployment rate as noteworthy.	13	1
201406	3236	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think this decline tells you that much about how much slack remains in the labor market given the drop in the participation rate.	13	1
201406	3237	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But at the same time, I don’t think we can ignore it altogether, as we don’t know how many of these discouraged workers will return to the labor force as the labor market tightens.	13	1
201406	3238	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So, at the margin, I think the likelihood has increased that we will run out of excess slack in the labor market somewhat sooner than we had thought earlier.	13	1
201406	3239	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue pertains to headwinds.	13	1
201406	3240	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	How long will they persist?	13	1
201406	3241	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of housing, I was quite skeptical about the Tealbook’s forecast at the beginning of the year.	13	1
201406	3242	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It showed a pretty strong recovery in housing, and I continue to believe that the housing recovery will be a slow slog.	13	1
201406	3243	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	One question is, what will happen to credit availability in terms of mortgage loans?	13	1
201406	3244	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Credit scores have become a much more important factor in driving the availability of mortgage credit.	13	1
201406	3245	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And on that point, my thinking has evolved.	13	1
201406	3246	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Earlier, I thought that credit availability would improve relatively quickly as the financial sector returned to health and housing prices recovered.	13	1
201406	3247	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But now I think that this bifurcation across FICO scores will turn out to be much more persistent.	13	1
201406	3248	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason for that is, I think, that the mortgage-lending decision fundamentally changed.	13	1
201406	3249	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Prior to the crisis, the security of the loan rested primarily on the house as collateral.	13	1
201406	3250	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The credit quality of the borrower was viewed as much less important, and we certainly saw that in terms of the type of people that got mortgage credit during the crisis.	13	1
201406	3251	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This presumably made sense in a world in which housing prices typically rose, because that drove down the loan-to-value ratio and drove up the margin of protection to the lender.	13	1
201406	3252	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think the crisis changed all of this.	13	1
201406	3253	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Housing prices declined significantly, and people found out that the foreclosure process was painfully slow.	13	1
201406	3254	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, the collateral of the house offered much less protection to the lender than had been anticipated at the time the loan was made—hence, the need to place a greater weight on the creditworthiness of the borrower.	13	1
201406	3255	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think this is something that is going to change anytime soon.	13	1
201406	3256	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, when you put this together with the increased student loan debt burdens and higher down payment requirements, this suggests that the housing headwinds will be with us for a long time.	13	1
201406	3257	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I’d like to pose and answer a few questions about the low level of volatility that we have seen in currency, equity, and fixed-income markets.	13	1
201406	3258	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This does cause me some concern that market participants will respond to this by taking on greater risk.	13	1
201406	3259	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That would prove problematic when volatility inevitably increases.	13	1
201406	3260	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The first question is, why is volatility so low?	13	1
201406	3261	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, there are two broad sets of factors.	13	1
201406	3262	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the economy is evolving in a way close to the consensus outlook, so existing positioning doesn’t need to be adjusted because the outlook hasn’t changed in a material way.	13	1
201406	3263	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And, second, I think there is remarkably little disagreement about the outlook; the dispersion of the forecast is quite narrow.	13	1
201406	3264	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The second question is, are we responsible for this low level of volatility?	13	1
201406	3265	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think we are partially responsible.	13	1
201406	3266	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Our gradual, predictable taper of our asset purchases and our forward guidance with respect to liftoff does help reduce uncertainty about the path of short-term rates, and this contributes to less volatility.	13	1
201406	3267	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That raises the question, should we do something about this if we are partly responsible for this low volatility?	13	1
201406	3268	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I do think we should remind investors that the world is uncertain, and that this low volatility will inevitably end at some point in the future.	13	1
201406	3269	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We want investors to behave in a way consistent with the risks that exist and how the world might unfold in the future.	13	1
201406	3270	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t think we want to deliberately create more uncertainty about monetary policy just in order to make financial markets more volatile.	13	1
201406	3271	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That is because low volatility also contributes to rising stock prices and lower term premiums that make financial conditions more accommodative, and that is actually a goal of policy.	13	1
201406	3272	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	At the zero lower bound, keeping financial conditions accommodative is what we’re trying to achieve.	13	1
201406	3273	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, we’re essentially incurring some increased risk on financial stability—in other words, we are generating lower volatility—in order to generate easier financial conditions and faster progress to our dual mandate objectives.	13	1
201406	3274	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	For myself, I think the tradeoff here is still favorable.	13	1
201406	3275	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Although there is increased risk- taking, leverage hasn’t increased much and credit growth is sluggish.	13	1
201406	3276	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the impact of a sharp rise in volatility is manageable.	13	1
201406	3277	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, if we weren’t at the zero lower bound, I would feel differently.	13	1
201406	3278	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Then, it wouldn’t be such an attractive tradeoff.	13	1
201406	3279	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We could have more volatility and less financial-stability risk, but we could offset that impact on financial conditions by lowering short-term interest rates.	13	1
201406	3280	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the current setup, this isn’t available to us.	13	1
201406	3281	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The bottom line for me is, at the zero lower bound, you may want to damp volatility to make financial conditions easier, even though there might be some payback for this later.	13	1
201406	3282	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3283	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3284	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201406	3285	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks very much, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3286	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to just say a few things about how the state of the economy looks or, rather, what questions I have about it.	13	1
201406	3287	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We have got two basic facts since last time.	13	1
201406	3288	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	One is, we had an extremely weak first quarter.	13	1
201406	3289	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It seems to be getting weaker and weaker.	13	1
201406	3290	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure whether I take any comfort from the fact that the staff says that it’s not so much weather, it’s exports and inventories.	13	1
201406	3291	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If that’s the case, it’s not an act of God, or at least only in a very complicated sense is it an act of God.	13	1
201406	3292	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3293	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And it means there is something happening in the economy that we really didn’t quite understand; on exports, okay, that’s the rest to the world, but on inventories, I’m not sure what it is.	13	1
201406	3294	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t take much comfort from that.	13	1
201406	3295	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I would rather it was the weather, and then we’d know it’s warm now, and we’re not going to have that this quarter or next quarter.	13	1
201406	3296	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The other fact we had was the labor market seems to be continuing to do well, and I think almost everyone here thought that there would be a backup from 6.3 percent to 6.4 percent or something like that.	13	1
201406	3297	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It didn’t happen.	13	1
201406	3298	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And the staff had to decide how to deal with these facts.	13	1
201406	3299	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, they’ve gone with the strong labor market and downplayed what happened in the first quarter.	13	1
201406	3300	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But at the same time we have had a major decline in expected growth because of lower potential growth.	13	1
201406	3301	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	That, I understand, was something that was in the pipeline of the production function of the Division of Research and Statistics for some time, so it’s not directly caused by the first quarter.	13	1
201406	3302	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We have some key questions now.	13	1
201406	3303	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	One is, how fast are we growing?	13	1
201406	3304	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the outcome we get is, in the long term, less than we thought, and in the short term, not very different than what we were growing at, except for the statistical effect of having the first quarter be negative, and more and more negative so far, as time has gone by.	13	1
201406	3305	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think we don’t know very much about the long term, and I’m going to wait before marking down long-term growth.	13	1
201406	3306	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I have read the papers by Bob Gordon, and I have listened to Joel Mokyr, and I read the newspaper yesterday, and I understand there’s still an argument going on in the profession, both of them based on things that are not very easy to quantify.	13	1
201406	3307	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I am mindful of the work by Reinhart and Rogoff and the fact that recessions accompanied by financial crises are longer and deeper.	13	1
201406	3308	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Despite all the noise about their empirical work, I think that fact is pretty well established.	13	1
201406	3309	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know that we have finished seeing the impact of that financial crisis on the growth rate, so I haven’t made up my mind about whether we’re heading for secular semistagnation or just looking at a fairly long disturbance.	13	1
201406	3310	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The second question is, what will happen to fiscal policy?	13	1
201406	3311	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it is not going to become very expansionary, but we may get a little bit out of state and local governments if the economy begins to expand more rapidly, as is the forecast.	13	1
201406	3312	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The third question is, how fast is the labor market approaching full employment?	13	1
201406	3313	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it’s certainly faster than we expected.	13	1
201406	3314	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s interesting, if you look at the behavior of both the short-term and the long-term unemployed, they are both coming down.	13	1
201406	3315	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Long-term unemployment took a turn and is also coming down, and that’s part, presumably, of the ongoing equilibration of the labor market.	13	1
201406	3316	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	That means that productivity must be growing less fast than we thought, except for the participation rate declining.	13	1
201406	3317	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The fourth question is, how fast are wages rising?	13	1
201406	3318	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	This relates to inflation.	13	1
201406	3319	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	They are rising very slowly, but I don’t think they will be growing as slowly as this when we begin growing at 3 percent or a little more, and as the unemployment rate gets close to our estimates of full employment.	13	1
201406	3320	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And if the Phillips curve is supposed to be very flat, I don’t think it will stay that flat when we get closer to full employment.	13	1
201406	3321	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I might be asked, on what empirical work do you base this?	13	1
201406	3322	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I haven’t done that empirical work.	13	1
201406	3323	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And, fifth, what is the outlook for inflation?	13	1
201406	3324	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It depends on wage growth and various other things, but here I want to go back to a question I raised yesterday.	13	1
201406	3325	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We are putting a lot of weight on the inflation rate not being at 2 percent.	13	1
201406	3326	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It is our inflation rate that is not at 2 percent, so we are not achieving our goals.	13	1
201406	3327	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	My guess is that the public thinks we are achieving our goals, because I’m not sure they know what the inflation rate as measured by the PCE deflator is.	13	1
201406	3328	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And my guess is, if there’s anything they think about it’s the CPI, which is probably the best estimate of what their cost of living looks like to them.	13	1
201406	3329	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think that the small changes in the inflation rate that we calculate in using Okun’s law, and everything else that we’ve got in the model, are really entirely relevant to how the public—and that means businesses as well as households—see the inflation rate, and I think the outlook for inflation is a little less, but—and now I come to the second point—we have this incredible uncertainty about these things, and we don’t really know how to deal with it.	13	1
201406	3330	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Vice Chairman Dudley just talked very convincingly about how to think about low volatility in the context of, nonetheless, having high uncertainty about the future.	13	1
201406	3331	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I want to quote from the Tealbook.	13	1
201406	3332	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Apropos the real federal funds rate, the Tealbook emphasizes—this is on page 31 of Tealbook A—“the high degree of uncertainty around these estimates.”	13	1
201406	3333	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	First, of the long-run real federal funds rate, “70 percent confidence interval around our estimate of 1¾ percent would run from negative ¾ percent to 4¼ percent.”	13	1
201406	3334	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know how to think in that context of changes of ¼ percent that are possible, and so forth.	13	1
201406	3335	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now, trend output growth can be estimated more precisely with a standard error of just over ½ percentage point.	13	1
201406	3336	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But we should recognize, if I can quote Herb Stein, which I will do frequently in the years to come, the difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.	13	1
201406	3337	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	And the difference between a rate of per capita growth of 1¼ percent and 1 percent, which is what we have changed to, is 20 percent.	13	1
201406	3338	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	That is not small.	13	1
201406	3339	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If you think it’s small, ask yourself what difference it makes over 50 years.	13	1
201406	3340	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It makes a big difference whether we’re growing at 1 percent or 1¼ percent.	13	1
201406	3341	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a big change, and I also don’t know what we should do about it.	13	1
201406	3342	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We had a little bit of a discussion of this yesterday—I don’t remember in which context, but we need to think about that.	13	1
201406	3343	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Bill has just given us an example of how to do it.	13	1
201406	3344	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The other part is very clear, and I don’t think there is any ambiguity.	13	1
201406	3345	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t believe that the rates of uncertainty we have in the economy now are representative of the behavior of the economy, and the rates of uncertainty reflected in the VIX or something like that, are in fact the amount of uncertainty that is around.	13	1
201406	3346	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we ought to keep saying these estimates are uncertain because, if not, we will be accused of screwing up again.	13	1
201406	3347	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We will end up like Mark Carney, who was mentioned yesterday for having changed the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee’s forward guidance.	13	1
201406	3348	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, he is only changing because they wanted to give the impression that they knew for sure what was going to happen and when they were going to do it, and they didn’t because the uncertainty is so large.	13	1
201406	3349	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think we’ve got to not use uncertainty as an excuse for not achieving what we may want to achieve, but just to say, “These are our best estimates, but there is a lot of uncertainty out there in the world.	13	1
201406	3350	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Many things can happen, and we will make responses to changes in underlying conditions, and you should expect that.	13	1
201406	3351	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	This is what we think will happen.”	13	1
201406	3352	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	We can’t say “We also know that with a probability of 99.5 percent it won’t happen,” but we could say that and totally confuse the public.	13	1
201406	3353	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	This is something I am just throwing out because I don’t know how to deal with it either.	13	1
201406	3354	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I think we’ve got to figure out how to deal with it.	13	1
201406	3355	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3356	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201406	3357	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3358	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	A few quick points, some of which are connected.	13	1
201406	3359	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	First, I subscribe to the general view many of you have already stated that the significantly increased momentum of this quarter will continue through the year, though probably at a somewhat reduced pace.	13	1
201406	3360	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	In addition to the factors that have been cited by others yesterday afternoon, it is probably worth noting that cap-ex almost has to jump some this year, because there have been so many delayed investments needed to replace worn-out equipment.	13	1
201406	3361	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And from what I’ve read, some of that is just going to come due.	13	1
201406	3362	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Second, though—and this is a variation on the theme sounded by Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Fischer over the past few minutes—I find it a little hard to totally ignore Q1.	13	1
201406	3363	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, subject to data revisions that would make things look a little less bad, the early part of the year wasn’t a hiccup; it was more like coughing up blood.	13	1
201406	3364	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	And since weather is, at most, an incomplete explanation, as Governor Fischer just pointed out, particularly for the housing slowdown, I think there is probably at least a little bit of reason for lingering concern as to whether there is some weakness underlying the recent bounceback.	13	1
201406	3365	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s connected to some of the things Bill was saying.	13	1
201406	3366	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Third, there certainly continues to be improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201406	3367	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Everybody cited it.	13	1
201406	3368	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	By definition, that means there must be less slack than there was six months ago.	13	1
201406	3369	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s still hard to say just how much less slack there is.	13	1
201406	3370	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Some of the incoming data, I think, can still be read in ways that are consistent with both of the narratives we have been hearing over the past year or two or three—for example, the recent uptick in job openings has been read by some as an indication of latent mismatch problems now manifesting themselves, suggesting that there is less slack.	13	1
201406	3371	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I think you could also read it as an indication that employers are finally moving from talking about more hiring toward taking the steps to actually do more hiring.	13	1
201406	3372	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	What will ensue will be more hiring and perhaps increased employment of the long-term unemployed, whose rates of job-taking, as Stan just noted, have picked up some.	13	1
201406	3373	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Similarly, I think the relative impact of the long-term unemployed on wages and inflation is going to continue to be hard to pin down.	13	1
201406	3374	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I will confess to not having read the new paper coauthored by President Williams.	13	1
201406	3375	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I didn’t download it and read it last night, President Williams—I’m sorry—but I will.	13	1
201406	3376	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	As he was describing it yesterday, I was reminded again that until this recession and recovery, short-term and long-term unemployment in the United States had essentially moved together for more than half a century.	13	1
201406	3377	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	In some sense, the current situation is really the only observation we have to make judgments about the implications of long-term unemployment in a context in which it isn’t changing, more or less, in lockstep with short-term unemployment.	13	1
201406	3378	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	That is why I think we are going to continue to see good, thoughtful work on both sides of this issue for a while to come, and why, as I said a couple of meetings ago, I think we are just going to have to be pragmatic in making decisions.	13	1
201406	3379	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Fourth, we have definitely seen some early signs of a pickup in wage increases, though not so much in total compensation.	13	1
201406	3380	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I believe we should all hope that this trend continues and, indeed, accelerates, since PCE increases are going to be hard to sustain at the levels that are anticipated in the Tealbook in the absence of significant increases in household income.	13	1
201406	3381	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, we are not going to be able to continue to rely on wealth effects from the asset appreciation over the past year or so and the declining saving rates that we have seen over the past year or so.	13	1
201406	3382	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Fifth, and finally, unless there is something ominous lurking in the Q1 experience, it does seem as though the biggest downside risks to the US economy are foreign in origin, both economic and geopolitical.	13	1
201406	3383	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	On the economic side, people have mentioned—Beth Anne did yesterday—the case of possible Chinese inability to maintain growth above 7 percent.	13	1
201406	3384	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I have also begun to wonder some about Japan, which seems to be slipping from the relatively favorable trajectory that it established last year.	13	1
201406	3385	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	On the geopolitical front—this is all pretty obvious—there has been some reduction in risk of broad-based fallout from Ukraine, but it’s still material.	13	1
201406	3386	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	As a couple of people noted yesterday, Iraq has returned to the fore as a source of potentially substantial instability with rising effects of the type we have already seen on oil markets and beyond.	13	1
201406	3387	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3388	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3389	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201406	3390	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3391	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	My forecast is close to that of the Tealbook baseline, and I continue to see a good bit of slack in the economy and also the absence of strong evidence of tightness either in prices or wages or other metrics.	13	1
201406	3392	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’d like to focus for a few minutes on conditions in the financial markets, which I see as a potential risk to this forecast.	13	1
201406	3393	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	After almost six years of highly-accommodative policy, the risks are out there and continue to build.	13	1
201406	3394	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	To be specific, the risk in the near term, to me, is not that of a meltdown at the core of the system, which is much stronger and better protected than before the crisis, but rather that of a sharp correction amplified by the liquidity mismatch in the markets that would damage or halt the progress of what is still a weak economy.	13	1
201406	3395	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	As we’ve discussed, and I would be in agreement generally with Bill’s approach to this question, but as we discussed yesterday morning with the staff, implied volatility for equities, currencies, and long- and short-term fixed income are at historically low levels around the globe and market participants have pointed to a number of explanations for that.	13	1
201406	3396	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Particularly important for me would be, along with low realized volatility and the reach for yield, the guidance that this Committee and other central banks have given, that rates will remain low for the foreseeable future.	13	1
201406	3397	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	This explanation, to me, cuts across and supports all of the other explanations.	13	1
201406	3398	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Low volatility gives a feeling of safety and encourages the taking of risks, often in the form of levered bets, and a sudden increase in volatility can also lead to a sudden flight from these positions, big price movements across financial asset classes, and a significant tightening of financial conditions.	13	1
201406	3399	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The reach for yield is also evident across fixed-income markets—for example, there has been a resumption of strong flows into emerging market bond funds, which are often regarded as the canary in the coal mine.	13	1
201406	3400	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Investors have also shown strong appetite for European spread products, including peripheral, sovereign, and bank debt.	13	1
201406	3401	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Conditions in the leveraged finance markets in the United States and Europe are extremely loose.	13	1
201406	3402	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In the United States, leverage is high, although not quite at all-time, pre-crisis highs.	13	1
201406	3403	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Yield structures are historically weak with covenant-lite loans at an all-time high and also with less visible and more complex terms that have typically precluded, for example, the incurrence of additional debt and payments to equity holders.	13	1
201406	3404	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The share of issuance from low- rated borrowers—single-B and triple-C—is at an all-time high.	13	1
201406	3405	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Rates and spreads are also at or near historic lows.	13	1
201406	3406	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	With the support of the economic environment, low rates, and no covenants to violate, defaults are low and should remain low for a while, but these trends suggest that the ultimate wave of defaults will be quite large when it does materialize.	13	1
201406	3407	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	As President Fisher raised yesterday, wholesale investors are piling into newly created CLOs, and dealers are offering them leverage to fund their investments.	13	1
201406	3408	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In this case, the investor’s position is in a leveraged investment vehicle that funds leverage at the level of the corporate buyer.	13	1
201406	3409	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	From an investor’s standpoint, this is three levels of leverage.	13	1
201406	3410	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The point here is not to suggest that these are at all like the systemically dangerous SIVs of 2007, but more to illustrate the pressure that investors are under to find yield and the risk that they are taking.	13	1
201406	3411	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Meanwhile, compared with the pre-crisis era, availability and provision of liquidity in the markets is less certain and more at risk of drying up exactly when it’s needed.	13	1
201406	3412	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Dealer fixed- income inventories remain well below pre-crisis levels despite huge inflows into this sector since the crisis, much of it from retail investors, and many attribute this to the changed regulatory environment of the Volcker rule and the leverage ratio and stronger supervisory guidance about balance sheet risks.	13	1
201406	3413	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	ETFs and other retail-oriented investment vehicles own an increasing share of less liquid fixed-income products, exposing potentially unsuspecting retail investors to large liquidity risks.	13	1
201406	3414	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Putting these factors together, there’s widespread concern that a return to higher levels of volatility and a material repricing of these assets, perhaps triggered by a central bank decision to begin raising rates, would be amplified by strong retail outflows and low liquidity.	13	1
201406	3415	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The result would be a sudden tightening in financial conditions and material real economy effects.	13	1
201406	3416	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	So what to do about it?	13	1
201406	3417	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In my view at this point, this is not particularly an argument for bringing forward rate increases, nor are there obvious regulatory tools close to hand—for example, there’s a growing amount of anecdotal information that suggests that hedge funds and private-equity firms are busily building their own platforms to initiate and underwrite leverage financings as new regulations and our guidance put more pressure on regulated institutions.	13	1
201406	3418	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It seems to me to be a task mainly for communication, on which a great deal rides.	13	1
201406	3419	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I must say I found the statement by Governor Carney of the Bank of England last week interesting in this regard.	13	1
201406	3420	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	As we all know, he noted that the bank’s first rate hike could happen sooner than markets currently expect, and this unexpected statement seems to have been intended to produce a reaction, which it did.	13	1
201406	3421	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Sterling rates and volatility moved up significantly.	13	1
201406	3422	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	After a short delay, US rates and volatility also moved up in a more muted fashion as investors digested this speech, as the US is seen as being only a few months behind the Bank of England in tightening.	13	1
201406	3423	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The Carney speech shows the sensitivity of the markets to the slightest hint of an actual rate increase, even one that is thought likely to be at least a few months off.	13	1
201406	3424	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It also shows one possible way to avoid a disconnect between market expectations and Committee intentions.	13	1
201406	3425	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’m not recommending this for today, I’m just pointing out that it is important that we avoid such a disconnect.	13	1
201406	3426	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In my view, in the short term, Governor Carney has done us a small favor by shaking the market out of its complacency, and I just will close by saying that this issue will require close watching and perhaps eventually action along these lines.	13	1
201406	3427	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201406	3428	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201406	3429	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard?	13	1
201406	3430	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No audible response]	13	1
201406	3431	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201406	3432	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I want to thank you for a very interesting set of observations on the economic outlook.	13	1
201406	3433	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	At our previous meetings I summarized some of your comments during the go-round by relating them to a few key questions that underpin our policy decisions, and with your indulgence I will employ the same approach today, relying, in fact, on questions that are close cousins to those I posed last time.	13	1
201406	3434	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The questions are the ones that we’ve established to continue tapering our asset purchases, namely, is the labor market continuing to improve and is progress likely to be sustainable; and second, is it reasonable to expect that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over time?	13	1
201406	3435	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the question of labor market improvement, I heard broad agreement around the table that the labor market is continuing to improve.	13	1
201406	3436	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you, including Presidents Fisher, Plosser, and Bullard, mentioned positive labor market developments in your own regions, and of course, the employment reports for April and May showed solid job gains nationally with the three-month averages of both total and private payroll gains now standing about 230,000 per month, which is up from about 180,000 in March.	13	1
201406	3437	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George and several others mentioned a wide set of labor market indicators and various indexes that you’ve constructed; the ones similar to the Board’s labor market index likewise suggest improvement.	13	1
201406	3438	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The U-5 and U-6 are down, job openings up, the rates of hiring and quits, while still below normal levels, are gradually moving up.	13	1
201406	3439	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The prevalence of hard-to- fill jobs is rising.	13	1
201406	3440	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Household surveys suggest some improvement in confidence in the labor market, and Governor Fischer just noted that both long-term and short-term unemployment are coming down.	13	1
201406	3441	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, along with the decline in the unemployment rate, we have also seen a significant decline in the labor force participant rate, and Tealbook interprets part of that decline as cyclical.	13	1
201406	3442	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	It does not interpret the full decline in U-3 as reflective of reduction in labor market slack.	13	1
201406	3443	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Several of you, including Vice Chairman Dudley, noted that you agree with this interpretation, but I did hear some skepticism around the table about this conclusion, and Presidents Plosser and Bullard both suggested that we may not, in fact, see any significant bounceback in participation.	13	1
201406	3444	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, conceivably, the decline is related to the structural phenomenon that President Fisher mentioned yesterday, namely, the disappearance of middle- class jobs.	13	1
201406	3445	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think the evidence does suggest that a disproportionate share of job loss during the recession came in middle-paying occupations, whereas the gains since then have been tilted somewhat toward lower-paying occupations.	13	1
201406	3446	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the topic of how far we remain from our maximum employment goal, this is something we will surely be debating in the coming months.	13	1
201406	3447	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you—including Presidents Rosengren and Lockhart, who mentioned this explicitly—see notably more slack than would be indicated by U-3 alone.	13	1
201406	3448	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	This reflects the fact that an unusually large share of the work force is involuntarily underemployed, as well as the unusually large decline we’ve seen in labor force participation, a portion of which arguably reflects cyclical factors.	13	1
201406	3449	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	These forms of shadow underemployment or unemployment are disproportionately high relative to U-3.	13	1
201406	3450	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	One implication, as President Rosengren mentioned, is that the labor force participation rate may move sideways as the labor market strengthens over the next few years.	13	1
201406	3451	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	That’s what Tealbook envisions, and we may, therefore, see U3 declines at a slower pace than recently.	13	1
201406	3452	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	There was some discussion of labor market shortages.	13	1
201406	3453	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher, in particular, noted increased concern in Texas with the shortage of qualified job candidates.	13	1
201406	3454	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	That said, outside of a couple of regions, occupations, and sectors, several of you mentioned that there isn’t much evidence of general pressure on wages and compensation.	13	1
201406	3455	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart mentioned that part-time workers appear to be holding wage growth down.	13	1
201406	3456	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	By almost all metrics, the overall movements we have seen in compensation still show little evidence of acceleration, which is consistent with substantial remaining slack.	13	1
201406	3457	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans mentioned that his business contacts at this point show no concern with wage or broader cost pressures.	13	1
201406	3458	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, the ability of firms to replace workers with labor-saving technology—and they’re willing to do so if they encounter wage pressures, a phenomenon President Fisher described in his remarks—could be a further factor holding wage growth down.	13	1
201406	3459	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In fact, I personally wonder if such technological possibilities may be contributing to the tendency we’ve seen for quite a number of years now for real wage growth to lag productivity growth.	13	1
201406	3460	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	One of my own concerns—and this is something that Governor Tarullo mentioned—is that if wage growth doesn’t turn up, we may not see rapid enough income gains to support the consumer spending forecast in Tealbook.	13	1
201406	3461	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	If the markup and the share of labor income in GDP do not stabilize, and if the marginal propensity to consume out of labor income exceeds that from capital income, we could easily see growth remaining stuck near 2 percent rather than gradually strengthening as in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201406	3462	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the issue of sustainability of continued labor market gains, many of you—and I think I would include in this list Presidents Mester, Williams, George, Plosser, Dudley, Fisher, Bullard,  and Evans and Governor Tarullo—perhaps I’ve missed some—expressed an expectation that the economy will continue to grow rapidly enough to sustain labor market gains.	13	1
201406	3463	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The decline in GDP in the first quarter was surprisingly large, but many of you cited a wide range of evidence suggesting that we are in the midst of a significant rebound.	13	1
201406	3464	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you, like President George, noted a list of good reasons for aggregate demand to grow at a moderate pace in the remainder of the year.	13	1
201406	3465	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	These include diminishing fiscal drag and accommodative monetary policy, rising household net worth, and generally improved balance sheets, with continued solid gains in employment.	13	1
201406	3466	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart and others noted signs that the credit conditions are easing.	13	1
201406	3467	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, Presidents Lockhart and Evans and Governor Tarullo cited some evidence from surveys and your business contacts suggesting that investment spending should strengthen.	13	1
201406	3468	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you described your impressions of business sentiment, with President Evans, I believe, describing it as good, not great, which is consistent with my own impression from recent meetings with business leaders.	13	1
201406	3469	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Presidents Fisher, Plosser, Lacker, Lockhart, and Fisher—I said “President Fisher” twice, I apologize—	13	1
201406	3470	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	This is going to happen a lot.	13	1
201406	3471	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201406	3472	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	—commented on their impressions from surveys with their contacts describing sentiment using terms like “positive,”	13	1
201406	3473	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But several of you did comment on housing, noting that it does remain very soft.	13	1
201406	3474	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Tealbook expects a considerable pickup, but I did note comments by Vice Chairman Dudley and Presidents George, Lacker, Lockhart, and Plosser suggesting that for a host of different reasons relating to demographics, student debt, credit constraints, and supply constraints in producing housing, that the softness we have seen may be with us for quite a substantial time.	13	1
201406	3475	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Although most of you appear to have incorporated in your forecasts an expectation that growth will pick up to an above-trend rate in the remainder of this year and next, a few of you—	13	1
201406	3476	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Presidents Rosengren and Lockhart, Governor Tarullo, Presidents Bullard and Evans, Governor Fischer, and Vice Chairman Dudley—did sound some notes of caution here.	13	1
201406	3477	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The forecast of a return to moderate growth does remain just that.	13	1
201406	3478	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	It’s a forecast and not yet a reality.	13	1
201406	3479	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard noted that the quarters with negative growth are quite rare and may not, in fact, prove to be transitory, and several of you noted—President Rosengren, I think, noted this particularly— that incoming data have caused you to lower your forecast, becoming a bit more pessimistic.	13	1
201406	3480	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I personally agree that given how frequently we’ve been burned in the past, some degree of caution is in order until forecast turns into reality.	13	1
201406	3481	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, many of you noted the higher recent readings we’ve seen on core CPI and PCE inflation, including yesterday’s CPI reading, and interpret that as providing positive evidence that inflation is in fact moving back up toward our goal, which is a condition we have established to continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases.	13	1
201406	3482	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A few of you, and I would include here Presidents Plosser, Fisher, Lacker, and Bullard, expressed concerns that, absent a sufficient removal of policy accommodation, inflation could well rise above the Committee’s target.	13	1
201406	3483	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Presidents Fisher and Plosser and Governor Fischer cautioned us to remember that with declining unemployment, wages may rise, pushing up inflation and leaving us behind the curve, with a few of you noting that the risks could entail a rise in inflation expectations, although Governor Fischer cautioned us that there is huge uncertainty around this forecast.	13	1
201406	3484	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But I think it’s fair to say that no one at this table would like to experience a repeat of the 1970s.	13	1
201406	3485	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams noted that in recent work with Glenn Rudebusch he found evidence confirming the view of Kruger, Gordon, and others that inflation is more sensitive to short-term than to long-term unemployment.	13	1
201406	3486	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Frankly, I’ve personally been skeptical of this finding based, in part, on work by Board staff, and as Governor Tarullo mentioned, the increase we have seen in long-term unemployment is pretty recent and historically unique, and it could have other interpretations, such as downward nominal wage rigidity.	13	1
201406	3487	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But I think we need to recognize that it is a possibility, and, if so, inflation could rise to mandate-consistent levels well before our full employment goal is attained.	13	1
201406	3488	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The conclusion that President Williams drew isn’t that the Committee is behind the curve, but rather that the Committee may need to permit a temporary overshoot of our 2 percent inflation target to counter hysteresis, and I do think this is an important policy issue and it’s one that will merit further discussion in the days ahead.	13	1
201406	3489	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to the concerns that were expressed that inflation may rise above our target, Presidents Rosengren, Evans, and Kocherlakota focused on exactly the opposite concern, that inflation may persist below our target for a prolonged time unless we permit unemployment to overshoot our estimate of its natural rate, along the lines contemplated in Tealbook and justified by the analysis described in the Lindner memo.	13	1
201406	3490	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Under these circumstances, President Kocherlakota emphasized the risk that inflation expectations could drift down over time, as in Japan, and low inflation expectations could potentially become endemic and hard to change.	13	1
201406	3491	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, you continue to expect that, under our current policy path, inflation will gradually move up toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201406	3492	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you mentioned, as in Tealbook, that this could require a period of running the economy above potential.	13	1
201406	3493	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Briefly, on risks to the outlook, most of you mentioned that they seemed reasonably balanced, and the main risks I heard pertained first of all to global developments, such as slowing growth and financial-stability risks in China and the possibility that tensions in the Middle East could lead to a sharp increase in energy prices.	13	1
201406	3494	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Also importantly, Vice Chairman Dudley and Governor Fischer and particularly Governor Powell spoke to the issue of the low level of volatility and the trends we’re seeing in financial markets, some compression in credit spreads, reach for yield, and other risks to financial stability, and I absolutely agree that these are trends that are disturbing and, at a minimum, warrant monitoring.	13	1
201406	3495	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me come back to this in a second.	13	1
201406	3496	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Just adding a couple of brief comments of my own.	13	1
201406	3497	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the outlook, I haven’t changed my baseline forecast very much at all since our previous meeting, and I, too, see the broad range of incoming evidence as suggesting continued improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201406	3498	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I agree with those who see the decline in U-3 as overstating that degree of improvement, and I particularly see a portion of the decline in the participation rate as reflecting discouragement.	13	1
201406	3499	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the prospects for growth and continued improvement in the labor market, I frankly found recent data to be quite perplexing.	13	1
201406	3500	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	At this stage, it looks like we’ll see a pretty alarming decline in first-quarter GDP, and although most of the decline is due to large negative contributions from net exports and inventories, private domestic final purchases also seem to have slowed, and the most recent retail sales numbers haven’t been all that encouraging either.	13	1
201406	3501	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	As Governor Fischer mentioned, it’s not clear we should take heart from the fact that net exports and inventories declined either.	13	1
201406	3502	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	There are real crosscurrents here.	13	1
201406	3503	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned, I am also worried by the continued failure of real wages to grow in line with productivity.	13	1
201406	3504	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with Tealbook that as the labor market tightens this trend will probably change, but I do see it as a downside risk to the outlook for consumer spending.	13	1
201406	3505	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Without denying the substantial progress the economy has made toward returning to maximum employment, these observations underscore to me the importance of remaining cautious as we approach the question of the appropriate timing for removing accommodation.	13	1
201406	3506	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	And I would also just emphasize that I, too, am concerned about developments in financial markets and the signs we may be seeing of complacency in some segments.	13	1
201406	3507	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In addition to continued general vigilance in monitoring, I think applying appropriate supervisory and regulatory measures is in order.	13	1
201406	3508	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I also do think it’s important to lean against any tendency that develops in markets to view the FOMC as making any unconditional policy promises.	13	1
201406	3509	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In other words, I think we should emphasize—and this is something that Governor Fischer emphasized, and Governor Powell and Vice Chairman Dudley also commented on—that policy is truly data-dependent.	13	1
201406	3510	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	If, based on our reading of labor market conditions, inflation, and financial conditions, the outlook were to strengthen materially, policy accommodation would be removed sooner than markets might anticipate, and market participants need to be aware of this possibility.	13	1
201406	3511	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	However, I do agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that I would be reluctant to purposely say something to try to jolt expectations and to purposely raise volatility, given that we’re against the zero lower bound, and that’s a delicate balance, but I think it’s one we need to navigate.	13	1
201406	3512	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and I think we’re ready to turn to our policy round.	21	2
201406	3513	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn to Bill next for his briefing.	21	2
201406	3514	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201406	3515	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives” that was distributed this morning.	21	2
201406	3516	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the top panels of your first exhibit, despite the unexpectedly large decline in economic activity in the first quarter, the staff, the primary dealers, and your SEP contributions all still point to fairly steady declines in the unemployment rate and a gradual return of inflation toward your 2 percent goal as the economy grows at a somewhat faster-than-potential rate over the next couple of years.	21	2
201406	3517	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	With the economy still on track, you may see the outlook for policy as little changed.	21	2
201406	3518	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The primary dealer economists would agree.	21	2
201406	3519	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the middle-left panel, the median dealer projection for the path of asset purchases is unchanged from April.	21	2
201406	3520	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	All of the dealers are virtually certain that the Committee will reduce the pace of purchases another $10 billion at this meeting and that purchases will continue to move down in measured steps.	21	2
201406	3521	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Most dealers expect that you will cut purchases from $15 billion to zero at the October meeting, though a handful see a $10 billion reduction at that meeting, with Treasury purchases continuing at a pace of $5 billion through December.	21	2
201406	3522	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As Simon noted yesterday, there is still a fair amount of disagreement about when you will choose to end reinvestments of principal payments on SOMA holdings, but, of the dealers who answered the question, most now see the end of reinvestments coming after liftoff.	21	2
201406	3523	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Moving to the right, this timing contributes importantly to the later decline in the dealers’ expectation for the size of the SOMA portfolio than in the staff forecast, which assumes that reinvestments end at the time of the first increase in the funds rate.	21	2
201406	3524	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The bottom panels examine expectations for the path of the federal funds rate.	21	2
201406	3525	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown on the left, the median dealer and buy-side survey respondents made only modest changes to their outlooks for the funds rate since the April survey and continue to expect a gradual rise in short-term interest rates starting next summer.	21	2
201406	3526	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown to the right, the dealer survey, the staff forecast, and your SEP contributions all show a reduction in the longer-run normal level of the federal funds rate over recent months.	21	2
201406	3527	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Turning to the alternatives for this meeting, with the medium-term economic outlook little changed, you may want to make only small changes to the statement, as in alternative B on page 6.	21	2
201406	3528	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative B updates the Committee’s summary of recent economic developments, noting that economic activity “has rebounded in recent months,” without explicit reference to the transitory decline in output during the first quarter.	21	2
201406	3529	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It is a bit more upbeat than the April statement regarding labor market developments, describing them as generally showing “further improvement” and noting that, although the unemployment rate is lower, it remains elevated.	21	2
201406	3530	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Household spending is described as rising moderately, and the statement notes a resumption in growth of business fixed investment.	21	2
201406	3531	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The only other changes to the statement are a reduction in the pace of asset purchases noted in paragraph 3.	21	2
201406	3532	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Market expectations appear to be fairly well aligned with a statement like alternative B, and consequently it would be unlikely to generate a significant reaction in asset markets.	21	2
201406	3533	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, page 8, may appeal to those of you who are convinced that first- quarter growth was held down almost entirely by transitory factors and that the underlying pace of economic expansion remains sufficient to eliminate labor market slack relatively quickly.	21	2
201406	3534	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	You may also see the recent firming in inflation as likely to be more persistent than the staff, or may be concerned that continuing asset purchases well into the fall and keeping the funds rate at its effective lower bound well into next year could pose risks to inflation or to financial stability.	21	2
201406	3535	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	These views may lead you to want to taper asset purchases more rapidly and, by doing so, signal that liftoff is likely to occur earlier than markets now expect.	21	2
201406	3536	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Like that for alternative B, the statement for alternative C begins by indicating that economic activity has rebounded in recent months.	21	2
201406	3537	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	However, it is more upbeat than alternative B in noting that labor market indicators have shown “broad further improvement,” and introduces more expansive language characterizing payroll employment, as well as the unemployment rate and other measures, as indicating that “underutilization of labor resources remains.”	21	2
201406	3538	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It is also more positive in its description of business fixed investment and inflation.	21	2
201406	3539	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph announces a larger reduction in the pace of asset purchases, while the fourth suggests that there could be a similarly large reduction in the future.	21	2
201406	3540	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	A statement along the lines of alternative C would surprise investors and would likely cause them to pull forward the expected timing of the first rate hike and might lead them to anticipate a steeper subsequent path of the funds rate as well.	21	2
201406	3541	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Longer- term interest rates likely would rise, equity prices fall, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201406	3542	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, alternative A on page 4 may appeal to policymakers who view the sequence of downward revisions to first-quarter GDP as casting doubt on whether the current rebound in economic activity marks a return to sustained above-trend economic growth, or who are concerned that inflation might not return to 2 percent anytime soon without additional monetary accommodation.	21	2
201406	3543	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Such policymakers may want to continue asset purchases at their current pace for now to await further information concerning the economic outlook, labor market conditions, and inflation; they may also want to strengthen the forward guidance.	21	2
201406	3544	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The first and second paragraphs of alternative A are more tentative about the recent economic news and the outlook for inflation than their counterparts in alternative B.	21	2
201406	3545	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph refers to increased uncertainty about the economic outlook as justification for a decision to maintain the current pace of purchases until more information on the outlook is available.	21	2
201406	3546	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	And the fifth paragraph strengthens the forward guidance for the federal funds rate by adding an inflation floor.	21	2
201406	3547	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	An announcement along the lines of alternative A would come as a considerable surprise to market participants, likely leading them to mark up their expectations for total asset purchases, perhaps by a considerable amount, and to push back their anticipated timing of liftoff.	21	2
201406	3548	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Interest rates would fall and the dollar could depreciate.	21	2
201406	3549	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Equity prices could rise or fall depending on the size of the negative signal that investors took from the statement about the economic outlook.	21	2
201406	3550	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for these alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201406	3551	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you.	21	2
201406	3552	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201406	3553	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Bill?	22	2
201406	3554	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201406	3555	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	22	2
201406	3556	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201406	3557	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a comment and a question.	22	2
201406	3558	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The comment is that I found these charts about the median dealer purchase expectations and the expected path of the fed funds rate to be useful.	22	2
201406	3559	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would be, I think, also informative to be presenting information about the distribution of beliefs as well.	22	2
201406	3560	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be slightly helpful in getting after some of the concerns about low volatility that we’ve been hearing, because you’d be getting a little bit of a picture of the distribution of beliefs in the market as well as just looking at the median.	22	2
201406	3561	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a comment.	22	2
201406	3562	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The question is about the SEP.	22	2
201406	3563	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The SEP shows a slight amount of tightening.	22	2
201406	3564	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are the staff views on how that would be interpreted by markets?	22	2
201406	3565	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The so-called dot plot shows, as Min described in the briefing yesterday, a little bit higher dots.	22	2
201406	3566	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	The median for 2015 was higher by 12½ basis points, and the one for 2016 by 25 basis points.	22	2
201406	3567	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I think, as we have seen in the past, those dots get a lot of attention in markets, and I think it will be read as suggesting a little bit tighter path for policy.	22	2
201406	3568	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I would expect to see some upward movement in market-based measures of expected policy, OIS or whatever, as a result of that.	22	2
201406	3569	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	We will see this afternoon, but I think that’s likely.	22	2
201406	3570	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	As I think Simon pointed out in his briefing, the market expectations are a little low relative to your SEP expectations.	22	2
201406	3571	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Not only are you above, but you’re a little more above, and I think that, again, will push things a little higher.	22	2
201406	3572	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The market expectations for the dots, you mean, or for—	22	2
201406	3573	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Just for policy.	22	2
201406	3574	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that we do ask a lot of questions about how concentrated the beliefs are.	22	2
201406	3575	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	There is close to a 100 percent belief that you will reduce asset purchases by $10 billion at this meeting  There is much less certainty about when liftoff will be, though, if you ask that question.	22	2
201406	3576	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201406	3577	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Related to this, would the market take any signal away from an inference that the dots are higher because existing participants have adjusted their forecast as opposed to the changing composition of the Committee, and that, by itself, could lead to shift in the dots?	22	2
201406	3578	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It’s hard to know what market participants will believe, but—	22	2
201406	3579	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I’m just asking for speculation.	22	2
201406	3580	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	—they are certainly aware that there has been a change in composition, and I would expect them to think there is at least a reasonable probability that the change in composition has contributed to the move up in the dots.	22	2
201406	3581	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	We asked a question about the dots, and some of the answers said it’s hard to work out because there are new people on the FOMC.	22	2
201406	3582	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	22	2
201406	3583	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Here’s a two-hander.	22	2
201406	3584	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	22	2
201406	3585	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not obvious, though, if the dots change because the composition changed, that it doesn’t matter.	22	2
201406	3586	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	Oh, absolutely.	22	2
201406	3587	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	No, no.	22	2
201406	3588	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I would think it would be the reverse in some sense.	22	2
201406	3589	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	It would matter if they thought that, for example, the change in composition had moved the center of the Committee in a particular way.	22	2
201406	3590	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That would matter.	22	2
201406	3591	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	The big issue is, they try to put names on each dot, and that makes it harder for them to work out the particular names they might be interested in when you add people.	22	2
201406	3592	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Isn’t there a slight offset, Bill, too, though, because the long-term equilibrium fed funds rate has come down slightly?	22	2
201406	3593	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I’m not sure if that is an offset.	22	2
201406	3594	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I guess it’s an offset in terms of what should happen to longer-term rates.	22	2
201406	3595	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	22	2
201406	3596	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what I mean.	22	2
201406	3597	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	I don’t think it’s an offset in terms of what should happen to expectations through the funds rate over the next few years.	22	2
201406	3598	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with that.	22	2
201406	3599	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander?	22	2
201406	3600	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	22	2
201406	3601	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I just wanted to underscore the point the Vice Chairman just made.	22	2
201406	3602	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This goes to how we all talk about this publicly.	22	2
201406	3603	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Of course, you’ll have the first chance, Madam Chair, to do that.	22	2
201406	3604	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think emphasizing that this comes from composition could really lead markets at that point to be thinking that this represents a change in the Committee’s reaction function.	22	2
201406	3605	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That carries with it certain risks I think.	22	2
201406	3606	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And just to follow up on the comment I had made about the distribution.	22	2
201406	3607	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s not just about how much a particular individual believes in the forecast he or she offers, it’s also about the distribution of beliefs for the period ahead—just to clarify what I was trying to say.	22	2
201406	3608	2014-06-18	meeting	POTTER	Certainly.	22	2
201406	3609	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	22	2
201406	3610	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A two-hander, President Mester.	22	2
201406	3611	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	22	2
201406	3612	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I just wanted to offer that my interpretation is if you look at 2015 unemployment rates, that forecast has been revised down a bit.	22	2
201406	3613	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I mean, you can point to economic conditions as being a factor in sort of—	22	2
201406	3614	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s right, but inflation was also marked down.	22	2
201406	3615	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	If you apply kind of a Taylor (1999) rule to the individual contributions, and look at what those might have implied about the distribution of dots in 2016, say, you can’t explain the movement of the dots.	22	2
201406	3616	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The 2015 inflation central tendency was not marked down.	22	2
201406	3617	2014-06-18	meeting	ENGLISH	That’s right.	22	2
201406	3618	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Bill?	22	2
201406	3619	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201406	3620	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, and before we begin our policy go-round, I’d like to raise an issue with you.	23	2
201406	3621	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	A few of you have mentioned to me that you think the time has come to clarify for the public the likely timing of the cessation of asset purchases, assuming we stay on the path of reducing asset purchases.	23	2
201406	3622	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, assuming the economy continues to progress along the lines we are anticipating, do we intend to bring the purchase program to a close at our October meeting with a $15 billion reduction in the pace of purchases, or do we, instead, intend to make another measured $10 billion reduction in October, and bring the program to a conclusion after the December meeting with a $5 billion reduction?	23	2
201406	3623	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I have been asked this question, and several of you have mentioned to me that you have as well.	23	2
201406	3624	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to say that I’m sympathetic to the view that it would be worthwhile to clarify this point sooner rather than later.	23	2
201406	3625	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I worry that the longer we wait to say something about this final step in the program, and the more we respond by saying that the Committee hasn’t yet decided, the larger this will loom in the minds of investors.	23	2
201406	3626	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	They may think that we see this as a very meaningful decision, and when the decision comes, it will be seen as a significant statement about our assessment of the economic outlook and the likely timing of interest rate increases, even though, in macroeconomic terms, it just is not a substantive issue at all.	23	2
201406	3627	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I like the idea of getting our decision on this out to the public soon.	23	2
201406	3628	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	One way to do this would be to include something in our statement today, and I know there are arguments in favor of such an approach.	23	2
201406	3629	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	But, I confess, it is not my personal preference.	23	2
201406	3630	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think that just adding a sentence, for example, to paragraph 4 that clarifies this, without providing any context, and in a statement that is otherwise notable for its absence of red ink, might well be read as saying something significant about our sense of the outlook.	23	2
201406	3631	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	So, in today’s statement, if we were to make such an addition, it will really stand out.	23	2
201406	3632	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, providing detail about the end of the purchase program could also encourage the view that our purchases are on a preset course, which I think is wrong.	23	2
201406	3633	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Using the statement to convey this information could have effects on policy expectations that I think would be unwelcome.	23	2
201406	3634	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, I think it’s highly likely that I will get a question on this topic at the press conference this afternoon.	23	2
201406	3635	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	My preference would be to actually answer that question, but I would do so in a way that provides the context that this is a decision that is not meaningful from a substantive point of view, that it does not have implications for our intentions regarding liftoff, which will hinge on our evolving expectations concerning our actual and expected progress in achieving our objectives, and that our purchases remain data-dependent.	23	2
201406	3636	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, before doing so, I absolutely want to make sure that you would be comfortable with this approach, and also to get your views on when it would be better to end the program, assuming that we do continue to reduce the pace of purchases.	23	2
201406	3637	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	My personal preference would be to go with a final step-down in the pace of purchases of $15 billion at the October meeting in order to avoid having the minimal purchases that would otherwise continue through December.	23	2
201406	3638	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think that would gain undue focus and attention, but I am completely open to your views on this question.	23	2
201406	3639	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	In your contributions during the go-round, I would appreciate it if you would indicate what your preferences are on the policy issue—namely, should the final reduction be $15 billion or $5 billion?	23	2
201406	3640	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Also, I’d like to hear your views on the communications issue.	23	2
201406	3641	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are you comfortable with my providing this information at the press conference, assuming the appropriate question is asked?	23	2
201406	3642	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	And if, to our surprise, there is no such question, this issue could, in any case, be covered in the minutes with the appropriate context provided.	23	2
201406	3643	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone have any particular questions on that?	23	2
201406	3644	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Otherwise, we can begin the go- round, and I’d just appreciate your comments on that.	23	2
201406	3645	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Can we step down $25 billion in September?	23	2
201406	3646	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Don’t push it, Jeff.	23	2
201406	3647	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201406	3648	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not in the feasible set.	23	2
201406	3649	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201406	3650	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201406	3651	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3652	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me start with the proposal just raised.	23	2
201406	3653	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I strongly support the idea of providing this kind of clarification.	23	2
201406	3654	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that if we don’t clarify the timing of the end of purchases now, I think we really run the risk, as you indicated, of allowing this very minor detail in policy being seen as a critical signal of our overall stance.	23	2
201406	3655	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Personally, I’d prefer—and my views differ from President Lacker’s on this—for this last $5 billion of purchases to take place in December rather than October.	23	2
201406	3656	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a very minor detail in economic terms, so I’m prepared to support the lead of the Committee as a whole on the question of timing.	23	2
201406	3657	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll put my vote in for December, but it’s not a strong preference for me.	23	2
201406	3658	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the communication issue, I would prefer for this language to be included in the statement, and I will express my preference for that.	23	2
201406	3659	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That I feel a little more strongly about.	23	2
201406	3660	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the FOMC should really be taking ownership of policy decisions like this rather than implying that the Chair has ownership.	23	2
201406	3661	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought last June was a bad precedent along these lines in terms of communication.	23	2
201406	3662	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not talking just in terms of outcomes, I’m talking in terms of the decision of the Committee to not take ownership of material decisions and not have them in the statement.	23	2
201406	3663	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d rather not repeat that precedent.	23	2
201406	3664	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, again, the important step, most important thing here, is to clarify this issue in some way.	23	2
201406	3665	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If your lead, Madam Chair, is to address this in the press conference, I’m prepared to support your lead on that.	23	2
201406	3666	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn next to alternative B.	23	2
201406	3667	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m prepared to support alternative B as written, but I do believe it can be improved.	23	2
201406	3668	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me suggest a specific change.	23	2
201406	3669	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like, if I could, to suggest that we add the redline language from paragraph 2 of alternative A, and that language is:  “The Committee anticipates that inflation will return to 2 percent, but only gradually.”	23	2
201406	3670	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would just add that clause to paragraph 2 of alternative B.	23	2
201406	3671	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A couple of things about this new language:  First of all, I think it does actually accurately reflect the Committee’s consensus outlook on inflation, as much as we can have a consensus outlook.	23	2
201406	3672	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in terms of a change, it reflects our own staff’s reassessment of underlying inflation.	23	2
201406	3673	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s appropriate for the FOMC to share that reassessment with the public, so I think it’s appropriate for us to make that change in the language.	23	2
201406	3674	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That would be my recommended change in the language for alternative B.	23	2
201406	3675	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, let me turn to a policy change that I believe we should take up over the next two meetings.	23	2
201406	3676	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I suggested in the previous go-round, I am highly concerned that our current approach to policy could lead to unanchored inflation expectations.	23	2
201406	3677	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our policy is focused on reducing accommodation, and it systematically communicates to the public that the FOMC is either unwilling or unable to influence the course of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years.	23	2
201406	3678	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This message is detrimental to the promotion of price stability and our credibility, more generally.	23	2
201406	3679	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe that we should be planning for the possibility of more-aggressive responses to low inflation.	23	2
201406	3680	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One such response is contained in the language of alternative A, which says that we will keep interest rates extraordinarily low at least until the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation rises back to 2 percent.	23	2
201406	3681	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is in paragraph 5 of alternative A.	23	2
201406	3682	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This language is a natural extension of our past threshold-based communications.	23	2
201406	3683	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, given the lessons from the Bank of Japan that I mentioned in the prior go-round, I actually don’t think this language goes far enough.	23	2
201406	3684	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With this language, the FOMC sets no real deadline for returning inflation back to 2 percent, and so it continues to suggest that it sees persistently low inflation as part of a new normal.	23	2
201406	3685	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is what I think would be useful to work on over the next couple of meetings:  How can we build deadlines into our response to persistently low inflation?	23	2
201406	3686	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I mean, we could be thinking about this.	23	2
201406	3687	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think right now the labor market improvement is proceeding in a gratifying way, but of course this could be applied to thinking about labor market shortfalls as well.	23	2
201406	3688	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Put another way, how can we systematically commit to providing more accommodation if inflation and the outlook for inflation does not return back to 2 percent by, say—and I’m naming a date out of nowhere—mid-2016?	23	2
201406	3689	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, what might those steps be?	23	2
201406	3690	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there are at least a couple of alternatives on the table.	23	2
201406	3691	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is that we could commit to targeting the price level if we’re committing to make up for post-2016 misses relative to target with more- aggressive future policy, or we could commit to embarking on a new asset purchase program that accelerates automatically until inflation returns to 2 percent.	23	2
201406	3692	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These are only a couple of alternatives, and I’m sure there are other approaches that would be useful.	23	2
201406	3693	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, some of you may be concerned about the possible impact of these policy approaches on financial stability, and I’m sympathetic to this concern.	23	2
201406	3694	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the past year or so, I’ve suggested ways for us to take this potential impact into account in our deliberations.	23	2
201406	3695	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I thought President Williams made a great point in a recent speech.	23	2
201406	3696	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to keep in mind that macroeconomic stability in general, and price stability more specifically, are really the key foundation that we can provide as a Committee for financial stability.	23	2
201406	3697	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I discussed in the previous go-round, we should see persistently low inflation as posing significant risks to that needed price stability.	23	2
201406	3698	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I indicated, Governor Fischer made a couple of comments about whether we should be using the PCE or the CPI.	23	2
201406	3699	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m very open to reconsidering the Committee’s decision to focus on the PCE.	23	2
201406	3700	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I share with him—when I talk about the inflation target, having to explain what PCE is and what CPI is—my main point is, it includes food and energy.	23	2
201406	3701	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s basically the only thing I try to communicate—unsuccessfully, by the way.	23	2
201406	3702	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think that, as a Committee, it’s worth rethinking about what that would mean, but right now our communication is PCE inflation is going to be at 2 percent.	23	2
201406	3703	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s what we consider as being consistent with maximum employment.	23	2
201406	3704	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we run below that, that’s basically saying that we think there is going to be downward pressure on inflation expectations, as we saw in our own staff’s evaluation of expectations.	23	2
201406	3705	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, you gave a very forceful defense of the FOMC’s commitment to the 2 percent target at your first press conference.	23	2
201406	3706	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I admit that I suspect I was guilty for your having to give that defense, but it was very forceful, and I thought a very strong part of your press conference.	23	2
201406	3707	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that kind of rhetoric is a powerful tool for central bankers, but at the end of day, actions trump words, and we need to be ready in the very near term to take concrete steps to more effectively defend our inflation target from below.	23	2
201406	3708	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think having a time-bounded approach to accommodation would be very helpful along those lines.	23	2
201406	3709	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll close with a quick comment on the Summary of Economic Projections.	23	2
201406	3710	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Plosser was teasing me in his go-round about my comment that my forecasts are divorced from reality.	23	2
201406	3711	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s becoming increasingly true—I’m very amenable to what the Tealbook’s forecast for inflation is, but my own forecast for inflation is based on the idea that inflation expectations have not drifted below 2 percent, because that would not be consistent with appropriate policy.	23	2
201406	3712	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have no way to begin to formulate a forecast that is actually based on the way I’m thinking about the economy at this point.	23	2
201406	3713	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think treating that as a hallmark, the first point of communication for the Committee outside of this meeting is increasingly problematic.	23	2
201406	3714	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would hope we could work together to have a better way to talk about our outlook than is being offered by the Summary of Economic Projections.	23	2
201406	3715	2014-06-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3716	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3717	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Fisher.	23	2
201406	3718	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3719	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With regard to your question, I agree with the suggestion you’ve made as to how you wish to handle this matter.	23	2
201406	3720	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	My preference personally, of course, is—and I’ve said this in speeches publicly—that we close off this program in October with the final $15 billion, and I’m happy to hear President Kocherlakota, although he has a personal preference to put it in the statement, to have a fallback, accepting that you handle this in the press conference.	23	2
201406	3721	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I would like to suggest that that is the best way to proceed, and I’m sure you’ll handle it just right.	23	2
201406	3722	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I do think it’s important to emphasize the fact that from a macroeconomic standpoint, this is not a significant factor, as you expressed.	23	2
201406	3723	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I fully support the way you suggested it be handled, and I would also say with regard to the ownership issue, the Chair speaks for the Committee, and from my standpoint as a close observer, I would say that the Chair has done a very good job of reflecting the Committee’s views rather than exerting any individual views, and I know you’ll continue to do so.	23	2
201406	3724	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	With regard to alternative B, I would suggest no changes.	23	2
201406	3725	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I like it the way it’s written.	23	2
201406	3726	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The sentence, “the unemployment rate, though lower, remains elevated”	23	2
201406	3727	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	—Bill and I have talked about this, of course, and eventually if we continue to see improvement there, we might want to migrate to the language that we have in alternative C, paragraph 1, but for now I think it’s fine the way it is.	23	2
201406	3728	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I want to conclude with a little apology here as to the way I stated myself yesterday.	23	2
201406	3729	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Just to be clear, I think I was pretty straightforward.	23	2
201406	3730	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I don’t embrace the suggestion that overshooting full employment is necessary if we’re to get inflation up to target.	23	2
201406	3731	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Indeed, as I said, I consider this the opposite of benign.	23	2
201406	3732	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But one thing I do at this table is I watch body language, and I ask Evan Koenig behind me to always watch the body language while I speak, and I noticed that Mr.	23	2
201406	3733	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Wilcox drew up to full seated height, which when he’s seated is higher than I am when I’m standing.	23	2
201406	3734	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I may have given offense.	23	2
201406	3735	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I apologize.	23	2
201406	3736	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As you said, Madam Chair, none of us want to repeat the experience of the 1970s.	23	2
201406	3737	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I may have gone too far, and if I, watching your body language, David, if I gave you or the staff any offense with regard to that paper, I apologize.	23	2
201406	3738	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I want to make it clear that if you look at my own SEP submissions, I actually expect inflation to be a little bit above 2 percent in 2017.	23	2
201406	3739	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	My SEP forecast just had a bit of a rate overshoot, and on the unemployment side my estimate for the natural rate is 5½ percent.	23	2
201406	3740	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I don’t mind a little overshoot as long as it doesn’t become endemic, and I want to make that clear.	23	2
201406	3741	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	But I also stress in my submission the need for tightening in 2015 and 2016 to contain that overshoot.	23	2
201406	3742	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Now, I made a suggestion yesterday alongside of an inference made by President Rosengren, which obviously went nowhere, but I want to just spend a minute on that.	23	2
201406	3743	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	This goes back to the issue of low volatility, and I’m very happy that Governor Powell has stressed financial issues.	23	2
201406	3744	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’ve spoken about this very low VIX matter for quite some time, both publicly and in this forum, but the suggestion was that if the economy keeps developing in the way we see it, that a gentler form of tightening before we actually raise the base rate would be to taper down our repurchases.	23	2
201406	3745	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	The market is so complacent—for example, British interest rates are the lowest they’ve been since the 17th century.	23	2
201406	3746	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	In our case, it’s at least 50 years and perhaps longer.	23	2
201406	3747	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	All of the indicators that Governor Powell mentioned I have spoken of before, and he put a little more muscle behind it, but I do think the markets are very, very tender.	23	2
201406	3748	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’d like the Committee to consider along the lines of what I suggested, and I believe Mr Rosengren was suggesting, that it might be a gentler form of signaling to the market that as we get more confidence, we consider tapering reinvestments.	23	2
201406	3749	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I was going to say we were seeing green shoots, but I’m not going to use that terminology ever again.	23	2
201406	3750	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	We’ve disabused that before, but before we get to the full bloom of summer and liftoff—I don’t want to leave that off the table.	23	2
201406	3751	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	I’d like to keep it on the table, but I just view it against the background of financial complacency, that that might be a gentler way to tighten than actually raising the base rate until we’re fully confident.	23	2
201406	3752	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	As I said yesterday, I want to see the whites of the eyes of everything we wanted to see before we raise the base rate.	23	2
201406	3753	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3754	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3755	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201406	3756	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3757	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201406	3758	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The minimalist approach to changing the statement makes eminent sense at a time when we are providing a gradual, transparent, and predictable path to the taper program.	23	2
201406	3759	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The weakness in the real economy in the first half of this year, coupled with our “steady as she goes” taper communications strategy, successfully avoided significant increases in interest rates or increased volatility, either of which might have further disrupted the recovery.	23	2
201406	3760	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Exit strategies can be difficult to maneuver even with a less complicated set of tools.	23	2
201406	3761	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The lessons I take from the four predictable taperings to date, based in part on the positive market response, is that our experience with the gradual and predictable slowing in balance sheet increases may be instructive when we begin to reduce our balance sheet.	23	2
201406	3762	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	To be explicit, when it becomes appropriate to reduce the size of our balance sheet, we may choose to do so gradually and predictably with the actual timing and size of tapered reductions depending on how the economy evolves.	23	2
201406	3763	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the two questions that you posed, I am fine with ending the purchases as you suggest—$5 billion on a $4 trillion balance sheet is the definition of rounding error.	23	2
201406	3764	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I don’t view it as a policy statement or a policy view.	23	2
201406	3765	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it’s a technical adjustment.	23	2
201406	3766	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I don’t think it belongs in the statement.	23	2
201406	3767	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I actually think that it should be in response to a question and more seem like an offhand remark because I think that’s probably what it deserves.	23	2
201406	3768	2014-06-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3769	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Plosser.	23	2
201406	3770	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3771	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	With regard to your question, Madam Chair, I agree with the following, that the $5 billion is a trivial thing, and that if you think it needs clarifying, we should clarify it.	23	2
201406	3772	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But information is information, and I do tend to lean toward President Kocherlakota’s suggestion that we could put it in the statement, that would be my preference.	23	2
201406	3773	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t feel hugely strongly about that, but I think that would be clearer and we could avoid some potential confusion by just saying it’s a technical clarification and, if things go as we anticipate, then we expect that the last decision would be the $15 billion, and kind of leave it at that.	23	2
201406	3774	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	For today, I can support alternative B as written.	23	2
201406	3775	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The economy appears to be bouncing back from a weak first quarter and is poised to grow at least somewhat above trend over the next year to year and a half.	23	2
201406	3776	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I see no reason to deviate from our path of purchase reductions of $10 billion per meeting.	23	2
201406	3777	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But I do want to put a couple of other issues on the table that I think we need to be contemplating.	23	2
201406	3778	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I have, since we instituted it in March, expressed reservations about paragraph 6, and over time my concerns about paragraph 6 actually have increased.	23	2
201406	3779	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	As I indicated yesterday, most of the policy rules that we look at in Tealbook B, that are consistent with our past behavior indicate that we should have an earlier liftoff and a steeper path of policy than what seems to be currently conveyed by our statement language.	23	2
201406	3780	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Even if our current anticipation is that rates will rise only very gradually, we should make sure to position our communication so that we can move liftoff forward in time relative to what seems to be anticipated and move rates up more quickly if that’s necessary.	23	2
201406	3781	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Otherwise, we are not being data-dependent in any systematic way.	23	2
201406	3782	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	It may well be that we will be very close to both our inflation objective and our average long-term unemployment rate if not by year-end, then by early next year.	23	2
201406	3783	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And if that occurs, for me, maintaining a zero or negative real rate would be unduly accommodative, and I think that would pose substantial risks to the economy.	23	2
201406	3784	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Even though the language in paragraph 5 indicates that the timing of liftoff will be assessed by our progress toward our objectives, which I support, I do not see us as having offered any such adjustment in our messaging or our statement that reflects the changing conditions we’ve seen in the economy.	23	2
201406	3785	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We are closer to our objectives than we were six months ago or a year ago, but we don’t seem to have changed our language or our messaging about liftoff or about rates.	23	2
201406	3786	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I just don’t want to see us get boxed in by our language in paragraph 6.	23	2
201406	3787	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to begin working on language that will convey more of the concept of a policy reaction function, the factors that are in that reaction function, and the state-contingent nature of future policy.	23	2
201406	3788	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Paying lip service to such a reaction function while ignoring its message or signals is counterproductive.	23	2
201406	3789	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to be adjusting our communications and anticipated policy action consistent with the fact that we are indeed moving closer to our policy objectives for both inflation and unemployment.	23	2
201406	3790	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I didn’t say we were there yet.	23	2
201406	3791	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I just said we’re moving closer.	23	2
201406	3792	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I have another concern about the language in paragraph 6, and that is the lack of specificity in conveying the economic conditions that would keep policy looser for longer.	23	2
201406	3793	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The staff did introduce a 25 basis point reduction in the long-run natural rate of interest as suggested in Tealbook A, and that does imply a neutral rate that is 25 basis points lower, if you will, at the end.	23	2
201406	3794	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But that says nothing about the pace at which we approach the steady state.	23	2
201406	3795	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Our policy rules give us the shape of that liftoff, presumably, and so the policy endpoint does not tell us much about the pace at which we would raise rates, and I think that still remains a question.	23	2
201406	3796	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Looking at the infamous dot chart, as was already noted, many people lowered by 25 basis points their long-run equilibrium neutral rate, I guess.	23	2
201406	3797	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Actually the dot chart indicates there’s also a slightly steeper path than the last time.	23	2
201406	3798	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But I do think we have to be careful, as Governor Fischer suggested.	23	2
201406	3799	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Gauging changes in long-run trends is both econometrically and conceptually very difficult to do, and I think we need to do that with great caution.	23	2
201406	3800	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think that we need to not only do it with caution, but also to the extent we do it, it has to be undertaken in a very disciplined, precise way so that we’re happy with the implications of it moving forward and don’t need to reverse and go back the other way.	23	2
201406	3801	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we have to be very careful about that.	23	2
201406	3802	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	At this stage, I’m not inclined to want to let that change in the staff’s view be reflected in my views about the long-run equilibrium rate or potential growth too much at this point.	23	2
201406	3803	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	In addition, as I’ve already mentioned, I think it would be prudent to begin shrinking our balance sheet before we start raising rates.	23	2
201406	3804	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We will soon have the opportunity to do so, as I alluded to yesterday.	23	2
201406	3805	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The current reinvestment rates are pretty small, $15 billion to $20 billion, and we could do so with relatively little impact on the stance of policy.	23	2
201406	3806	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The alternative, as I suggested, if the Committee chooses not to do that, I think it could very well be prudent to reconsider our reinvestment strategy to bias our purchases in the reinvestment toward short-term Treasuries, which would also give us more flexibility with our balance sheet as we move forward.	23	2
201406	3807	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	That might be an effective strategy.	23	2
201406	3808	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Finally, the Committee has given the impression to the markets that we are unlikely to sell assets, especially MBS.	23	2
201406	3809	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m still of the view that this is not a good approach to policy or to our communications.	23	2
201406	3810	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	If the size of our balance sheet has the effects we’ve long asserted, and it’s providing accommodation as we claim, then  maintaining a large balance sheet during the exit will require us to raise rates more and higher than we otherwise would to achieve any given stance of monetary policy.	23	2
201406	3811	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	The balance sheet and interest rate policy are intertwined.	23	2
201406	3812	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	To argue otherwise undermines the credibility of our earlier messages for balance sheet policy.	23	2
201406	3813	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Why do we want to insist on an exit strategy that raises short-term rates higher and faster simply because we do not wish to sell assets?	23	2
201406	3814	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I have yet to see a careful analysis of this tradeoff and why selling wouldn’t be perhaps the preferable approach.	23	2
201406	3815	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, there could be a story in which there are differential effects on the economy of a higher future short-term rate versus the effects on term premiums or other things that people have argued about the balance sheet, but again, I haven’t seen an analysis of those challenges and the tradeoffs that are involved, and I think we need to think about that.	23	2
201406	3816	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the arguments that people have, I think, is that we wanted to make sure that we didn’t sell MBS because we were afraid about the housing market—that is, we wanted to make sure we continued our credit allocation policies toward housing.	23	2
201406	3817	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But, of course, what that means, if that’s the way this works, is that having to raise other short-term rates faster and higher in order to accomplish the not-selling of assets and the provision of credit allocation to housing, means we are imposing higher costs on other borrowers.	23	2
201406	3818	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Why is that desirable?	23	2
201406	3819	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Why do we want to pursue that policy?	23	2
201406	3820	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I have just yet to hear a coherent case that justifies that sort of action.	23	2
201406	3821	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think those are some things we need to work on and need to think about both in our language and in our statements and our policy choices as we go forward.	23	2
201406	3822	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But for today, I can support alternative B as written.	23	2
201406	3823	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I have no strong objections to President Kocherlakota’s suggestion of adding in that statement from alternative A, although I might have a small bias to sort of say let’s take a minimalist approach at this meeting.	23	2
201406	3824	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But I do think that the suggestion has some merit because it reestablishes that the Committee is not just worried about inflation being low.	23	2
201406	3825	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	We actually believe that inflation is going to get to our target.	23	2
201406	3826	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	I think there’s some merit to that.	23	2
201406	3827	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	But I’m not convinced that now is the right meeting to put that in, but I think in the future it would be worth considering.	23	2
201406	3828	2014-06-18	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3829	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3830	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201406	3831	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3832	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I have just four comments.	23	2
201406	3833	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll enumerate them here, and then expand on them.	23	2
201406	3834	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My first comment is that, in my opinion, the current policy path is not state-contingent enough.	23	2
201406	3835	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It is too driven by calendar considerations, along with our median forecast.	23	2
201406	3836	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think—echoing a little bit of what Governor Fischer said—the world is more stochastic than what we have in mind as we sit here today.	23	2
201406	3837	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk about that a little bit.	23	2
201406	3838	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I think these calendar plans are driven in part by the press conference schedule.	23	2
201406	3839	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to suggest that for something like the discussion of operating procedure, perhaps an off-schedule press conference would be more appropriate.	23	2
201406	3840	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk a little bit about that.	23	2
201406	3841	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Third, I think we also have this nagging issue of the meaning of the ending of the QE program, which you just brought up, Chair Yellen.	23	2
201406	3842	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve got $5 billion on the table in the fall.	23	2
201406	3843	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think it will be credible to say that this is a meaningful asset purchase, so I agree with you on that.	23	2
201406	3844	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll talk about that for just a minute.	23	2
201406	3845	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Then I want to get back to this issue of reinvestments.	23	2
201406	3846	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	For my comments on reinvestments, I’m going to put my dove feathers on, so you all have to get ready for that.	23	2
201406	3847	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	And I’m going to disagree with the characterization of Vice Chairman Dudley.	23	2
201406	3848	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think he is too hawkish on this issue, so I’ll give my case for that.	23	2
201406	3849	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think ending reinvestment is actually a buffer step—that’s the way I have always viewed it.	23	2
201406	3850	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a buffer step between ending QE and raising the policy rate, and I think it’s going to aid our communication, not harm our communication, so I’ll talk about that a little bit.	23	2
201406	3851	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think taking that buffer step out of the exit process is going to make for a much rockier ride as we get close to the date of policy liftoff.	23	2
201406	3852	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Let me just elaborate on these points a little bit.	23	2
201406	3853	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I think current policy is not sufficiently state-contingent.	23	2
201406	3854	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It’s too driven by calendar considerations.	23	2
201406	3855	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Some of you may recall that last year at this time Chairman Bernanke had a press conference.	23	2
201406	3856	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It was a raucous one.	23	2
201406	3857	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	He said at that press conference that unemployment would be 7 percent by June 2014, and that QE would be ended.	23	2
201406	3858	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We are amazingly far ahead of this schedule on unemployment—we’re at 6.3 percent—and far behind on policy adjustment.	23	2
201406	3859	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We haven’t brought the QE program to a close as of this point.	23	2
201406	3860	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	With most forecasts predicting rapid growth in the current quarter and through the rest of the year, we may have to consider altering plans and deviating from our preset pace.	23	2
201406	3861	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Calendar- based policy has a high risk of getting out of sync with actual economic developments.	23	2
201406	3862	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation also, in my view, is poised to head higher.	23	2
201406	3863	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We saw yesterday that, by far, the largest component of the staff inflation forecast is a constant, representing longer-term inflation expectations.	23	2
201406	3864	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think it is reasonable to interpret longer-term inflation expectations as drifting down at this juncture since, for instance, the SPF expectations of core PCE inflation remain at 2 percent, and other measures are also stable.	23	2
201406	3865	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, I think everyone should add 25 basis points to the staff forecast for inflation, which then puts inflation at target in the medium term.	23	2
201406	3866	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	That is certainly how I would interpret the forecast, and my own forecasts have inflation at target or, indeed, exceeding target in the not-too-distant future.	23	2
201406	3867	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If inflation expectations are declining, then that is a very serious issue, indeed, for the Committee, and I agree completely with President Kocherlakota on this.	23	2
201406	3868	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I have advocated this in the past, that we definitely need to defend our inflation target from below.	23	2
201406	3869	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But I’m not convinced that they are drifting down at this point.	23	2
201406	3870	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll keep an open mind about it, but I’m not convinced about it.	23	2
201406	3871	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I do not agree that if longer-term inflation expectations are drifting down that that’s a problem that can be fixed by cyclical adjustment.	23	2
201406	3872	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The way I would think about models is that you’ve got those inflation expectations more or less fixed, and that the economy is going to cycle around those expectations, and it’s going to be very hard to move away from them.	23	2
201406	3873	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Even if inflation goes above the longer-term expectations, markets would be interpreting that as a cyclical factor, not as a structural factor.	23	2
201406	3874	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It’s really very troubling for the Committee if we cannot center inflation expectations on our goal.	23	2
201406	3875	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But I—again, my view is that we are centered on our goal, and it would take more convincing to get me to move off that view in the near term.	23	2
201406	3876	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to the calendar-based plans.	23	2
201406	3877	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of our plans are based on the calendar and envision press conferences by Chair Yellen as a primary communication vehicle.	23	2
201406	3878	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I have advocated, and continue to advocate, that we design all FOMC meetings to be ex-ante identical with a press conference attached.	23	2
201406	3879	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Financial markets, in my view, seek reassurance from the Chair that they understand the Committee’s thinking on current monetary policy issues.	23	2
201406	3880	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Our current system puts a lot of pressure on particular meetings and particular press conferences.	23	2
201406	3881	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think it mixes messages about the current state of monetary policy—which is always a concern— and current interpretation of what is going on in the economy with other longer-term issues that we might want to address at that particular juncture.	23	2
201406	3882	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe, just maybe, one thing we could do is split the latter part off into a separate press conference.	23	2
201406	3883	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	You could have a separate press conference that would focus entirely on future monetary policy implementation issues and focus all the questions on that.	23	2
201406	3884	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	You could talk about the overnight reverse repo facility until you’re blue in the face without bringing in the current policy stance of the Committee and the day-to-day monetary policy issues.	23	2
201406	3885	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m just suggesting that as a possibility.	23	2
201406	3886	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	One advantage of that is you could schedule it when it was appropriate, when the Committee felt like we got to the right juncture, so I just put it on the table as a possibility.	23	2
201406	3887	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to the issue about ending QE.	23	2
201406	3888	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	As other people have remarked, it is a small issue, but it does affect the expected timeline of policy rate liftoff.	23	2
201406	3889	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciate Chair Yellen bringing this up.	23	2
201406	3890	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think buying $5 billion in assets is just not credible.	23	2
201406	3891	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It will be viewed by markets as essentially zero, and markets will say that the program is effectively over.	23	2
201406	3892	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Chair Yellen that the last step should probably be just go down to zero, and I would not put this in the policy statement.	23	2
201406	3893	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I agree that this is something that could be dealt with, as President Rosengren suggested, as sort of an offhand comment and go from there.	23	2
201406	3894	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Now, however, I do think that this reinvestment issue is a serious one for our exit strategy, so, again, I’m going to put my dove feathers on here and fly around the room a little bit.	23	2
201406	3895	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Ending reinvestment, in my view, is a buffer step between ending QE and raising the policy rate.	23	2
201406	3896	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	One of the things we have been concerned about is, as we get to the end of the QE program, all of the talk is going to be about, well, are they going to raise rates at the next meeting, and so on.	23	2
201406	3897	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	By having this buffer step, it’s an intermediate decision that the Committee could make during this period between ending QE and raising the policy rate.	23	2
201406	3898	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It would be clear that the Committee is going to have to make that decision, and would suggest that the Committee has enough confidence in the economy at that juncture to go ahead with that decision before actually getting to the rate increase.	23	2
201406	3899	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It should not have a large effect on the economy, certainly not a large macroeconomic effect according to the models that we have.	23	2
201406	3900	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Even if you think it might have a large macroeconomic effect, you could certainly manage it in an effective way, as was discussed yesterday—that is, we could stipulate that the size of the balance sheet would fall along a smooth path, or, if you wanted to do the reinvestment maybe into shorter-term Treasury securities, you could do some of that.	23	2
201406	3901	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think there are various ways to manage it.	23	2
201406	3902	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It doesn’t have to just be an abrupt decision to end reinvestment.	23	2
201406	3903	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I suggest we keep the step of ending reinvestment as a useful tool during the interim period between ending QE and raising the policy rate.	23	2
201406	3904	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My views are different from Vice Chairman Dudley’s.	23	2
201406	3905	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	He gave four reasons to move ending reinvestments back in the timeline.	23	2
201406	3906	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My interpretations are different.	23	2
201406	3907	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	First, he argued ending reinvestments would signal the beginning of tightening.	23	2
201406	3908	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Well, yes, but only in the sense that it would signal that the Committee was confident enough to move a step closer to raising the policy rate.	23	2
201406	3909	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, that’s a useful thing to be able to do, because there’s going to be a lot of pressure on the Committee about when are we going to raise the policy rate once the QE program ends.	23	2
201406	3910	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Taking the end of reinvestment off the table would mean that the immediate, concrete next step for the Committee would be to raise the policy rate.	23	2
201406	3911	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, Vice Chairman Dudley suggested that part of the idea is to get off the zero bound sooner rather than later, which I’m not so sure is my sentiment, or maybe the sentiment of the Committee.	23	2
201406	3912	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We want to get off the zero lower bound at exactly the right time, ideally.	23	2
201406	3913	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Vice Chairman Dudley also cited communications challenges, but my argument is that the end of reinvestment is a helpful and useful buffer step that the Committee can use to signal that the Committee has enough confidence to raise the policy rate in the meetings following the date of ending reinvestment.	23	2
201406	3914	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, Vice Chairman Dudley made a risk-management argument, but my view would be that we can change balance sheet policy as necessary in response to macroeconomic events.	23	2
201406	3915	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	We have done that in recent years, including our open-ended QE program.	23	2
201406	3916	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	On this dimension, I agree with President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201406	3917	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If we get into trouble on the downside, if the economy looks to be worse, or the inflation outlook looks to be worse than we expected, then I would think we would have to go back and use our balance sheet tool as we have in recent years.	23	2
201406	3918	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	But it’s not looking like that’s the way the economy is going, at least sitting here today.	23	2
201406	3919	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line on this issue:  I think it would make our job harder, and possibly much harder, if we move the ending reinvestment decision to after the policy rate decision.	23	2
201406	3920	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	For today, Madam Chair, I can support alternative B, but I think some of the issues I mentioned here do need attention in the coming meetings.	23	2
201406	3921	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think we should add the sentence suggested by President Kocherlakota at this time.	23	2
201406	3922	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	My own forecast has inflation moving higher faster and actually above target.	23	2
201406	3923	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Just as a last comment, I am not one that views the inflation target as some kind of ceiling.	23	2
201406	3924	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I do think you should hit it on average over a period of time, and maybe this is something that the Committee should have a broader discussion about.	23	2
201406	3925	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	If you hit your inflation target on average over a period of time, you are going to be much closer to price-level targeting.	23	2
201406	3926	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	It isn’t exactly price-level targeting, but it’s much closer to price-level targeting.	23	2
201406	3927	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	That’s optimal policy in the kinds of sticky price models that are informing a lot of the judgments around this Committee.	23	2
201406	3928	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m one that thinks, as long as we can hit it on average, that’s fine.	23	2
201406	3929	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Let me just end with that comment.	23	2
201406	3930	2014-06-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3931	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3932	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201406	3933	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3934	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B.	23	2
201406	3935	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the proposed statement is satisfactory as presented.	23	2
201406	3936	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Like the previous meeting, I favor a minimalist approach, the least possible drama this time around.	23	2
201406	3937	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On the question you posed, I really don’t think it’s a big deal one way or the other, but I’ll make the case for two final steps, October and December.	23	2
201406	3938	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The reason would be that putting it off until December might delay the starting of the considerable period clock in the minds of some people in the market, particularly those who are not listening and who are locked into a six- month view.	23	2
201406	3939	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think it’s a big deal, but, on balance, I would favor, as President Kocherlakota did, doing this in December.	23	2
201406	3940	2014-06-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3941	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3942	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201406	3943	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3944	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B as written, to continue the taper.	23	2
201406	3945	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I support an October concluding taper of $15 billion as you suggested, although we are not on a preset course.	23	2
201406	3946	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	23	2
201406	3947	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Stating this at the press conference is perfectly fine, in my opinion.	23	2
201406	3948	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Just to be clear, my assumption for appropriate monetary policy in my SEP submission is liftoff in the first quarter of 2016 with a shallow path of tightening thereafter, and my long-run nominal federal funds rate is at 3¾ percent.	23	2
201406	3949	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think inflation and inflation pressures remain low.	23	2
201406	3950	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think they are low for the PCE.	23	2
201406	3951	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think they are low for the CPI.	23	2
201406	3952	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think they are low around the world.	23	2
201406	3953	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	President Kocherlakota’s comments are important here.	23	2
201406	3954	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think we should vigorously support ending our below-inflation-target performance, which by some measures we have experienced since 2008 on core PCE.	23	2
201406	3955	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	My preferred policy rate liftoff is delayed until I have high confidence that one-year- ahead inflation is at least at our target, and is sustainable thereafter.	23	2
201406	3956	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	It would be very helpful to increase our discussion publicly of associated compensation growth that supports sustainable inflation at the target.	23	2
201406	3957	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	For instance, as you mentioned, Madam Chair, nominal wage growth of average productivity growth plus an inflation objective sounds right to me.	23	2
201406	3958	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s 1½ percent plus 2 percent.	23	2
201406	3959	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s 3½ percent, and we’re well under that.	23	2
201406	3960	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We have a ways to go on this front, and I think that if wages started to move up in line with that that would be associated with sustainable inflation at our objective.	23	2
201406	3961	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Without this type of steady-state wage growth, it’s difficult for me to believe that inflation is going to be at our target, at least sustainably.	23	2
201406	3962	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Let me close by highlighting a little-discussed risk that we could face.	23	2
201406	3963	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Once we begin raising rates, I think our worst dilemma will be if inflation falls and is below our inflation objective and remains below our inflation objective.	23	2
201406	3964	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We know how to deal with inflation above our target.	23	2
201406	3965	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	A premature fiat tightening, like the Bank of Japan and the ECB have done over time, will quickly ratify a return to the zero lower bound challenges that we desperately need to get away from.	23	2
201406	3966	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Our first priority should be to exit the zero lower bound organically, as quickly as possible.	23	2
201406	3967	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s too early to begin thinking we can return to a “business as usual” central banking attitude.	23	2
201406	3968	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Like I said, we know how to deal with inflation if it’s above our target.	23	2
201406	3969	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	We need to focus on goal-oriented monetary policy for our dual mandate objectives.	23	2
201406	3970	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s better to err on the side of getting away from the zero lower bound.	23	2
201406	3971	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	If we put a lot of hope on threading the needle to exit the zero lower bound, we risk falling back.	23	2
201406	3972	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	I agree with President Kocherlakota’s sentiment that we need to put more weight on getting to the inflation objective sustainably as the unemployment rate falls and with nominal compensation growth rising closer to 3½ percent.	23	2
201406	3973	2014-06-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3974	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	3975	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201406	3976	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	3977	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would like to start with an apology to Vice Chairman Dudley.	23	2
201406	3978	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Normally, when one of the major sports franchises in my District is in a championship, I reach out to my colleague in the other District to make a small wager.	23	2
201406	3979	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unfortunately, with the Stanley Cup Finals coming up, with the L.A.	23	2
201406	3980	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Kings playing the New York Rangers, I was traveling at the time, and I didn’t actually reach out to you.	23	2
201406	3981	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	By the time I came—	23	2
201406	3982	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m happy.	23	2
201406	3983	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m happy that you didn’t, in view of how it all turned out.	23	2
201406	3984	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	By the time I came home, it was already over.	23	2
201406	3985	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201406	3986	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I apologize.	23	2
201406	3987	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you for that.	23	2
201406	3988	2014-06-18	meeting	FISHER	President Lockhart and I could have had the same deal.	23	2
201406	3989	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201406	3990	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent data confirm that the first- quarter drop is an anomaly and point to the reemergence of moderate growth.	23	2
201406	3991	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, substantial labor market slack persists, and inflation remains below our longer-run target, and these circumstances call for maintaining the current course of policy.	23	2
201406	3992	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This includes a further measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, combined with forward guidance that signals a highly accommodative future path for the funds rate.	23	2
201406	3993	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The judicious wording changes in alternative B properly leave the first quarter behind while highlighting policy continuity.	23	2
201406	3994	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Madam Chair, with regard to the October ending of the asset purchases, I agree with your approach completely.	23	2
201406	3995	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think this is a governance issue.	23	2
201406	3996	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	You actually invited all of us to opine on that, and I do think putting it in the statement would potentially lead to the public misconstruing the message there.	23	2
201406	3997	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree completely with how President Rosengren put this— you really want this to be just a minor technical issue, so I agree with the approach that you have suggested on that at the press conference.	23	2
201406	3998	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do want to mention an issue looking further ahead from our policy decisions today, and obviously our main challenge is going to be managing the normalization of policy while minimizing unnecessary disruptions in financial markets.	23	2
201406	3999	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our discussions yesterday focused on the operational issues, so these are obviously very important.	23	2
201406	4000	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would like to take this opportunity to highlight an additional challenge relating to the global monetary policy environment.	23	2
201406	4001	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recently returned from visits to four foreign countries: South Korea, Japan, Germany, and Texas.	23	2
201406	4002	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201406	4003	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And my visits to Japan and Germany were just an apt reminder of the divergent paths that the major central banks of the world are taking in terms of monetary policy currently and over the next couple of years.	23	2
201406	4004	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Both the Bank of Japan and the ECB are in the early stages of sizable and prolonged expansions of monetary accommodation.	23	2
201406	4005	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view is that these steps are entirely appropriate, and I am encouraged by the signs of progress in escaping deflation in Japan.	23	2
201406	4006	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I foresee a tug of war in global financial markets as we and the Bank of England withdraw monetary accommodation at the same time that the ECB and the Bank of Japan are adding massively to accommodation.	23	2
201406	4007	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	As research on the effects of QE has shown, policy actions in one major economy spill over to the financial conditions, especially interest rates and exchange rates, in other countries.	23	2
201406	4008	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This came up in the primary dealer survey as one of the factors—the policy actions of other countries—that explain why interest rates have been coming down globally, and we know this.	23	2
201406	4009	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this divergence in the policy direction across the globe will add an additional dimension that may complicate our task of achieving the appropriate set of financial conditions supportive of our employment and price stability goals in the period ahead.	23	2
201406	4010	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, it may exacerbate carry trade, reach-for-yield, and short-term capital flows with financial-stability implications.	23	2
201406	4011	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I mention this issue not with some goal of advocating a particular policy, but, rather, to highlight this issue as one we should have on our radar screen and one we should be including and accounting for in our analysis involving future financial conditions.	23	2
201406	4012	2014-06-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4013	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4014	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201406	4015	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4016	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	I support alternative B today.	23	2
201406	4017	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	The FOMC has signaled that it would take a significant change to the outlook before it would deviate from the path of reducing asset purchases by $10 billion per meeting.	23	2
201406	4018	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	While there are risks and uncertainty, economic developments suggest our forecast remains largely intact.	23	2
201406	4019	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Growth is expected to rise over the forecast horizon with employment increasing and inflation moving gradually back to our goal.	23	2
201406	4020	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I believe we should continue on the policy path the Committee has laid out and reduce monthly purchases by another $10 billion.	23	2
201406	4021	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the ambiguity about whether our purchases will end in October or December if we keep on our tapering path, I agree with the Chair that this is really immaterial from an economic point of view.	23	2
201406	4022	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Hence, I have no strong preferences for October or December.	23	2
201406	4023	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Rather than clarify the ambiguity in the statement, which would elevate its importance, I support the Chair’s proposal to do this in the press conference, and I guess I would say if you’re confident you’re going to get the question, fine.	23	2
201406	4024	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	If you think there’s some possibility the question won’t come up, then I would just suggest doing it in your prepared remarks to clarify the ambiguity and get the issue off the table.	23	2
201406	4025	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Turning to language, I have no problem with the statement as written in alternative B.	23	2
201406	4026	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	My preference is to make minimal changes today, but with the end of purchases looming and with rate increases anticipated sometime next year, provided the economy evolves as anticipated, I believe it will very soon be time to change the guidance indicating that liftoff will be a considerable time after the asset purchases end.	23	2
201406	4027	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	My preference would be to replace this language with state-contingent language, although, given the history of the language, I understand this to be an aspirational goal.	23	2
201406	4028	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	To the extent our policy is forward looking and liftoff is tied to the outlook, perhaps examining the SEP—although I realize that may be a dirty word—either the data that we just collected or a follow-up to it, may give us more understanding of the conditions that Committee participants see at the time of liftoff.	23	2
201406	4029	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	In any case, it would seem prudent to come up with language alternatives for consideration sooner rather than later.	23	2
201406	4030	2014-06-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4031	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4032	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201406	4033	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4034	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B in terms of a further reduction in asset purchases.	23	2
201406	4035	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The labor market has shown meaningful improvement, and inflation, both realized and expected, has increased.	23	2
201406	4036	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	The current 1.6 percent year-over-year rate of inflation, along with the projection from the Survey of Professional Forecasters that it will be 1.9 percent next year, suggests that inflation dynamics are generally aligned with our 2 percent goal.	23	2
201406	4037	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	As the economy improves, I have been particularly interested in looking at the various policy prescriptions in Tealbook and to what extent they deviate from the current stance of our policy.	23	2
201406	4038	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	In particular, a footnote in Tealbook B, noted that those deviations have persisted even as the intercepts in the policy rules have been adjusted to reflect the Board staff’s downward revisions to the long-run real fed funds rate.	23	2
201406	4039	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	I also noted that the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* is also now 35 basis points above the actual real fed funds rate, which is the widest, most accommodative spread since the end of the crisis.	23	2
201406	4040	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	These rules suggest to me that we may need to consider preparing markets for liftoff possibly earlier than currently expected in order to be most consistent with a data-dependent policy and to minimize potential adverse effects of a reach for yield, as highlighted by Governor Powell.	23	2
201406	4041	2014-06-18	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding communication about the end of asset purchases, I support the $15 billion in October and that you use the press conference as an opportunity to communicate that, and I assume our minutes would, of course, reflect that.	23	2
201406	4042	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201406	4043	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201406	4044	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4045	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I support alternative B.	23	2
201406	4046	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I support reducing purchases $15 billion in October.	23	2
201406	4047	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d suggest we put it in the minutes and you respond to a question about it by being forthcoming.	23	2
201406	4048	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d suggest that you don’t put it in the prepared statement.	23	2
201406	4049	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	It’s a little ambiguous what it means for the Chair to put a policy pronouncement in the prepared statement that isn’t in the Committee statement.	23	2
201406	4050	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think we had trouble with that last June.	23	2
201406	4051	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I guess more broadly, an observation on some of the earlier discussion today, by Governor Powell and others.	23	2
201406	4052	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I take it for granted that our first policy signals are going to generate an increase in volatility.	23	2
201406	4053	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	To me it’s not obvious that, per se, that would be a problem we need to solve.	23	2
201406	4054	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I think we should expect the normal market reaction to be an increase in volatility.	23	2
201406	4055	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	I can picture increases in volatility that we would view as problematic, as symptoms of miscommunication or of us adding more unintended uncertainty about the future, but I can also picture volatility going up in ways that we ought to expect and sort of welcome.	23	2
201406	4056	2014-06-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4057	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4058	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201406	4059	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4060	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B.	23	2
201406	4061	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I also support your proposal about the press conference.	23	2
201406	4062	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	It may be the only major news of the day, because this time there’s not any suspense about whether we should continue with the program.	23	2
201406	4063	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	The advice you’ve received to treat it in a very matter-of-fact way seems to me to be about right.	23	2
201406	4064	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’d just like to pick up, in addition to that, on something that President Plosser said looking at paragraph 6 of alternative B.	23	2
201406	4065	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think that, President Plosser, if you go to the last sentence that you object to, there are two ways of looking at it, and there’s an ambiguity about what is normal in the longer run.	23	2
201406	4066	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	If you took the “-er” off “longer,” then the statement would be “normal in the long run,” then it’s pretty straightforward that that will be the case.	23	2
201406	4067	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know what “normal” is for a longer time path, and it just seems ambiguous.	23	2
201406	4068	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Alternatively, for when we do this next time, we could just say economic—“near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions are likely to warrant a gradual approach to the long-run target federal funds rate.”	23	2
201406	4069	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I think those would both deal with that, if we want to do it, whenever.	23	2
201406	4070	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4071	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4072	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201406	4073	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4074	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B as written; I am fine with your proposed way of handling the last chunk of the taper.	23	2
201406	4075	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I do think President Lockhart makes an important point.	23	2
201406	4076	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	I’m not sure how much can be done about it though, which is that a lot of the world out there is even less state-contingent than we are and they are driven by the calendar, and for a lot of people, the last chunk of tapering will flip a switch that’s more or less six, seven, or eight months.	23	2
201406	4077	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Although we can all, I hope, confirm that nothing is on a preset path, I think we probably should expect that there is going to be a little bit of reaction there.	23	2
201406	4078	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s sensible to handle it as you proposed, and I agree with Eric, John, and Richard that it actually would not be a good idea to have it in the statement because that would elevate it too much.	23	2
201406	4079	2014-06-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4080	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4081	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201406	4082	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4083	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B as written, and I’m very comfortable with your approach on October, of saying that we will cut $15 billion in October and handling it as a question or in the minutes.	23	2
201406	4084	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In a sense, the normalization process effectively began one year ago at this meeting when the Committee first officially socialized with the public the idea that quantitative easing might not go on forever, resulting in the well-known taper tantrum.	23	2
201406	4085	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	This is the first normalization cycle in 10 years, I think, and if I counted correctly, it’s the eighth one of my adult life, but it’s the first one I will have experienced inside these walls.	23	2
201406	4086	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I’ve been thinking about ways to learn more about the process and different ways to think about it.	23	2
201406	4087	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	For me, the starting point is the Tealbook baseline, which represents for me an acceptable modal outlook and a policy framework that brings the economy to full employment and our inflation objective in a reasonable period of time; in the case of inflation, not as fast as desired.	23	2
201406	4088	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Beyond that, it also seems to me useful to learn from the taper, as President Rosengren suggested and others, too, I think, and also to understand how past Committees have approached the problem and think further, in addition, about the risks to the forecast and the loss function you might apply to those risks if realized.	23	2
201406	4089	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	As a result of all that, working with the Board staff, I’ve started to look at earlier tightening cycles to see what light they might shed, and market participants and commentators are out there doing exactly the same thing.	23	2
201406	4090	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	For example, I met with Board staff and also with a hedge fund a couple of weeks ago that had looked at the previous seven policy normalization cycles and found a clear pattern under which the increase in long-term rates in a tightening cycle has increasingly taken place before the FOMC’s first actual rate hike, which I think sheds some light and helps make some sense on last summer’s taper tantrum.	23	2
201406	4091	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	It also makes the long-end rally of the first half of this year look even more oddly timed, and maybe I’ll take this opportunity to comment on President Lacker’s comment.	23	2
201406	4092	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I fully agree that it would be healthy to see a return to higher levels of volatility and higher rates, too, for that matter.	23	2
201406	4093	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Some of you may also have seen the Goldman piece of last week, which looked at the prior three tightening cycles that began in 1994, 1999, and 2004, and I went through those cycles with the help of Board staff with this piece in mind.	23	2
201406	4094	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In both 1994 and 2004, the Committee’s first rate increase happened at a time when headline unemployment was about ½ percentage point above the staff’s contemporaneous estimate of the natural rate.	23	2
201406	4095	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	In today’s forecast, that fits pretty well.	23	2
201406	4096	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	That would suggest liftoff around the time of this meeting next year, which is in line with the baseline forecast of Q2.	23	2
201406	4097	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I know this analysis is based on two data points.	23	2
201406	4098	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Interestingly to me, in 1999, the Committee didn’t tighten until unemployment was nearly a full percentage point below the staff’s estimate of the natural rate.	23	2
201406	4099	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The special circumstances then, as we all know, I suspect, were persistent low inflation of below 1½ percent for both core and headline PCE associated with the well-known IT-driven productivity gains.	23	2
201406	4100	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	And there are obvious special circumstances here today: Inflation is unusually low and it’s further below target than in any of these prior tightening cycles and expected to remain so; and there’s also the general specialness of this era in which a damaged economy is slowly repairing itself.	23	2
201406	4101	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	But these are already baked into our forecast, and our policy rate path is now in line with the optimal control simulations and more accommodative than all of the simple policy rules in Tealbook B, except nominal income targeting.	23	2
201406	4102	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	There’s no obvious message in this for me about liftoff.	23	2
201406	4103	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Others may see that differently.	23	2
201406	4104	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	The bigger question is probably the risks to the modal forecast and the weights one puts on those risks.	23	2
201406	4105	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I do see a risk of a lower inflation path, as I mentioned earlier.	23	2
201406	4106	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I also see a risk to the economy from financial conditions.	23	2
201406	4107	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I guess the relative importance of those risks will depend for me on future developments.	23	2
201406	4108	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I see this as the early stages of an interesting exercise.	23	2
201406	4109	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	I invite comments outside the bounds of this meeting from anyone interested, and I’ve actually suggested it to folks as perhaps an interesting subject for a presentation at some point.	23	2
201406	4110	2014-06-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4111	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4112	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201406	4113	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4114	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23	2
201406	4115	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I think there’s a virtue in confirming market expectations of continuity in the policy stance at this juncture, given recent data.	23	2
201406	4116	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I have to say I’m very sympathetic to the risks that were highlighted by President Kocherlakota, having seen them over a period of time in Japan and having alerted my European friends that I thought their policy stance was flirting with dangerously low inflation and causing quite a bit of consternation, but those concerns remain.	23	2
201406	4117	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I would be comfortable with the proposed addition of the language in paragraph 2, but I don’t feel strongly about that.	23	2
201406	4118	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the October termination, I think obviously there is a virtue to clarifying at some juncture.	23	2
201406	4119	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m perfectly comfortable with October.	23	2
201406	4120	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I would be comfortable with the second date as well.	23	2
201406	4121	2014-06-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I do believe that given the continuity represented in alternative B this will be viewed as news, and there will be some importance attached to it that perhaps you don’t intend.	23	2
201406	4122	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201406	4123	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4124	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201406	4125	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I take President Kocherlakota’s point, but I think making that change in the language at this meeting at a time when inflation looks like it’s actually creeping up, I think people would just have trouble trying to understand what the motivation was for that statement change.	23	2
201406	4126	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I support the Chair’s proposal in terms of the press conference and the $15 billion taper in October.	23	2
201406	4127	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t want it in the statement, and I don’t want it in the press conference statement.	23	2
201406	4128	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you want to do it in a low-key way, and if it doesn’t come up—and I’ll be shocked if it doesn’t—it will come up in the minutes, and that will be a fine way to dispose of it.	23	2
201406	4129	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also have some thoughts about the Taylor rule formulations in Tealbook B.	23	2
201406	4130	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Not surprisingly, all of them show liftoff occurring either immediately or before year-end.	23	2
201406	4131	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think these rules are a very poor guide to policy right now.	23	2
201406	4132	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	These Taylor rules use as their intercept the long-run equilibrium real rate, which has been lowered to 1¾ percent in their latest formulation.	23	2
201406	4133	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think they should be using the short-run equilibrium rate, which is likely to be considerably lower.	23	2
201406	4134	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Why should the short-term equilibrium rate be lower?	23	2
201406	4135	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Lower because we can identify significant headwinds that almost certainly have lowered the equilibrium real rate.	23	2
201406	4136	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This is evident in the sluggish recovery, for example, that we have seen in the housing sector.	23	2
201406	4137	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Also lower, though, because of the counterfactual.	23	2
201406	4138	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If policy were as easy as implied by the current level of real short-term rates relative to the 1¾ percent long-run equilibrium real rate, then the economy should be growing much faster than the trajectory we’ve actually been on.	23	2
201406	4139	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue worth considering with respect to these Taylor rule calculations, if the unemployment rate is artificially or temporarily depressed because of a drop in the participation rate, and if the Taylor rule’s measure of the output gap is based on the unemployment rate, which seems to be the way the staff does it, then it would seem that the Taylor rule formulations understate the output gap because they’re taking on board fully the drop in the unemployment rate, which has been driven in part by the participation rate.	23	2
201406	4140	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s another issue, I think.	23	2
201406	4141	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The bottom line for me is, I think I’ve said this over and over again, but I’m going to say it one more time.	23	2
201406	4142	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Be careful not to let these Taylor rule calculations influence your assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.	23	2
201406	4143	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, we’re obviously not doing that because the Committee supports alternative B and it’s not following the Taylor rule formulation, but I do think these rules are a bit misleading in the current set of circumstances.	23	2
201406	4144	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, let me just talk very, very briefly on reinvestment.	23	2
201406	4145	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not going to go through all the arguments I made yesterday, but just state two things.	23	2
201406	4146	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	One, the reason why I want to end reinvestment after rather than before liftoff is very simple.	23	2
201406	4147	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Our priority should be to get off the zero lower bound as soon as possible, consistent with the dual-mandate objectives.	23	2
201406	4148	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true that, on a model-based basis, ending reinvestment first wouldn’t supposedly do anything to short- and long-term rates, or be very minor, we did an experiment last summer that was supposedly very similar, in terms of the taper tantrum, and we saw not only a very large rise in long-term rates, but we also saw a very significant change in the path of short-term rate expectations.	23	2
201406	4149	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think you can model these things.	23	2
201406	4150	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you just see how markets can sometimes react in a very violent way, and so I don’t want to take that risk because if we were to experience that sort of event, we might not be able to get off the zero lower bound as soon as we would if we reversed the order and did the reinvestment later.	23	2
201406	4151	2014-06-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201406	4152	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201406	4153	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you all for your input on the issue of how to handle October or December.	23	2
201406	4154	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	As we went around, I think the vast majority of you preferred October and to have me do this in the press conference if it comes up.	23	2
201406	4155	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear some interest in putting it in the statement, but as I understood it, you were willing to go along with the press conference.	23	2
201406	4156	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I do agree that there could be some reaction to this, and I will do my very best to minimize it, but I don’t want to downplay the potential for some reaction.	23	2
201406	4157	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	It’s because I expect that that I don’t want to see it in the statement, but I think that’s real.	23	2
201406	4158	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to alternative B, there were a couple of proposals for changes, but I think overwhelmingly in the go-round, what I heard was support to basically leave alternative B as it is with minimal red ink today.	23	2
201406	4159	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I would propose and put that forward at this point for a vote.	23	2
201406	4160	2014-06-18	meeting	LUECKE	The vote will cover alternative B as described on pages 6 and 7 of Bill English’s handout and directive B on page 12 of the handout.	23	2
201406	4161	2014-06-18	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Fisher Yes President Kocherlakota Yes President Mester Yes President Plosser Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes .	23	2
201406	4162	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	I guess that’s good.	1	1
201406	4163	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	What do I have to tell you?	1	1
201406	4164	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Two things.	1	1
201406	4165	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	There are boxed lunches for those of you who would like to have them or are going to take off.	1	1
201406	4166	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who are gluttons for punishment, you can watch the press conference in the special study.	1	1
201406	4167	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	The date for the next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, July 29 and 30.	1	1
201406	4168	2014-06-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, congratulations on your highest majority yet.	1	1
201406	4169	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	True, true.	1	1
201406	4170	2014-06-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
