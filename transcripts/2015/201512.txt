201512	0	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everybody.	5	5
201512	1	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	As everyone knows, we had a farewell lunch for President Kocherlakota at our October meeting, and Narayana recused himself from FOMC business after that.	5	5
201512	2	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I will also note that Neel Kashkari has been selected as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis effective January 1, and he will be attending the January FOMC meeting.	5	5
201512	3	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Attending on behalf of Minneapolis today is First Vice President Jim Lyon.	5	5
201512	4	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Jim has also represented Minneapolis at the FOMC in September 2009, and I know he has attended many FOMC meetings.	5	5
201512	5	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to welcome you, Jim, back to the table.	5	5
201512	6	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thank you.	5	5
201512	7	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	5	5
201512	8	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Now, let me say, this entire meeting, as has been the case for a few meetings, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	5	5
201512	9	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So we need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201512	10	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201512	11	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201512	12	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	5	5
201512	13	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s ask Simon to start things off with the Desk report.	61	6
201512	14	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201512	15	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Since the Committee met in October, expectations that liftoff will occur at this meeting have increased substantially, while the expected slope of the target rate thereafter is little changed.	61	6
201512	16	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As liftoff expectations grew earlier in the period, broader asset prices were relatively range bound.	61	6
201512	17	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	However, late in the period, sharp commodity price declines weighed on risk sentiment.	61	6
201512	18	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	On net, domestic financial conditions tightened over the period.	61	6
201512	19	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, over the period the market- implied probability of liftoff at this meeting increased markedly, driven by the October FOMC statement and the better-than-expected October employment report.	61	6
201512	20	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Adjusting for year-end effects in the January federal funds futures contract, we estimate a market-implied probability of roughly 90 percent.	61	6
201512	21	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The average probability of liftoff at this meeting, according to the Desk’s most recent dealer and buy-side surveys, is also around 90 percent.	61	6
201512	22	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	And all but one of the 51 respondents view this meeting as the most likely time of liftoff.	61	6
201512	23	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Amid the buildup in expectations regarding liftoff, there was a parallel shift up in the market-implied policy rate path, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201512	24	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The market- implied path continues to be shallow by historical standards at the initiation of tightening phases, rising by about 50 basis points per year in 2016 and 2017.	61	6
201512	25	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	According to the Desk’s surveys, the average expected pace of tightening in the first two years after liftoff, conditional on not returning to the effective lower bound, declined slightly, as shown in the middle-left panel, continuing the trend observed since we first asked about this in September 2014.	61	6
201512	26	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	On average, survey respondents now expect the target rate to increase 80 basis points in the first year after liftoff and 95 basis points in the second year.	61	6
201512	27	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Market rates over the next two years are still somewhat below the mean expectations of the target rate in the Desk’s surveys, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201512	28	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	These mean expectations are derived from survey questions eliciting probability distributions for year-end rates.	61	6
201512	29	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Importantly, the answers include assessments of the likelihood of returning to the zero bound.	61	6
201512	30	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The dots in the panel show individual respondents’ expectations for the year-end target federal funds rate in 2016 and 2017, with the dots scaled by the proportion of respondents expecting each rate level and shaded by how likely they view a return to the effective lower bound; darker shades indicate a lower probability of returning to the effective lower bound.	61	6
201512	31	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, the gap between market rates (the red diamonds) and the average survey expectations (the blue dashed lines) is slight for 2016 but becomes larger in 2017, and respondents that place high weight on a return to the zero lower bound have lower mean rate expectations.	61	6
201512	32	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The medians of the survey respondents’ modal expectations regarding the federal funds rate remain slightly below the median of the SEP dots published in September.	61	6
201512	33	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Desk survey respondents generally expect a decline in the median 2017 and 2018 dots and in the median projection of the longer-run rate at this meeting.	61	6
201512	34	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In written commentary, they highlighted persistent downward pressures on global growth and recent Federal Reserve communications on the neutral federal funds rate as underpinning these expectations.	61	6
201512	35	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss the path of policy and market expectations more in his briefing.	61	6
201512	36	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Shifting to broader markets, expectations for liftoff to come at this meeting appeared to be taken largely in stride, particularly over the time period in early November during which these expectations increased to high levels.	61	6
201512	37	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In November, domestic equity price indices and credit spreads were relatively little changed, and, as shown in the bottom-left panel, option-implied volatility across asset classes remained subdued.	61	6
201512	38	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	However, sharp declines in oil prices late in the intermeeting period appear to have had knock-on effects throughout global financial markets.	61	6
201512	39	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	These declines in oil prices are shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201512	40	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Over the period, the price of front-month Brent crude dropped by about 20 percent.	61	6
201512	41	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Broader commodity prices also declined notably over the period, with the Bloomberg Industrial Metals Index falling by roughly 10 percent.	61	6
201512	42	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	While contacts largely attribute the decline in oil prices to persistent oversupply—especially following the most recent OPEC meeting—broad-based weakness in commodity prices likely in part reflects ongoing concerns about global growth.	61	6
201512	43	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The commodity price declines had adverse effects on high-yield corporate credit markets, as reflected in the widening in high-yield spreads shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61	6
201512	44	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The widening was most pronounced in energy credits (the dark blue line), with spreads, on average, up 200 basis points over the period.	61	6
201512	45	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	However, there was also a more broad-based selloff, with high-yield spreads ex energy widening by 80 basis points.	61	6
201512	46	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As part of this, US high-yield mutual funds and ETFs saw outflows of $4.5 billion for the week ending December 9, up from an average outflow of about $1 billion over the prior month.	61	6
201512	47	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	And as was widely publicized last week, one open-ended high-yield mutual fund that had invested in lower-quality corporate bonds gated investors amid persistent redemption requests.	61	6
201512	48	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Commodity price declines also continued to serve as a headwind to inflation compensation and emerging market asset prices.	61	6
201512	49	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Five-year and five-year, five-year- forward inflation compensation was little changed on net and remains well below historical averages and the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective, as shown in the top- right panel.	61	6
201512	50	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index declined by 3 percent, and the MSCI Emerging Market Equity Index fell by over 10 percent.	61	6
201512	51	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The onshore and offshore renminbi depreciated against the US dollar, as shown in the middle-left panel, taking the renminbi to levels weaker against the dollar than those seen following the devaluation in August.	61	6
201512	52	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, the basis between the onshore and offshore renminbi widened in recent weeks, as shown in grey in this panel, likely reflecting a reduced desire by Chinese officials to intervene in the wake of the announcement of the renminbi’s inclusion in the SDR basket and ahead of FOMC liftoff.	61	6
201512	53	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	China’s leadership repeatedly stressed the strength of the renminbi on a trade- weighted basis, and many expect that in the future they will measure the renminbi against a basket of currencies rather than considering only the U.S dollar.	61	6
201512	54	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	More broadly, while dollar strength was most pronounced against commodity- linked currencies, the dollar appreciated modestly against the currencies of all major US trading partners over the period, as shown in the dark blue lines in the middle- right panel.	61	6
201512	55	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index increased by about 1 percent, pushing year-to-date gains to nearly 8 percent.	61	6
201512	56	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The ongoing theme of monetary policy divergence, particularly between the Federal Reserve and other major central banks, such as the ECB, continued to serve as a tailwind to US dollar strength.	61	6
201512	57	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	While on net the euro-to-dollar exchange rate was little changed on the period, the euro did touch its weakest level against the dollar since March, as expectations of Fed and ECB policy diverged starkly.	61	6
201512	58	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This divergence can be seen in the spread between US and German two-year nominal yields, shown in the bottom-left panel, which reached year-to-date highs just ahead of the December ECB meeting.	61	6
201512	59	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	At that meeting, the ECB announced an array of additional easing measures, including a 10 basis point cut to its deposit facility rate to negative 30 basis points, an extension of its asset purchases by at least six months, and an expansion of its public- sector purchase program to include reinvestments and local and regional bonds.	61	6
201512	60	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Nevertheless, market expectations for the extent of ECB easing had become quite lofty ahead of the meeting, and the announcement led to an abrupt tightening of euro- area financial conditions, including a sharp increase in euro-area sovereign yields.	61	6
201512	61	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Interestingly, a substantial portion of the rise in these yields passed through into Treasury yields, particularly at the long end of the curve, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201512	62	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This highlights, as did the taper tantrum, the correlation in global term premiums and financial conditions more broadly.	61	6
201512	63	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As I noted earlier, the move to an almost fully priced-in increase for the federal funds target range appeared to be taken largely in stride during November, but this occurred with no reevaluation of the path of policy.	61	6
201512	64	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As is clear from both the taper tantrum and the recent experience of the ECB, markets can be very sensitive to changes in policy or communications—at times, it appears, for no good reason.	61	6
201512	65	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Thus, there is still likely event risk surrounding the announcement of the Committee’s decision tomorrow, particularly given the turbulence in markets in the past few days, although the major surprise to markets would be no change in the target range.	61	6
201512	66	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin on exhibit 3 and provide a review of money markets, market functioning, and Desk operations.	61	6
201512	67	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, the staff continued testing the Federal Reserve’s policy normalization tools, with the overnight RRP operations continuing to provide a soft floor under short-term interest rates, including around month-ends.	61	6
201512	68	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, outside month-end, the effective federal funds rate printed between 12 and 14 basis points.	61	6
201512	69	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury bill and repo rates fluctuated more notably amid the shifts in bill supply following the suspension of the debt ceiling.	61	6
201512	70	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, overnight RRP take-up averaged $105 billion over the period, increasing on month-ends.	61	6
201512	71	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	And as shown in grey, Federal Reserve reverse repurchases with foreign official institutions, otherwise known as the foreign RP pool, hit record levels of over $200 billion early in the period.	61	6
201512	72	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Usage of both operations continued to be sensitive to the level of market rates.	61	6
201512	73	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see, usage declined later in the period, reflecting the impact of higher Treasury bill rates.	61	6
201512	74	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, the Desk announced plans to offer a total of $300 billion in three term RRP operations crossing year-end.	61	6
201512	75	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	We will provide an update on the intended plans for these operations at the end of the FOMC meeting tomorrow, as the details will depend upon the Committee’s policy decision.	61	6
201512	76	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As Simon noted, this intermeeting period saw a significant increase in the likelihood market participants place on liftoff occurring at this meeting.	61	6
201512	77	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The middle- left panel shows expectations for the levels of three overnight interest rates following liftoff, as implied by financial market contracts and the Desk’s surveys.	61	6
201512	78	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	We calculated the market-implied post-liftoff levels of the effective federal funds rate and GCF repo rate using futures contracts adjusted for expected year-end movements, assuming that the median probability assigned to December liftoff from the Desk’s surveys of 90 percent is currently priced in.	61	6
201512	79	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the point estimates represented by the blue dots, we calculated a range for implied post-liftoff levels based on different assumptions about the perceived probability of liftoff, shown in the light blue shaded area.	61	6
201512	80	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see, the market- and survey-based measures for the effective federal funds, GCF, and triparty repo rates suggest that these overnight rates are expected to shift up by around 20 basis points from their current levels, to within the target range of 25 to 50 basis points that market participants expect to prevail after liftoff.	61	6
201512	81	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	These rates are also expected to retain their current configuration, with the effective federal funds rate below the interdealer GCF repo rate and slightly above the triparty repo rate.	61	6
201512	82	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	However, it appears that the pass-through of the increase in the target range to market rates is expected to be slightly less than one for one, in part due to expectations that the ON RRP offering rate following liftoff will increase by only 20 basis points relative to an increase of 25 basis points in the target range.	61	6
201512	83	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As I noted, when calculating the overnight rates implied by futures contracts, we assumed that year-end conditions would be similar to what we have seen during the past few quarter-ends.	61	6
201512	84	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	While market participants expect some volatility in money markets related to year-end, we have no reason to expect that conditions will be materially worse than in recent year-end periods.	61	6
201512	85	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, respondents to the Desk’s surveys continue to broadly expect ample capacity, or headroom, in overnight RRP operations following liftoff, either through an elevated or suspended aggregate cap.	61	6
201512	86	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	This is reflected in the white boxes, shown in the panel, which are calculated based on expectations for the difference between overnight RRP capacity and demand.	61	6
201512	87	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The expectation of ample capacity has likely contributed to confidence in the Federal Reserve’s ability to control short-term interest rates following liftoff and around the year-end.	61	6
201512	88	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	While we don’t have reason to expect major dislocations associated with liftoff around year-end, I’d like to highlight some developments across markets that contacts have noted as potentially pointing to important structural changes in financial intermediation.	61	6
201512	89	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that at prior meetings, we have updated the Committee on the widening in spreads within the Treasury repo market.	61	6
201512	90	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	This has resulted from dealers with large, stable repo funding bases requiring increased compensation to intermediate between money funds in the triparty repo market and the smaller, less creditworthy dealers that seek to borrow in the interdealer, or GCF, market.	61	6
201512	91	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the spread between the volume-weighted average rates in the interdealer segment and the broader triparty market has widened.	61	6
201512	92	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	This spread, which averaged only a couple of basis points during 2013, has widened to over 10 basis points and has spiked as much as 30 basis points on quarter-ends.	61	6
201512	93	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The widening in this spread has had a direct impact on the cost of intermediation in the Treasury repo market.	61	6
201512	94	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	It has also been noted as having more indirect impacts in other markets.	61	6
201512	95	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As illustrated in the bottom-right panel, the US interest rate swap spread—the difference between the LIBOR-based swap rate and corresponding Treasury yield, shown for the five-year tenor in the dark blue line—has narrowed over recent months and is now negative at maturities of five years and beyond.	61	6
201512	96	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In theory, swap rates should be higher than Treasury yields of equivalent maturity because they reference three-month LIBOR, which has credit risk.	61	6
201512	97	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The moves in swap spreads have been associated with developments that suggest they may be temporary.	61	6
201512	98	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	For example, the narrowing coincided with increased foreign-reserve manager sales of US Treasury securities—sales that should put upward pressure on Treasury yields—and elevated realized and expected corporate bond issuance, which should put downward pressure on swap rates.	61	6
201512	99	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	An additional factor cited that may suggest a more persistent shift in these spreads, however, has been an increase in the cost of financing Treasury securities, something that is necessary for speculative arbitrage that would serve to restore a positive swap spread.	61	6
201512	100	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The increase in financing costs is reflected in the recent inversion in the spread between the three-month LIBOR rate and the equivalent-maturity Treasury GC repo rate, also shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201512	101	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	This inversion has been driven primarily by the increase in the term GC repo rate, consistent with the rise in the repo market spreads I noted a moment ago in panel 17.	61	6
201512	102	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In the most recent Desk surveys, respondents were asked to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the recent narrowing in swap spreads.	61	6
201512	103	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As summarized in the top-left panel of your fourth exhibit, respondents assigned the highest rating to “increased balance sheet cost for cash products,” with 42 of 50 respondents assigning their highest rating to this factor.	61	6
201512	104	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Some pricing anomalies have also emerged in foreign exchange swap basis spreads.	61	6
201512	105	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Over recent months, we have seen the spreads across a number of currencies widen, as shown in the top-right panel, suggesting a higher cost of borrowing dollars offshore after hedging the corresponding foreign exchange risk.	61	6
201512	106	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The widening does not seem to reflect current funding stress in offshore funding markets, and has instead been attributed to increased demand for US dollars via the FX swap market as a byproduct of monetary policy divergence, as well as increased demand for dollar funding over year-end.	61	6
201512	107	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	This widening would normally be arbitraged away by banks that would lend at a high premium via the FX swap market.	61	6
201512	108	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	However, contacts have suggested that the elevated cost of expanding their balance sheets to do so has deterred banks from engaging in this activity, particularly ahead of year-end.	61	6
201512	109	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	To summarize, the market dynamics I described in Treasury repo and interest rate and FX swaps appear to be, at least in part, a byproduct of the increased costs financial institutions face when expanding their balance sheets to intermediate certain market activity.	61	6
201512	110	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The resulting shifts in market rates and spreads could have implications for the monetary policy transmission process.	61	6
201512	111	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The next few panels focus on reinvestments.	61	6
201512	112	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As the perceived likelihood of liftoff occurring at this meeting has risen, market participants have also been focused on other parts of the normalization process, including the reinvestments of principal payments on Treasury securities and agency MBS.	61	6
201512	113	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the median respondent to the Desk’s surveys now expects the FOMC will cease some or all reinvestments of Treasury securities and agency MBS approximately 12 months following liftoff, roughly 3 months later than was expected in October and 6 months later than was expected one year ago.	61	6
201512	114	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In explaining the changes to their expectations, respondents focused on recent FOMC communications on conditions surrounding the end of reinvestment policy specifically and the gradual path of normalization more generally.	61	6
201512	115	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, conditional on reinvestments being phased out over time, the median respondent expects this to occur over a one-year period following a change in the reinvestment policy, suggesting that a full cessation of reinvestments would not be expected to occur until roughly two years following liftoff.	61	6
201512	116	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, I should note that in light of the large volume of Treasury maturities scheduled in early 2016, the Desk has fielded an increasing number of inquiries on the mechanics of the Treasury reinvestment policy.	61	6
201512	117	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As we discussed in June, and as reflected in the June minutes, the Desk will continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities at auction.	61	6
201512	118	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	As summarized in the bottom-left panel, this is accomplished by placing bids for the SOMA at Treasury auctions equal in par amount to the value of holdings maturing on the issue date of the securities being auctioned.	61	6
201512	119	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The bids are allocated proportionally across those securities being auctioned based on the announced offering amounts.	61	6
201512	120	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	SOMA holdings are currently limited to 70 percent of the total outstanding amount of any one Treasury security.	61	6
201512	121	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk observes this when rolling over maturing securities.	61	6
201512	122	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In order to provide additional clarity on this question to the public in advance of upcoming maturing of Treasury securities, the Desk plans to publish FAQs to the public website shortly after this meeting that will outline the details of the Treasury securities reinvestment policy.	61	6
201512	123	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	We have copies of these FAQs if you would like to review them.	61	6
201512	124	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Before I turn the briefing back over to Simon for updates on some longer-term issues, we’ll be happy to take questions.	61	6
201512	125	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions for Lorie or Simon?	62	6
201512	126	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201512	127	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201512	128	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to go back to exhibit 1, figure 1.	62	6
201512	129	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	This shows market-implied probability of a rate hike at or before the December FOMC meeting.	62	6
201512	130	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I am concerned about a little bit of revisionist history here.	62	6
201512	131	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I am looking before the September FOMC meeting, and this survey is showing a probability of 90 percent that the Committee would lift off.	62	6
201512	132	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	My recollection of that period is that market-implied probabilities were only about 30 percent going into the—	62	6
201512	133	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	For the September meeting, this shows the probability of liftoff at or before the December meeting.	62	6
201512	134	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We are trying to capture the probability of liftoff in 2015 in this chart.	62	6
201512	135	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The probability of liftoff in 2015, not at a particular meeting?	62	6
201512	136	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	It is at or before the December FOMC meeting.	62	6
201512	137	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now I’ve got it, sorry.	62	6
201512	138	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201512	139	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Then I want to go to exhibit 4, figure 21, “Expected Timing of End to Some or All Reinvestments Relative to Liftoff.”	62	6
201512	140	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve got some dots here at zero.	62	6
201512	141	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Does that mean somebody in the market is saying that we are going to lift off and cease reinvestments at this meeting?	62	6
201512	142	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	That is the one respondent who doesn’t think there will be liftoff.	62	6
201512	143	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	That respondent thinks that you will cease reinvestments at this meeting and lift off in April.	62	6
201512	144	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	None of the traders who work at that firm believe that’s true.	62	6
201512	145	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201512	146	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, it kind of makes me wonder about some of the other dots.	62	6
201512	147	2015-12-16	meeting		[Laughter]	62	6
201512	148	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This person has been more accurate than other people over the last three or four years, as he’s had a view very contrary to what the market and the consensus was, and that was a good place to be.	62	6
201512	149	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	My guess would be that he probably is going to be wrong this time.	62	6
201512	150	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201512	151	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201512	152	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62	6
201512	153	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201512	154	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201512	155	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, Simon, why don’t you proceed.	62	6
201512	156	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	I thought it would be useful to update the Committee on several other issues.	61	6
201512	157	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As noted in the revised notification for the year-end term RRP operations, the September 30 two-day term RRP operation was not authorized under the March term RRP testing resolution, as the resolution had only authorized conducting term RRP operations through September 29.	61	6
201512	158	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	There are multiple layers of review for open market operations that all missed this issue, and it was discovered only in the review process for the December term operations.	61	6
201512	159	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We are continuing to assess what adjustments to the control environment could be effective in preventing this type of occurrence in the future and how we can better routinize the detection process, particularly prior to the ratification of open market operations at FOMC meetings.	61	6
201512	160	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The public announcement of the September 30 term RRP operation did cite the testing resolution, and in the 2015 annual report on domestic operations we will note the deviation.	61	6
201512	161	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The revised data collection for FR 2420 has been proceeding smoothly.	61	6
201512	162	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As can be seen in the first panel of exhibit 5, the volumes collected for the federal funds market have increased, and the staff is confident that the data we are receiving is of sufficient quality to execute on the plan to change the underlying data source for the publication of the effective federal funds rate to the FR 2420.	61	6
201512	163	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The switchover is planned to occur at the start of March, and at that time we would also adjust the calculation method to the volume-weighted median from the volume-weighted mean.	61	6
201512	164	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In addition, we are now collecting a very large volume of Eurodollar transactions and plan to also start publishing the overnight bank funding rate, or OBFR.	61	6
201512	165	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows a comparison of the effective federal funds rate and OBFR from the revised data collection, with those rates calculated using the brokered data.	61	6
201512	166	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	These differences are small.	61	6
201512	167	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The Desk plans to announce the switchover date on January 6, following the release of the minutes of this meeting.	61	6
201512	168	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As outlined in the middle-left panel, this public announcement would also include details about efforts to increase transparency and about policies intended to align the production of the EFFR and OBFR with international standards for financial benchmarks, as described in a memo sent to the Committee last week.	61	6
201512	169	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	An additional advantage of the FR 2420 data over the data we receive from the brokers is that we can publish more details about the unsecured overnight market.	61	6
201512	170	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The memo outlines the summary statistics we would include with the daily publication of the EFFR and OBFR.	61	6
201512	171	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The staff is considering whether additional data should be released with a lag, and we would welcome your feedback on this and other details of the plan.	61	6
201512	172	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Since 2014, we have been able to analyze secured money markets using daily transaction data from the triparty repo market, as noted in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201512	173	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The Desk has found this very useful in its analysis of the overnight and term RRP operations as well as in its overall market monitoring efforts.	61	6
201512	174	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In 2014, the Federal Reserve convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, or ARRC, a group of major US dollar swap dealers tasked with identifying robust alternative reference rates.	61	6
201512	175	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Staff members working to support the ARRC, under Governor Powell’s leadership, have been assessing whether there might be a role for the official sector to produce an alternative reference rate based on overnight secured transactions, particularly given that the Desk already produces one such rate internally.	61	6
201512	176	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The staff is currently investigating the possibility of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York publicly producing such a rate with the support of the Office of Financial Research.	61	6
201512	177	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	At the June meeting, the staff updated the Committee regarding a review of the Federal Reserve’s counterparty framework.	61	6
201512	178	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	At that time, we noted that the current framework is serving the Committee well while highlighting potential improvements in the administration of the counterparties.	61	6
201512	179	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	For the primary dealers, we are also investigating the appropriate financial condition criteria, following the discussion at the June meeting.	61	6
201512	180	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Our assessment has also been informed by the Treasury Operations Counterparty program and the Mortgage Operations Counterparty program, or MOC.	61	6
201512	181	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Details on operational results from the MOC are contained in the bottom panel.	61	6
201512	182	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In these programs, the Desk conducted outright transactions with smaller broker-dealers.	61	6
201512	183	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Our evaluation is that the very small operational benefits associated with transacting with smaller broker-dealers are greatly outweighed by the costs associated with managing such relationships.	61	6
201512	184	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Thus, we are unlikely to recommend that dealers with less than $50 million in capital—the maximum capital of MOC participants—be eligible to be a primary dealer.	61	6
201512	185	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The staff will continue to study potential adjustments to the counterparty frameworks in the context of a more sophisticated counterparty risk management approach that relies less on capital.	61	6
201512	186	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Once we have this framework in place, we will present draft revised administrative policies to the Committee for feedback.	61	6
201512	187	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Recall that in the discussion of the modernization of the Domestic Authorization last January, I suggested simplifying the description of eligible counterparties.	61	6
201512	188	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The Committee decided it preferred to wait for some of the results of the counterparty review before considering this change.	61	6
201512	189	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Unless the Committee has strong views in favor of making this change in January, I would recommend waiting for the revised counterparty administrative policies before addressing this issue again.	61	6
201512	190	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The staff have also been working on modernizing the documents related to foreign operations.	61	6
201512	191	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This work has uncovered a number of legacy issues related to earlier periods of active foreign operations.	61	6
201512	192	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, the structure of the documents is not symmetric with the domestic side, and we see value in moving to a structure in which the Committee more explicitly directs the current and potential future operations of the Desk.	61	6
201512	193	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The form of this direction may be influenced in part by the results of a project evaluating the current foreign-reserves management framework.	61	6
201512	194	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This framework has been strained by the negative rates in the euro area, as can be seen in the top-left panel of your final exhibit.	61	6
201512	195	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We project overall income on the euro portfolio to turn negative next year under our current investment approach.	61	6
201512	196	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We hope to be ready to present recommendations to the Committee at the March meeting, although there is a significant risk that it could take longer.	61	6
201512	197	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Consequently, we recommend deferring any changes in the documents controlling foreign operations until the foreign reserves management review is complete.	61	6
201512	198	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Finally, the Desk, working closely with Board staff members, has been developing a formal structure for assessing the full range of operations that are readily available for implementation, as well as the lead time required to implement new or dormant operations under appropriate risk controls.	61	6
201512	199	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, the structure starts by cataloguing all existing and potential operations and facilities and assigning each to one of five readiness categories.	61	6
201512	200	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This structure allows us to comprehensively assess the readiness of operations and employ clear standards for testing, training, and technological development.	61	6
201512	201	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	It is important to emphasize that it is appropriate for the vast majority of operations and facilities in the extended and significant development categories to remain there.	61	6
201512	202	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As an example of an active use of this framework, consider the recent test of accepting yen for dollars that completed a series of small value tests of our ability to receive foreign currency from central banks in the active standing swap network.	61	6
201512	203	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The completion of these tests moved this operation to “in production standby” from “rapid deployment.”	61	6
201512	204	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Such live operational tests are important to validate that an operation remains in standby mode.	61	6
201512	205	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This is why we ran a repo test this intermeeting period as well.	61	6
201512	206	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Such testing does identify issues that require attention to maintain the standby status.	61	6
201512	207	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	For example, the recent TDF test exposed a small glitch in how funds are matured from TDF accounts due to software changes.	61	6
201512	208	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The testing allowed San Francisco and Board staff members to fix the glitch prior to liftoff.	61	6
201512	209	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Another advantage of such testing is that when problems occur, we can test backup capacity.	61	6
201512	210	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	This happened last week in the live testing of the overnight RRP, when a switch to a new version of FedTrade produced erroneous settlement instructions for some counterparties, requiring a manual contingency to be deployed.	61	6
201512	211	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	As we build out the operational readiness structure, it is likely we will present to the Committee a small value testing plan for the year rather than notifications for each individual test.	61	6
201512	212	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	To conclude, the staff have conducted extensive tests of the tools that the Committee might want to deploy during the early stages of normalization and are confident in their operational integrity.	61	6
201512	213	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee decides to raise the target range tomorrow, then starting on Thursday, we will begin our daily operational call at 9:00 am to allow for more discussion and analysis among the staff and move the morning financial market update call to 9:30 am  Committee participants and their staff are welcome to join these calls.	61	6
201512	214	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Thank you Madam Chair.	61	6
201512	215	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	That completes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201512	216	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We’d be happy to take any other questions.	61	6
201512	217	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201512	218	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions for Simon?	62	6
201512	219	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201512	220	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	You’re unusually quiet.	62	6
201512	221	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Don’t complain, Madam Chair.	62	6
201512	222	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62	6
201512	223	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	62	6
201512	224	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to ratify open market operations.	63	6
201512	225	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201512	226	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201512	227	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201512	228	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let us proceed to the economic briefings, and John Roberts will start us off.	11	1
201512	229	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201512	230	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	I will be referring to “Material for the Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11	1
201512	231	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The top panels of your first exhibit review labor market conditions, which have continued to improve in recent months.	11	1
201512	232	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As indicated in the inset box in panel 1, total nonfarm payroll employment rose 210,000 in November, following a robust increase of 300,000 in October.	11	1
201512	233	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown by the black line, over the past three months, payrolls have increased at an average monthly pace of 220,000, similar to the pace of recent years.	11	1
201512	234	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The unemployment rate, shown in Panel 2, was 5 percent in both October and November, slightly lower than in the third quarter.	11	1
201512	235	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Over the past 12 months, the unemployment rate has fallen ¾ percentage point.	11	1
201512	236	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The labor force participation rate, shown in the middle-left panel, ticked up to 62.5 percent in November.	11	1
201512	237	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Over the past 12 months, the participation rate has moved down 0.4 percentage point, the same pace of decline as for the trend (the blue line).	11	1
201512	238	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown in the middle-right panel, manufacturing output edged up only slightly in the first half of the year.	11	1
201512	239	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We currently estimate that manufacturing IP rose 3½ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, and we anticipate a small increase in the current quarter.	11	1
201512	240	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	November data will be released tomorrow morning.	11	1
201512	241	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Panel 5 presents the staff outlook for consumer spending.	11	1
201512	242	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We currently estimate that real PCE increased at a 2½ percent annual rate in the current quarter, a bit less than in the third quarter.	11	1
201512	243	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Some of that downtick reflects the effects of unseasonably warm weather, which held down use of energy-related utility services.	11	1
201512	244	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Averaging across this quarter and next, we expect real PCE to rise about 3 percent at an annual rate.	11	1
201512	245	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	After the Tealbook closed, we received the November retail sales report.	11	1
201512	246	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The latest readings, summarized in the inset box, are consistent with the Tealbook outlook.	11	1
201512	247	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown in the bottom-right panel, we continue to expect real GDP to increase at about a 2 percent annual rate over the second half of this year and in the first quarter of next year.	11	1
201512	248	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	That pace is a bit faster than our estimate of potential GDP growth.	11	1
201512	249	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Our medium-term outlook for real GDP is shown in panel 1 of your next exhibit.	11	1
201512	250	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Over the medium term, we expect real GDP to increase about in line with the pace of recent years.	11	1
201512	251	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	In particular, we’re forecasting real GDP to rise 2½ percent next year and about 2 percent in each of 2017 and 2018.	11	1
201512	252	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The top-right panel discusses some of the key factors shaping our outlook.	11	1
201512	253	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As noted in the first bullet and shown in panel 3, net exports are expected to be a substantial drag on GDP growth in 2016 and 2017, reflecting the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the dollar since the middle of last year.	11	1
201512	254	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Joe Gruber will discuss the net export outlook in more detail in his presentation.	11	1
201512	255	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We think a number of other factors will support GDP growth over the medium term.	11	1
201512	256	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown in panel 4, after several years when fiscal policy was a substantial drag on real activity, it more recently has provided a modest degree of stimulus.	11	1
201512	257	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We expect that to continue next year as spending authorized by the bipartisan budget agreement ramps up.	11	1
201512	258	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	In addition, we anticipate that consumer spending will continue to be supported by the high level of household wealth, shown in panel 5.	11	1
201512	259	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Panel 6 shows the staff outlook for the unemployment rate.	11	1
201512	260	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	With output gains forecast to exceed the staff’s estimate of potential growth, the unemployment rate continues to fall and reaches 4½ percent by the end of 2018.	11	1
201512	261	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The pace of improvement is somewhat less than in recent years despite a similar rate of increase in real GDP.	11	1
201512	262	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As you can see in panel 1, we anticipate that potential output will rise somewhat more rapidly in the medium term than has been the case in the recent past.	11	1
201512	263	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Thus, the same increase in real GDP leads to a smaller change in resource utilization and, as a consequence, a smaller reduction in the unemployment rate.	11	1
201512	264	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The dashed red line shows the outlook for the unemployment rate as of the June Tealbook.	11	1
201512	265	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Our near- term outlook for the unemployment rate is about ¼ percentage point lower than in June.	11	1
201512	266	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	By 2018, the downward revision is a bit more than ½ percentage point.	11	1
201512	267	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Your third exhibit presents our outlook for inflation, starting with the near term in the top-left panel.	11	1
201512	268	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As of the December Tealbook, we expected headline PCE inflation would be around zero in the current quarter as well as in the first quarter of next year, held down by falling energy prices.	11	1
201512	269	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We anticipated that core PCE prices would rise at an annual rate of 1¼ percent in the current quarter and a bit more in the first quarter.	11	1
201512	270	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Since the Tealbook closed, we’ve received PPI data and, this morning, the November CPI.	11	1
201512	271	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Taking these data into account, we now expect near-term inflation to be slightly lower than at the time of the Tealbook.	11	1
201512	272	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Notably, current-quarter core PCE inflation would be 1 percent rather than 1¼ percent.	11	1
201512	273	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The top-right panel shows 12-month changes in total and core PCE prices.	11	1
201512	274	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The plotted series end with the staff’s estimate for November as of the Tealbook.	11	1
201512	275	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	With the latest data in hand, we now estimate that overall PCE prices (the dashed red line) rose only ¼ percent over the 12 months ended in November, just a touch lower than the Tealbook figure that is plotted.	11	1
201512	276	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The solid black line shows the 12-month change in core PCE prices.	11	1
201512	277	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Taking into account the CPI and PPI data, we now estimate the 12-month change through November to be 1.3 percent—again, just a touch lower than the figure that’s plotted.	11	1
201512	278	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Panel 3 shows the staff’s outlook for core PCE inflation over the medium term, along with a decomposition of the key factors driving the forecast.	11	1
201512	279	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Overall, we see core inflation rising from 1.3 percent this year to 1.9 percent by 2018.	11	1
201512	280	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As can be seen in line 2, in the staff’s view, the recent declines in energy and import prices have held down core inflation by about ½ percentage point this year and will have a similar effect next year.	11	1
201512	281	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	By 2018, however, energy and import prices are a neutral influence.	11	1
201512	282	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown in line 3, we also anticipate that rising resource utilization will boost inflation over the next several years.	11	1
201512	283	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The effect is expected to be slight, however, reflecting the staff’s view that the economy’s implicit “Phillips curve” is very flat.	11	1
201512	284	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Line 4 presents the effects of other factors.	11	1
201512	285	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Among other things, we anticipate that unusually low medical price increases will restrain inflation for the next year or so but will be essentially neutral by 2018.	11	1
201512	286	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Finally, the staff estimates that underlying inflation is currently 1.8 percent and will remain at that level for the next several years.	11	1
201512	287	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We expect underlying inflation eventually to move up to the Committee’s long-run objective.	11	1
201512	288	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As can be seen in the middle-right panel, our forecast for core PCE inflation (the black line) is a bit lower than we wrote down in June (the dashed red line), especially next year.	11	1
201512	289	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The near-term downward revision mostly reflects lower energy and import prices than in June; the projection for 2018 is about unchanged.	11	1
201512	290	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Panel 5 shows the outlook for overall PCE inflation.	11	1
201512	291	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Energy is once again the culprit for the near-term downward revision since June.	11	1
201512	292	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Once the drag due to the behavior of oil prices fades, we continue to expect overall PCE inflation to move in line with core inflation.	11	1
201512	293	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Panel 6 shows recent data on hourly compensation.	11	1
201512	294	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Over the 12 months ended in September, hourly compensation as measured by the ECI (the dot-dash black line) rose about 2 percent, a bit less than over the preceding 12-month period.	11	1
201512	295	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Hourly compensation from the productivity and costs program posted large gains in the second and third quarters and, as can be seen in the solid blue line, was up 3½ percent over the most recent four quarters.	11	1
201512	296	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	While that is a step-up from the sluggish pace of recent years, this is a volatile series and, for now, we are not taking too much signal from its recent acceleration.	11	1
201512	297	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Your final exhibit highlights two of the alternative scenarios that were presented in the Tealbook, in which we consider the consequences of a recession when the economy is still near the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.	11	1
201512	298	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As noted in panel 1, the bulk of the statistical evidence suggests that recessions do not die of old age (that is, the chance of a recession does not increase as time passes).	11	1
201512	299	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Nonetheless, based on the average occurrence of recessions since 1960, there is about a 15 to 20 percent chance of a recession occurring in any given year—and thus close to a 50 percent chance over the next three years.	11	1
201512	300	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	In the Tealbook scenarios, we considered the implications of a recession that starts in 2016:Q2, when the federal funds rate is forecast to still be close to zero.	11	1
201512	301	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We carried out the simulations using the staff’s EDO model, which is a DSGE model of the US domestic economy.	11	1
201512	302	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As discussed in panel 2, our recession scenario reflects shocks to the model that have been chosen to replicate the average behavior of real GDP and the federal funds rate in the five more moderate recessions since 1960.	11	1
201512	303	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Over those recessions, real GDP fell an average of ¾ percent from peak to trough, and the federal funds rate fell 275 basis points.	11	1
201512	304	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	This decline in the federal funds rate is much larger and more rapid than would be implied by the inertial version of the Taylor rule that we typically use in our Tealbook scenarios.	11	1
201512	305	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As is our usual practice, we assume no additional unconventional policy response.	11	1
201512	306	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The middle row shows the implications of these shocks under two assumptions about monetary policy—with and without the zero lower bound imposed.	11	1
201512	307	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Without the lower bound on nominal interest rates, as can be seen in the blue dot-dash line in panel 3, the unemployment rate peaks in the middle of 2017 at just over 6 percent.	11	1
201512	308	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Inflation—in the middle panel—stays at 1¼ percent next year rather than rising as in the baseline.	11	1
201512	309	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	With the federal funds rate at around 50 basis points before the recession starts, it falls just below minus 2 percent by the end of next year.	11	1
201512	310	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	When we assume, plausibly, that the federal funds rate can’t fall below zero, the outcomes for the economy are worse.	11	1
201512	311	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As shown in the red dashed line in panel 3, in this case, the unemployment rate reaches nearly 7 percent.	11	1
201512	312	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The federal funds rate—in the panel at the far right—returns to its effective lower bound in the second quarter of next year and remains at that level through 2017.	11	1
201512	313	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As I just noted, the scenario includes the assumption that the Committee does not make use of any of its unconventional tools.	11	1
201512	314	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	If the Committee does use unconventional policy, outcomes would likely be better than those represented by the red dashed lines.	11	1
201512	315	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The bottom panel raises some additional considerations.	11	1
201512	316	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	As noted in the first bullet, over the course of the medium term, the funds rate rises in the baseline projection.	11	1
201512	317	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Thus, starting in 2018, there would be room, under the baseline, to accommodate a 275 basis point cut in the federal funds rate.	11	1
201512	318	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	It is worth noting, however, that here we have assumed a moderate recession.	11	1
201512	319	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	If we take into account the severe recessions as well, the average drop in the federal funds rate would have been 400 basis points.	11	1
201512	320	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Indeed, even in a moderate recession, a funds rate cut of 275 basis points may be smaller than desirable.	11	1
201512	321	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	For example, in these scenarios, the EDO model’s estimate of the equilibrium federal funds rate drops by 650 basis points.	11	1
201512	322	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Joe Gruber will continue our presentation.	11	1
201512	323	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Thank you.	11	1
201512	324	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Compared with the turbulence in international financial markets that preceded your meeting in September, international conditions now appear considerably more stable.	11	1
201512	325	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Foreign GDP growth is strengthening and financial markets remained relatively calm over much of the intermeeting period even as the probability of liftoff approached certainty.	11	1
201512	326	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Over the past week, markets have become a bit more jittery, with emerging market currencies depreciating and spreads widening, though for reasons we generally do not pin on liftoff.	11	1
201512	327	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In this context, our baseline forecast does not suggest adverse consequences arising from liftoff for either the foreign economies or the US external sector, but risks remain that bear continued close monitoring.	11	1
201512	328	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown in the top table of exhibit 5, after a very weak second quarter, our projection of a pickup in foreign GDP growth in the third quarter (line 1) appears to have materialized.	11	1
201512	329	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In the emerging market economies (EMEs), emerging Asia excluding China (line 3) enjoyed an especially strong step-up, supported by a stabilization of exports, as can be seen in panel 2, following substantial swings over the preceding half year.	11	1
201512	330	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Chinese growth remained brisk (line 4), bolstered by retail sales (the red line in panel 3) and notwithstanding a dip in industrial production (the black line) that has already begun to fade.	11	1
201512	331	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The pace of activity also stepped up in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) (line 6), with bouncebacks in Canada (line 7), after declining oil investment pushed down GDP in the first half, and Japan (line 8).	11	1
201512	332	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Growth in the euro area (line 9) and the United Kingdom (line 10) disappointed slightly, but the indicators for the fourth quarter, including composite PMIs (shown in panel 4), support our outlook for strengthening European growth.	11	1
201512	333	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	One particularly dark spot has been Brazil, whose GDP (line 5 in the table) continued to plummet in the third quarter as political turmoil weighed on confidence and investment, driving down industrial production (the red line in panel 5) and pushing up unemployment (the black line).	11	1
201512	334	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We do not expect Brazilian GDP to bottom out until the middle of next year, and we have downgraded our outlook yet again as stubbornly high inflation constrains monetary policy and political problems block implementation of needed fiscal and structural policies.	11	1
201512	335	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Returning to line 1 in the table, the overall foreign outlook is basically unchanged from the October Tealbook.	11	1
201512	336	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Activity is expected to accelerate a bit next year, supported by accommodative monetary policy and easing credit conditions in the AFEs.	11	1
201512	337	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In contrast to most economies we forecast, growth in China is expected to edge down gradually over the projection period, as the economy continues to rebalance away from investment and potential growth moderates.	11	1
201512	338	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	For many, but not all, economies, low oil prices are expected to boost growth, a positive impetus that has only gotten larger in light of the recent price declines.	11	1
201512	339	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The price of Brent crude oil, the black line in panel 6, fell to just below $38 per barrel yesterday, only slightly above its trough during the global financial crisis, as global oil production remains strong and inventories accumulate.	11	1
201512	340	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Prices came under further pressure after the recent OPEC meeting provided little indication that the cartel would take any action to reign in supply for the foreseeable future.	11	1
201512	341	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We expect oil prices to edge up gradually during the forecast period, in part supported by declines in US production.	11	1
201512	342	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Prices for industrial metals (the red line in panel 6) have also continued their steep decline.	11	1
201512	343	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The higher dollar and resilient supply have played an important role in pushing down prices, as have market concerns over the strength of demand, particularly from China, for metals.	11	1
201512	344	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Declining energy prices have been a major contributor to low inflation globally, supporting continued accommodative monetary policy by the major foreign central banks, as discussed in your next exhibit.	11	1
201512	345	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown across the top three panels, headline inflation in the third quarter was near zero in the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom.	11	1
201512	346	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Core inflation, though higher, is also quite subdued.	11	1
201512	347	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Diminishing slack is expected to push up core inflation, with even steeper increases in headline inflation as oil prices flatten out.	11	1
201512	348	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	That said, inflation is expected to remain below target in both the euro area and Japan through the end of 2018.	11	1
201512	349	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Referencing subdued inflation, the ECB announced a number of policy measures on December 3, as discussed earlier by Simon and outlined in panel 4, including an extension of its quantitative easing program and a 10 basis point cut in its deposit rate to minus 0.3 percent.	11	1
201512	350	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown in panel 5, the ECB’s deposit rate (the green line) has been negative since mid-2014, pulling other short-term lending rates into negative territory as well without any noticeable disruption to European money markets.	11	1
201512	351	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We expect the ECB to leave its policy rate (the green line in panel 6) at its current level until the end of 2018.	11	1
201512	352	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The Bank of Japan did not announce any new measures at its October and November meetings, despite revising down its inflation outlook, but it continues to purchase assets at a rapid pace.	11	1
201512	353	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In the United Kingdom, markets were struck by the dovish tone of the Bank of England’s November Inflation Report, including the announcement that it would not consider reducing its asset holdings until the policy rate normalized to about 2 percent, a higher threshold than many had previously expected.	11	1
201512	354	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We expect the BOE to begin hiking its policy rate (the blue line in panel 6) in the second quarter of next year.	11	1
201512	355	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	With the Federal Reserve widely expected to hike interest rates tomorrow, attention has focused on monetary policy divergences across the advanced economies.	11	1
201512	356	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Policy divergences may present some challenges for US monetary policy.	11	1
201512	357	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown in panel 7, 10-year sovereign yields across the advanced economies remain fairly tightly correlated, suggesting that there is a risk that low yields abroad will put downward pressure on US yields even as the Federal Reserve lifts policy rates.	11	1
201512	358	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Another consequence of monetary policy divergence has been the sharp appreciation of the dollar against the currencies of other advanced economies.	11	1
201512	359	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown by the red line in panel 8, the jump in the dollar against the AFE currencies over the past two months has been coincident with a rise in the spread between US 24-month-ahead policy rate expectations and expected policy in other advanced economies.	11	1
201512	360	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Our outlook for the dollar is shown at the top of your next exhibit.	11	1
201512	361	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We assume that Federal Reserve liftoff has largely been priced into the dollar at this point, and we have penciled in only a touch more appreciation through the first quarter of next year.	11	1
201512	362	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	This forecast is generally consistent with the historical experience associated with periods surrounding the start of previous tightening cycles.	11	1
201512	363	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown by the “butterfly chart” in panel 2, averaging across dollar moves in the 12 months surrounding the past four Federal Reserve tightening cycles (the black line), our forecast dollar path (the dashed red line) is about in line with the average post- tightening trajectory.	11	1
201512	364	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Of course, we are cognizant of the risk that liftoff might be associated with a more pronounced rise in the dollar, as explored in the “Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario presented in the Tealbook.	11	1
201512	365	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In this scenario, liftoff and ensuing policy normalization induce a sharp 10 percent further rise in the dollar (shown in panel 3).	11	1
201512	366	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The stronger dollar pushes down US real net exports and lowers US GDP growth (panel 4) over the next two years, boosting the unemployment rate by about ½ percentage point (panel 5).	11	1
201512	367	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Another commonly raised concern surrounding liftoff has been the potential for increased financial turbulence in the emerging market economies.	11	1
201512	368	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	However, market movements since the October FOMC meeting suggest that the reaction could be limited.	11	1
201512	369	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	For one, as shown in panel 6, the response of emerging market currencies (the red line) to the sharp increase in US policy rate expectations (the black line) following the October FOMC and October payrolls report was relatively muted.	11	1
201512	370	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Over the past few months, EME currencies have been more closely correlated with oil prices, which plunged late in the period (the black line in panel 7).	11	1
201512	371	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We are not sanguine, however, about EME risks, given elevated corporate leverage and falling commodity prices hanging over many emerging market economies.	11	1
201512	372	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In addition, prospects for China’s exchange rate policy, which roiled emerging markets during the summer, remain a wild card.	11	1
201512	373	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown in panel 8, the renminbi has resumed depreciation this month following a period of relative stability.	11	1
201512	374	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Our forecast is for the renminbi to remain flat over the next year, as Chinese officials balance concerns for financial stability with a desire to staunch reserve outflows.	11	1
201512	375	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	However, further depreciation is a risk, with the potential to spill over to other emerging markets.	11	1
201512	376	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Although the staff baseline projection is not premised on significant further appreciation of the broad dollar, the sharp run-up in the dollar since July 2014 continues to weigh heavily on the outlook for US net exports—the subject of your next exhibit.	11	1
201512	377	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The top two panels of your exhibit provide some detail on how the dollar affects our outlook.	11	1
201512	378	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The panel on the left shows data and our forecast for real export growth (the solid black line), as well as an estimate from our trade model (the black dots).	11	1
201512	379	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The model takes foreign GDP and the dollar as its inputs, with the contribution of each of these variables to export growth measured respectively by the green and blue bars in the panel.	11	1
201512	380	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	As shown by the blue bars, the drag due to dollar appreciation is expected to be both large and long lasting, with the peak negative effect not hitting until the first half of next year and the drag lasting into 2018.	11	1
201512	381	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	The dollar also boosts imports, as shown by the blue bars in panel 2, further pulling down the net export contribution to GDP.	11	1
201512	382	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Here, too, the dollar has large and persistent effects, with the peak boost to imports projected to occur in the first half of next year.	11	1
201512	383	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Overall, we expect the contribution of net exports to remain negative throughout the forecast, as can be seen in line 3 of the table.	11	1
201512	384	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Net exports took almost 1 percentage point off US real GDP growth in the first half of 2015 but are estimated to have exerted less drag in the second half, as exports (line 1) remained weak but imports (line 2) slowed as well.	11	1
201512	385	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Next year, we expect net exports to again weigh heavily on GDP growth, as exports remain about flat while imports shake off some of their second-half weakness.	11	1
201512	386	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	To help understand the recent slowdown in imports, panel 4 highlights developments in a few key sectors.	11	1
201512	387	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Consumer goods (the black line) have been strong, in line with the strengthening of the dollar.	11	1
201512	388	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In contrast, imports of nonfuel industrial supplies (the blue line) and imports of capital goods (the red line) have been weak in recent quarters.	11	1
201512	389	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	In part, this weakness appears to reflect a steep decline in imports of oil extraction equipment and machinery, likely reflecting the steep fall in domestic drilling that has followed the plunge in oil prices.	11	1
201512	390	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	With US drilling activity in the period ahead unlikely to keep falling so quickly , we believe that a flattening out of these imports will allow a pickup in overall import growth next year.	11	1
201512	391	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Thank you.	11	1
201512	392	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Jason will now continue.	11	1
201512	393	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Thank you, Joe.	11	1
201512	394	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for the Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201512	395	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201512	396	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown in the top panel, most of you project that real GDP growth will be at or slightly above your assessments of its longer-run pace this year.	11	1
201512	397	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Almost all of you see growth picking up next year before converging toward its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018.	11	1
201512	398	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The medians of your projections regarding growth this year and over the next two years are a bit above the 2 percent median of your longer-run projections.	11	1
201512	399	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown in the second panel, all of you project that the unemployment rate, after reaching 5 percent this year, will be at or below its longer-run value over the forecast period.	11	1
201512	400	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation moves up from 0.4 percent this year to 1.6 percent in 2016, climbing further to 1.9 percent in 2017.	11	1
201512	401	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Most of you project that, by 2018, headline PCE inflation will reach the Committee’s goal of 2 percent, while a few of you indicate that inflation would still be 0.1 to 0.3 percentage point below 2 percent at that time.	11	1
201512	402	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown in the bottom panel, almost all of you expect core inflation to increase gradually over the next three years.	11	1
201512	403	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the September Summary of Economic Projections and with the December Tealbook.	11	1
201512	404	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the top panel, the median path of your projections regarding real GDP growth is little changed from September, and is slightly below the Tealbook forecast in the near term and slightly above it over the medium term.	11	1
201512	405	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The median of your forecasts of the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, edged down 0.1 percentage point over the next three years.	11	1
201512	406	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Many of you revised down your projection of the longer- run normal rate of unemployment slightly, although these revisions did not change the median projection or the range for the longer-run rate.	11	1
201512	407	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	A few of you cited the stronger-than-expected labor market data in recent months as a factor explaining the change in your unemployment forecasts.	11	1
201512	408	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Although many of you revised down your projections of total PCE inflation in 2016 by 0.3 percentage point or more, with some of you citing further declines in oil prices as a contributing factor, the median projection for that year, shown in the third panel, did not change materially.	11	1
201512	409	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	At longer forecasting horizons, most of you did not change your projection of total PCE inflation.	11	1
201512	410	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The median path of your forecasts of core PCE inflation was also little changed from September, as indicated by the final panel, although many of you made small downward adjustments for core PCE inflation over the next two years.	11	1
201512	411	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	For both inflation measures, the median paths of your projections are slightly more optimistic than the staff’s forecasts in the Tealbook.	11	1
201512	412	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the quarter in which you currently judge the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate to be appropriate and of the economic conditions you anticipate at that time.	11	1
201512	413	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The top panel shows that all but two of you view this meeting as appropriate for the first increase.	11	1
201512	414	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	With the appropriate commencement of policy normalization deemed imminent, your projections of the unemployment rate and core PCE inflation rate at liftoff, shown in the bottom left, gravitate toward your projections for 2015, the medians of which are 5 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively.	11	1
201512	415	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	A couple of you stated in your comments that a decision to not lift off at this meeting would be a risk to the Committee’s credibility and could also provoke a negative financial market reaction.	11	1
201512	416	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Exhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the forecast period and in the longer run.	11	1
201512	417	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The medians of your funds rate projections, indicated by the red lines in the top panel, stand at 0.4 percent at the end of 2015, 1.4 percent at the end of 2016, 2.4 percent at the end of 2017, and 3.3 percent at the end of 2018.	11	1
201512	418	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Since September, a majority of you revised down your projected path of the federal funds rate over the next two years, while the ranges for these two years have gotten narrower.	11	1
201512	419	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	In addition, many of you also lowered your projection for 2018.	11	1
201512	420	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Most of you judged that economic conditions will likely justify a gradual rise in the federal funds rate, citing continued low readings of actual inflation and inflation compensation, and other headwinds that will likely dissipate only over time, such as slow global growth.	11	1
201512	421	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	In addition, some of you noted that a gradual increase in the federal funds rate would be commensurate with the expectation that the equilibrium real interest rate will rise slowly over the next few years.	11	1
201512	422	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	With respect to the longer-run nominal funds rate, four of you lowered your projections, three by 25 basis points.	11	1
201512	423	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	A sizable majority of you project that at the end of 2018, the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will still be below, albeit quite close to, your individual judgments of its longer-run level—a larger number of you than in September.	11	1
201512	424	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 4, the medians of interest rate prescriptions based on a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule, given your projections of core inflation, the unemployment gap, and the longer-run nominal federal funds rate, have shifted down for this year and the next two years compared with September.	11	1
201512	425	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The decline in the 2015 interest rate prescription is the most pronounced and is driven by lower projections of inflation and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	11	1
201512	426	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Over the next couple of years, the declines are attenuated by downward revisions to the projections of the unemployment gap.	11	1
201512	427	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Despite the downward shift in the Taylor rule prescriptions, almost all of you continue to project levels of the federal funds rate over the next three years that are below the prescriptions of the rule.	11	1
201512	428	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Indeed, for most of you, the gap between your projections of the federal funds rate and the rule’s prescriptions has widened over the next three years.	11	1
201512	429	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	The final exhibit shows your assessments of uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201512	430	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown in the figures to the left, your views regarding uncertainty have not changed in a material way since September.	11	1
201512	431	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Almost all of you judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average levels over the past 20 years.	11	1
201512	432	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Since September, your assessment of the risks to GDP growth and unemployment has become more balanced.	11	1
201512	433	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	As shown in the panels to your right, only three of you see the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside—four fewer than in September—and only two of you see the risks to unemployment weighted to the upside—also four fewer than in September.	11	1
201512	434	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Diminished risks to US growth arising from conditions abroad, together with strength in recent labor market data, were cited by a few of you as the reasons for risks being viewed as now broadly balanced.	11	1
201512	435	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Notwithstanding the majority view that risks to growth and unemployment are nearly balanced, many of you continue to judge that risks to inflation are weighted to the downside, while none of you see the risks weighted to the upside, as reported in the third and fourth panels on the right.	11	1
201512	436	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Several of you highlighted declining inflation expectations and the continued strength of the dollar as contributing to these downside risks.	11	1
201512	437	2015-12-16	meeting	WU	Thank you.	11	1
201512	438	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	11	1
201512	439	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	12	1
201512	440	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201512	441	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201512	442	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I have two questions.	12	1
201512	443	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	First, on the SEPs.	12	1
201512	444	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Exhibit 3, inflation versus the unemployment rate in the lower left—I started staring at that, and all of a sudden I started feeling calm, and I started thinking about alt-B, and I started thinking that maybe alt-B was better, and I felt more calm [laughter].	12	1
201512	445	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	It is rather hypnotic, isn’t it?	12	1
201512	446	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Okay, anyway—back to the real question.	12	1
201512	447	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The economic outlook, exhibit 2, the medium- term outlook, real GDP.	12	1
201512	448	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Looking at potential GDP growth, I was reminded of something I have asked questions about in the past—in 2014, the potential output growth looks like it was quite low.	12	1
201512	449	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	And then I wondered if maybe I hadn’t prepared carefully enough.	12	1
201512	450	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	So I went back to look at the Tealbook chart that has that, and 2014 was buried in an average of 2011 to 2014, which was 1.1 percent.	12	1
201512	451	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I had sort of forgotten that we have 0.4 here for 2014.	12	1
201512	452	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I guess the question is— and, John, you are the perfect person, as I understand it, to answer this, since it is based upon your research on Kalman smoothing and things like that.	12	1
201512	453	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	What is the basis for thinking about this?	12	1
201512	454	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	And since it is so amazing, the question really is, does this provide a lesson for the future?	12	1
201512	455	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Because it is a rather dramatic step-down in potential output growth.	12	1
201512	456	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	If we had found something like that at a period featuring less resource slack, maybe we might think that some inflation will be coming our way.	12	1
201512	457	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure how to think about it.	12	1
201512	458	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We tried to get the improvement in the output gap right for 2014.	12	1
201512	459	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Of course, the changing output gap is just the difference between real GDP growth and potential GDP growth.	12	1
201512	460	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	And we saw in 2014 that labor market conditions were improving very rapidly.	12	1
201512	461	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The unemployment rate was coming down quite a lot, so we thought, “Oh, the output gap must be improving a lot.”	12	1
201512	462	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	So what we essentially did was to say, “Hmm, with GDP growth not as strong as it should be to get that kind of an improvement in the output gap, there must have been some measurement error in the actual GDP numbers.”	12	1
201512	463	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	And because we don’t have room in our accounting system right now for measurement error, we put the measurement error in potential GDP.	12	1
201512	464	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	This is something we are thinking a lot about.	12	1
201512	465	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	In the research of mine that you cite, we do have an explicit role for measurement error, but that isn’t something that’s in our traditional accounting systems.	12	1
201512	466	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	One could imagine a more elaborate system in which you break down real GDP into not just the two components, of potential output and the output gap, but into three components:  potential output, the output gap, and measurement error.	12	1
201512	467	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	So that’s what’s going on there.	12	1
201512	468	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	That is a little less satisfying than I was expecting, because if my memory is right, I thought that was the occasion when the first-quarter winter was really dastardly.	12	1
201512	469	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Exactly.	12	1
201512	470	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	And we just made this judgment call to take it all as potential output.	12	1
201512	471	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	That is exactly right, and that is what I am calling “measurement error.”	12	1
201512	472	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12	1
201512	473	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	So I understand that kind of swag, I guess.	12	1
201512	474	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	But on the other hand, GDP was 2½ percent that year, right?	12	1
201512	475	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Yes.	12	1
201512	476	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	But you are exactly right.	12	1
201512	477	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We are putting a lot of weight on what we thought was an anomalous Q1 number.	12	1
201512	478	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12	1
201512	479	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12	1
201512	480	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201512	481	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	GDP growth was 2½ percent, and the unemployment rate was coming down a lot, so unless you posit a big discrepancy between the growth of actual GDP and potential GDP, it’s really hard to reconcile a substantial decline in the unemployment rate.	12	1
201512	482	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	So we sort of “squeezed the balloon,” and, as John Roberts described, we squeezed it into here.	12	1
201512	483	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, we are in the process, as John Roberts mentioned, of inventing a more elaborate system that would allow us to do something that we can’t do at the moment, and that is, have a smooth series for potential GDP that probably accords a little more with our economic intuition so that potential GDP growth is driven by things like trend multifactor productivity, capital investment, population growth, those sorts of things.	12	1
201512	484	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	What we’d like, ideally, is to have a smooth series for potential GDP that represents that, and we would also like to show you an output gap that itself is also smooth and accurately represents pressures on resource utilization.	12	1
201512	485	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	At the moment, absent, as John was describing, a third category for—in the Kalman filter world, it is called “observation error.”	12	1
201512	486	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	Absent an explicit designation of observation error, we can’t do those two things.	12	1
201512	487	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	So as an imperfect parking place, we have put the noisiness into potential GDP growth.	12	1
201512	488	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s what’s going on in the—	12	1
201512	489	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I think it was a good decision.	12	1
201512	490	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I think we are well served by that type of good judgment, just put all the pain in one place and let the analytics go forward on a more reasonable—no, I’m not questioning that, I’m just trying to understand it.	12	1
201512	491	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201512	492	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12	1
201512	493	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201512	494	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question on John’s exhibit 4, “A Recession at the ZLB,” which obviously was also in the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A.	12	1
201512	495	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I read from the text and from your presentation, if I look at the blue dot-dashed line—which indicates that you are not imposing a zero lower bound, you are not imposing anything—you are actually doing two things with the funds rate here.	12	1
201512	496	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have a baseline assumption about some kind of Taylor rule with inertia, but then you are also dropping the funds rate by 275 basis points to show a typical or a strong reaction to the recession.	12	1
201512	497	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is a combination of these two effects.	12	1
201512	498	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then, on the zero lower bound, you are constraining it at essentially 10 or 12½ basis points.	12	1
201512	499	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have one technical question, which is, I am puzzled by the fact that the red dashed line with the zero lower bound is almost always—by just my looking at panel 5 in the exhibit—above the blue dashed line, which goes against economic intuition.	12	1
201512	500	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I understand it is above at the zero lower bound, but it wouldn’t be that way, for example, for 2018.	12	1
201512	501	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though the economy is worse off, the funds rate is higher.	12	1
201512	502	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I was curious about really what’s going on here.	12	1
201512	503	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the second issue, which is kind of more related to the box in the Tealbook about the effective lower bound, is I would be very interested to see what would happen if, when you do these kinds of scenarios, instead of a zero lower bound, you used a negative 50 basis point or a negative 100 basis point lower bound, given the experience in Europe, and in light of what we’ve learned from that, which is reported in the Tealbook, just to kind of give us a flavor of, in a situation like this, if we could go to negative rates.	12	1
201512	504	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if we had a view on how that would pass through to financial conditions, how much of an extra kick would that give us before going to, say, QE4 or some other tool?	12	1
201512	505	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Let me answer your first technical question.	12	1
201512	506	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	We assume that there is the initial kick-down in the federal funds rate, and then, after that, it just follows the inertial Taylor rule.	12	1
201512	507	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	That is sort of what is going on in the blue dot-dash line.	12	1
201512	508	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The reason the red line is above the blue dot-dash line is basically the inertia.	12	1
201512	509	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	The inertial Taylor rule has a lot of inertia, and so you’re inheriting zero rather than negative 1, and it is persistent, so that is why it is above.	12	1
201512	510	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	So that was your first question.	12	1
201512	511	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Your second question, why not—	12	1
201512	512	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	Is that clear, John?	12	1
201512	513	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s clear, but it’s not satisfactory, really, because if you think about it—and I have talked about this so many times—these kinds of arbitrary “I am pushing the funds rate in one, and I am putting inertia in the other,” and you are getting what are nonsensical responses that one path is above the other, even though the economy is worse.	12	1
201512	514	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would prefer to see something like an optimal control exercise, in which you are really doing something that is apples-to-apples, so that I could see what the different outcomes would be if I was trying to do something that is consistent with our views.	12	1
201512	515	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is something that we can, you know—	12	1
201512	516	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	Yes, that’s something that we’ve been thinking about.	12	1
201512	517	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is pretty simple.	12	1
201512	518	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	It is a mechanical application of the inertial rule.	12	1
201512	519	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	The inertial rule is simply feeding off a lagged value that’s zero when the ZLB is imposed, and the inertial rule is feeding off a negative number when the ZLB is not imposed.	12	1
201512	520	2015-12-16	meeting	WILCOX	It, obviously, would be possible to do an optimal control version of the same kind of exercise.	12	1
201512	521	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	So your second question—I would suggest averaging the blue line and the red line.	12	1
201512	522	2015-12-16	meeting	ROBERTS	If the federal funds rate could go to minus 100, then the outcome would probably be somewhere in between where it is when it goes to minus 200 and when it’s stuck at zero.	12	1
201512	523	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m really thinking ahead to, if this really happened, what the cost- benefit analysis, or at least the benefit analysis, would be in terms of macroeconomic stabilization if we really thought that the effective lower bound was something lower.	12	1
201512	524	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You know, giving us a little more information in these kinds of scenarios of, “Hey, if you guys were willing to go to minus 50, you wouldn’t get an unemployment rate of nearly 7, you might get an unemployment rate that peaked at 6¼.”	12	1
201512	525	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s where I’m going with this, thinking ahead to the staff analysis.	12	1
201512	526	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Madam Chair, may I briefly—the staff is in the process of evaluating various technical, legal aspects of our actual ability to implement negative short-term interest rates, on the basis of the experience abroad.	12	1
201512	527	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12	1
201512	528	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201512	529	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201512	530	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to follow up with President Williams on the same exhibit 4, “A Recession at the Zero Lower Bound.”	12	1
201512	531	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Williams, to do this experiment in which we lower the funds rate to implausible levels and then trace out the response—I’m not sure that’s the most useful thing to show to the Committee.	12	1
201512	532	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll suggest an alternative experiment, which is:  You do have this constant probability of recession.	12	1
201512	533	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	If a recession occurred in 2016, I think what the Committee wants to know is, how much QE would you have to do to mitigate the recession and what does the staff model say about that?	12	1
201512	534	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	And then, as an alternative, you assume the recession does not occur until 2019 or something like that, when the funds rate is much higher or in a much better position, and then presumably you might not have to do any QE, or might have to do much less or something like that.	12	1
201512	535	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But otherwise we’re comparing to something that, you know, we can’t do.	12	1
201512	536	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So that’s kind of distressing.	12	1
201512	537	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	On exhibit 7, which is entitled “Liftoff” and is about the dollar, figure 2, “Dollar Moves Around the Start of a Tightening Cycle,” shows the average of past tightening cycles, and the black line declines—which I guess is a depreciation of the dollar in the months following these four previous historic tightening cycles.	12	1
201512	538	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I thought you were going to show me an alternative scenario of “what if that happened?”	12	1
201512	539	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	And that isn’t actually the alternative that you showed me in figures 3, 4, and 5 here.	12	1
201512	540	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	You showed me further tightening.	12	1
201512	541	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I guess—	12	1
201512	542	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	That’s right.	12	1
201512	543	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	—what’s the connection?	12	1
201512	544	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	I think you’re right, your interpretation of the black line is correct here.	12	1
201512	545	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	On average in previous tightening cycles, we have seen a slight depreciation of the dollar, because tightening likely has been priced in before the actual event of the interest rate increase, as you would expect.	12	1
201512	546	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	Honestly, this was just highlighting the risk more.	12	1
201512	547	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	What people probably are seeing is the risk of the forecast.	12	1
201512	548	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	But I think you’re exactly right, we don’t really have a very good idea of what’s going to happen to the dollar post-liftoff, and it’s possible that it would fall.	12	1
201512	549	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	So in most of these episodes, China’s not important.	12	1
201512	550	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	In 2004, they’re important.	12	1
201512	551	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	They start appreciating against the US dollar in 2005.	12	1
201512	552	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Oh, sure, you’re averaging across these past periods, which are different.	12	1
201512	553	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Absolutely.	12	1
201512	554	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	So the currency composition—	12	1
201512	555	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	But the China one would be a big one.	12	1
201512	556	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	We took this to basically a further 10 percent appreciation of the dollar just because I think that’s the risk that we had in mind, but that’s not to say that’s the only thing that could happen.	12	1
201512	557	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, one interpretation of this figure 2 is that a lot of the action is ahead of the tightening cycle because it’s all pulled forward in financial markets.	12	1
201512	558	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Then, after you get past the initiation of the cycle, other things happen in the economy, and you don’t know what those are.	12	1
201512	559	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	That’s in line with our forecast, I would say, with this relatively flat forecast path of the dollar.	12	1
201512	560	2015-12-16	meeting	KAMIN	President Bullard, I think I would add, exactly apropos of the point that you made, that we have another alternative simulation in the Tealbook that highlights the possibility that foreign growth is a little faster than we expect, and as a result of that faster growth, the dollar depreciates.	12	1
201512	561	2015-12-16	meeting	KAMIN	And that’s exactly the type of thing that could be reflected in the depreciation of the dollar, shown in this average of past tightening cycles, that the FOMC tightening is already built in beforehand, and then new information arises afterward.	12	1
201512	562	2015-12-16	meeting	KAMIN	And, as a result, the dollar can go up or down.	12	1
201512	563	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	All right.	12	1
201512	564	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201512	565	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	12	1
201512	566	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201512	567	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Number one, still on panel 2 of exhibit 7, am I not correct, Joe, that the past tightening cycles that you’ve averaged were ones in which there was already a fair amount of divergence between US policy rates and policy rates in at least two out of the three important central banks for our purposes, which is to say, the Bundesbank, the ECB, and the Bank of Japan?	12	1
201512	568	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, number two, in none of these circumstances, obviously, have there been six years of more or less coincident rates, right?	12	1
201512	569	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	That’s correct.	12	1
201512	570	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	I think you’re right in pointing out that in 1994, there was policy divergence already at that point, but like you said, we were both headed in the same direction, but basically at different paces.	12	1
201512	571	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	So in some sense the divergence is a little different this time because we’ve had six years, basically, of the same rates, and things are going in different directions at this point.	12	1
201512	572	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	And so you see that the much faster realized appreciation of the dollar going into this tightening episode is probably a reflection of that, right?	12	1
201512	573	2015-12-16	meeting	GRUBER	So we’ve had, what, a 16 percent rise in the dollar since middle of last year, and I think that’s not something we’ve seen around other tightenings.	12	1
201512	574	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12	1
201512	575	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12	1
201512	576	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201512	577	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin the round, and I’m going to call on President Rosengren.	13	1
201512	578	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	579	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My SEP submission is qualitatively similar to the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201512	580	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect real GDP growth over the next two years only somewhat above 2 percent, the unemployment rate at the end of 2017 at 4.6 percent, and a return of PCE inflation to 2 percent by 2018.	13	1
201512	581	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My policy rate assumption is also qualitatively similar to that of the Tealbook, with a 25 basis point increase at every other meeting.	13	1
201512	582	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, a boring forecast, but for a central banker, boring is good.	13	1
201512	583	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because my modal forecast is basically more of the same economic outcomes that we have been experiencing over this past year, the mode may not be the most interesting aspect of the outlook.	13	1
201512	584	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Instead, this may be a good time to consider what could make our modal forecast go wrong.	13	1
201512	585	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My primary unease with my modal forecast concerns inflation.	13	1
201512	586	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Core PCE inflation is currently at 1.3 percent.	13	1
201512	587	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I’m reasonably confident in my modal forecast based on continued tightening of labor market conditions, an alternative case is not hard to justify.	13	1
201512	588	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although the current spread between the core CPI and core PCE is certainly not unprecedented, it is large relative to the spread we’ve experienced over the past five years.	13	1
201512	589	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If core PCE inflation tended to revert to core CPI inflation, we might be more confident of a return to our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201512	590	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case.	13	1
201512	591	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	When my staff ran error correction models in the two core series, core CPI tends to converge to core PCE and not the other way around.	13	1
201512	592	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	The implication is that we should not take much solace in the higher value for core CPI inflation.	13	1
201512	593	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	With tighter labor markets, one might expect that surveys and financial market indicators would provide more confidence in the projection of reaching our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201512	594	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the SPF PCE median expectation for the next 10 years and the 5-to-10-year-ahead TIPS measures of inflation expectations have recently fallen and now are at or near 10-year lows.	13	1
201512	595	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	The difficulty returning to our inflation target is a global problem.	13	1
201512	596	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Central banks in developed economies are significantly undershooting their inflation targets.	13	1
201512	597	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Their attempts to restore inflation to their 2 percent targets have depreciated their currencies against the dollar, a development that is likely to conflict with our own attempts to return to our inflation target.	13	1
201512	598	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	With market expectations tentative and the global low inflation environment potentially inhibiting our own efforts, this is a risk that, if it materializes in coming quarters, could alter my desired monetary policy path.	13	1
201512	599	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the risks are not completely asymmetric.	13	1
201512	600	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most significant risk that would argue for a tighter monetary policy path than I have in my SEP arises from labor market behavior.	13	1
201512	601	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since the onset of the recovery, the labor market has tightened more quickly than I expected.	13	1
201512	602	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast has real GDP over the next two years averaging close to 2 percent, not much different than what we have averaged over the past several years.	13	1
201512	603	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, despite very modest and slower-than-expected growth, the unemployment rate over the past several years has fallen more than expected.	13	1
201512	604	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Compounding that risk, we also do not have a particularly good record of stabilizing the unemployment rate at its natural rate.	13	1
201512	605	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Instead, monetary policy often contributes to a significant undershooting of our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201512	606	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	This risk is mitigated somewhat by the expectation that, as in the Tealbook, some workers will be drawn back into the labor force, so that some of the remaining labor market slack not captured in the U- 3 rate will diminish.	13	1
201512	607	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But a plausible alternative is that the unemployment rate falls well below our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201512	608	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m not deeply concerned that such undershooting will cause a sharp rise in inflation, but rather that our attempts to return unemployment to the natural rate will similarly result in overshooting, above the natural rate, setting off a cycle of corrections that might induce additional volatility into the economy.	13	1
201512	609	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am perhaps less concerned about undershooting and overshooting than I would be if I held to the Tealbook’s natural rate of unemployment estimate, as my current estimate of the natural rate of unemployment is 4.7 percent.	13	1
201512	610	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is starting to represent a sizable difference from the staff’s forecast.	13	1
201512	611	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But even with a much lower natural rate, if the estimate were significantly surpassed, I would become more worried about future inflationary pressures and about inadvertently creating another recession in our attempts to avoid such pressures.	13	1
201512	612	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In such a context, I might want a tighter normalization path to avoid such a scenario.	13	1
201512	613	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, I do not see any imminent threat to financial stability.	13	1
201512	614	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, as outlined in the Chair’s recent e-mail, overall financial conditions might be conducive to sowing the seeds of such problems.	13	1
201512	615	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While macroprudential tools may be the preferred first line of defense, I have concerns about whether we have sufficient foresight, tools, and political will to use those tools to full effect.	13	1
201512	616	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	To be sure, we also do not know how effective monetary policy would be in slowing particular activity that might lead to financial instability.	13	1
201512	617	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But we certainly have the ability to implement standard monetary policy tools if we deem them necessary and effective.	13	1
201512	618	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am probably more willing to lean on monetary policy tools than some others, at least until I have more confidence in the use of macroprudential tools.	13	1
201512	619	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am glad that we are having a more fulsome discussion in April, but at least for me a buildup of financial-stability pressures might influence how quickly I would be willing to normalize.	13	1
201512	620	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My baseline forecast at this time is that those concerns will not rise to the level that would alter my preferred path of the short-term interest rate, but monitoring financial conditions closely in coming quarters is certainly warranted.	13	1
201512	621	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	622	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	623	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201512	624	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	625	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District have changed little in recent months.	13	1
201512	626	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	The overall tone of our contacts and survey respondents remains positive, though there are pockets of weakness associated with energy production and exports.	13	1
201512	627	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary December numbers for our manufacturing composite index remain basically at a neutral level, and reports received from our contacts were mixed.	13	1
201512	628	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Bright spots include aerospace, power generation equipment, medical equipment, and the auto industry, in which several new plants are being built in our District.	13	1
201512	629	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Weakness appears concentrated among export-related businesses.	13	1
201512	630	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	An illustrative comment came from a chemical manufacturer in North Carolina who said that his export business was down sharply, off 25 percent, but domestic business was up 15 percent.	13	1
201512	631	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Contacts at our large defense contractors are reporting a much more positive outlook as a result of the budget deal.	13	1
201512	632	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	They welcome the increased funding, of course, but they also noted that the extended time horizon was reducing uncertainty and allowed them to plan, hire, and invest.	13	1
201512	633	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Lower natural gas prices have resulted in reduced drilling activity in the Marcellus region.	13	1
201512	634	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Pipeline construction to connect existing wells is still active, however.	13	1
201512	635	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Residential real estate markets continued to improve at a moderate pace.	13	1
201512	636	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	We hear that some homebuyers are entering the market anticipating rate increases ahead, but shortages of buildable lots and labor are said to be driving up costs and limiting single-family construction activity.	13	1
201512	637	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Our bankers say that demand for credit is growing and credit quality is improving, but competition is still fierce for good borrowers.	13	1
201512	638	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	They say that TRID, the new closing document requirement, is increasing mortgage origination costs, and that it is going to be difficult for small community banks to afford to do any mortgage lending.	13	1
201512	639	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	The struggle to find qualified workers continues across a range of occupations.	13	1
201512	640	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	My favorite anecdote this time is that construction companies are posting armed guards at work sites to discourage the poaching of construction crews.	13	1
201512	641	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	And, finally, in the category of “be careful what you wish for,” we hear of sizable hiring plans at large D.C. law firms.	13	1
201512	642	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the outlook has not changed much since our previous meeting.	13	1
201512	643	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I’ll touch on just a few significant developments.	13	1
201512	644	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	First, consumer spending is obviously the key to the outlook.	13	1
201512	645	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Although the reports on real PCE were weak in September and October, there were quirks each month that reduced their signal value, and retail sales ex gasoline were up significantly in November.	13	1
201512	646	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I expect consumer spending to continue to grow at around 3 percent for at least another year, bolstered by strong income growth, good job prospects, and a solid household balance sheet.	13	1
201512	647	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Second, we are seeing some signs of increasing wage growth in the data, and that fits well with the many reports we have seen about shortages of skilled workers and growing wage pressures.	13	1
201512	648	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible now that we will see a pickup in wage gains next year, something that should support a healthy household sector.	13	1
201512	649	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Third, the federal budget agreement should provide a direct boost to overall economic activity next year.	13	1
201512	650	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Not only does it add to outlays in the near term, but, as I said, some firms in our District report that it reduces uncertainty, a development that should itself encourage spending.	13	1
201512	651	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	One source of concern of late is that manufacturing diffusion indexes have been noticeably soft, including our own Fifth District index.	13	1
201512	652	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, though, the Board’s industrial production index for manufacturing as a whole has been rising at a modest pace.	13	1
201512	653	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thinking about how those two types of sources aggregate disparate sectors, I am more confident in the Board’s index, so I share the staff’s view that total manufacturing output should continue to advance even in the face of further strength in the dollar.	13	1
201512	654	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	In sum, recent developments line up well with the Tealbook’s forecast of above-trend real GDP growth next year.	13	1
201512	655	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I wrote down 2.4 percent, which is not that far from the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	656	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I part company with the staff a bit on the near-term inflation outlook, however.	13	1
201512	657	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	In the absence of shocks, I think it is reasonable to look for headline and core inflation to make substantial progress toward 2 percent next year.	13	1
201512	658	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	In any case, there is substantial uncertainty about the inflation outlook over the next two years, and we need to keep this in mind as we craft language on policy guidance.	13	1
201512	659	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201512	660	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	661	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201512	662	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	663	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	The declines in energy prices and farm incomes continue to weigh heavily on the Tenth District economy.	13	1
201512	664	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Oil prices have retreated further since our previous meeting, and our industry contacts now expect oil prices to remain depressed or to drop even further in the first half of 2016 before recovering somewhat in the second half.	13	1
201512	665	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, another round of steep capital spending cuts and associated layoffs are expected.	13	1
201512	666	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Several District energy firms also have had their credit downgraded further in recent weeks, and contacts expect more consolidation and defaults in 2016.	13	1
201512	667	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Headwinds due to supply and demand factors have also created a more pessimistic outlook for farm income since the previous meeting.	13	1
201512	668	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Crop prices remain 10 percent below year- ago levels, and we are approximately 35 percent below the five-year average following reports of near-record domestic production.	13	1
201512	669	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Additionally, cattle prices have fallen.	13	1
201512	670	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Little improvement is expected in the near term, as global demand for US agricultural and food exports has declined in 2015 about 10 percent as a result of the strong dollar and increased competition from other major agricultural and food exporters.	13	1
201512	671	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Our District manufacturing survey has slipped back below the breakeven level of 50 after two months of showing signs of stabilizing.	13	1
201512	672	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Activity is lowest in Oklahoma, but even less energy-intensive states are showing some signs of softening.	13	1
201512	673	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Despite the headwinds arising from commodity price behavior, we continue to see strength in other areas.	13	1
201512	674	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Based on our surveys, the strongest employment gains are expected in the high-tech services and transportation sectors.	13	1
201512	675	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Some employment gains are also expected in the real estate sector as home prices continue to appreciate across the District and home inventory levels remain low.	13	1
201512	676	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, I expect growth of around 2 percent in 2015 despite notable drags due to weakness in net exports and lower investment in the energy sector.	13	1
201512	677	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, my forecast is for growth of 2½ percent next year, as global growth is expected to be modestly higher than this year and the headwinds generated by a high foreign exchange value of the dollar begin to wane.	13	1
201512	678	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Conditions generally look favorable for solid consumption growth.	13	1
201512	679	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	As household balance sheets have improved, the savings rate is high compared with the past few years.	13	1
201512	680	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	House prices are rising, wage growth is showing some signs of improving, and gasoline prices are low.	13	1
201512	681	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Even so, it is worth considering how much more headroom consumers may have, especially given the brisk pace of auto sales.	13	1
201512	682	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Durable consumption has historically been about 12 percent of total consumption following recessions and then rises to about 14 percent as an expansion matures.	13	1
201512	683	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Currently, durables represent about 11 percent of total consumption, suggesting, perhaps, that some upside potential exists in terms of durable goods consumption.	13	1
201512	684	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Also, I have noted that the average age of durable goods remains somewhat high compared with before the crisis.	13	1
201512	685	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	My forecast for the unemployment rate relies on some further improvement in the labor market, although the decline in participation of prime-age males seems unlikely to substantially reverse.	13	1
201512	686	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	In 2010, 14 percent of prime-age males hadn’t worked within the past year.	13	1
201512	687	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	This percentage is virtually unchanged today.	13	1
201512	688	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	In contrast, from 2010 to 2015, the share of these detached workers who haven’t worked in the past five years increased from 50 percent to 61 percent.	13	1
201512	689	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	The rise in detachment during a period of labor market improvement suggests that deeper structural obstacles exist that may not be easily overcome by a cyclical improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201512	690	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of wages, we are seeing some signs of faster wage growth after controlling for compositional effects.	13	1
201512	691	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	For example, using the Current Population Survey, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta wage tracker follows individual workers and shows that average annual wages have increased from less than 2 percent in 2010 to about 3½ percent for prime-age workers.	13	1
201512	692	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Along these same lines, the latest NFIB survey shows a sharp increase in the number of firms planning to raise wages.	13	1
201512	693	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to inflation, there have been considerable disinflationary pressures generated by the commodity price decline and dollar appreciation over the past year.	13	1
201512	694	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	From the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year, WTI prices fell 52 percent, more than they have ever fallen in periods other than postwar US recessions.	13	1
201512	695	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Over this period, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, of course, has also sharply appreciated.	13	1
201512	696	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	My staff estimates that the simultaneous drag generated by these outsized movements in both commodity prices and the dollar are subtracting about 45 basis points from core PCE inflation, an estimate that is similar to what the Chair reported in a recent speech but using a somewhat different approach.	13	1
201512	697	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Without these headwinds, core inflation looks to be running at almost 1¾ percent.	13	1
201512	698	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Another factor that supports my confidence that inflation will rise is the stability of long- term survey-based inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	699	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	My own preferred survey measure is the five-year, five-year-ahead forecast of PCE inflation.	13	1
201512	700	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	This measure edged up to 2.1 percent from 2 percent in the first half of this year and has since remained relatively stable.	13	1
201512	701	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Although the University of Michigan survey of longer-term inflation expectations has edged down, this survey appears to be more sensitive to the drop in gasoline prices and is not necessarily a sign that longer-term inflation expectations have declined to a level inconsistent with our 2 percent goal.	13	1
201512	702	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	703	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	704	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201512	705	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	706	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As a final sounding of my District’s contacts before the possible liftoff decision at this meeting, my team met with a large number of business leaders across the Sixth District.	13	1
201512	707	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The spread of interviews was fairly representative of the national industrial mix.	13	1
201512	708	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Businesses appear to be ready for and supportive of a rate increase coming from this meeting.	13	1
201512	709	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This support seemed to be based on a broadly held view that business activity is expanding at more or less the same moderate pace that we’ve seen for most of the recovery.	13	1
201512	710	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, I would characterize the outlook of the majority of our contacts as “restrained optimism.”	13	1
201512	711	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Major employers indicated that demand for workers continues to grow, and wage growth appears to be firming.	13	1
201512	712	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Pockets of softness were reported, as expected, in regions and industries with concentrations in oil exploration and refining.	13	1
201512	713	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Companies with significant ties to commodity production also reported slowing, as did some manufacturing firms.	13	1
201512	714	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Continuing heightened inventory levels were mentioned frequently as a potential source of production weakness in the near term.	13	1
201512	715	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This contrasts somewhat with the Tealbook’s more benign view of the inventory situation.	13	1
201512	716	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Even in the auto industry, whose sales are very strong, we heard concern about inventory trends.	13	1
201512	717	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Our director, who heads the nation’s largest auto retailer, mentioned a recent surge in inventories partially fueled by imports.	13	1
201512	718	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Apparently, auto manufacturers with global operations had been redirecting shipments to the United States as the market they consider as having the best prospects for excess global inventory absorption.	13	1
201512	719	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	He offered the opinion that, in the near term, the pace of sales can absorb the heightened inventories, but he expressed concern about whether the historic high sales pace is sustainable.	13	1
201512	720	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Although earlier in the year we heard references to logistics bottlenecks—most prominently the Long Beach port strike—as contributing to the inventory buildup.	13	1
201512	721	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In this cycle, we heard more emphasis on disappointing sales.	13	1
201512	722	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In that regard, consumer spending reports were mixed.	13	1
201512	723	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Several contacts said they expect significant price discounting in coming weeks to move unsold stocks.	13	1
201512	724	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding business investment, our chair, who participates in the Business Roundtable, noted a downshift in the composite business outlook of the group and, with that, a sharp reduction in anticipated capital expenditures over the next six months.	13	1
201512	725	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Despite some concerns, most of our contacts are expecting continued moderate expansion of business activities.	13	1
201512	726	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	They are seeing the glass as half full.	13	1
201512	727	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Along with their support for liftoff, we heard broad support for taking a cautious approach to the pace of normalization until underlying points of strength in business conditions can be confirmed.	13	1
201512	728	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In my outlook for the US economy, I’ve lowered my forecast of near-term real GDP growth a little, in order to reflect the cautious sentiment we detected along with the mixed data picture.	13	1
201512	729	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This puts my growth outlook pretty much into line with this meeting’s Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201512	730	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve also lowered our projection of headline inflation for 2016, as has the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	731	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We recently surveyed businesses once again about their “business-input inflation” expectations.	13	1
201512	732	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	While cost expectations of firms are more or less unchanged from earlier surveys, we picked up notable differences in perspective from industry to industry.	13	1
201512	733	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Our data on businesses in the retail industry and manufacturing showed slippage in year-ahead cost expectations compared with this time last year.	13	1
201512	734	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We’re not prepared to conclude that these moves are an early signal of a more broadly based downshift in inflation expectations of businesses, but they may be an additional cautionary note regarding inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	735	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In updating my forecast for this meeting’s SEP submission, the trend of inflation expectation readings was hard to ignore.	13	1
201512	736	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Six months ago, we were getting different readings from financial markets and household surveys.	13	1
201512	737	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, it’s my sense that the various indicators of inflation expectations are more in alignment, and so it’s a little harder to claim that expectations remain anchored at levels near the Committee’s target.	13	1
201512	738	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In my projections for 2016, even as I’ve lowered my estimate of headline inflation, I’m treating recently softening inflation expectations as representing a risk to the outlook.	13	1
201512	739	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Consistent with that treatment, my balance of risk perspective has the risks to growth and employment as balanced, while I have inflation risks showing a downside bias.	13	1
201512	740	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	741	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	742	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201512	743	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	744	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Information received from District contacts since the previous FOMC meeting suggests that overall economic conditions continue to improve at a modest pace.	13	1
201512	745	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Results from our business outlook survey in the District were consistent with improving conditions but did not show signs of accelerating growth.	13	1
201512	746	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Preliminary District employment data through October have been stronger than in previous months and consistent with modest job growth.	13	1
201512	747	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Two notable business developments in the District were Ford’s $1.3 billion investment in the Louisville Ford truck plant and St Jude Medical’s announcement of a $9 billion investment in Memphis.	13	1
201512	748	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Each project is estimated to bring about 2,000 jobs to the local area.	13	1
201512	749	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The unemployment rate in the District measured across metropolitan statistical areas is 4.9 percent based on the latest reading, just below the current national unemployment rate and consistent with the Committee’s median view of the long-run rate of unemployment for the nation.	13	1
201512	750	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal information received from District hiring managers continues to suggest building wage pressures.	13	1
201512	751	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Comments from directors across a variety of industries suggest that 2016 wage pools are being set to produce wage increases of about 3 percent—that’s in a world of low inflation and low productivity growth.	13	1
201512	752	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Nationally, the strong real GDP growth registered in the second quarter of 2015 does not appear to be carrying over into the second half of the year.	13	1
201512	753	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The evolving data, as well as the consensus of most forecasters, suggest that the moderate growth and low inflation registered in the third quarter will carry into the fourth quarter.	13	1
201512	754	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the average of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’s three nowcasts is 2.3 percent real GDP growth in the fourth quarter.	13	1
201512	755	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	In short, real GDP growth during the second half of 2015 has not materialized as we in St Louis expected.	13	1
201512	756	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we have reduced our growth expectations further, and we now stand at a real GDP growth forecast broadly similar to private forecasters for 2016, around 2¾ percent.	13	1
201512	757	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning unemployment, we have been more optimistic than the median of this Committee and, hence, more accurate during the past three years.	13	1
201512	758	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We continue to be more optimistic and have penciled in a 4.3 percent unemployment rate for the end of 2016.	13	1
201512	759	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We think this is very reasonable provided growth comes in at 2½ to 3 percent for 2016.	13	1
201512	760	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	This forecast is more aggressive than the Tealbook and most private forecasters, but most forecasters have underestimated the pace of improvement in labor market outcomes over the past several years.	13	1
201512	761	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Should job gains continue to average 200,000 a month, this would be far above the pace necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant.	13	1
201512	762	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we think the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall in 2016.	13	1
201512	763	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Domestic inflation readings continue to be difficult to interpret as a result of continuing turmoil in international energy and commodities markets.	13	1
201512	764	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We have been expecting oil prices to stabilize and that, given the current pace of increase in other prices, headline inflation would return to target rather mechanically during 2016.	13	1
201512	765	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is still our baseline, but further declines in crude oil prices in recent days bear careful watching.	13	1
201512	766	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to see lower crude oil prices as a bullish factor for the US economy, as I think it is inconsistent to argue that it’s both a negative factor when oil prices go up and when they go down.	13	1
201512	767	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We have to choose one or the other.	13	1
201512	768	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think having lower oil prices is a bullish factor for the US economy.	13	1
201512	769	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, renewed oil price declines may delay the return of headline inflation to target.	13	1
201512	770	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We have, accordingly, moderated our inflation forecast in the current SEP round.	13	1
201512	771	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We still expect a modest overshooting of the Committee’s inflation target, with headline PCE inflation peaking at 2.1 percent year over year by the end of 2016 and stabilizing at 2 percent thereafter, provided this Committee pursues the appropriate level of policy accommodation over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201512	772	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The extent of this overshooting has been tempered relative to previous forecasts and, in addition, has been pushed further into the future.	13	1
201512	773	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I see recent oil price declines as a downside risk to this inflation forecast, but I’m not willing to adjust the forecast further on the basis of the information available as of today.	13	1
201512	774	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Our current inflation forecast is now closer to the SPF forecast than it has been but above the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	775	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Again, I think this is reasonable provided that growth comes in at 2½ to 3 percent in 2016 and unemployment falls below 4½ percent.	13	1
201512	776	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Considering underlying measures of inflation, I continue to think that our so-called core inflation is not the right measure and that continued focus on this is doing a disservice to US monetary policy.	13	1
201512	777	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	As Governor Fischer and, just now, President George and many others have pointed out, in the current episode of dramatic crude oil price declines, core inflation, despite the exclusion of food and energy prices, has still been importantly affected by the large energy price movement, enough to take several tenths off the year-over-year inflation rate.	13	1
201512	778	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Better measures of underlying trend inflation are available and should assume more prominence in the Committee’s decisionmaking.	13	1
201512	779	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	A possible contender is the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s trimmed mean PCE inflation rate, which is currently running at 1.7 percent year over year.	13	1
201512	780	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is only three-tenths below the Committee’s goal and is likely to rise gradually over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201512	781	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	This suggests that the Committee’s inflation goal is close to being met.	13	1
201512	782	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Another possibility would be the so-called sticky-price CPI, which came up today, at 2.4 percent year over year.	13	1
201512	783	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The sticky-price CPI has the advantage of theoretical backing in the New Keynesian literature, which says that it’s the sticky prices you should worry about in an economy in which sticky prices are the key friction.	13	1
201512	784	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	New Keynesian ideas influence a lot of the thinking around this table.	13	1
201512	785	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation expectations have continued to deteriorate, and this is a concern to me, but these declines remain closely correlated with movements in global dollar oil prices and perhaps cannot be interpreted in a straightforward way at the current juncture.	13	1
201512	786	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I remain in a wait-and-see mode with respect to measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	787	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	788	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	789	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13	1
201512	790	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	791	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Our District, with the exception of manufacturing, has seen a slight pickup in activity since our previous meeting.	13	1
201512	792	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing remains a soft spot for our general activity index, which returned to negative territory in December.	13	1
201512	793	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Like the nation, we have seen resumed momentum in labor markets, with acceleration in employment growth and declines in the unemployment rate.	13	1
201512	794	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	There’s also limited evidence of a slight increase in the pace of wage growth.	13	1
201512	795	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	On the upside, autos have been flying off the showroom floor, and construction growth has been relatively solid.	13	1
201512	796	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Overall, I would continue to categorize growth in the Third District as modest.	13	1
201512	797	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Looking at employment growth in a bit more detail:  October jobs data were strong in both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with most of the growth concentrated in service-sector jobs.	13	1
201512	798	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth has now accelerated to the national average, and participation rates have stabilized at around 62.9 percent.	13	1
201512	799	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Employment in mining and drilling has declined over the past three months but is still up year over year.	13	1
201512	800	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Notably, the tristate unemployment rate declined three-tenths of a percent in October to 5.2 percent.	13	1
201512	801	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	One interesting feature of the labor market in my region is that Delaware is experiencing a persistent increase in labor force growth driven in part by the reentry of workers into the labor force.	13	1
201512	802	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I don’t know whether this behavior will remain special to Delaware or prove to be a harbinger of a more general labor market development, but it’s worth noting that Delaware has proven to be a first state in at least one other historically significant event—go Blue Hens.	13	1
201512	803	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Indicators of Third District manufacturing activity continue to indicate weakness.	13	1
201512	804	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The current activity index in our December Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey, which will be released Thursday morning, came in at minus 5.9, down from 1.9 in November—indicating that activity is slightly negative, a condition that’s now prevailed for the past four months.	13	1
201512	805	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	We did see a pickup in shipments, but it was ever so slight.	13	1
201512	806	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	However, indicators of future activity, although still solidly in positive territory, declined significantly from 43.4 to 23.0, and that number is now slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13	1
201512	807	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	On the other hand, activity in the service sector remains robust.	13	1
201512	808	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In our nonmanufacturing business survey, the general activity index in November remained close to its nonrecessionary average, coming in at 26.3, down somewhat from its October reading.	13	1
201512	809	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Respondents remain upbeat, with the future activity indexes remaining solidly in positive territory.	13	1
201512	810	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	An initial report received from a contact regarding activity on Black Friday indicated that crowd volumes were higher than they had seen in several years and that shoppers were socializing less, were more focused on shopping, and were handling multiple bags of merchandise.	13	1
201512	811	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Subsequent reports of holiday shopping activity in the District have been somewhat mixed.	13	1
201512	812	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	However, auto dealers are reporting brisk sales, and one executive indicated that consumers are using the fall in gas prices to upgrade the class of vehicles they are buying.	13	1
201512	813	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	This behavior was particularly influencing sales of larger SUVs.	13	1
201512	814	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In real estate, housing and construction are showing modest improvements largely driven by the growth in multifamily housing units.	13	1
201512	815	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The single-family housing sector of the market remains lackluster, and house price appreciation in the region lags that of the nation.	13	1
201512	816	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In the pricing arena, there appear to be distinct differences across sectors.	13	1
201512	817	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In manufacturing there is very little evidence of price pressures, with the indexes for both prices received and paid coming in negative in the December Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey.	13	1
201512	818	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The opposite was true in the nonmanufacturing survey, with the analogous indexes experiencing increases that accelerated somewhat in November.	13	1
201512	819	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	This dichotomy carried over into our inaugural firm price expectation survey, which measured next-year price forecasts for own prices, compensation, and overall inflation.	13	1
201512	820	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The median forecast among manufacturers was for their own prices to rise 1 percent in the fourth quarter of next year compared with the prices they charge this quarter, while the comparable forecast for nonmanufacturers was 3 percent.	13	1
201512	821	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Regarding total compensation, the median expected change for both sets of respondents was an increase of 3 percent, and both groups anticipated that consumer inflation would rise 2 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter.	13	1
201512	822	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	However, although wages are expected to rise at a somewhat faster pace for selected skills, few firms will be increasing wages at a significant pace for all workers.	13	1
201512	823	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Also, a much larger fraction of firms are reporting difficulty finding workers with the required skills compared with six months ago.	13	1
201512	824	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, I believe that the real economy remains healthy.	13	1
201512	825	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	My forecast is for the economy to grow at 2.2 percent in 2015, accelerating a bit to 2.5 percent in 2016, then growing at 2.4 percent and 2.3 percent in 2017 and 2018, respectively.	13	1
201512	826	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I see Q4 unemployment at 5 percent, but I see the rate dipping to 4.8 percent in 2016 before gradually rising to 5.0 percent in 2018.	13	1
201512	827	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	With regard to inflation, I see both headline and core measures gradually returning to target.	13	1
201512	828	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Next year, I foresee a considerable bounceback in inflation as the effects of falling oil prices and dollar appreciation dissipate.	13	1
201512	829	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I anticipate that headline PCE inflation will be 1.6 percent in 2016 and reach our target by 2018, and that core PCE inflation will be 1.7 percent next year and will not reach target until sometime in 2018.	13	1
201512	830	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, my forecast is a tad weaker on unemployment and slightly more optimistic on growth than the Board staff’s forecast in the Tealbook, but generally the overall contour is not appreciably different, at least in any meaningful statistical sense.	13	1
201512	831	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The last comment I’d like to make as we approach liftoff is that I’d like to raise concerns with respect to the phrase “data dependency.”	13	1
201512	832	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Although the Committee has been careful to emphasize that it is the trend in data, not any one data point, that matters in forming policy, this is, as we know, oftentimes overlooked by the media and the public.	13	1
201512	833	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In particular, over the recent past, there has been a tendency for Q1 data to come in on the weak side perhaps as a result of residual seasonality.	13	1
201512	834	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	As we go forward, I believe it will be important to look at the data very broadly as we interpret and publicly discuss the consequences of our actions.	13	1
201512	835	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	836	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	837	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break at this point and grab some coffee and some fruit outside.	13	1
201512	838	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We’re doing very well.	13	1
201512	839	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we return at 25 after.	13	1
201512	840	2015-12-16	meeting		[Coffee break]	13	1
201512	841	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started again.	13	1
201512	842	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201512	843	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	844	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The tone of my discussions with business leaders this time was cautious to downright pessimistic, but perhaps this reflects their industrial mix.	13	1
201512	845	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I talked to a number of manufacturers with big international exposures.	13	1
201512	846	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Conditions are particularly bad in the steel industry.	13	1
201512	847	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Prices of some of their benchmark products are down about 40 percent from a year ago, and one of my directors mentioned that a couple of large firms may be in serious financial trouble.	13	1
201512	848	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The heavy equipment manufacturers remain quite downbeat and for some time have been laying off workers in response to persistent low demand for mining and agricultural equipment.	13	1
201512	849	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	My steel and heavy equipment contacts did hope to see a pickup in demand for construction-related inputs and machinery in the spring and noted that the highway bill should help.	13	1
201512	850	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I guess this is another Federal Reserve stimulus program.	13	1
201512	851	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13	1
201512	852	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Looking ahead, manufacturers and my other contacts with global business presence generally see Western Europe coming off the bottom.	13	1
201512	853	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	China should either stabilize or pick up in part as a result of recent fiscal measures there, and South America, particularly Brazil, is expected to remain a mess.	13	1
201512	854	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The bright spot in my District is the auto industry.	13	1
201512	855	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Of course, sales have been quite strong the past few months, and Ford, for one, is expecting only a modest slowdown in 2016 from the industry’s recent pace.	13	1
201512	856	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Their forecast is premised on only a gradual tightening in financial conditions.	13	1
201512	857	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Something more rapid would likely hit car payments in a big enough way that consumers would delay purchases or buy less-expensive models.	13	1
201512	858	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Outside the auto area, the news about the consumer has been okay but not robust.	13	1
201512	859	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	For example, my director from Discover credit cards reported just moderate increases in sales and credit usage.	13	1
201512	860	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	With regard to wages and prices, a number of my directors reported wage gains, but these were largely for upper- and some lower-tiered workers.	13	1
201512	861	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The segment in the middle continues to miss out.	13	1
201512	862	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Ford characterized the UAW contracts as a bit expensive on wages and bonuses.	13	1
201512	863	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	They expected some higher wage spillover upstream to parts suppliers.	13	1
201512	864	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	However, in return for higher payouts, Ford will receive some offsetting productivity-enhancing changes in work rules.	13	1
201512	865	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Outside these few wage reports, I’ve not heard a thing about cost pressures or increasing prices.	13	1
201512	866	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	In financial markets, our contacts’ basic message was that credit conditions have tightened somewhat since the previous FOMC meeting, and here I should mention that all of our calls were made before last week’s problems in high-yield markets.	13	1
201512	867	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Of course, our contacts noted that spreads are up, and they’ve risen more since then.	13	1
201512	868	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	They attributed these earlier increases in part to a reduction of liquidity in corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, but mostly the increases seemed to reflect repricing of high-yield debt, especially debt rated triple-C and below.	13	1
201512	869	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We also heard of somewhat tighter credit conditions in commercial real estate, especially for new construction loans, and there most notably in the multifamily sector.	13	1
201512	870	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Overall, as of last week, our contacts’ perception was that we are seeing a healthy repricing of riskier assets and not an unwarranted reduction in credit availability.	13	1
201512	871	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	One caveat with regard to this assessment is that our small business financing contact at PayNet noted a sharp drop in their small business lending index in October.	13	1
201512	872	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	This seems like something to keep an eye on.	13	1
201512	873	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	After all, as my large corporate contacts tell me they are either maintaining employment levels or laying off workers, I have been speculating that small and medium-size enterprises are currently a source of strength nationally.	13	1
201512	874	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Turning to the national outlook, on balance, the incoming data on spending have been a bit softer than we projected in our September SEP submission.	13	1
201512	875	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We’ve lowered our forecast of growth by a few tenths over the next year or so.	13	1
201512	876	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We now see GDP growth averaging in the 2¼ to 2½ percent range over the projection period.	13	1
201512	877	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Although this is faster than the Tealbook, our assumptions regarding potential GDP growth also were a few tenths higher.	13	1
201512	878	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We see resource gaps closing in 2017 and then the economy running only a bit above potential in 2018.	13	1
201512	879	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	So my outlook does not have output overshooting potential to the same degree as the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	880	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We made no material changes to our inflation forecast.	13	1
201512	881	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	It looks similar to the Tealbook, with inflation slowly moving up close to target by the end of the projection period.	13	1
201512	882	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I did want to note President Bullard’s comment about core inflation rates and trimmed mean PCE—I have not studied this carefully, but my staff had looked at the average inflation experience over some longer period of time.	13	1
201512	883	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	For the period from 1984 to the present, trimmed mean PCE inflation is about two-tenths higher than both total PCE and core PCE inflation, which are exactly 2.3 percent, on average, over that time period.	13	1
201512	884	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	So there quite likely could be some wedge in there, and at least over that longer period of time, it was higher.	13	1
201512	885	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	It’s something to keep in mind, as it’s higher than our target inflation rate measured by the increase in total PCE prices.	13	1
201512	886	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	My forecast is predicated on the key assumption that policy rates rise at a very gradual pace and that the Committee strongly communicates its state-dependent expectation that rates will follow such a gradual path.	13	1
201512	887	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	FOMC communications should also make clear the Committee’s strong commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201512	888	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	We should actively disabuse the public of any wrong impression that 2 percent is a ceiling.	13	1
201512	889	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Reaffirming our symmetric objective would solidify the upward pull on actual inflation from inflationary expectations.	13	1
201512	890	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Without this commitment to symmetry, our Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago outlook would not be projecting inflation to rise to target over the forecast period.	13	1
201512	891	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I will also note that, largely to better reflect the reality of our Committee communications, I changed my policy rate assumptions in the SEP to have liftoff occurring tomorrow instead of in June 2016.	13	1
201512	892	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	My policy assumption includes only two moves next year and then about 100 basis point increases in both 2017 and 2018.	13	1
201512	893	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	This policy rate path is premised on the assumption that by late next year, core inflation will finally be making some visible progress toward target and real economic activity will have continued to grow moderately above trend.	13	1
201512	894	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	These developments should give us more confidence that the equilibrium real interest rate is moving up as well.	13	1
201512	895	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	This is a crucial state-dependent feature of my overall economic projection.	13	1
201512	896	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	If we do not reach these data markers next year, then I would find it necessary to reassess the policy rate path needed to achieve our dual-mandate goals.	13	1
201512	897	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	And I believe we should clearly communicate such state dependence now.	13	1
201512	898	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	The public needs clear guidance beyond our decision tomorrow.	13	1
201512	899	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	900	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	901	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201512	902	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13	1
201512	903	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I have been very encouraged by recent labor market developments.	13	1
201512	904	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Robust job gains in October and November have brought average monthly employment growth for the year to 210,000, bringing moderate further increases in resource utilization.	13	1
201512	905	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And the continued subdued rates of nominal wage growth suggest some further slack may remain.	13	1
201512	906	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Among the various measures of nominal wage growth, the ECI provides the best overall measure.	13	1
201512	907	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It is comprehensive in terms of the types of compensation it includes, representative of the “universe” of firms, and the least subject to shifts in the industry and occupation of workers.	13	1
201512	908	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The ECI measure increased only 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in September, little different from the average pace of increase over the recovery.	13	1
201512	909	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Similarly, the most recent 12-month gain in average hourly earnings, at 2.3 percent, is only slightly above this average pace.	13	1
201512	910	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, compensation per hour in the business sector rose 3½ percent over the past year, a substantial step-up from the preceding year.	13	1
201512	911	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	However, this series is quite volatile, and its previous history suggests that rates of increase should move lower in the period ahead.	13	1
201512	912	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	With overall unemployment already low at 5 percent, the continuing subdued rate of wage gains naturally raises the question, where are the margins of remaining slack?	13	1
201512	913	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In this regard, a number of labor market experts have noted that the employment-to-population ratio for 25- to 54-year-olds remains 2½ percentage points below its average level in 2007 and is only halfway back to its level before the recession.	13	1
201512	914	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Most of the shortfall reflects lower rates of labor force participation.	13	1
201512	915	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, it is difficult to judge the extent to which secular or cyclical forces are depressing the participation rate for this group, but several factors suggest that at least some portion of this shortfall may be cyclical.	13	1
201512	916	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	First, historically, employment rates for this group have been quite high, close to 90 percent for men and over 70 percent for women, suggesting a strong desire for employment among this age group.	13	1
201512	917	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, individuals out of the labor force tend to respond to any improvement in labor market conditions with a lag because of transition costs of moving to employment from other activities such as schooling or child care.	13	1
201512	918	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	So recovery along this margin could reasonably be expected to lag conditions in the labor market.	13	1
201512	919	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, gauges of the attractiveness of the labor market, such as job finding rates, quits rates, and wages, have improved more slowly than the unemployment rate, holding out hope that there is room for further improvements in those conditions to attract workers back into the labor force.	13	1
201512	920	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, the share of employees working part time for economic reasons, at 4 percent, also remains about 1 percentage point above pre-recession norms.	13	1
201512	921	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, although some of this higher level may be due to structural changes, some portion may reflect a cyclical shortfall.	13	1
201512	922	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Along with this encouraging improvement in the labor market, domestic demand continues to increase at a moderate pace.	13	1
201512	923	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on consumer spending have been close to expectations—with auto sales, in particular, remaining strong—and real PCE looks to increase nearly 3 percent this year, similar to last year’s pace and up noticeably from earlier in the recovery.	13	1
201512	924	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, some of the supports for consumer spending are likely to moderate or diminish in the period ahead.	13	1
201512	925	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	For instance, asset prices have reached or exceeded gauges of historical levels, so future gains in wealth will likely be more moderate than earlier in the recovery.	13	1
201512	926	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Similarly, credit conditions have mostly normalized.	13	1
201512	927	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, the strength in consumer spending over the medium term is likely to depend on further improvement in the labor market and, in particular, on a pickup in wage growth.	13	1
201512	928	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, government purchases are likely to increase somewhat next year, given the recently passed bipartisan Budget Act.	13	1
201512	929	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	But even with this boost, the contribution of government purchases to aggregate demand will remain relatively modest.	13	1
201512	930	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast to consumption, private fixed investment has decelerated from earlier in the recovery as pent-up demand for capital has waned.	13	1
201512	931	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Most recently, weakness in the energy sector has weighed on investment.	13	1
201512	932	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And with the recent step-down in oil prices, this weakness will be more persistent than previously forecast.	13	1
201512	933	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Developments on the second leg of our dual mandate have been significantly less encouraging.	13	1
201512	934	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation has remained persistently below our 2 percent target for six years now despite substantial monetary accommodation.	13	1
201512	935	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the end of 2009, PCE inflation has averaged 1.4 percent, while core PCE inflation has averaged 1.5 percent.	13	1
201512	936	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Over this period, we have had 70 readings on the 12-month change in core PCE.	13	1
201512	937	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In only four months has the rate been above 2 percent, and in these four months inflation was 2.1 percent or less.	13	1
201512	938	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent price data give little hint that this undershooting of our target will end any time soon.	13	1
201512	939	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there may be reasons to expect inflation to rise gradually over the medium term, the forces that have kept it below our target have been remarkably persistent.	13	1
201512	940	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, on the basis of the descriptions of the alternative simulations in the Tealbook, it is noteworthy how hard you have to work to generate rates of inflation that exceed 2 percent in 2017 and 2018.	13	1
201512	941	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The Phillips curve remains inert, a tiny fraction of its former self.	13	1
201512	942	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	There are also some hints that the persistent underperformance of inflation may be beginning to have some effect on inflation expectations, as some others have noted.	13	1
201512	943	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although survey data had remained fairly steady, some recent readings have drifted lower.	13	1
201512	944	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Projections in the Survey of Professional Forecasters suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 2012.	13	1
201512	945	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past year, the median 5- to 10-year-ahead inflation expectation in the Michigan survey has averaged 2.7 percent, below the average reading over the past 10 years, and the preliminary December reading was 2.6 percent.	13	1
201512	946	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This edging down in survey measures follows pronounced and persistent deterioration in market-based measures.	13	1
201512	947	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on TIPS and nominal Treasury yields, as well as swaps, show that inflation compensation has remained near the very low levels reached at the beginning of this year.	13	1
201512	948	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Overall, these data, together with the persistent underperformance of actual inflation, raise some risk that inflation expectations could deteriorate.	13	1
201512	949	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I would note in that regard that roughly half of the SEP submissions now assess risks to core inflation as tilted to the downside, and, of course, I am among that half.	13	1
201512	950	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, although the risks from the domestic components of aggregate demand appear roughly balanced overall, I continue to be concerned about downside risk arising from the foreign outlook.	13	1
201512	951	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although recent data suggest some improvement in foreign growth in the third quarter, growth is still very low, and risks remain, as evidenced by the recent volatility in commodities prices.	13	1
201512	952	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Growth in many advanced economies is quite feeble, despite unprecedented monetary accommodation.	13	1
201512	953	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on Japan have improved, but third-quarter growth was still only 1 percent.	13	1
201512	954	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In the euro area, GDP increased at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent last quarter, and challenges remain.	13	1
201512	955	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In Japan, fiscal constraints threaten to derail growth in coming years, and slow growth, along with elevated fiscal debts, make many other advanced economies vulnerable to adverse shocks.	13	1
201512	956	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Oil prices, as has been noted, have resumed their downward slide, with a further decline of 19 percent over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201512	957	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And although supply remains an important driver, the 10 percent further decline in metals prices suggests weak global demand is also at play.	13	1
201512	958	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This adds further terms-of-trade pressures to the complicated policy challenges facing many emerging markets that are contending with a significant slowing in economic growth following a prolonged period with elevated growth in private-sector debt.	13	1
201512	959	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Emerging market growth slowed from an average of nearly 5 percent from 2010 to 2013 to a little over 3 percent last year and to 2¼ percent in the first half of this year.	13	1
201512	960	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As you saw in the Tealbook, although growth has moved up somewhat last quarter to 3 percent, it still remains low.	13	1
201512	961	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	If economic growth remains low and exchange rate pressures rise, the ability to service some of the earlier accumulations in debt may be called into question and financial stresses may emerge.	13	1
201512	962	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The transition to slower growth in China, in particular, remains an important risk to global economic and financial conditions.	13	1
201512	963	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on economic activity have been mixed but overall suggest a continued gradual slowdown.	13	1
201512	964	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent weeks have seen evidence of increased foreign exchange intervention along with additional depreciation of the currency and a widening in the spread between the onshore and offshore currency markets.	13	1
201512	965	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Following the SDR announcement, the depreciation of the currency resumed at an accelerated pace, and we have seen a further 2 percent decline against the dollar in total during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201512	966	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Most recently, the PBOC’s suggestion of a shift to a weighted basket of currencies has raised some questions about possible further depreciation against the dollar.	13	1
201512	967	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The continued unsettled nature of the Chinese exchange rate arrangements pose risk of further volatility.	13	1
201512	968	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, with China accounting for over 20 percent in the trade-weighted dollar index, further downward movements in the renminbi against the dollar could have important knock-on effects.	13	1
201512	969	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, the intermeeting period has seen a further 2 percent increase in the real dollar, bringing total strengthening up to about 16 percent since the summer of last year.	13	1
201512	970	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the staff expects net exports to subtract a little over ½ percentage point from real GDP growth this year and 1 percentage point next year.	13	1
201512	971	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Further appreciation in response to weak foreign demand poses downside risks to this outlook and, conversely, dollar appreciation in response to stronger US growth may temper the impact of upside surprises here.	13	1
201512	972	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, it is worth referencing the earlier presentation on the proximity of the zero lower bound, which accentuates the asymmetry in the risks to the outlook arising from adverse developments, whether foreign or domestic.	13	1
201512	973	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As illustrated in the Tealbook, the federal funds rate has been cut by an average of 275 basis points over the five most moderate recessions since 1960.	13	1
201512	974	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	To the extent that the zero lower bound is a binding constraint, this implies a more severe recession in the event of an adverse shock.	13	1
201512	975	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	With the most recent Survey of Market Participants placing the probability of returning to the zero lower bound within the next two years at 25 percent, this is an important consideration.	13	1
201512	976	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I may be more cautious than others around this table about the feasibility or advisability of viewing negative interest rates and QE as regular parts of our peacetime policy toolkit.	13	1
201512	977	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe there are special costs and discontinuities associated with initiating such unconventional policies.	13	1
201512	978	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	979	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	980	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201512	981	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	982	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Before I read the Tealbook last week, I had expected it to show an unchanged or weaker outlook than was presented in October.	13	1
201512	983	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I had that impression, I suppose, mainly because the newspapers and outside forecasters and newsletters had seemed less than positive as of late, but I guess their job is to report the bad news more than the good news.	13	1
201512	984	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So I was pleased and a bit surprised to see that, in fact, the staff’s interpretation of recent events has led to a modest strengthening of their outlook.	13	1
201512	985	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Further, as I read the Tealbook, I found their version of how economic events might unfold to be reasonably persuasive.	13	1
201512	986	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Real GDP growth seems likely to continue to rise a little faster than 2 percent in the next few years, aided next year by a pickup in federal spending, and the unemployment rate seems likely to fall further.	13	1
201512	987	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	At the same time, inflation seems likely to rise, albeit slowly.	13	1
201512	988	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	That conclusion depends in significant part on forecasts of the price of oil.	13	1
201512	989	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	In the past month or so, the price of oil has declined from levels of about $50 per barrel, a value at which many had begun to think it would stabilize, to under $40 per barrel.	13	1
201512	990	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And with inventories high and OPEC no longer acting like a cartel, the price of oil may take longer to stabilize than had been anticipated until fairly recently.	13	1
201512	991	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The other key factor in forecasts of both inflation and output is the exchange rate, and it remains to be seen to what extent foreign exchange markets have priced in the impact of a possible change in the federal funds rate, a topic we discussed earlier in the day with the staff.	13	1
201512	992	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, I believe that inflation is likely to follow approximately the path that the staff forecast and the SEP see for it.	13	1
201512	993	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to mention three key elements in the staff forecast.	13	1
201512	994	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	They are, first, developments in the rest of the world; second, productivity growth; and third, r*.	13	1
201512	995	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the first point, economic performance in the rest of the world, the staff’s analysis is slightly more optimistic than it was a few months ago, with China apparently on the road to a growth rate of 6½ percent or more, and with some positive signs coming out of the euro area, with the staff expecting growth to return to 2 percent–plus within a year from now.	13	1
201512	996	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The ECB is clearly determined to run an accommodative monetary policy, which is far different than its behavior of a few years ago, and the euro-area economy is the second largest in the world.	13	1
201512	997	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, structural labor productivity growth over the period from 2011 to 2014 declined to an average annual rate of 0.8 percent, mainly as a result of a decline in multifactor productivity growth, which increased at a rate of only 0.1 percent per annum over that period.	13	1
201512	998	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	This year, the staff estimates that multifactor productivity growth will increase to just 0.3 percent, a rate that is expected to increase gradually to 0.7 percent by 2018.	13	1
201512	999	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	This projected increase in multifactor productivity accounts for the bulk of the increase in the staff forecast in structural labor productivity.	13	1
201512	1000	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And that increase is critical in returning potential output growth to close to 2 percent, despite the staff’s and everyone else’s predictions of continuing declines in the labor force participation rate and a slower growth of labor supply.	13	1
201512	1001	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	A third issue is the increase in the staff’s estimate of the Tealbook-consistent FRB/US- based r* estimate.	13	1
201512	1002	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	As shown on page 2 of Tealbook B, this estimate rose from 0.74 percent in October to 1.24 percent this round.	13	1
201512	1003	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	This is a reflection of the staff’s view that some factors, mainly fiscal spending, have boosted the underlying strength of the economy enough that we don’t need monetary policy to be as expansionary to close the output gap as we did the previous time we estimated r*.	13	1
201512	1004	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	That seems like a remarkably large upward revision in a forecast round in which the staff describes the revisions as a “modest upgrade.”	13	1
201512	1005	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	When we discussed with the staff how this revision compares with those in the past, it turns out that revisions are often in the range of 25 basis points and that a 50 basis point move like this one is not that rare.	13	1
201512	1006	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We had another one between July and September.	13	1
201512	1007	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Perhaps that underscores why using more than one measure of r* to gauge the stance of policy is good practice, and it also draws our attention to the fact that in the FRB/US model—and, I believe, in the real world—r* can be significantly affected by policies other than monetary policy.	13	1
201512	1008	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The fact that the modest upward revision in fiscal spending leads to a positive growth outcome takes me to another important point.	13	1
201512	1009	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We’re all typically reluctant to voice our views about the appropriate stance of fiscal policy because that isn’t our job and we shouldn’t presume to tell the Congress and the administration what to do.	13	1
201512	1010	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	But fiscal policy has a direct bearing on monetary policy.	13	1
201512	1011	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	If fiscal policy were substantially more supportive than it has been, we might have been able to get off the zero lower bound sooner and perhaps be further away from it when, inevitably, we are hit with another recessionary shock sometime in the future.	13	1
201512	1012	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, if the fiscal spending were put to good use, making investments in infrastructure and technology that will eventually boost productivity, that would also make the tradeoffs that the economy faces more appealing.	13	1
201512	1013	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t make fiscal policy, but fiscal policy can help significantly in producing growth, and we should consider how best to draw the attention of the policy community to this consequential point.	13	1
201512	1014	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’d also like, possibly for the second or third time, to discuss the frequent assertion that every central bank that raised its interest rate from the ZLB has had to return it to zero.	13	1
201512	1015	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’m one of those who raised the interest rate in 2009 and later reduced it.	13	1
201512	1016	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	There was nothing inevitable about the return to zero when it was raised.	13	1
201512	1017	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Israel began raising the interest rate in mid-2009, when the economy was growing well, and with inflation above the target range in large part because of increases in the price of housing.	13	1
201512	1018	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	That was the appropriate thing to do.	13	1
201512	1019	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then came the euro crisis.	13	1
201512	1020	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The Israeli economic situation deteriorated, and it became necessary to reduce the interest rate.	13	1
201512	1021	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s not clear to me what the message is of the much-quoted fact that countries that raise the interest rate from the lower bound later returned it to there.	13	1
201512	1022	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	By the same token, some years from now, we will be able to say that every country that reduced the interest rate to the zero lower bound later had to raise it from there.	13	1
201512	1023	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201512	1024	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	That would not mean that the rate should not have been reduced, but it might well mean that the emphasis on the rate having to be reduced by countries that had raised it is misplaced.	13	1
201512	1025	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The simple question we need to answer today is whether we should raise the interest rate from its current level.	13	1
201512	1026	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And I believe the considered answer to that question is “yes,” which we’ll talk about tomorrow.	13	1
201512	1027	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	My views do differ slightly from the Tealbook on the balance of risks.	13	1
201512	1028	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	On page 69 of Book A, the staff says that it says that it views the risk to the GDP outlook as “tilted somewhat to the downside.”	13	1
201512	1029	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that, if anything, the risks are slightly on the upside.	13	1
201512	1030	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Let me give a few factors.	13	1
201512	1031	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, by sending the message that the federal funds rate is not stuck at zero, we will be encouraging potential investors to invest now before interest rates rise again.	13	1
201512	1032	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And, as I think I also mentioned before, this was the subject of Ben Bernanke’s Ph.D. thesis.	13	1
201512	1033	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	It was about waiting to invest, a topic that was very important around the beginning of the 1980s when he wrote his thesis and when the economy didn’t seem to be getting off the dime.	13	1
201512	1034	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, while we focus with concern on the negative effects of the latest decline in the price of oil on inflation, we should also consider its effects on demand.	13	1
201512	1035	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The robust consumer spending in recent quarters, especially the strong auto sales in recent months, may well be strengthened by the continuing decline in energy prices.	13	1
201512	1036	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Third, if the modest upward movement we’ve seen in wage increases turns out to prove persistent as well, which is an upside risk, personal consumption expenditures in 2016 could turn out to be stronger than currently projected in the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	1037	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, over the longer term, it is quite possible that we will be surprised to the upside by productivity growth.	13	1
201512	1038	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	In a forum like this one, one thinks of Alan Greenspan in 1995 saying that he sensed that there was something going on with productivity, and one thinks also of Bob Solow saying that one sees computers everywhere except in the GDP data.	13	1
201512	1039	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The revolutionary changes in the way we live and work using mobile technologies, including powerful search engines for everything and the ways businesses are learning to harness robotics and machine intelligence, will eventually find their way into the productivity statistics.	13	1
201512	1040	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The delays may be long, but there is a decent upside risk that productivity growth will increase by more than we currently expect in the next few years.	13	1
201512	1041	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll say more on the consequences of all this in tomorrow’s remarks.	13	1
201512	1042	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1043	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1044	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13	1
201512	1045	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	13	1
201512	1046	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	To start, let me go back and go a little deeper on the energy sector.	13	1
201512	1047	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	A number have commented on it.	13	1
201512	1048	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, the overall tone has soured since the previous FOMC meeting.	13	1
201512	1049	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The attitude has now shifted to an even-lower-for-even- longer price outlook.	13	1
201512	1050	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We have all talked about the disarray in OPEC and the lack of any pretense of a production ceiling.	13	1
201512	1051	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Market participants that we talked to in the Eleventh District believe that Saudi Arabia is quite content with the results so far of their supply strategy.	13	1
201512	1052	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They are determined to maintain their market share, and certainly any reduction in supply from Saudi Arabia is going to have to be accompanied by proportionate declines from Russia and Middle Eastern nations, and that is really not feasible.	13	1
201512	1053	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So a reduction appears to be unlikely so far.	13	1
201512	1054	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think that OECD excess inventory, which we measure as the amount of inventory that is over the five-year average, is now about 300 million barrels globally.	13	1
201512	1055	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I have talked in the past two meetings about the daily supply–demand gap.	13	1
201512	1056	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	By the time we end this year, we think the year will have averaged a daily supply–demand gap of about 1.7 million barrels.	13	1
201512	1057	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I think when I first started talking in September we said 2.	13	1
201512	1058	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	At our previous meeting we said something lower, 1.6.	13	1
201512	1059	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We now believe—actually, today—that the supply–demand gap is 1.2 million barrels.	13	1
201512	1060	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect that, by the end of 2016, that gap—it won’t be linear, but it will get down to 600,000 barrels a day.	13	1
201512	1061	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And based on all that, we continue to believe that it’s probably not going to be until—as we’ve said before—if not late 2016, then sometime in the first half of 2017 before daily supply–demand gets into some amount of balance and we start working off this inventory.	13	1
201512	1062	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	If we are wrong, though, we are going to be wrong because it is going to take longer, and here is why and here is what is spooking the market.	13	1
201512	1063	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It starts with Iran.	13	1
201512	1064	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I have always mentioned that Iran was a wild card.	13	1
201512	1065	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And because it now looks much more probable that sanctions in Iran are going to be lifted, and lifted sooner than the market had expected, we now believe Iran will likely return to the market at some point in the first half of 2016.	13	1
201512	1066	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Today, they produce 2.8 million barrels.	13	1
201512	1067	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’ve talked to market participants broadly, and we’re not sure exactly what the Iranians do with that 2.8 million barrels, but the suspicion is that they’re selling some of it, and they’re storing some of it.	13	1
201512	1068	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We know that it would be their intention to increase their supply to 3.3 million barrels a day.	13	1
201512	1069	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We also know that they currently have in storage 30 million to 40 million barrels of oil.	13	1
201512	1070	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So when you talk about those supply–demand numbers that I said earlier, they don’t factor in Iran.	13	1
201512	1071	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But these are very big numbers, and it has thrown the market into a great amount of disarray, and it has created more uncertainty about when the balance is going to happen.	13	1
201512	1072	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We have also mentioned Libya, but it is much smaller.	13	1
201512	1073	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	That will add another 200,000 to 400,000 barrels of oil, but that is small compared with Iran.	13	1
201512	1074	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Another thing we have learned—and this has been interesting about the structure of this industry—we’ve said a lot about all of the rig count cuts and the cap-ex cuts.	13	1
201512	1075	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But the truth is that US production declines have been very slow to materialize, and global production declines have been slow.	13	1
201512	1076	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the reasons is that there have been production increases from the Gulf of Mexico, which was a very long-term project that just got activated.	13	1
201512	1077	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	That went the other way.	13	1
201512	1078	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, there was a bump-up in oil prices at the end of the summer, which caused some shale producers who are very nimble to reinitiate production and sell in the forward curve.	13	1
201512	1079	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So that created a problem.	13	1
201512	1080	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There is also a time lag between rig and spending declines and actual production declines.	13	1
201512	1081	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Normally, producers don’t just shut down a well.	13	1
201512	1082	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They let it run off, and they simply don’t replace it with new supply.	13	1
201512	1083	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, we’re now finding that these rigs in shale are much more productive.	13	1
201512	1084	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This is one place in which we are seeing productivity growth, for better or worse, and they’re producing more from wells than they may have expected.	13	1
201512	1085	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So here’s what we think is happening.	13	1
201512	1086	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Because global supply has been sticky to decline, there is even more pressure domestically to decrease— and we’re all seeing it.	13	1
201512	1087	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	What’s happening here is that there is much more pressure on domestic producers and their service suppliers, so there’s going to be a further decline.	13	1
201512	1088	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s going to happen in a step function.	13	1
201512	1089	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the reasons we are getting more into balance, though, is demand.	13	1
201512	1090	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our estimate is that demand growth in 2015 was 1.5 million barrels a day, so that helped create some of it.	13	1
201512	1091	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And we think it is going to be another 1.5 million barrels a day in 2016.	13	1
201512	1092	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So that alone will help get us into balance.	13	1
201512	1093	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It is ironic to talk about this now, but there is more and more discussion—and it is starting to make sense to me—that by 2018, we may actually get to the point at which we’re in balance, having worked off a lot of this excess inventory.	13	1
201512	1094	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We will see what decisions OPEC makes then, and there is going to be a lag to get supply back online in 2018, because a lot of the service providers and the equipment and the labor will have been taken out of commission, and people are going to be leery about getting back in.	13	1
201512	1095	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The irony is that we might get whipsawed, or we might have a price shock in 2018—probably not before then, but in 2018 and beyond there is going to be some risk of this.	13	1
201512	1096	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I have a feeling we’re going to be talking about this at this table because of the damage that is being done here to domestic supply, and that OPEC might, at a future date, depending on what happens, reassert itself.	13	1
201512	1097	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So we will talk about that more.	13	1
201512	1098	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Not surprisingly, more bankruptcies, restructurings, and so on and so forth—it is going to get worse in that regard.	13	1
201512	1099	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll comment on the high-yield market, which we talked about earlier, because the energy sector is a material part of the high-yield market.	13	1
201512	1100	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	High-yield credit spreads have widened, and the dynamic is that, because energy is weak, there are more defaults or risk of defaults.	13	1
201512	1101	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	High- yield funds used to be held by insurance companies in the old days and, yes, by some funds and others, but an increasing amount of the holdings in the high-yield market are by people who offer daily liquidity or even monthly or quarterly liquidity.	13	1
201512	1102	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And what’s happening with weak energy is, you don’t sell the energy because you probably can’t sell it, but you will sell a double-B or other stronger credit, which widens high-yield spreads for everyone in the market.	13	1
201512	1103	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We are seeing that in the hospital sector this week—it’s a great example.	13	1
201512	1104	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The hospital sector really gapped out this week even though there’s been no credit event, but that’s a ripple effect arising from what’s going on in energy.	13	1
201512	1105	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re at risk of that happening again.	13	1
201512	1106	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	If Iran really does come back on, and we have more shocks and this gets worse, we may have more events like we did this last week heading into 2016.	13	1
201512	1107	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We are just going to have to monitor it.	13	1
201512	1108	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll briefly say a couple of words about the District.	13	1
201512	1109	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, these facts—low oil prices, a slowing international economy, a strengthened dollar—are not helpful to the Eleventh District.	13	1
201512	1110	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There has been strength in the health-care and the leisure-and-hospitality sectors.	13	1
201512	1111	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The Affordable Care Act has been helpful.	13	1
201512	1112	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, the drops in gasoline prices have certainly helped the leisure-and-hospitality industry in the Eleventh District.	13	1
201512	1113	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Similar to what we’ve said before, I’ll just summarize—from all of our surveys, the headline is: manufacturing weak, service sector remains strong.	13	1
201512	1114	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Because of the diversification of the state, we still think Texas’s job growth this year is likely to be 1.3 percent.	13	1
201512	1115	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think job growth for Texas, for the District, will be 1.5 percent next year.	13	1
201512	1116	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the key underpinnings of Texas’s growth for all of these years since 2000 is that we have had a higher rate of migration to and population growth in the state.	13	1
201512	1117	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our population has grown 1 full percentage point faster than the rest of the country for the past 15 years on average.	13	1
201512	1118	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The impact of this will be, if jobs grow in Texas in 2016 at 1.5 percent, that our unemployment rate is likely to go up.	13	1
201512	1119	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It will inch up because this labor flow and company migration is continuing.	13	1
201512	1120	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It may stop or slow the decline in the unemployment rate because of this.	13	1
201512	1121	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The last comment I will make—which is not a very positive thing, but it is something we are watching—is that Texas leads the nation in uninsured.	13	1
201512	1122	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We have 19 percent uninsured, and this is the greatest percentage and number of uninsured in the country.	13	1
201512	1123	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I won’t get into the debates of both sides, but we are one of the states that has not taken government money related to the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid.	13	1
201512	1124	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Without making a value judgment on this, this is something we are watching to see how it affects economic conditions.	13	1
201512	1125	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Regarding the national economy, I’m going to confine my comments, given time, to three or four things that we are hearing from CEOs who are domiciled in this District but do business throughout the United States.	13	1
201512	1126	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	These are a few trends that struck me as we talked:  Number one, most of our companies across sectors—service and manufacturing—see the consumer as healthier but as being notably cautious despite the gasoline-price dividends.	13	1
201512	1127	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Spending habits are also rapidly changing, driven by technology and globalization.	13	1
201512	1128	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Consumers are increasingly able to shop for goods, as we all know, at the lowest price, substituting private-label and non-US sources for brands, increasingly using technology to find deals, and turning to disruptive models as alternatives to traditional models—famously Uber versus a car or taxi, Airbnb versus a hotel room, and Amazon versus a book store or retailer.	13	1
201512	1129	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But we are hearing these comments across sectors, including from AT&T, which is seeing this affect their business.	13	1
201512	1130	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The impact of all of this is that consumer pricing power is driving down the price of goods and services.	13	1
201512	1131	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In their day jobs, they may not have wage and bargaining power, but as consumers, they have pricing power.	13	1
201512	1132	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Exceptions to this include prescription drugs, health and beauty aids, and so-called affordable luxury, like a Starbucks cup of coffee and other experiences.	13	1
201512	1133	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, though, most companies that we talk to are continuing to search for ways to cut costs through process improvements in either manufacturing or technology they use to serve customers.	13	1
201512	1134	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Related to this, then, is a continuing trend in the effort to improve profits and EPS growth by leveraging up, as I mentioned in the previous meeting, to buy back stock or looking to do M&A to gain efficiencies.	13	1
201512	1135	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This is highly creative.	13	1
201512	1136	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There is widespread pressure from activists to do this.	13	1
201512	1137	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	At a 2 percent plus 10-year and tight investment-grade spreads, it’s hard to pass this up.	13	1
201512	1138	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Most of the businesses we talked to believe even with the first stages of federal funds tightening, it is unlikely to affect their availability of financing if they are double-B and stronger, and so they’re going to continue to do this—and I agree with this.	13	1
201512	1139	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Related to this, they are continuing to be hesitant to commit resources to capital spending because they don’t see the demand strength, as well as this phenomenon of downward pricing pressure, which squeezes their margins and expected ROI on projects.	13	1
201512	1140	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	My last comment is that a number of people I talked to, big and small companies, are commenting about a reduction in dynamism they’re seeing in various industries.	13	1
201512	1141	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	What do they mean?	13	1
201512	1142	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It is easier to exit than to enter.	13	1
201512	1143	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There are greater barriers to entry, including compliance with regulation, and, notably, this includes local regulation, licensing requirements, and harder- to-access credit.	13	1
201512	1144	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And I think President Lacker talked about the challenges faced by the community banks.	13	1
201512	1145	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This is seeping into the availability of credit if you are a small business, if you are a new entrant.	13	1
201512	1146	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Scale efficiencies are needed to increase profit.	13	1
201512	1147	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Geographic mobility of labor is tougher because of land prices—it is harder to move.	13	1
201512	1148	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So it makes it more important to have access to multiple labor pools.	13	1
201512	1149	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And so, simply, top-line growth is harder to generate, and margins are increasingly coming from scale.	13	1
201512	1150	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1151	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1152	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201512	1153	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1154	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	After waiting many, many years, the whole world is holding its breath to see what happens this week.	13	1
201512	1155	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m referring, of course, to the plot of the new Star Wars movie [laughter], but we face a decision of cosmic importance here as well.	13	1
201512	1156	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since our previous meeting, the data have evolved largely as expected—in fact, even a little better—leaving little doubt about the strength and resilience of the expansion.	13	1
201512	1157	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Real GDP growth remains on track, bolstered by solid consumer and business spending.	13	1
201512	1158	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economy is poised to enter the new year with good underlying momentum.	13	1
201512	1159	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, I see growth continuing above trend in 2016.	13	1
201512	1160	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see the risks to the outlook as balanced.	13	1
201512	1161	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the downside, the restraining effects of earlier dollar appreciation may spill over into the coming year, and the threat of further slowdowns in the euro area or East Asia remain.	13	1
201512	1162	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	By contrast, sagging energy prices could spur consumer spending further in the near term, and data on household formation suggest some upside risk in the housing market.	13	1
201512	1163	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	With continued above-trend growth, we made significant progress toward our employment goal.	13	1
201512	1164	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job growth has been especially strong, averaging over 200,000 per month for most of the past few years, and my own District has been leading the charge.	13	1
201512	1165	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	For job growth over the past 12 months, 7 of our 9 states are ranked in the top 10, and this group includes states that were hit the hardest by the housing bust and the financial crisis, such as California, Nevada, and Arizona.	13	1
201512	1166	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Clearly, these states had to climb out of a deep hole, but it is reassuring that they, too, are mostly recovered despite lingering economic and financial headwinds.	13	1
201512	1167	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	With national unemployment at my estimate of the natural rate of 5 percent, I see the labor market as very close to our maximum employment goal.	13	1
201512	1168	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even if we consider the individuals who are not active labor market participants but state that they want a job, the news is good.	13	1
201512	1169	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The size of that broad group has fallen dramatically over the past year and is now largely in line with levels observed in the past two expansions when the unemployment rate reached 5 percent.	13	1
201512	1170	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other labor market indicators such as perceptions of job availability, job openings, and difficulty filling jobs are near or above their levels associated with full employment.	13	1
201512	1171	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, with above-trend GDP growth next year, my SEP submission has the labor market overshooting our full employment target by a substantial margin.	13	1
201512	1172	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, since our previous meeting, I’ve lowered my expected path for the unemployment rate.	13	1
201512	1173	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I now expect it to fall to 4½ percent this year.	13	1
201512	1174	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking further ahead, I see growth needing to fall back to slightly below potential in order to get the unemployment rate back to its natural rate, which I see as happening in 2018.	13	1
201512	1175	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, in my SEP submission, I actually have in 2017 and 2018 growth of about 1¾ percent, which is below my estimate of trend.	13	1
201512	1176	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, this has nothing to do with the Phillips curve or anything—it’s simply the arithmetic of having an unemployment rate of 4½ percent and wanting it to move back to my natural rate of 5 percent in the next few years.	13	1
201512	1177	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The sustained period of labor market overheating should increase upward pressure on inflation and offset some of the lingering disinflationary pressures associated with the pass- through of lower import and energy costs into core prices.	13	1
201512	1178	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I expect inflation will gradually move back to our target of 2 percent by the end of 2017, and I’ll note that I am SEP respondent number 16.	13	1
201512	1179	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of my SEP submission, I put in liftoff for this meeting and, consistent with my view of the outlook, have four increases in the funds rate next year and five in 2017.	13	1
201512	1180	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then, in 2018, I have the funds rate reaching my estimate of the nominal natural rate of 3¼ percent.	13	1
201512	1181	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now I’ll turn to a topic that’s garnered a great deal of attention in the Twelfth District but also nationwide, and that’s the burgeoning commercial real estate boom.	13	1
201512	1182	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In hot metro areas in the Twelfth District, such as Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle, investor interest has driven commercial properties up to new highs.	13	1
201512	1183	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Rental rates in some cases haven’t kept pace, and that’s pushed cap rates way down, reportedly into the 3s for some properties.	13	1
201512	1184	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This upward trajectory in prices and the decline in cap rate show no signs of abating.	13	1
201512	1185	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This activity has been spurred, in part, by foreign investors, especially those from China who are seeking a relative safe haven for their capital investments and who are willing to accept abnormally low returns.	13	1
201512	1186	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The market for multifamily housing in my District’s leading metro areas has been even hotter than the one for commercial real estate overall.	13	1
201512	1187	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Prices of apartment buildings in San Francisco and Silicon Valley have left their previous peaks in the dust and continue to soar.	13	1
201512	1188	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although prices for commercial real estate have skyrocketed in these key markets, rising construction activity has been more moderate.	13	1
201512	1189	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonresidential construction activity has increased, but growth in this segment pales in comparison with past booms.	13	1
201512	1190	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Construction activity in multifamily housing is up more substantially.	13	1
201512	1191	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, this appears to largely reflect pent-up demand for new apartments and condos rather than speculative overbuilding.	13	1
201512	1192	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, my contacts tell me that regulatory constraints on new building, particularly in the hot markets in my District, have kept a lid on the construction boom, at least so far.	13	1
201512	1193	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, it’s one of the few times when business people have actually told me that the regulatory burden has been serving a useful purpose.	13	1
201512	1194	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In line with the surge in multifamily construction, community banks in the Twelfth District have seen rapid growth in this segment of their loan portfolios.	13	1
201512	1195	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, danger signs in this market, such as loose lending standards and excessive leverage, remain largely absent.	13	1
201512	1196	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The bottom line on conditions in commercial and multifamily markets is that although they’re not yet flashing red, the potential for imbalances merits close monitoring.	13	1
201512	1197	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning back to the national scene:  The progress we’ve made toward our goals for the past year is remarkable.	13	1
201512	1198	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Truly with us, the Force is.	13	1
201512	1199	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201512	1200	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1201	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201512	1202	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Top that one, Governor Powell.	13	1
201512	1203	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1204	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	On a more serious note, my forecast has not changed a great deal since the September SEP submission.	13	1
201512	1205	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I see real GDP growth continuing modestly above the potential rate, although a bit slower in 2016 than the Tealbook growth forecast at 2½ percent, due to the headwinds arising from the external sector.	13	1
201512	1206	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate has declined six-tenths so far this year, and I continue to expect that it will decline to 4½ percent by the end of 2016 and remain near there in 2017 and 2018.	13	1
201512	1207	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I see core inflation moving up to 1½ percent next year and to around 2 percent in 2017, as the economy tightens and as the effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices eventually fade.	13	1
201512	1208	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The two strong employment reports for October and November totaling a little more than 500,000 new jobs provide solid evidence to me that the economy is continuing to expand at an above-trend rate.	13	1
201512	1209	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Payrolls are now averaging comfortably above 200,000 for all of 2015 and for the past three months.	13	1
201512	1210	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Layoffs are low and job openings are high.	13	1
201512	1211	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I see continued growth supported by solid increases in consumer spending, reflecting a much-improved labor market, rising incomes, and an elevated wealth-to-income ratio.	13	1
201512	1212	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	In addition, residential investment and business investment outside the energy sector seem to be on a solid footing.	13	1
201512	1213	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Fiscal policy is now supporting the economy, rather than holding it back.	13	1
201512	1214	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The drag on aggregate demand due to the behavior of the external sector will continue, but that drag hasn’t been sufficient to slow the economy below trend.	13	1
201512	1215	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The amount of remaining slack is probably modest, but there is enough uncertainty about the location of supply-side constraints to counsel a cautious approach in removing accommodation.	13	1
201512	1216	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Without trying to address every margin of slack, I’d like to mention three areas in support of that.	13	1
201512	1217	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	First, while the unemployment rate of 5 percent is at or close to many estimates of the natural rate, I don’t yet see persuasive signs of an acceleration in compensation.	13	1
201512	1218	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The one indicator that does show a strong uptick is compensation per hour, and that is the highly volatile one, just as Governor Brainard said.	13	1
201512	1219	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	So I don’t see a sustainable or broad-based increase at all there, much as I stare at the graph.	13	1
201512	1220	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Such signs would be a welcome indicator of labor market tightness.	13	1
201512	1221	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Second, I would point to the labor force participation rate, which, at least to me, has been disappointing so far this year after remaining more or less flat for 18 months.	13	1
201512	1222	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	It’s now dropped four-tenths, but there is good reason to expect that participation will return to trend and probably exceed trend in the next couple of years on this path.	13	1
201512	1223	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook estimate of the cyclical participation shortfall is about 30 basis points, consistent with the canonical paper by our staff—Stephanie Aaronson, Bill Wascher, and four others.	13	1
201512	1224	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	In the Tealbook forecast, participation moves sideways and in doing so reaches trend by around the end of 2016 and then actually moves slightly above trend thereafter, which is consistent with past recoveries.	13	1
201512	1225	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	In fact, in the past two recoveries, participation has risen to roughly 50 basis points above trend late in the cycle when wages are rising and the unemployment rate is low.	13	1
201512	1226	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I would also point to a good deal of interesting research that has documented the damage done to the labor force from long and deep recessions, and here I’m thinking of the work by Greg Howard, Rob Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson here at the Board, among others, for example.	13	1
201512	1227	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The bottom line is that I’m not in any hurry to conclude that the current low level of participation reflects immutable structural factors.	13	1
201512	1228	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Inflation provides a third reason for caution.	13	1
201512	1229	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	More recent movements in the dollar and oil should exert some downward pressure on prices for a while longer, although the staff estimates they would be modest.	13	1
201512	1230	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Although no one can predict the timing with any confidence, oil and the dollar will eventually stabilize, and inflation will increase mechanically as a result.	13	1
201512	1231	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	That’s my forecast, but I will admit that that analysis leaves me with some degree of unease.	13	1
201512	1232	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	In addition, although inflation expectations are broadly stable, they do appear to be under some downward pressure, and this is a challenge that the Committee simply has to meet.	13	1
201512	1233	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The fact that we’re much more likely than anyone would like to return to the zero lower bound makes this all the more important.	13	1
201512	1234	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Market participants should look back on this period and be convinced that the Committee is determined to get back to 2 percent inflation and is willing to run some risk of overshooting on resource utilization to do that, and only our behavior can carry that burden.	13	1
201512	1235	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	With that background, I have shifted to a slightly lower path for the policy rate in this SEP.	13	1
201512	1236	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I assume liftoff at this meeting and a total of three increases of 25 basis points each for 2016 and three more in 2017.	13	1
201512	1237	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I believe that for the next couple of years, economic weakness around the world will mean that the Committee can and should remove accommodation only gradually.	13	1
201512	1238	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I would conclude by commenting briefly on recent conditions in leveraged finance markets, which have been a topic today and for the past couple of weeks.	13	1
201512	1239	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	These markets have been in a correction since about midyear, particularly for the most risky assets, such as those rated triple-C or lower or not rated at all, and particularly among energy firms.	13	1
201512	1240	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The Third Avenue announcement last week that the firm would refuse to allow withdrawals has put significant further pressure on these markets, and while the situation warrants careful monitoring, it’s worth saying that sharp changes in sentiment and liquidity are not at all unusual in leveraged finance markets.	13	1
201512	1241	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I can’t say—no one can really say—whether this will portend a sustained turn in the credit cycle, but for now I don’t see this correction as having important implications for the real economy or for monetary policy.	13	1
201512	1242	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	In fact, given that rates are likely to stay low for several more years, there remain powerful incentives to reach for yield, and many professionals are saying that this is the best and, in fact, the first real buying opportunity in several years.	13	1
201512	1243	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	This isn’t a forecast, but it would not surprise me if, after all of this settles out, the leveraged finance markets return to a boil in the first half of 2016 after this correction.	13	1
201512	1244	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1245	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1246	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Lyon.	13	1
201512	1247	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1248	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The Ninth District economy is expanding, but growth is modest and uneven.	13	1
201512	1249	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	There’s little evidence of rising inflation.	13	1
201512	1250	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The strong dollar and slower growth in foreign economies are contributing to weaknesses in the District’s industrial, agriculture, energy, and mining sectors.	13	1
201512	1251	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	At the same time, urban areas are generally continuing to grow.	13	1
201512	1252	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Unemployment in the Twin Cities area fell to 2.9 percent in October, the lowest rate among metropolitan areas of 1 million or more.	13	1
201512	1253	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Notwithstanding this low unemployment, the BLS reports that the core CPI for Minneapolis–St Paul increased only 1.1 percent from the first half of 2014 to the first half of 2015.	13	1
201512	1254	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The same combination of modest growth and low inflation prevails nationally and bears on the Committee’s deliberations.	13	1
201512	1255	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In its October statement, the Committee specified two conditions for raising rates at this meeting:  further improvement in the labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term.	13	1
201512	1256	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	I think there’s no doubt that the US labor market has improved since October across a range of metrics, so I’ll focus my remaining remarks on the outlook for inflation.	13	1
201512	1257	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Core PCE inflation has been quite stable over the past year, running close to 1.3 percent.	13	1
201512	1258	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Although today’s CPI report shows some improvement, the CPI data still do not appear strong enough to bring the PCE inflation rate back to 2 percent.	13	1
201512	1259	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The fact that core inflation is running consistently below target is important in light of the research literature on forecasting inflation.	13	1
201512	1260	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	This literature has repeatedly shown that it’s hard to improve on a forecast that equates future headline inflation to the recent trend value for core inflation.	13	1
201512	1261	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	As in October, such a forecast predicts that headline inflation will run below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201512	1262	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In particular, the literature shows that adding the unemployment rate or other measures of economic activity alongside lags of core inflation does not notably improve forecast accuracy.	13	1
201512	1263	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thus, we should not be very confident that continuing improvements in labor markets will automatically push up inflation.	13	1
201512	1264	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	It is true that headline inflation should rise toward core inflation as recent transitory declines in energy prices fade, but energy prices will likely play a minor role in the evolution of core inflation.	13	1
201512	1265	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Stabilization in the foreign exchange value of the dollar will help to stabilize import prices, which in turn will contribute to a modest uptick in core inflation.	13	1
201512	1266	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	But with disinflationary trends in place in most of the major exporting nations and currency values notoriously unpredictable, we shouldn’t count on import prices to restore US inflation to target.	13	1
201512	1267	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	What about other ways to gauge the likely direction of future inflation?	13	1
201512	1268	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Unfortunately, as has been the case for some time, neither market-based nor survey-based measures of inflation expectations instill much confidence that inflation is returning to our 2 percent target over the medium term.	13	1
201512	1269	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near their historic lows.	13	1
201512	1270	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Survey-based measures have edged downward and are also near historic lows.	13	1
201512	1271	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In sum, I see little reason to be more confident now than in October that inflation will return to 2 percent in the medium term.	13	1
201512	1272	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In the next round, I’ll discuss how this may raise communication challenges for the Committee.	13	1
201512	1273	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1274	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1275	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201512	1276	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1277	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	My baseline expectations have changed very little since October.	13	1
201512	1278	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The economy is chugging along at a moderately above-trend pace of growth.	13	1
201512	1279	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s revealed enough momentum to surmount the hurdles of the stronger dollar and sluggish global economy, at least up to this point, though it doesn’t seem to me that the upside risk would take us more than a couple of tenths of a percentage point higher than what people project.	13	1
201512	1280	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, when I was in the corridor at the coffee break, I heard a rumor that someone tomorrow is going to propose that we increase the federal funds rate.	13	1
201512	1281	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201512	1282	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I was talking to you during that period, President Williams.	13	1
201512	1283	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I wanted to address the formulation that we’ve had in our FOMC statements for some time with respect to improvements in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would return to the target rate.	13	1
201512	1284	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Beginning with the labor market, we’ve seen a few signs that wage increases may finally be picking up, though judging how much of this is attributable to labor market tightening may be a bit difficult in light of the increases in state and local minimum wages that are going into effect in 2015 and 2016, as well as some increases by some large, low-wage employers that have been prompted by political and social considerations.	13	1
201512	1285	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	All of this should serve as a reminder that monthly wage numbers are pretty noisy.	13	1
201512	1286	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	On the issue of remaining slack, I think it’s still hard to say anything with great assurance on how much slack remains, and Jay has already well addressed this point.	13	1
201512	1287	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Apart from the continuing questions regarding wages, we have uncertainties about labor force participation and, more generally, the future behavior of those who are currently out of the labor market.	13	1
201512	1288	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Some have argued that nonparticipants are not a good indication of remaining slack, citing, among other things, recent declines in reentry rates from marginally attached workers and those outside the labor market.	13	1
201512	1289	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	But we’ve got to remember that, in many respects, we still have some quite unusual characteristics in the labor market relative to pre-crisis conditions.	13	1
201512	1290	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	On this point of reductions in the reentry rate of those out of the labor force, for example, it’s worth noting that the percentage of those who leave the labor force but continue to want a job is still well above levels that prevailed pretty steadily for a decade before the crisis.	13	1
201512	1291	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And as it’s still the case that nearly half of those who exit the labor force from long-term unemployment will reenter within a year, this persistently large group of those leaving may—and I emphasize “may”—reflect some additional slack.	13	1
201512	1292	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	An additional point, just to reiterate, is that paying too much attention to a couple of months of data can be misleading.	13	1
201512	1293	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	For example, the recent decline in the percentage of the long- term unemployed finding a job followed an earlier increase, and that recent decline has basically taken us to where we were a couple of years ago.	13	1
201512	1294	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	These are yet more examples showing why I think it’s hard to draw too many conclusions from one data series about the labor market.	13	1
201512	1295	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	We still don’t know how much of what’s going on reflects secular changes from what we’ve seen before and how much will snap back to something more like pre-crisis conditions.	13	1
201512	1296	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	So has there been improvement in the labor market?	13	1
201512	1297	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	In a literal sense, of course there has been.	13	1
201512	1298	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s been ongoing improvement for some time now.	13	1
201512	1299	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The relevant question, to me at least, is whether the improvement that has taken place is enough to justify raising the federal funds target range.	13	1
201512	1300	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s consistent with our statutory mandate to treat this question as a self-contained one that is unrelated to the issue of inflation.	13	1
201512	1301	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	After all, our statutory mandate is to promote maximum employment, not to promote improved employment conditions.	13	1
201512	1302	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	So the limit on our efforts to promote further employment in the labor market comes from the other part of the dual mandate, that of price stability.	13	1
201512	1303	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The formulation we adopted some time ago that it would be appropriate to lift off when labor market conditions had improved and there was reasonable assurance that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective was, I believe, a logical way of indicating that we had been falling short on both sides of the mandate in the same direction.	13	1
201512	1304	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s no justification for removing accommodation that helps promote employment unless that stance would conflict with the price-stability side of the mandate or potentially pose a risk to financial stability that might lead to some very negative outcomes for both mandates.	13	1
201512	1305	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	What about inflation?	13	1
201512	1306	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Can we have reasonable assurance that, under current circumstances, inflation will return to 2 percent in the medium term, given that both headline and core have been running below that target for nearly the whole period since the financial crisis, and that this Committee has pretty consistently overestimated what inflation will be a year in advance?	13	1
201512	1307	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	As I understand it, the basic argument of those who have this assurance is that inflation is currently being held below that level essentially because of the decline in energy prices and the strengthening of the dollar, both of which are presumed to be transitory.	13	1
201512	1308	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	With the output gap presumed to be small and diminishing, a Phillips-curve relationship will then reassert itself.	13	1
201512	1309	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	That seems to me a plausible hypothesis, but, to be honest, it doesn’t seem more than that.	13	1
201512	1310	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	There are several reasons of quite different types why the hypothesis may not pan out as anticipated.	13	1
201512	1311	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, even if one stipulates the basic argument, it might be premature to make it under current circumstances.	13	1
201512	1312	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, as Governor Brainard pointed out, as one listened to views around the table today, this seems a somewhat unusual moment to be asserting reasonable confidence, a moment when people are marking down expectations for inflation and the downside risks associated with it.	13	1
201512	1313	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The recent additional slide in oil prices and expectations of the longer-term effect of a strong dollar may make the downward pressure on inflation last longer than had been expected, and some people began making this argument earlier this year.	13	1
201512	1314	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Alternatively, the output gap may be modestly to moderately larger than assumed.	13	1
201512	1315	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	This possibility returns us to the discussions we’ve been having more or less every meeting for several years now, to which I alluded a moment ago.	13	1
201512	1316	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	A second reason to doubt the hypothesis cuts more deeply into the mechanics of the theory that lies beneath it.	13	1
201512	1317	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Here there are two salient points, both of which I and others have made numerous times before.	13	1
201512	1318	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	One is the familiar observation that the Phillips-curve reasoning has not fared very well empirically for some years now.	13	1
201512	1319	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	While nearly everyone shares the intuition that, directionally at least, a narrowing output gap should lead to more inflation, there just hasn’t been very much observed data to back up that intuition for at least a decade, certainly not with anything like the precision that one would hope to find in a theory underlying important policy decisions.	13	1
201512	1320	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The second point is that the assumption of anchored expectations that plays an important role in the hypothesis is at least a little questionable.	13	1
201512	1321	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	For one thing, both market and survey measures of inflation expectations are at the low ends of their historical ranges; while it may be that liquidity considerations and gas prices, respectively, help explain these current measures, their very levels remind us that there’s no convincing theory—much less an empirically supported theory—of how expectations are formed, how in concrete terms anchored expectations function in the economy to affect inflation, and when expectations may become unanchored.	13	1
201512	1322	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It has been remarkable to me to observe how much weight is placed on a concept that has worked reasonably well for projecting inflation in the recent past but for which neither theory nor practice provides much ground for determining when and how it will continue to work in the future.	13	1
201512	1323	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It seems at least worth asking whether the persistence of some developments that are characterized as shocks in the models we use may over time themselves affect expectations.	13	1
201512	1324	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Or maybe the mere persistence of below-stated-target inflation over a period of years can have this effect.	13	1
201512	1325	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	If Narayana Kocherlakota were still here today, he might add that the apparent acquiescence of the FOMC in that situation might further chip away at the anchor keeping expectations in place.	13	1
201512	1326	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	A third reason to question the hypothesis is even more fundamental—that is, the possibility that current models for understanding inflation are missing a different dynamic that has taken hold in the economy.	13	1
201512	1327	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Some academics have argued as much.	13	1
201512	1328	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It certainly is not farfetched to wonder whether a shift in the so-called commodity supercycle, the slowing of emerging market growth on a secular basis, changes in US labor markets, and other phenomena have worked a more basic change in the sources and path of inflation.	13	1
201512	1329	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Here, as in many other areas, the financial crisis and Great Recession may have amplified or accelerated changes already working their way through the economy.	13	1
201512	1330	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	There is no particular reason to believe that the understanding about inflation developed in the Volcker and post-Volcker periods will be any more lasting than that which prevailed in the pre-Volcker period.	13	1
201512	1331	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	The obvious candidate for a quite different explanation is secular stagnation.	13	1
201512	1332	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	But even short of a theory affecting the entire performance of the economy, something else may be going on, and it is precisely at times when received wisdom is breaking down that policy missteps look, in retrospect, most likely to occur.	13	1
201512	1333	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I certainly don’t think there’s enough evidence of secular stagnation, or variants thereof, to justify substituting some new theoretical approach to how inflation develops.	13	1
201512	1334	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	But there is a possibility that a significant shift in how the economy operates—for example, that inflation may be significantly more influenced by secular than cyclical factors right now—has been under way.	13	1
201512	1335	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	This is just another reason why I’ve been suggesting that we should rely a little less on faith that old correlations will reassert themselves and a little more on incoming data that actually show they are working.	13	1
201512	1336	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	More generally, I don’t want to reject what I’ve termed the “plausible hypothesis” that seems to be motivating much of the Committee.	13	1
201512	1337	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Were we currently seeing core inflation moving up, perhaps along with documented wage acceleration that seems tied to that inflation, it might well be reasonable to have confidence that inflation was finally returning to the Committee’s stated target.	13	1
201512	1338	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	By the way, no one— certainly not me—has been arguing for waiting until inflation actually gets all the way to 2 percent to begin acting.	13	1
201512	1339	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s more a matter of wanting to see data that document the fact that the trend is in that direction.	13	1
201512	1340	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	So, in the end, for me this is a matter of assessing which outcomes are more likely and which risks are of greater concern.	13	1
201512	1341	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	There is surely some chance that if we were to wait, the hypothesis will prove correct, and we would have to move more quickly to raise rates in the future in order to contain inflationary pressures that threaten to get away from us.	13	1
201512	1342	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Though with real GDP growth running only modestly above its trend rate, this seems to me a fairly modest risk.	13	1
201512	1343	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	In an environment, though, of global disinflation, with spreads on many asset classes already widening, with decent but mixed economic indicators, with our own statistical models suggesting that the underlying trend of PCE inflation is 1.8 percent or a little lower, and with an asymmetric box of tools with which to respond to a slowdown as opposed to more rapid growth, I think it’s difficult, at least for me, to have reasonable confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent.	13	1
201512	1344	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not unreasonable to have that belief, but the case for it still seems to me a little soft.	13	1
201512	1345	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1346	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1347	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201512	1348	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1349	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Economic conditions and business sentiment in the Fourth District remain positive and are little changed since our previous meeting.	13	1
201512	1350	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Overall, business contacts expect the expansion to continue and for wages to pick up over the coming year.	13	1
201512	1351	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions rose 7 points, from minus 5 in October to plus 2 in December—suggesting little change in economic conditions.	13	1
201512	1352	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	At last week’s joint meeting of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh boards, directors continued to report that in most sectors, the business climate has improved this year.	13	1
201512	1353	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Autos, aerospace, and nonresidential construction continue to be among the stronger sectors in the District, while the energy and steel sectors remain challenged by low commodity prices, the strong dollar, excess global capacity, and weak growth abroad.	13	1
201512	1354	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	While conditions in manufacturing remain generally weak, we did hear some better news over the intermeeting period from some of our manufacturing contacts outside the energy-related sector.	13	1
201512	1355	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	For example, a producer of automated warehouse systems who services both traditional and online retailers reported double-digit growth this year, and that he could have grown more had he been able to find qualified workers to expand his workforce.	13	1
201512	1356	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Construction contacts also reported that it’s difficult to find qualified workers.	13	1
201512	1357	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	A director from a very large multinational retailer of consumer goods indicated that the US business is doing well, with most markets showing consumer growth of 2 to 4 percent.	13	1
201512	1358	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Globally, the company is offsetting the negative effects of the strong dollar by continuing to implement cost-saving programs and productivity enhancements.	13	1
201512	1359	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	She reports that the positive effects of lower energy costs are finally coming through and helping to counteract the effects of the strong dollar.	13	1
201512	1360	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	A director from a major company supplying paints and coatings to the construction industry has an optimistic outlook for the housing industry, pointing to the gap between the rate of household formation and the smaller pace of construction, combined with the very low level of existing housing stock.	13	1
201512	1361	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets in the Fourth District continue to make steady progress.	13	1
201512	1362	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	In October, year- over-year employment growth rebounded to 1.4 percent after a softer reading in September.	13	1
201512	1363	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	District job growth has been running between 1¼ and 1½ percent over the past three years, which is considerably stronger than it was over the previous expansion when the region actually lost jobs.	13	1
201512	1364	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has fallen to 4.7 percent, which is more than ½ percentage point lower than the minimum reached during the last expansion in 2007.	13	1
201512	1365	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Shortages of qualified workers continue to be an issue in the District.	13	1
201512	1366	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	This also appears to be an issue nationally, according to the results of the special questions on hiring plans and wages asked of business contacts across all Districts over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201512	1367	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	So far in our region, acceleration in wages is seen mainly in higher-skilled jobs, but some of our District contacts report that they will be implementing broad-based wage increases of 3 to 4 percent next year and significantly higher increases for high-skilled workers.	13	1
201512	1368	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy:  In response to the incoming data, I’ve made only minor adjustments to my outlook since the September SEP.	13	1
201512	1369	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including highly accommodative monetary policy, household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession, and sustained strengthening in labor markets.	13	1
201512	1370	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	While lower oil prices will continue to weigh on investment- and energy-related sectors, lower energy costs will help offset some of the effects of the stronger dollar on businesses and will also support stronger consumer spending.	13	1
201512	1371	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Fiscal policy will also make a modestly positive contribution.	13	1
201512	1372	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect GDP growth to pick up to an above-trend pace of 2.7 percent next year before moving down over 2017 and 2018 to trend, which I estimate at about 2¼ percent.	13	1
201512	1373	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I view the current economy at or nearly at full employment from the standpoint of our monetary policy goal.	13	1
201512	1374	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate is now about ¼ percentage point below my estimate of the longer-run rate of 5¼ percent.	13	1
201512	1375	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The labor force participation rate is now only about 30 basis points below its longer-run trend rate as estimated by Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Board staff.	13	1
201512	1376	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The pace of economic growth I’m projecting is sufficient to deliver some further improvement in labor markets, with payroll growth exceeding the range of 75,000 to 120,000 per month that various models indicate as sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate.	13	1
201512	1377	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I see the unemployment rate falling further below my longer-run rate next year, before gradually returning to that level by the end of 2018.	13	1
201512	1378	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I view inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored despite some small movements in our measures.	13	1
201512	1379	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	As the expansion continues and as the effects of the earlier and more recent declines in energy prices, non-energy commodity prices, and the appreciation of the dollar wane, I expect inflation to increase gradually, returning to our 2 percent goal sometime in 2017.	13	1
201512	1380	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	President Rosengren may feel better to know that the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff also analyzed the relationship between core PCE inflation and core CPI inflation, but they found that it was very difficult to reach any general conclusion about whether the gap between the two is usually closed by core PCE inflation rising toward the core CPI inflation rate or vice versa.	13	1
201512	1381	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	There are, of course, risks to my forecast, but I see them as balanced and not overly large.	13	1
201512	1382	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	On the downside, the dollar could appreciate more than I’ve assumed, perhaps reflecting divergent paths for economic growth and monetary policy abroad from those in the United States.	13	1
201512	1383	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Another risk is that oil prices could continue to decline rather than stabilize.	13	1
201512	1384	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Both of these could dampen growth in the trade and industrial sectors more than I’ve built into my forecast.	13	1
201512	1385	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	On the upside, lower oil prices may buoy consumer spending more than I anticipate.	13	1
201512	1386	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	With respect to inflation risks, the effects of oil price declines and dollar appreciation may be less transient and inflation could stay lower for longer than I’m projecting.	13	1
201512	1387	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	This could weigh on inflation expectations, which could then feed back into actual inflation.	13	1
201512	1388	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, accommodative monetary policy combined with an improving economy may lead to more-than-anticipated upward pressure on inflation over the medium run.	13	1
201512	1389	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	In fact, analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s staff shows that over the past 15 years, historical forecast errors of several highly regarded inflation forecasting models have been skewed to the upside—that is, the models have underestimated actual inflation.	13	1
201512	1390	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The policy path that underlies my modal forecast has the federal funds rate moving up at this meeting and then gradually up over the forecast horizon, reaching my longer-run level of 3½ percent in 2018.	13	1
201512	1391	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Of course, if incoming economic information leads to a significant change in my outlook, I’ll adjust this policy path as appropriate.	13	1
201512	1392	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I view one of the benefits of starting on this path now is that it will allow us to recalibrate policy over time as some of the uncertainty surrounding the longer-run level of interest rates, the economy’s potential growth rate, and the longer-run unemployment rate are resolved.	13	1
201512	1393	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Having policy react to changes in the outlook as informed by changes in economic conditions is how I interpret our being “data dependent.”	13	1
201512	1394	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Our policy rate path may well have to deviate from what our current expected path is if the economy’s evolution turns out to be different from what we currently anticipate.	13	1
201512	1395	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I don’t view this as problematic, nor do I think we should refrain from taking appropriate action based on the current outlook solely because there’s some chance the outlook will change in a way that necessitates having to subsequently reverse the action.	13	1
201512	1396	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The economy is dynamic, and there are always risks associated with the forecast which may ultimately manifest themselves.	13	1
201512	1397	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Appropriate policy has to be systematically responsive to material changes in the outlook.	13	1
201512	1398	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1399	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1400	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201512	1401	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1402	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On balance, I think the economy’s forward momentum remains intact, but I think the risks to that growth momentum lie mainly on the downside.	13	1
201512	1403	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	While the effects of the inventory cycle will undoubtedly prove short-lived, the impact of the stronger dollar and slow foreign growth on US trade performance is likely to prove more persistent, as documented in the Tealbook.	13	1
201512	1404	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The effects of this are already visible in US manufacturing by some measures.	13	1
201512	1405	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I did take some signal from the most recent ISM manufacturing index, which dipped below 50 percent last month.	13	1
201512	1406	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the first time it’s been below that mark in three years.	13	1
201512	1407	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	My concern is this:  The persistent trade drag will slow the economy, and this in turn will lead to slower payroll employment growth.	13	1
201512	1408	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If that were to happen, that would cut into household income growth, and that could take some of the steam out of consumer spending.	13	1
201512	1409	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, we’re clearly not seeing that yet—employment gains remain healthy, and the most recent retail sales report was solid—but I do think this is a real risk to the outlook.	13	1
201512	1410	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the risks to the outlook are mainly about what’s happening abroad.	13	1
201512	1411	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think those risks are still very much present.	13	1
201512	1412	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The OPEC decision to increase their production quota at a time when oil prices are weak and inventories are abundant has provoked another downward movement in oil prices, and this could intensify even further from here if inventories continue to accumulate and exhaust the available storage space.	13	1
201512	1413	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In any case, I think we’re going to see a lot more stress on energy producers and major energy-exporting countries in 2016.	13	1
201512	1414	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is, existing price hedges are running off, and the new hedges, if they are put in place, will be set at much lower levels than a year ago.	13	1
201512	1415	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the WTI crude oil forward prices 12 months ahead are roughly $20 a barrel lower now than they were a year ago, so the December 2016 contract is trading at around $44 a barrel.	13	1
201512	1416	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t get that much if you sell oil forward anymore.	13	1
201512	1417	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The stress, I think, on some emerging market economies also has increased further as a number of other commodity prices have hit new lows.	13	1
201512	1418	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, it’s noteworthy that it’s not like the supply is not still coming out of Spain—there are a number of large-scale mining production facilities that are going to enter the market in 2016.	13	1
201512	1419	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is going to exacerbate the glut in commodities such as iron ore and copper.	13	1
201512	1420	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, not only is there a risk of still lower prices, but this stress from lower prices is likely to prove persistent for quite some time.	13	1
201512	1421	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I focus on both the degree of stress and the persistence of stress because I think that the more severe the stress is and the longer it lasts, the greater the chance of breakage.	13	1
201512	1422	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That breakage could include large corporate failures, big capital flow reversals, or pronounced currency weakness.	13	1
201512	1423	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If that were to occur, the degree of stress could increase even further.	13	1
201512	1424	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, currency weakness could exacerbate the burden of dollar-denominated debt, and that would increase the risk of additional breakage.	13	1
201512	1425	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The result could be a self-reinforcing dynamic that could lead to a much worse outcome than what we currently anticipate.	13	1
201512	1426	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I see the financial crisis and the Great Recession as one example of this dynamic at work.	13	1
201512	1427	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In the fall of 2007, we did not appreciate what was going to come our way over the next few years.	13	1
201512	1428	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	As the stress intensified and persisted, more and more things broke, and I think this just shows the limits of model-based forecasts that have trouble incorporating these types of reinforcing dynamics.	13	1
201512	1429	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to China, the good news is that the transition to more-balanced growth is under way, but I do think people may be a bit too optimistic about the ability of the Chinese to manage this process and the risks that have already been created by the sharp rise in indebtedness that’s occurred there among major corporates and local government entities.	13	1
201512	1430	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The prevailing view about China seems to be that while there eventually could be a hard landing—the fact is the buildup of debt there is very striking—it’s not going to happen yet.	13	1
201512	1431	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because the government still has plenty of policy instruments that it can use to cushion the adjustment and a view that the policymakers are highly competent.	13	1
201512	1432	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that’s probably the right view.	13	1
201512	1433	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	What happens if it turns out that the hard landing happens much sooner than what we currently anticipate?	13	1
201512	1434	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side of the ledger, I continue to be less worried than some of us about core inflation being considerably below 2 percent.	13	1
201512	1435	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are several reasons for this.	13	1
201512	1436	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I take some signal from the fact that the trend has been sideways rather than down given the fact that we’ve had energy prices and non-energy import prices pushing downward, so core inflation has been flat even though we’ve had these downward forces.	13	1
201512	1437	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that when those downward forces dissipate, core inflation should move back up.	13	1
201512	1438	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I do take some signal from the fact that the gap between core services inflation and core goods inflation is unusually wide right now, so that reinforces that first point.	13	1
201512	1439	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggests to me that inflation will likely rise as that gap is closed by core goods inflation moving higher as the effects of the stronger dollar ultimately dissipate.	13	1
201512	1440	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, I think wage trends are consistent with an economy that’s approaching full employment.	13	1
201512	1441	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true that wage compensation trends, broadly defined, have not moved up much, I do take some signal from what we’ve seen because it does seem consistent with anecdotal reports in which businesses are telling us that it’s harder and harder to find people for certain types of positions—“truck driver” seems to be the one that I hear the most about.	13	1
201512	1442	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, there may be offsetting factors holding down wage trends, such as the weak headline inflation trend and the fact that the underlying productivity growth trend seems to have fallen.	13	1
201512	1443	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So the fact that some things that might be pushing nominal wage growth down and the fact that the wage compensation trend is broadly stable might be consistent with an economy that is, in fact, approaching full employment.	13	1
201512	1444	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast to the fact that the core inflation rate is a bit below 2 percent, which I’m not that anxious about, I do have some concerns about inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	1445	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Some of the survey- based measures of inflation expectations show a slight downward trend, and although the University of Michigan measure over the next five years ticked back up to 2.6 percent in November, it remains at the very low end of the range of recent years.	13	1
201512	1446	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Most notable to me is the decline in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations.	13	1
201512	1447	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This is a three-year measure of inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	1448	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So what happens?	13	1
201512	1449	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	For each individual, we calculate the mean, the median, and the 25th and 75th percentile of their three-year inflation density forecast, and all of these measures have dipped notably over the past year.	13	1
201512	1450	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	From January, they’ve declined between 30 to 50 basis points— that’s the mean, the median, and the 25th and 75th percentile.	13	1
201512	1451	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	What that’s telling you is that the whole distribution of inflation expectations for these individuals has shifted to the left.	13	1
201512	1452	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And it seems hard to attribute this shift just to the drop in energy prices because, one, energy prices were dropping pretty sharply last January, and, two, unlike the University of Michigan five-by- five inflation expectations measure, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York three-year measure doesn’t seem to be nearly as sensitive to the changes in oil and gas prices.	13	1
201512	1453	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to point you to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations because I think this survey actually has a much sturdier methodology for tracking inflation expectations compared with the University of Michigan measure.	13	1
201512	1454	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The University of Michigan survey has been around a lot longer, I know, and that’s why we always cite it, but I think the Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey is actually a better survey.	13	1
201512	1455	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The sample size is much bigger, and it’s conducted so that most of the respondents are the same month to month, so you’re following the same people over time, which eliminates a lot of the sampling volatility in the results.	13	1
201512	1456	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And the question about inflation expectations is better crafted to elicit well- informed responses about inflation expectations.	13	1
201512	1457	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We ask about inflation—the University of Michigan survey asks about prices.	13	1
201512	1458	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, of course, the survey has a much shorter track record—it only goes back a couple of years.	13	1
201512	1459	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But if it’s changes in inflation expectations from survey measures that we care about, then there’s a good case to put considerable weight on the New York survey results and not just always cite the University of Michigan measures.	13	1
201512	1460	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When I put all of this together—no significant change in the growth outlook, considerable risk from abroad, and inflation expectations in some danger of becoming unhinged to the downside—that suggests to me that there’s not a slam-dunk case for tightening at this meeting or, for that matter, concluding that not tightening in September was a mistake.	13	1
201512	1461	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, these risks may not materialize, so I think it’s inappropriate to wait any longer.	13	1
201512	1462	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are always risks, and with the unemployment rate now close to most of our estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate, I don’t think we should wait any longer, as long as we believe the economy is likely to continue to grow at an above-trend pace, even if only slightly.	13	1
201512	1463	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think the current situation calls for a go-slow strategy until we see either the economy’s forward momentum is sustained or the inflation outlook evolves in a manner consistent with even greater confidence that inflation will head back to 2 percent over the medium term or both.	13	1
201512	1464	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s what I’ve signaled with the my SEP submission—only two 25 basis point tightenings in 2016, and then, as we get more confident, a faster pace thereafter.	13	1
201512	1465	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201512	1466	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201512	1467	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And thank you to everyone for a very thoughtful round of comments on the economic outlook and the risks.	13	1
201512	1468	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I would just like to wrap up with a few comments of my own, including some observations on the policy implications of the outlook and the uncertainties we face in anticipating tomorrow’s discussion.	13	1
201512	1469	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the labor market.	13	1
201512	1470	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Back in October, I was concerned that the soft tone of the data we had received coming into that meeting might be a sign that a persistent broad-based slowing in the pace of labor market improvement was under way.	13	1
201512	1471	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately, that risk now seems far less likely, in light of the past two monthly reports, which I think everyone would agree were quite favorable.	13	1
201512	1472	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Payrolls grew about 220,000 per month, on average, from September through November, and that’s about the same solid pace we observed over the past 12 months.	13	1
201512	1473	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate has continued to edge down in recent months, and, at 5 percent, it’s 0.7 percentage point lower than last January and only a shade above the median of our projections of its longer-run sustainable level.	13	1
201512	1474	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Broader measures of labor utilization have also improved substantially.	13	1
201512	1475	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The U-6 rate, for example, has fallen almost 1½ percentage points since the start of the year.	13	1
201512	1476	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Labor force participation has declined since the start of the year, and the employment-to-population ratio is unchanged.	13	1
201512	1477	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	But these developments, nonetheless, represent a cyclical improvement in labor market conditions, in light of ongoing demographically driven declines in their underlying trends.	13	1
201512	1478	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, to my mind, overall, the data confirm that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably over the past year.	13	1
201512	1479	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I continue to think, as a number of you do, that the economy is not quite back to full employment.	13	1
201512	1480	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is still ¼ percentage point above my own estimate of its longer-run level.	13	1
201512	1481	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains about 1 percentage point above its pre-recession level, and I’m more optimistic than the staff that a healthy job market will pull people back into the labor market.	13	1
201512	1482	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, wage growth, as measured by the ECI and average hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis, remains soft, suggesting not only that the labor market is not all that tight, but that our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment might be too high.	13	1
201512	1483	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	That said, a number of you mentioned indications of rising wage pressures from your contacts, and it’s a theme I’ve also heard in many recent meetings with business leaders.	13	1
201512	1484	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the recent marked acceleration in compensation per hour on a year-over-year basis, coupled with monthly gains in average hourly earnings this fall that have been somewhat greater on average than those seen earlier in the year, could be signaling the start of a sustained pickup in wages after years of stagnation.	13	1
201512	1485	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, of course, I would also see that as a welcome development in line with the Tealbook forecast, but I agree with those of you who have pointed out that wage measures, especially compensation per hour, are very noisy indicators, and we should keep in mind that earlier this year we thought we were seeing signs of a pickup in wages, and it subsequently faded.	13	1
201512	1486	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	With regard to spending and production indicators, on balance, the incoming data point to continued moderate growth in real activity.	13	1
201512	1487	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Motor vehicle sales have been robust, retail sales are advancing at a solid pace, and consumer confidence has moved up recently and currently stands at a relatively high level.	13	1
201512	1488	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Housing continues its gradual recovery, and business fixed investment appears to be expanding steadily outside the drilling and mining sector.	13	1
201512	1489	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Even there, reduced drilling should restrain overall GDP growth much less in the coming year as the contraction bottoms out and the sector shrinks.	13	1
201512	1490	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the relative strength of domestic spending is being partially offset by weakness in net exports, and that is a drag that is likely to persist for some time, due to the appreciation of the dollar and the current weakness in foreign growth.	13	1
201512	1491	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	But the potential risks to the US economy from global financial and economic developments, although still quite material, at least in my view, have diminished since late summer.	13	1
201512	1492	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, I expect that real GDP growth will continue to run a bit ahead of potential output growth, thereby generating further improvements in labor market conditions in coming months.	13	1
201512	1493	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, during the intermeeting period, the data have been largely in line with expectations.	13	1
201512	1494	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	My outlook is little changed.	13	1
201512	1495	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	For this year, overall PCE inflation appears poised to come in a bit below ½ percent, a shade lower than the staff projected in October.	13	1
201512	1496	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	But barring some major surprise, by the March meeting, headline inflation will probably have jumped to around 1 percent on a 12-month basis, as the big declines in energy prices recorded a year ago drop out of the index.	13	1
201512	1497	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Core inflation at that point is likely to be close to 1½ percent, a touch higher than currently.	13	1
201512	1498	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, although the lingering effects of recent movements in oil prices and the dollar may keep inflation subdued for much of the rest of 2016, I am at least reasonably confident that once these transitory influences finally dissipate, inflation over the next two or three years will return to 2 percent, aided by a further tightening in resource utilization.	13	1
201512	1499	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So what does all of this imply for monetary policy?	13	1
201512	1500	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	With regard to the decision at this meeting, my own judgment is that current economic conditions and the outlook, taken together, now warrant a modest increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.	13	1
201512	1501	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Three considerations lead me to this conclusion.	13	1
201512	1502	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	First, as I just noted, we have seen further improvement in the labor market, and I’m reasonably confident that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	13	1
201512	1503	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thus, the two conditions for liftoff that we announced back in March have now been met to my satisfaction.	13	1
201512	1504	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Second, monetary policy operates with a substantial lag, and waiting to act until we’re closer to achieving our dual objectives risks disrupting the economy in the future because we might be forced to tighten abruptly.	13	1
201512	1505	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, and very importantly, monetary policy will remain appropriately accommodative if we do decide to raise the target range by 25 basis points.	13	1
201512	1506	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	This assessment primarily follows from my judgment that a further fall in the unemployment rate would be desirable both to help take up the labor market slack that remains and to speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201512	1507	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the effective stance of policy after liftoff should help to produce these conditions without being overly stimulative.	13	1
201512	1508	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s assume that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is currently about zero, consistent with the analysis presented at the October meeting.	13	1
201512	1509	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Increasing the target range by 25 basis points would, therefore, leave the real federal funds rate roughly 100 basis points below the equilibrium rate, as core inflation is currently running a little below 1½ percent.	13	1
201512	1510	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Simulations of the FRB/US model and the Laubach-Williams model suggest that keeping the gap between the real federal funds rate and the equilibrium rate constant at this level for a couple of years would be expected to push the unemployment rate only ¼ to ½ percentage point or so below its longer-run sustainable level, all else being equal, providing a modest boost to inflation.	13	1
201512	1511	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	This simple calculation suggests to me that we needn’t be in a hurry to close the real federal funds rate gap, as the risk of excessively overheating the economy seems low.	13	1
201512	1512	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	That said, our economic projections imply that the federal funds rate will likely have to rise gradually over the next few years even if we were to decide that it is appropriate to keep the gap between the real federal funds rate and the equilibrium rate constant.	13	1
201512	1513	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	As trend inflation gradually converges back to 2 percent, the nominal federal funds rate will need to move up more or less in tandem to avoid an inadvertent easing in the effective stance of policy.	13	1
201512	1514	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Similarly, the federal funds rate, both real and nominal, will need to rise over the next few years as the headwinds still restraining real activity fade—that is, if r* rises gradually as we expect.	13	1
201512	1515	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, real activity and inflation could evolve in materially different ways from what we now expect, and so we should be wary of being too confident about the appropriate future path of policy.	13	1
201512	1516	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, taking a cautious approach to tightening remains appropriate in light of the asymmetric risk posed by the effective lower bound in the present circumstances.	13	1
201512	1517	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, we should proceed cautiously in light of heightened uncertainty about the economic effects of higher interest rates.	13	1
201512	1518	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	In part, this increased uncertainty reflects the fact that our monetary policy is now atypically diverging from that of the rest of the world, and, as a result, we may see unusually large exchange rate effects.	13	1
201512	1519	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Other sources of increased uncertainty are the changes that have occurred over the past eight years in credit availability, capital standards, and other aspects of the financial system, which may have reduced the sensitivity of aggregate activity to interest rates.	13	1
201512	1520	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And the taper tantrum episode reminds us that the response of financial markets to a change in policy can be hard to predict.	13	1
201512	1521	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Although these considerations argue in favor of proceeding cautiously in adjusting the stance of monetary policy, especially in the early going, they do not imply that we should stand pat for as long as inflation remains subdued.	13	1
201512	1522	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	For example, if the labor market were to continue to improve markedly as we move through 2016, then further moderate increases in the federal funds rate would probably be warranted, even if core inflation was still showing no signs of picking up.	13	1
201512	1523	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Although we might consider lowering our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment a bit in response to such developments, it would also be prudent to view them as a sign that the underlying strength of the economy was in fact increasing, and that inflation would move up as labor and product markets tighten.	13	1
201512	1524	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, we would want to check the pace of employment growth somewhat to reduce the risk of overheating that could eventually force us to tighten abruptly, with potentially adverse effects on the economy.	13	1
201512	1525	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, if inflation were to remain persistently subdued beyond next year despite further improvements in the labor market and no special transitory factors were in play, then, in my view, a more radical rethinking of the economy’s productive potential would surely be in order.	13	1
201512	1526	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, let me stop there with those comments.	13	1
201512	1527	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have time to turn to Thomas for his briefing on monetary policy alternatives before we break for dinner.	21	2
201512	1528	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201512	1529	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201512	1530	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	One key issue for tomorrow is whether to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201512	1531	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Just as important, as you emphasized in your discussion at the October meeting, is that tomorrow’s statement effectively communicate the Committee’s current thinking about the likely future path of the federal funds rate as well as the economic conditionality of the expected policy rate path.	21	2
201512	1532	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The three draft statements in the handout provide options for addressing these two issues.	21	2
201512	1533	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A, B, and C offer somewhat different combinations of assessments of current and expected economic developments bearing on the Committee’s decision on the policy rate.	21	2
201512	1534	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the box at the top of your first exhibit, all three alternatives report further improvement in a range of labor market indicators over the intermeeting period and say that those developments confirm an appreciable improvement in underutilization of labor resources since early this year.	21	2
201512	1535	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	On inflation, both alternatives B and C characterize inflation as continuing to run below the Committee’s objective in part because of declines in energy prices and prices of non- energy imports.	21	2
201512	1536	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	However, they offer somewhat different perspectives on recent movements in measures of inflation expectations.	21	2
201512	1537	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B highlights the fact that market-based measures are low and that survey-based measures have “edged down,” while alternative C characterizes those measures, respectively, as having “stabilized” and having “generally remained stable.”	21	2
201512	1538	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In describing the outlook for inflation in paragraph 2, both alternatives B and C reaffirm the expectation that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory factors currently holding down inflation dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.	21	2
201512	1539	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	And, in announcing the policy action in paragraph 3, both alternatives express reasonable confidence in that forecast.	21	2
201512	1540	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	However, alternative B includes a couple of indications that the Committee is viewing the outlook for inflation cautiously.	21	2
201512	1541	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B retains the final sentence of paragraph 2 in the October statement, which says “the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.”	21	2
201512	1542	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	And paragraph 4 emphasizes the Committee’s intention to carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.	21	2
201512	1543	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A says that the Committee is not sufficiently confident in the outlook for inflation to warrant a change in the target range for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201512	1544	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In explaining the decision to leave the funds rate unchanged, the Committee would cite “subdued” inflation, core inflation, and gains in labor compensation and “low” measures of inflation expectations.	21	2
201512	1545	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 1 reports that the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is “only partly” attributable to transitory factors.	21	2
201512	1546	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 suggests a risk that too-low inflation might persist by saying that the temporary factors holding down inflation will “eventually” dissipate; paragraph 2 also reports that the Committee sees a need to “closely monitor” measures of both actual and expected inflation.	21	2
201512	1547	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	If it were to adopt alternative A, the Committee would drop the criteria for liftoff that it first communicated in March.	21	2
201512	1548	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Instead,  it would say that how long to maintain the current federal funds rate target would depend on “realized and expected” progress toward its maximum employment and inflation objectives, and it would add that it is prepared to provide additional accommodation if incoming information does not soon indicate that inflation is moving up toward 2 percent.	21	2
201512	1549	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The box at the bottom of exhibit 1 summarizes how alternatives B and C communicate the Committee’s thinking about the expected policy rate path as you go forward.	21	2
201512	1550	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 of alternative B indicates that the Committee’s economic outlook is consistent with “gradual” adjustments in the stance of policy.	21	2
201512	1551	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Then, in paragraph 4, alternative B describes the Committee’s expectation that “economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”	21	2
201512	1552	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative C refers to “appropriate” rather than “gradual” policy adjustments in paragraph 2 and omits the “only” in paragraph 4.	21	2
201512	1553	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Both alternatives state the Committee’s expectation that “the funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”	21	2
201512	1554	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Both alternatives underline economic conditionality by saying, in paragraph 4, that “the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range” will depend on “realized and expected economic conditions relative to [the Committee’s] objectives” and then adding that “the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.”	21	2
201512	1555	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The next exhibit examines how your policy strategy is currently understood by financial markets.	21	2
201512	1556	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Recall that in March 2014, you first introduced statement language indicating that “economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels” viewed “as normal in the longer run.”	21	2
201512	1557	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	This message has been reinforced over the past year by your SEP submissions as well as other communications.	21	2
201512	1558	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The median of primary dealers’ modal expectations for the path of the federal funds rate, shown by the blue dots in the upper-left panel of exhibit 2, is very close to the median of your most recent policy projections, the green diamonds.	21	2
201512	1559	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, the policy rate path derived from OIS quotes continues to run well below the median of modal expectations in the primary dealer survey.	21	2
201512	1560	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Based on these quotes, the federal funds rate is expected to increase only about 50 basis points over the first year following the onset of tightening.	21	2
201512	1561	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	But, as discussed in a box in Tealbook B, this gap does not necessarily imply that the modal outlook for the federal funds rate embedded in these quotes is much different from that of the dealer survey or the SEP.	21	2
201512	1562	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the upper-right panel, market quotes point to an expected pace of tightening that is substantially slower than it was at the onset of tightening in early 1994, the blue line, and mid-2004, the red line.	21	2
201512	1563	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Whether this observation indicates a correct understanding by market participants of your intended strategy depends on the economic conditions on which this expectation is predicated.	21	2
201512	1564	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	While we do not observe the expectations for economic outcomes on which these market quotes are based, the middle two panels, taken from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, suggest that these forecasters assign the highest probability to outcomes similar to those in your SEP.	21	2
201512	1565	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	I was advised that these panels are a little adventuresome, so let me just quickly say that I will certainly check afterward with President Evans on the effects that these panels have on the viewer.	21	2
201512	1566	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Each column here essentially represents an SPF vintage, with the most recent one being the right-most column, and the height of the bars of different colors in each of these columns represents the probability mass placed on the outcomes being shown underneath.	21	2
201512	1567	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, the dark blue portion at the right edge of the middle-left panel shows that forecasters currently see GDP growth over the year ahead in the 2 to 3 percent range as the most likely outcome, while the light blue portion at the right edge of the middle-right panel shows that they similarly place highest odds on PCE inflation next year falling in the 1 to 2 percent range.	21	2
201512	1568	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	It therefore seems plausible that if the economy evolves in a manner consistent with the median SEP outlook, market participants would be unlikely to alter their expectation of a tightening pace of 50 to 100 basis points per year.	21	2
201512	1569	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, how market expectations regarding the path of the policy rate would adjust if the economy were to surprise is less clear.	21	2
201512	1570	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Particularly striking is how little weight markets seem to place on the federal funds rate rising more than 150 basis points next year.	21	2
201512	1571	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The lower-left panel shows the probability distribution for three-month LIBOR at the end of 2016 implied by options on Eurodollar futures.	21	2
201512	1572	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The implied probability that the pace of tightening will exceed 150 basis points is merely 20 percent.	21	2
201512	1573	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Similarly, the odds that the SPF respondents place on real GDP growing faster than 3 percent or inflation exceeding 2 percent are also about 20 percent each.	21	2
201512	1574	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	A more robust economic performance could cause a sharp market response as in 1994, when the expected pace of tightening—the blue line in the upper-right panel—and longer-term rates shot up over the course of the year.	21	2
201512	1575	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	While surprisingly rapid progress toward the Committee’s objectives could pose challenges for your communications by raising the question to what extent you would still view gradual adjustments to the federal funds rate as being appropriate, arguably the opposite risk—a lack of progress toward your objectives—would present even greater challenges.	21	2
201512	1576	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	One possible scenario on investors’ minds might be that inflation fails to rise as you project—a scenario that might be reflected in continued low readings of breakeven inflation.	21	2
201512	1577	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As you know, decomposing breakeven inflation into expectations and risk premium components is challenging, and any such decomposition is model specific.	21	2
201512	1578	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The black line in the lower-right panel shows the inflation expectations component derived from the standard specification of the staff’s four-factor model including nominal and TIPS yields.	21	2
201512	1579	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	That measure suggests that inflation expectations of these investors at the 5-to-10-year horizon have declined only marginally since the middle of last year.	21	2
201512	1580	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	However, this result is based on the maintained assumption that inflation will return, eventually, to the 1991–2014 sample average.	21	2
201512	1581	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The red line shows that if this assumption is replaced by an assumption that inflation is nonstationary—that it need not revert to the sample average in the long run—the decline in inflation expectations since mid-2014 is estimated to have been substantially larger.	21	2
201512	1582	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In the face of substantial uncertainty about the strength of forces moving inflation back to your objective, you may view the emphasis that alternative B places on a gradual approach to removing accommodation combined with a great deal of attention to inflation developments as a prudent approach to managing this risk.	21	2
201512	1583	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, as a housekeeping item, I should mention that, since circulating Tealbook B, we made two minor adjustments to the language of the directive to the Desk, which is shown in bold blue on page 12 in your handout.	21	2
201512	1584	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The purpose of the second of these changes was to bring the language of the directive in line with the more accurate language that has been used for several years now in your postmeeting statements.	21	2
201512	1585	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So you will find that, actually, the postmeeting statement has always been talking about “at auction.”	21	2
201512	1586	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	I should also mention that we are considering one other small change that I should bring to your attention.	21	2
201512	1587	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	On page 13, the language there refers to the “primary credit rate,” and we wanted to add that this refers to the discount rate—and put the primary credit rate in parentheses—because prior to 2008, statements referred to “the discount rate,” and we wanted to make sure that there is no confusion that “primary credit rate” might refer to something like “prime rate.”	21	2
201512	1588	2015-12-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair, I would be happy to take questions.	21	2
201512	1589	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Thomas?	22	2
201512	1590	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a question that is for Simon and Lorie?	22	2
201512	1591	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	Easy question—it’s late in the day.	22	2
201512	1592	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	22	2
201512	1593	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So later this week—when are we going to know about the effectiveness of liftoff?	22	2
201512	1594	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Just walk us through Thursday, Friday—how that’s going to work.	22	2
201512	1595	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	On Thursday morning, we’ll start seeing quotes.	22	2
201512	1596	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The first thing to check is if the effective federal funds rate is in the 25 to 50 basis point range, assuming that you do raise the rate tomorrow.	22	2
201512	1597	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	And then, as the day goes on, we’ll see more quotes, and we won’t get the full set of data to analyze until later that day.	22	2
201512	1598	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	The briefing that we’ll do on Friday will have much more data to understand exactly what happened.	22	2
201512	1599	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But you should know something on Thursday.	22	2
201512	1600	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	On Thursday, we’ll get federal funds open and the hourly effective federal funds rate, so we’ll be able to tell everyone very quickly if we’re stuck on the launch pad.	22	2
201512	1601	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	There’s no doubt about that.	22	2
201512	1602	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions for Thomas?	22	2
201512	1603	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201512	1604	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Quiet crowd.	22	2
201512	1605	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	My goodness.	22	2
201512	1606	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve been bludgeoned into submission.	22	2
201512	1607	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201512	1608	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	There’s a reception across the way and dinner.	2	2
201512	1609	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll resume at 9:00 am tomorrow to complete our work.	2	2
201512	1610	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you all.	2	2

201512	1614	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	It looks like we are ready and raring to go.	2	2
201512	1615	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Yes?	2	2

201512	1619	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do you actually consider it early?	2	2

201512	1626	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams is going to start us off.	23	2
201512	1627	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1628	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I unequivocally support alternative B as written.	23	2
201512	1629	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The data convincingly support this decision, according to the conditions that we laid out.	23	2
201512	1630	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job growth has come in stronger than expected, and broad measures of labor underutilization have continued to improve.	23	2
201512	1631	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It appears likely that the economy will exceed full employment next year by even more than I had anticipated just a few months ago.	23	2
201512	1632	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Incoming price inflation data remain low, but this weakness largely reflects dollar appreciation and declines in energy and commodity prices.	23	2
201512	1633	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	These transitory factors should dissipate as labor markets really start to be stretched next year, and I’m confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over the next couple of years.	23	2
201512	1634	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The downside risks to the outlook have also fallen substantially.	23	2
201512	1635	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Fears of a sharp slowdown in China have diminished, and a federal fiscal battle appears to have been avoided.	23	2
201512	1636	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The resilience of the economy over the past few months in the face of those headwinds has also been encouraging.	23	2
201512	1637	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, the flip side of starting normalization now is, we can signal that the appropriate path will also be quite gradual, and the language in the statement does just that.	23	2
201512	1638	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Slow and steady increases in the funds rate should provide an appropriate tightening of broader financial conditions to maintain moderate growth and full employment in the face of continuing headwinds.	23	2
201512	1639	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I also support the language in paragraph 5 that signals that the reinvestment will continue until the funds rate normalization is well under way.	23	2
201512	1640	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This approach is supported by both communications and risk-management considerations.	23	2
201512	1641	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	For the next year or so, it’s desirable to keep policy focused on our traditional tool of monetary policy, the short-term interest rate.	23	2
201512	1642	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Such a focus will concentrate the public’s attention on our policy message; center policy rate expectations; and, I hope, minimize confusion.	23	2
201512	1643	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1644	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1645	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201512	1646	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1647	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I can support alternative B today, in large part because of its important state-dependent characterization of our gradual adjustment path.	23	2
201512	1648	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I find today to be a tough call.	23	2
201512	1649	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I think the risk-management case for delay until mid-2016 remains strong.	23	2
201512	1650	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Core PCE inflation continues to run well below our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201512	1651	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Some of our best medium-term r* measures are at zero or below, and the statistical models suggest they could be very low for a long time.	23	2
201512	1652	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	In a global environment full of low-inflation risks, I think uncertainty arguments weigh strongly for further delay while we monitor inflation for signs of revival toward 2 percent.	23	2
201512	1653	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	After all, we know how to raise rates if inflation heads too high, but we don’t like our toolbox nearly as much if we face renewed disinflationary pressures.	23	2
201512	1654	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	But the big weakness in the argument for alternative A today is that most of our recent monetary policy communications by this Committee have signaled that data conditions and our outlook have met the threshold for liftoff.	23	2
201512	1655	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Acting today seems appropriate to me as long as our first move is accompanied by a communication strategy that indicates that our initial adjustments will be gradual.	23	2
201512	1656	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	This strategy also needs to be clear that the path is state dependent, based on further confirmation that we are on track to achieve our dual-mandate goals over the medium term.	23	2
201512	1657	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	I believe that alternative B as written provides this clarity and strikes a reasonable balance among competing concerns.	23	2
201512	1658	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Another important feature in alternative B is the language in paragraph 4 stating that the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent means the Committee needs to give special consideration to actual and expected progress toward our inflation target.	23	2
201512	1659	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	This language recognizes reality.	23	2
201512	1660	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	It acknowledges that the main challenge we face today is getting inflation back up to target.	23	2
201512	1661	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	It appropriately emphasizes our concern over this policy shortfall, and it seems about as close as we can get today to saying that we are committed to a symmetric inflation target.	23	2
201512	1662	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	As I’ve discussed here many times before, if we act as if our target is actually a ceiling, it will be all that much harder for us to ever achieve our policy mandate.	23	2
201512	1663	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Most of us have said that we think we have a symmetric inflation target.	23	2
201512	1664	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Let’s make sure we also act as if we do.	23	2
201512	1665	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	And I hope that we will talk more about symmetry in January during the annual review of our longer- run goals and policy strategy.	23	2
201512	1666	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1667	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1668	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201512	1669	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1670	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201512	1671	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is positive news that the economy is finally at the point at which it is appropriate to get off the zero lower bound, a point we should continue to contemplate.	23	2
201512	1672	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Labor markets have certainly improved, and it was good news that the past two employment reports have been so positive.	23	2
201512	1673	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am reasonably confident that inflation will reach 2 percent, at least in part based on the current tightness in the labor market.	23	2
201512	1674	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, as I highlighted yesterday, the biggest risk to my forecast is that inflation does not rise to 2 percent as anticipated, similar to the comments that President Evans just made.	23	2
201512	1675	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we raise rates, I would suggest that we continue along that path only as our confidence that our inflation target will be met improves from reasonable to high.	23	2
201512	1676	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since I expect the tangible evidence of movement toward our inflation target to be slow, I am quite comfortable with a normalization path that incorporates only a gradual increase in rates.	23	2
201512	1677	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we don’t move from reasonable confidence to high confidence, I could easily imagine a pace of normalization slower than in my SEP.	23	2
201512	1678	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Today we do not need to decide the path, and I am confident that it is appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.	23	2
201512	1679	2015-12-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1680	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1681	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201512	1682	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1683	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’m afraid I’m going to make a longer statement, but with the same result.	23	2
201512	1684	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I favor raising the target federal funds rate to a range of 25 to 50 basis points.	23	2
201512	1685	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Because the FOMC has not raised the federal funds rate for nearly 10 years, because the rate was at its effective lower bound for more than 7 years, and because it was reduced to its present level at the height of the worst US financial crisis of the past 80 years, this move has acquired a significance that goes beyond the impact that would be expected on the basis of a 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate in more normal circumstances.	23	2
201512	1686	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The decision is significant also because it is the beginning of the process of normalization of monetary policy.	23	2
201512	1687	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	As the Chair and other members of this Committee have emphasized, most members of the FOMC expect that the normalization process will be gradual.	23	2
201512	1688	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	But we are all quick to add that the process will be data and outcome dependent, and that if prices and employment increase more rapidly than we currently anticipate, the future path of the interest rate will be steeper than we now anticipate.	23	2
201512	1689	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We should and do emphasize, no less, that if the economy falters and prices and employment increase more slowly than we currently anticipate, the future path of the interest rate will be shallower than we now anticipate, and shallowness includes the possibility that the interest rate path may reverse its slope.	23	2
201512	1690	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Yesterday, colleagues around the table made impressive presentations, setting out some of the downside risks of the decision we will be making in a few hours.	23	2
201512	1691	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I thought as I listened that it was a privilege to be a member of this Committee as we discuss the nation’s monetary policy with a seriousness and a level that is appropriate to the significance of our task.	23	2
201512	1692	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	For that we owe and express thanks not only to one another, but also and particularly to the Chair and to the staff.	23	2
201512	1693	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We said in March that we would move to raise interest rates as long as labor market conditions continued to improve and when members of the Committee were reasonably confident that inflation would return to its 2 percent target level over the medium term.	23	2
201512	1694	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe those conditions have been met.	23	2
201512	1695	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	This conclusion depends on my belief that, over the medium term, the Phillips-curve relationship will reassert itself, and I think we are beginning to see some signs of that in the behavior of labor compensation, but only faintly so.	23	2
201512	1696	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	What other factors are relevant?	23	2
201512	1697	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Let me list only eight.	23	2
201512	1698	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	One, the increase in the interest rate is very small.	23	2
201512	1699	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	We will be moving from an ultraexpansionary monetary policy to an extremely expansionary monetary policy.	23	2
201512	1700	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Two, what happens next?	23	2
201512	1701	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	On that issue, members of the FOMC have been clear, as I just said, that we expect a gradual process of normalization and recognize the possibility that the rate may also decline.	23	2
201512	1702	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Three, we should not minimize the uncertainties we always face about the future, especially in a situation such as the one we face today when we’re about to implement a new monetary policy mechanism designed to operate with our extremely large portfolio and with large countries, including China and Brazil, facing major economic policy challenges.	23	2
201512	1703	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Four, the Federal Reserve System has developed and tested the approach we will be using to raise the interest rate.	23	2
201512	1704	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	At one stage, it seemed useful to describe it as a corridor system, but it is more accurate to describe it as a two-story system.	23	2
201512	1705	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Not only has the system been tested, but the staff has also developed other mechanisms for use in a circumstance under which the two- story system does not do the job it is designed and expected to do.	23	2
201512	1706	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Five, we’re sending a signal not only about our expectations regarding the future, but also about what has been achieved so far:  a return to near normal in the labor market, which is an extraordinary success for the policies this Committee has implemented since the end of 2008— but, six, at a time when largely temporary forces are keeping the inflation rate significantly below its target level.	23	2
201512	1707	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	There are good reasons to expect that the continuing declines in the price of energy and in the appreciation of the dollar are temporary.	23	2
201512	1708	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Seven, many colleagues are concerned about indications that the expected rate of inflation has declined somewhat during recent months.	23	2
201512	1709	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I am also concerned, but I think that the more significant phenomenon is how little expected inflation has declined over the very long period that the actual inflation rate has been well below the target level of 2 percent.	23	2
201512	1710	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Eight, the economy has, during the course of the past year, withstood powerful headwinds and continued to increase employment, with a core PCE inflation rate that has remained above 1 percent and expected inflation rates that have stayed close to 2 percent.	23	2
201512	1711	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	In sum, our economy has done a superb, albeit not perfect, job in the continuing task of restoring a more normal labor market.	23	2
201512	1712	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And I believe we will, over the medium term, return to the vicinity of our target inflation rate and to a situation in which the interest rate will again play its role in the allocation of resources, including the allocation between financial activities and real investment.	23	2
201512	1713	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Why move now?	23	2
201512	1714	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Why not wait longer?	23	2
201512	1715	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, as the Chair has emphasized, our actions become effective with a lag.	23	2
201512	1716	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, there are some signs of accumulating financial stability problems.	23	2
201512	1717	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And, third, the signal we will be sending will reinforce the fact that our economic situation is continuing to normalize.	23	2
201512	1718	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	It is, of course, our duty to consider the many ways our expectations could be driven off track, but we also have to assign probabilities to the shocks that might drive us off track and to our ability to deal with them.	23	2
201512	1719	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	My conclusion is that we’re more likely to continue along a positive track and to withstand the negative forces with which we will certainly have to contend as events unfold and which may temporarily drive us off course.	23	2
201512	1720	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like next to turn, but briefly, to a few issues that continue to crop up.	23	2
201512	1721	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, are we about to repeat the experience of 1936 and 1937, as one hears?	23	2
201512	1722	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	No.	23	2
201512	1723	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The financial system is currently in good shape and will remain in good shape so long as we successfully manage financial stability, as I believe we’re doing now.	23	2
201512	1724	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	And, no, because there is no intention of tightening fiscal policy, as was done 80 years ago.	23	2
201512	1725	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, are we too late to move?	23	2
201512	1726	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	No.	23	2
201512	1727	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The financial system is basically in good shape, although there are some signs of instability in very localized instances, and employment continues to grow.	23	2
201512	1728	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	But what if growth ceases?	23	2
201512	1729	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then we can reduce the interest rate.	23	2
201512	1730	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I do not expect that we will have to do that, but I do believe we need to reconsider the argument that we should stay at the zero lower bound because if we try to get away from it, we will have to return to it.	23	2
201512	1731	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	That will always be a possibility for any country that decides to raise the interest rate above the ZLB, for negative shocks happen.	23	2
201512	1732	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	But that possibility should not keep us at the zero lower bound forever.	23	2
201512	1733	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	It is not enough to give an example of countries that have had to return to the zero lower bound.	23	2
201512	1734	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	One has to consider the expected value of trying to move away versus the expected value of staying put.	23	2
201512	1735	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The possibility that we will have to move back should not keep us at the zero lower bound forever, for the outlook is positive, and positive shocks also happen even if, by definition, we do not know when shocks will happen.	23	2
201512	1736	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Third, isn’t the rest of the world in too fragile a state for us to move?	23	2
201512	1737	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Most of the rest of the world is not doing well, but this economy has succeeded in increasing employment at a rapid rate despite the appreciation of the dollar and the decline in net exports.	23	2
201512	1738	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Expectations are that the growth rate of foreign countries will increase in 2016.	23	2
201512	1739	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Further, the exchange rate will cease appreciating at some point—and we saw some suggestions yesterday that it could be soon.	23	2
201512	1740	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that as we look to the future, we should address several worrisome developments with respect to our ability to do our job, particularly the constraints placed on our ability to act as the lender of last resort in a crisis and the shortage of policy tools to deal with financial stability.	23	2
201512	1741	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	There are other monetary policy topics we will need to address in the period ahead, particularly the role of forward guidance, the monetary mechanism toward which we are evolving, and the possibilities of finding new tools to deal with the zero lower bound.	23	2
201512	1742	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So, to conclude, we’re setting out on a new journey with the same goals we’ve always had—maximum employment, stable prices, and financial stability.	23	2
201512	1743	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	The journey is difficult and daunting, but we can take some comfort from the successes of Federal Reserve policy since the end of 2008, even while we need to remember the warning sent by the fact that there was a global financial crisis that began in September 2008.	23	2
201512	1744	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	As always, we’re operating in a world in flux.	23	2
201512	1745	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	At this time, a world that, after the historical entry of China into the modern world economy and the likely entry down the road of India into the modern world economy, the world may well be more like the world economy of the pre-BRICS era than we expected just a few years ago.	23	2
201512	1746	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, we are not the only policymakers whose actions affect the economy.	23	2
201512	1747	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, we do not have some of the tools that we need to manage financial stability.	23	2
201512	1748	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	But we have a job to do—monetary policy—and we have the tools to manage it.	23	2
201512	1749	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I expect that we will continue to do our job well, and that the decision we are likely to take today will be part of doing that job well.	23	2
201512	1750	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1751	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1752	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201512	1753	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1754	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B, and I’m satisfied that the statement as written will serve as effective communication of the Committee’s momentous decision in alternative B.	23	2
201512	1755	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to spend a couple of minutes sharing some anticipatory thoughts on possible implications of the sentence in paragraph 4 that begins “In light of the current shortfall of inflation.”	23	2
201512	1756	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This sentence calls out inflation as the focus of attention as we go through 2016 and, since the Committee’s decisions will be data dependent, suggests that the inflation data will significantly influence subsequent policy rate decisions.	23	2
201512	1757	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The SEP dot chart looks as though it will set up an expectation of rate increases on a schedule of every other meeting.	23	2
201512	1758	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The word “gradual,” used twice in the alternative B statement, will, to some extent, take its definition from the SEP.	23	2
201512	1759	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	So, assuming a move in January is a virtual nonstarter, which I do, the expectation will be for a second policy rate move in March.	23	2
201512	1760	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In the spirit of an “eyes wide open” approach, I think it’s worth considering what we will likely know at the time of the March meeting.	23	2
201512	1761	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We will have the February CPI data arriving on the second day of that meeting.	23	2
201512	1762	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We will have PCE price data only through January.	23	2
201512	1763	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	With the continuing softness in oil, gasoline, and commodity prices, it seems to me likely that the inflation data we will have in hand will be very weak.	23	2
201512	1764	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The Tealbook, in fact, suggests zero for the headline inflation number for the first quarter.	23	2
201512	1765	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	At this juncture, I have no reason to dispute the Tealbook projection.	23	2
201512	1766	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The Chair pointed out yesterday that we might have a small uptick in the year-over-year headline and core PCE readings because January 2015 was extremely weak.	23	2
201512	1767	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Even so, an inflation-data-dependent decision to raise the policy rate a second time in March could be problematic, it seems to me.	23	2
201512	1768	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said at the beginning of my comments, I support the statement as written.	23	2
201512	1769	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, I’m a little concerned about how we will operationalize the criterion of actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal in the early part of next year.	23	2
201512	1770	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I doubt we will have inflation statistics that are supportive of a conclusion that progress is being made.	23	2
201512	1771	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We may have to rely once more on employment data, along with the faith-based expectations drawn from our forecasts.	23	2
201512	1772	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The emphasis may have to remain on the expected, rather than the actual, inflation evidence.	23	2
201512	1773	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My overall point is a small one, really:  It’s one thing to project from the SEP exercise a forecast-based median level of the funds rate at year-end 2016.	23	2
201512	1774	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	It may well be another thing to make post-liftoff rate decisions in real time, especially in March, before those forecasts have had much validation.	23	2
201512	1775	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	So before the ink is long dry on today’s statement, we may well be advised to start thinking about how to make subsequent policy decisions and, very importantly, how to communicate the nuances of data dependence when the data are less complete or more ambiguous than we would like.	23	2
201512	1776	2015-12-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1777	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1778	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201512	1779	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1780	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	For the past several meetings, I’ve been convinced that economic conditions warranted an increase in our target federal funds rate range.	23	2
201512	1781	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	This was based on a sense that labor markets were in line with our best assessments of what constitutes full employment and on confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent once the most recent disinflationary impulse has passed.	23	2
201512	1782	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Since then, as I discussed in our earlier go- round, the economic reports for the United States haven’t appreciably altered that assessment.	23	2
201512	1783	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	So I continue to see a rate increase as well justified, and I support alternative B.	23	2
201512	1784	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	It’s great to be able to say that.	23	2
201512	1785	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	With this first rate increase effectively behind us, market attention is going to focus on the guidance we provide in the statement regarding the prospective funds rate path.	23	2
201512	1786	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Many Committee participants, myself included, have been saying that they expect the pace of the funds rate increases to be gradual.	23	2
201512	1787	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	As a result, market participants probably expect to see the word “gradual” in the statement.	23	2
201512	1788	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	As drafted, the statement does a great job of that.	23	2
201512	1789	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	It includes it twice—once in paragraph 2, in which we refer to “gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,” and then again down in paragraph 4, in which we refer to “only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”	23	2
201512	1790	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	These are both new elements.	23	2
201512	1791	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	My sense is that this statement could well push down the expected path of short-term rates.	23	2
201512	1792	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think pushing down the expected path of short-term rates would be a desirable outcome.	23	2
201512	1793	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	As we saw yesterday, markets already expect a funds rate path substantially below the path embodied in the median SEP or the staff’s forecast.	23	2
201512	1794	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	And according to the Tealbook, the market’s uncertainty about the pace of tightening is well below the levels seen during the previous tightening episodes, and I thought that evidence was quite striking.	23	2
201512	1795	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Under those circumstances, we should avoid pushing down market expectations of the funds rate path even further, but I’m willing to support the statement as written.	23	2
201512	1796	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	However, I think we’re running a risk here of exacerbating the disconnect between the market’s expectations of the funds rate path and ours, and I hope that doesn’t happen.	23	2
201512	1797	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I also see a risk that emphasizing a gradual path could reinforce the excessive sense of certainty in markets about that path, and that that could impede the adjustment of market expectations if the economic outlook starts to change materially in either direction, as Governor Fischer emphasized.	23	2
201512	1798	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	We should provide guidance to markets about how we will react to incoming data whenever we can, and I think the new sentence in paragraph 4 that President Lockhart discussed, which refers to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, seems to be a constructive element that does so.	23	2
201512	1799	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	But a heavy stress on the word “gradual” could dampen the market’s responsiveness to incoming data.	23	2
201512	1800	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	If anything, based on the Tealbook’s assessment of the market’s current lack of uncertainty about rates, I think it would be worthwhile to encourage markets to be less certain about the future path of rates.	23	2
201512	1801	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	I have a suggestion regarding communications for use either in the press conference or more generally for all of us, and this is a “bipartisan” suggestion.	23	2
201512	1802	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Lately, the answer to questions about the pace of increases seems to be a one-word mantra, “gradual.”	23	2
201512	1803	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	And it seems to have emerged as this cycle’s replacement for the two-word mantra of “measured pace,” which, during the past tightening cycle, came to be understood to mean precisely a quarter-point increase per meeting.	23	2
201512	1804	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	So I’d suggest that our mantra should be a four-word phrase, “gradual but data dependent,” in order to emphasize that responding to economic conditions takes precedent over implied past promises to proceed at any particular pace.	23	2
201512	1805	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	In other words, we shouldn’t say the word “gradual” without saying “but data dependent.”	23	2
201512	1806	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1807	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1808	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201512	1809	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1810	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	As everyone will have inferred from my remarks yesterday, I don’t think it’s appropriate policy to raise rates today.	23	2
201512	1811	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Even if one is inclined toward the transitory factors hypothesis, today seems an odd moment to declare reasonable confidence that inflation will return to the Committee’s stated 2 percent target, what with the further declines in oil prices, the expected extension of strong dollar effects, the CPI reading earlier in the week, and the number of concerns expressed here yesterday about inflation expectations.	23	2
201512	1812	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	In light of the number of important questions about whether inflation dynamics have changed in recent years, as well as about the labor market, I continue to believe it more prudent for the Committee to act more on evidence than on faith that traditional economic patterns and relationships will reassert themselves.	23	2
201512	1813	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Again, I don’t deny that these patterns may reemerge, but it’s far from certain.	23	2
201512	1814	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And with numerous tightening tools available in an economy that is not running very hot but with an unappealing set of options were more accommodation to be needed, I think it wise to be particularly certain of the directions of inflation and the economy before raising rates, thereby diminishing the chances of this latter eventuality.	23	2
201512	1815	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	My policy preference is captured fairly well by alternative A, though I would remove the sentence in paragraph 3 about providing additional accommodation.	23	2
201512	1816	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, I’ve asked myself what the best argument for acting today is and have listened to or read the views of many others on this topic.	23	2
201512	1817	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It seems the best reason to act lies not in the economics we face at today’s meeting, but in the fact that many on the Committee and, more recently, a particularly influential member thereof have intimated that we’re going to do so.	23	2
201512	1818	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve noted in the past that one shouldn’t follow through on an ill-advised policy just because one has said one might adopt that policy, but I have to admit that, at this point, the credibility of the FOMC is at some risk since many in the markets and the public believe that the FOMC promised September, then didn’t act, and has now promised December.	23	2
201512	1819	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	This poses some disturbing institutional issues—most important, the question of whether the Committee is to be pushed into action through arguably premature or overbroad public statements.	23	2
201512	1820	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	That is an important issue, and maybe it should bear discussion at some point in the Committee.	23	2
201512	1821	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	But, speaking for myself at this meeting, I wasn’t a part of this, and, as many will recall, I’ve advised against this pattern of frequent public comments with frequent references to particular meetings.	23	2
201512	1822	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Despite all of that, I will reluctantly go along with alternative B today for two reasons.	23	2
201512	1823	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, there is the institutional reality that there’s enormous significance attached out there to a member of the Board voting against the Chair’s position.	23	2
201512	1824	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Perhaps this shouldn’t be this way and we might be better off with the culture of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, but reality is what it is.	23	2
201512	1825	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	This moment of liftoff after seven years would be a particularly bad time to enter a dissent and thereby risk the Chair’s leadership position at a critical moment in monetary policy, which may face some considerable challenges in the months ahead.	23	2
201512	1826	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second, the Committee’s decision today as shaped by the Chair is, at least by its terms, not just for the rate rise, but also for an approach to monetary policy over the next year, one that is presumptively gradual and, with the addition of the language on inflation to paragraph 4, emphasizes what I’ve been suggesting—that is, it pays particular attention to whether inflation plays out as today’s SEP suggests it will.	23	2
201512	1827	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I requested such language and feel that its inclusion provides some basis for my going along with what is a broader policy orientation than just the federal funds rate increase.	23	2
201512	1828	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, as I suggested yesterday, the transitory factors hypothesis is plausible.	23	2
201512	1829	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I hope this orientation will mean that I’ll be closer to the majority of the Committee in assessing the economy—and inflation, in particular—as we go forward.	23	2
201512	1830	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	After all, even though I do think some secular changes in the economy may be playing an important role in affecting inflation, my baseline expectation is still for a gradual upward movement next year.	23	2
201512	1831	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Because of the questions that I discussed yesterday, I just don’t have enough confidence to act on those expectations right now.	23	2
201512	1832	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I was going to omit this statement.	23	2
201512	1833	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I had written this out last night, and I crossed it out this morning.	23	2
201512	1834	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	But, having just listened to several other comments, I recognize that others may differ, and I may be left concluding at a future meeting that faith has trumped empirics too much.	23	2
201512	1835	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I have to confess, I already hear some effort to undermine the language that has been inserted, so I’m afraid I do anticipate that I may have some differences with the majority of the Committee in the future.	23	2
201512	1836	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I hope not.	23	2
201512	1837	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I have one final point, though.	23	2
201512	1838	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	My focus on evidence and pragmatics is not one way.	23	2
201512	1839	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a position of principled or devoted dovishness.	23	2
201512	1840	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	If, for example, inflation were to begin moving well ahead of what the Committee expects in a way that suggested a trend, I would not be averse to taking quicker action despite my current instinct that things have changed in the economy in some pretty basic ways over the past 10 or so years.	23	2
201512	1841	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	And it’s for that reason that I actually would not want any stronger language in the statement committing us to a gradual approach or to reinvestment.	23	2
201512	1842	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	I never thought that it’s a particularly good idea to remove the kind of optionality that one wants to maintain up until the point of a decision.	23	2
201512	1843	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1844	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1845	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23	2
201512	1846	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	23	2
201512	1847	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I am in favor of alternative B as written.	23	2
201512	1848	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe it is time to begin the process of normalizing policy, and I am very mindful of the fact, as we have discussed, that monetary policy operates with a lag.	23	2
201512	1849	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we will likely need to maintain some level of accommodation for some period because of slower growth outside the United States—in particular, severe overcapacity and overleverage in China, which will likely push down rates of growth there for some extended period; aging demographics in the United States, which are likely to negatively affect workforce participation rates; and, in addition, the end of the so-called debt supercycle globally, which means that if there are debt increases in the future, they will need to be primarily supported by income growth.	23	2
201512	1850	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In light of all of these factors, though, I agree with the plan to remove accommodation gradually and assess and reassess conditions as we go.	23	2
201512	1851	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I also agree with the tone of our statement and ongoing communications, which emphasize our intention to move gradually; an explanation that this means we are likely to remain accommodative even after this increase, and that, even after a couple of more moves, that still means we have some degree of accommodation; and an emphasis that we will be data and state dependent on the upside as well as the downside.	23	2
201512	1852	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In 2016, I expect to see GDP grow 2 or 2½ percent, driven primarily by strength in the services sector, and that manufacturing will remain weak.	23	2
201512	1853	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I do expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline, further reducing labor market slack, and I think that inflation will move up, but gradually, eventually converging to 2 percent.	23	2
201512	1854	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	As we do this, I do believe markets have been well communicated with or set up, so they should be able to process these moves, although there will be bouts of volatility and some market illiquidity because of the structure of the investment industry, particularly as it’s developed in the past number of years.	23	2
201512	1855	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This volatility may be driven higher, particularly if corporate earnings continue to be sluggish, which I think is a distinct possibility.	23	2
201512	1856	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Some amount of market revaluation may be healthy, though, particularly with P/Es and market-cap-to-GDP measures at historically elevated levels.	23	2
201512	1857	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So I wouldn’t want to necessarily over-read or overreact to some level of market volatility, although I’m sure we’ll discuss this further as we go forward.	23	2
201512	1858	2015-12-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1859	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1860	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201512	1861	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1862	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m heartened by the continued progress on getting Americans back to work and by the prospect that there’s room to pull more prime-age workers back into the labor force.	23	2
201512	1863	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, I’m uneasy about the inflation leg of our mandate, and it would be difficult for me to point to any developments in the intermeeting period that have raised my confidence that core inflation will move to our 2 percent target in the next two to three years.	23	2
201512	1864	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	For six years now, PCE inflation has averaged below 1.5 percent.	23	2
201512	1865	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As this is despite substantial monetary accommodation and a substantial gain in resource utilization, it really does suggest that the Phillips curve is inert.	23	2
201512	1866	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, I’m troubled by hints that the persistent underperformance of inflation may be having some effect on inflation expectations.	23	2
201512	1867	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although previously, survey data had remained fairly steady, recent readings of both the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Michigan survey—and, of course, as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveys—have drifted lower.	23	2
201512	1868	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This follows a pronounced and persistent deterioration in market-based measures.	23	2
201512	1869	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, while the risks to domestic activity look relatively balanced, I am wary regarding the fact that that foreign developments could continue to pose downside risks to economic activity and financial conditions.	23	2
201512	1870	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	China is in the midst of navigating a complex of difficult cyclical and structural challenges.	23	2
201512	1871	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent further sharp declines in oil and metals prices underscore ongoing risks to a broader set of emerging markets, which are confronting challenges of their own that could be exacerbated by further terms-of-trade deterioration, weak growth prospects, and difficulties associated with elevated debt burdens.	23	2
201512	1872	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It would be unwise to dismiss lightly the risk of further bouts of currency volatility or pressure on these economies.	23	2
201512	1873	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m also mindful of the fact that there are important risks on the other side—in particular, the risk that inflationary pressures may emerge with greater force than is expected today.	23	2
201512	1874	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As I take into account the risks on both sides, the combination of asymmetrically greater room to tighten than to ease through conventional means; core inflation stubbornly below its target, with the deterioration we’ve seen in inflation expectations; and downside risks arising from abroad leads me to place somewhat greater weight on the possible regret associated with tightening too early than on the possible regret associated with waiting a little longer to see some of these risks play out before moving.	23	2
201512	1875	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I respect, of course, that many other members of the Committee, after lengthy deliberations, have come to a different conclusion.	23	2
201512	1876	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In that context, those same risk-management considerations argue for great care in what we communicate about the path forward.	23	2
201512	1877	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me highlight three specific aspects.	23	2
201512	1878	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	First, in light of the persistent low readings on inflation, the deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, and the fact that we will be lifting off when actual inflation remains well short of our goal, it’s very important to me to emphasize that future monetary policy will be importantly shaped by the credibility of our commitment to move inflation back to our target.	23	2
201512	1879	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In our discussion of the likely future path of monetary policy in paragraph 4, I put a lot of weight on the language that calls out inflation developments and progress toward our 2 percent goal as importantly influencing the stance of future policy.	23	2
201512	1880	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, the combination of a low neutral rate with slow progress on inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the effective lower bound than in previous decades, when the nominal neutral interest rate was probably much higher.	23	2
201512	1881	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The lower the longer-term nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate well below zero to provide accommodation.	23	2
201512	1882	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, monetary policy is likely to remain more constrained at the effective lower bound than to be operating at interest rate levels above it.	23	2
201512	1883	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As the probability of hitting the effective lower bound increases, that asymmetry in our flexibility becomes more pronounced.	23	2
201512	1884	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	For this reason, it’s very helpful that the statement provides additional guidance reflecting the Committee’s consideration of our reinvestment policy.	23	2
201512	1885	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The language in the fifth paragraph clarifying that the Committee anticipates continuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” helps clarify that future changes in monetary policy initially will rely primarily on the funds rate—our best-understood and most tested policy tool—and will provide more room to respond to negative shocks through conventional monetary tools.	23	2
201512	1886	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, it’s very important to communicate that, based on our understanding of the neutral rate, the path is likely to be more gradual and move to a lower level than has been the case in past tightening cycles.	23	2
201512	1887	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent research by the staff and others has shown that the current neutral rate is extremely low by historical standards and has persisted at a very low level for some time.	23	2
201512	1888	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Furthermore, persistent changes in demographics, productivity growth, risk premiums, and foreign growth suggest that it may remain at a low level well into the future.	23	2
201512	1889	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As these circumstances are highly unusual, it’s necessary to communicate to the public the effects they will have on monetary policy—namely, that normalization of the policy rate will likely be more gradual than in previous tightening episodes and likely move to a longer-run policy rate below historical norms.	23	2
201512	1890	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, the “gradual and low path” message should help reduce the risk of a “tightening tantrum” reaction to liftoff—a reaction that could slow progress toward both of our goals.	23	2
201512	1891	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	For all of these reasons, I place a lot of weight on the message that the pace of normalization is likely to be gradual, albeit data dependent.	23	2
201512	1892	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me conclude by saying I appreciate the careful and exhaustive preparations that have been undertaken by the staff, as well as the thoughtful approach of the Chair and the Committee over the past many months to ensure liftoff is operationally well managed and to align public expectations with the Committee’s policy reaction function and outlook.	23	2
201512	1893	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	At this critical juncture, I place a very high premium on ensuring the credibility of monetary policy and demonstrating effective control over monetary policy right out of the box.	23	2
201512	1894	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I support the Chair’s preferred approach as laid out in alternative B.	23	2
201512	1895	2015-12-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1896	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1897	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201512	1898	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1899	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today.	23	2
201512	1900	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to react a little bit to comments that have already been made.	23	2
201512	1901	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Generally speaking, I think we’re in good shape for this meeting, and congratulations to you, Madam Chair, for maneuvering us into this position.	23	2
201512	1902	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	My basic position has been that labor markets are largely healed, certainly as measured by the unemployment rate.	23	2
201512	1903	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Also, if you look at the level of the labor market conditions index that the Board staff has, you will find that that index is well above its average level since 1976.	23	2
201512	1904	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that inflation can be interpreted as more or less soft but as only a little bit below target net of the big oil price shock that we’re dealing with globally.	23	2
201512	1905	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I interpret that oil price decline as great news, really, for the US economy ultimately, even though it’s disrupting our interpretation of the inflation data.	23	2
201512	1906	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’re actually very close to our goals on both employment and inflation if you take the interpretation I’m suggesting.	23	2
201512	1907	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Internationally, I agree with the staff judgment that, in 2016, emerging market economies’ growth will improve to 3½ percent, and advanced foreign economies’ growth will increase to 2 percent.	23	2
201512	1908	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, forecasts are forecasts, but that’s probably the best judgment about what’s going to happen globally.	23	2
201512	1909	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	For these reasons, I think we’re in very good shape to start normalizing at this meeting.	23	2
201512	1910	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do think it’s the end of an era.	23	2
201512	1911	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	It sends a positive signal concerning the future of the US economy, and I agree with President Rosengren on that comment.	23	2
201512	1912	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think sending negative signals has plagued us since the end of the recession.	23	2
201512	1913	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve been worried about the economy.	23	2
201512	1914	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	That worry has transmitted into private-sector expectations and perhaps been damaging.	23	2
201512	1915	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So, when we can say we do see healing and we’re willing to acknowledge a better performance than what we had a couple of years ago, that’s a positive thing for the US economy.	23	2
201512	1916	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ll see how that plays out once we get going here.	23	2
201512	1917	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Evans on the symmetry argument about inflation.	23	2
201512	1918	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve never considered 2 percent inflation to be a cap, and I don’t think most people on the Committee think of the 2 percent target as a cap.	23	2
201512	1919	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I agree with the idea that we should emphasize the symmetry of our inflation target.	23	2
201512	1920	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We do that in our public commentary.	23	2
201512	1921	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do feel very strongly, however, that this should be a forward-looking statement, because that’s the way the Committee has behaved in the past.	23	2
201512	1922	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	In the current era, right now, we’ve missed to the low side, but we’ve repeatedly said we think it’s going to come back to target.	23	2
201512	1923	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Similarly, in the 2003–07 era, when we missed to the high side, arguably also because of commodity price movements, we repeatedly said during that era, “Yes, we’ve missed to the high side, but we think inflation is going to come back to target.”	23	2
201512	1924	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So, given the way that the Committee actually behaves, the number of misses on one side or another, even if they’re persistent, isn’t really the big factor.	23	2
201512	1925	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The big factor is, can the Committee make a reasonable case that they think inflation is going to come back to target?	23	2
201512	1926	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what we did from 2003 to 2007.	23	2
201512	1927	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what we’re doing again now.	23	2
201512	1928	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, there are all kinds of debates about how good that argument really is, and that does affect policy.	23	2
201512	1929	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But I feel strongly that if we’re going to talk about symmetry, it should be symmetry in the sense of “We’d be worried if we couldn’t make a good case that inflation’s going to come back to target from wherever it is.”	23	2
201512	1930	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have three main concerns about our current decision today.	23	2
201512	1931	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	One is, we’re normalizing but possibly so slowly that it’s really almost no normalization at all.	23	2
201512	1932	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think you have to take that into account.	23	2
201512	1933	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We could easily get hit with weaker data.	23	2
201512	1934	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve had a lot of residual seasonality in the first quarter, for instance.	23	2
201512	1935	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I was talking to President Harker about this yesterday.	23	2
201512	1936	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	You could easily get weak data in the first half of next year, and you really don’t get going very far on a normalization process.	23	2
201512	1937	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think we have to face up to the idea that we may not ever be able to get truly off the effective lower bound in a meaningful way, and that we might have to operate in an environment of low nominal interest rates for a very long time.	23	2
201512	1938	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We may not be able to return to the equilibrium of the period from 1984 to 2007, which is the equilibrium on which most of our empirical work is based, most of our theory is based, and most of our intuition is based.	23	2
201512	1939	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We may not be able to get back there, and we have to think about how we would conduct monetary policy in an era that’s like that.	23	2
201512	1940	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Another aspect of this is, yes, we’re trying to normalize, barely—25 basis points here today.	23	2
201512	1941	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But the G-7 isn’t normalizing, and they’re not particularly close to normalizing.	23	2
201512	1942	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Even in my head, I think we’ve still got this yearning to go back to the 1984–2007 era, and you have to recognize that we may not be able to get there.	23	2
201512	1943	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I hope we can, but we may not.	23	2
201512	1944	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	And the gradual pace, in combination with what the data might possibly hand us, makes me think that we may not be able to get there.	23	2
201512	1945	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The second concern is the possibility that we will be insufficiently state contingent in the normalization process.	23	2
201512	1946	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The 2004–06 normalization cycle included 17 straight meetings by this Committee—a few of you were here—that had an increase in the policy rate of 25 basis points at every single meeting.	23	2
201512	1947	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	That does not look very state contingent.	23	2
201512	1948	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	In retrospect, I’m fairly certain it was not optimal policy during that era.	23	2
201512	1949	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, it ended very badly for the US economy and for the global economy.	23	2
201512	1950	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Governor Tarullo used the phrase “maintaining optionality,” which, historically, has been very popular around here, and it’s popular with me.	23	2
201512	1951	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think you definitely want to maintain optionality.	23	2
201512	1952	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee desperately needs to be more flexible, sometimes speeding up and sometimes slowing down in response to macroeconomic events.	23	2
201512	1953	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not quite sure how we can actually get to a situation in which we’re willing to make one decision at one meeting and a different decision at the next meeting.	23	2
201512	1954	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But we cannot let “gradual” become the new “measured pace,” with the Committee just marching on regardless of what the data are saying.	23	2
201512	1955	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Lacker that we could try to phrase something like “data dependent gradualism” or “gradual but also data dependent” or something like that.	23	2
201512	1956	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve used the “data dependent” phrase so much that it may be losing effectiveness anyway because no one is sure if that really means trends in the data or the latest reading on a particular element of the data just days before a particular meeting.	23	2
201512	1957	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we still have work to do on this dimension.	23	2
201512	1958	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of risk that we get into a “measured pace” sort of scenario.	23	2
201512	1959	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	That did not work out well from 2004 to 2006.	23	2
201512	1960	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	My third concern, and my last comment here, is that I don’t think we have enough headroom on the balance sheet.	23	2
201512	1961	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee remains unwittingly committed to QE as the main policy tool should a recession develop over the policy horizon, and the staff reminded us that the unconditional probability of a recession in any year is probably 15 percent.	23	2
201512	1962	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So it could easily be that we get hit by bad data and go back into recession sometime over the forecast horizon.	23	2
201512	1963	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	A prudent policy would be to allow some runoff in the balance sheet to reduce it and at least move it a little bit toward a more manageable size, in order to give us more headroom in the circumstance of a new recession.	23	2
201512	1964	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think that ending reinvestment would have much of an effect on the macroeconomy today, but it would give us a little more room should we have to return to QE.	23	2
201512	1965	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I know that the Committee, across the “hawk/dove” spectrum here, has basically sworn off QE.	23	2
201512	1966	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But I don’t think it’s realistic to swear this off until you get to a fully normalized policy rate.	23	2
201512	1967	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Until we get there, we’re probably dependent on QE.	23	2
201512	1968	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Once the crisis hits, there’s going to be tremendous pressure on us to do something, and this is really our main tool.	23	2
201512	1969	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we want to ask ourselves, are you willing to go to $6 trillion, $7 trillion, or the kind of balance sheet that the Bank of Japan has?	23	2
201512	1970	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I really think it would just be prudent to allow some runoff.	23	2
201512	1971	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think it would have much impact on the economy today, but it would be a way to create a little more headroom in case we got into that scenario.	23	2
201512	1972	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t want to get in that scenario, and you don’t, either.	23	2
201512	1973	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	But that’s the reality of our situation while the policy rate remains very low.	23	2
201512	1974	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I urge the Committee to give some thought to creating headroom on the balance sheet by ending the reinvestment.	23	2
201512	1975	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1976	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1977	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201512	1978	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1979	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B today.	23	2
201512	1980	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The Committee has said that it will raise the federal funds rate when there has been further improvement in the labor market and when the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will return to the 2 percent objective in the medium term.	23	2
201512	1981	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I see those tests as met today.	23	2
201512	1982	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The inflation part of the test, for me, is a closer call, particularly in light of uncertainty about inflation dynamics.	23	2
201512	1983	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The Committee will need to monitor closely the progress of inflation, and, under the Chair’s leadership, I am more than reasonably confident that we’ll do that.	23	2
201512	1984	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	As I mentioned yesterday, I think it’s likely to be necessary for the economy to run above trend for some time to ensure that inflation does reach our 2 percent target.	23	2
201512	1985	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	If the economy evolves about as expected, I’m prepared to support a very gradual path for rate increases to achieve that outcome.	23	2
201512	1986	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	The statement is up to the task of signaling that the Committee expects to move gradually—again, assuming that the path is about as we expect.	23	2
201512	1987	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	And I would single out the mention of “gradual” twice, which will certainly be noticed.	23	2
201512	1988	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Let me say that I’m fine with that and am happy to support this statement as written.	23	2
201512	1989	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Finally, I do think it’s right that the market observers will read the SEP and think, “Four increases,” and they know the press conference schedule, so “Let’s focus on March.”	23	2
201512	1990	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	There will be a natural tendency to assume that there’s another increase in March.	23	2
201512	1991	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Let me just say now that that is not my prior at all.	23	2
201512	1992	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I have no prior about March.	23	2
201512	1993	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I wrote down three increases, not four.	23	2
201512	1994	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	I’m very happy to go through, therefore, a six-month period of no rate increases next year, and I would like to see that decision remain open and evolve according to the incoming data.	23	2
201512	1995	2015-12-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1996	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	1997	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23	2
201512	1998	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	1999	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In line with my economic forecast, my position on policy remains that we should raise rates at this meeting, and that the path of future funds rate increases should be gradual and data dependent, to use President Lacker’s language.	23	2
201512	2000	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Given my inflation forecast, I anticipate that this will lead to a rather gradual tightening of policy, and that policy will remain accommodative for some time.	23	2
201512	2001	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I adopt this position based on the fact that inflation has remained persistently below target and I thus attach some uncertainty to our ability to achieve our inflation target over the medium term.	23	2
201512	2002	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Placing some weight on these risks implies a policy rate path that is somewhat more accommodative than would be implied by historical behavior.	23	2
201512	2003	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	In particular, I envision at most four rate hikes next year, leaving the funds rate at, say, 1.38 percent at the end of 2016, with subsequent increases to 2.63 percent in 2017 and to 3.5 percent at the end of 2018, which is my view of the long-run neutral funds rate.	23	2
201512	2004	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	However, I should stress that my perspective will be continually updated by the data.	23	2
201512	2005	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Therefore, I support alternative B, which I believe is in accordance with these views.	23	2
201512	2006	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I would suggest one small change in the language, and that is to delete the clause “and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201512	2007	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Now, I understand the logic behind the addition of this phrase, but it seems innocuous at best and may just add confusion.	23	2
201512	2008	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	This may be idiosyncratic to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, but, in a discussion of what the wording could possibly mean, there were as many views among the people who were in the Philadelphia Reserve Bank staff’s briefings to me as there are among FOMC participants.	23	2
201512	2009	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	The views ranged from signaling to the markets that the current move should not be interpreted as having any immediate economic effect to indicating that the current move was being made to prevent the Committee from “falling behind the policy curve.”	23	2
201512	2010	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I think we should, therefore, admit that this language, at least to us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, is unclear, and I believe we should avoid adding uncertainty to our current policy decision.	23	2
201512	2011	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	While I understand that a change in the language of alternative B at this time is highly unlikely, it is wording I would not want to see carried from statement to statement.	23	2
201512	2012	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2013	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2014	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201512	2015	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2016	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B.	23	2
201512	2017	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	The economy’s progress over the past five years is notable, and today’s action is fully consistent, in my view, with our longer-run goals for promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.	23	2
201512	2018	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	The four policy rules in Tealbook B indicate liftoff is appropriate, and the real federal funds rate lies below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* by the widest margin within the past 10 years.	23	2
201512	2019	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, we know the focus now turns to the path.	23	2
201512	2020	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	As the box in Tealbook B highlights, markets largely expect action at this meeting and then anticipate a gradual pace of rate increases.	23	2
201512	2021	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, uncertainty associated with the path is lower than at the start of the 1994 and 2004 tightening cycles.	23	2
201512	2022	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	The market-implied path is a bit lower than that in my own SEP submission, but my path is also quite gradual relative to past tightening cycles.	23	2
201512	2023	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	A gradual path does stand in sharp contrast to the optimal control exercises in Tealbook B, which show a rather steep pace of rate increases.	23	2
201512	2024	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Earlier, optimal control exercises were informative regarding delaying liftoff, though it’s notable how they now resemble the “late and steep” option that the Committee discussed a year ago, which is a reminder for me that the Committee’s next steps are likely to prove as challenging as the path that led to today’s decision.	23	2
201512	2025	2015-12-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2026	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2027	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Lyon.	23	2
201512	2028	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2029	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In October, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate if two conditions were met: First, we saw some further improvement in the labor market, and, second, the Committee was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201512	2030	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In the previous go-round, I noted that the labor market has improved since October, but indications of future inflation have changed very little.	23	2
201512	2031	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Alternatives B and C would raise the federal funds rate target, but neither offers as complete a rationale for this decision as I would have preferred.	23	2
201512	2032	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	As I discussed in the previous go-round, our best statistical forecasting models, as well as market- and survey-based forecasts, suggest that inflation is likely to remain below target over the medium term.	23	2
201512	2033	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	To maintain its credibility, the FOMC must ensure that the public fully understands how monetary policy decisions relate to the Committee’s stated objectives and plans.	23	2
201512	2034	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	In turn, credibility is crucial for keeping inflation expectations well anchored.	23	2
201512	2035	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	I therefore believe it would be useful to offer a more complete and explicit rationale for raising rates at a time when the modal outlook still calls for very tame inflation.	23	2
201512	2036	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Such an explanation could build on concerns that if we delay raising rates, we face the risk of having to eventually tighten rapidly and disruptively in the event of a rapid increase in inflation.	23	2
201512	2037	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	If this concern or other risk factors broadly reflect the Committee members’ thinking on why a rate increase is appropriate at this time, then I would encourage the Committee to take every opportunity to explain these concerns in its communications.	23	2
201512	2038	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thoroughly explaining the key factors in the decision will help build public understanding of the Committee’s reaction function and ensure that we maintain the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target.	23	2
201512	2039	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	I believe that effective communication will become even more important as normalization proceeds.	23	2
201512	2040	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The SEP suggests that the Committee is likely to raise rates by about 100 basis points in the first year—in other words, at only about half of the meetings.	23	2
201512	2041	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	I’m concerned that such a pace may prove particularly challenging to communicate.	23	2
201512	2042	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	The Committee will need to explain why it’s adjusting the funds rate target at some meetings but not others, without tying policy too tightly to volatile incoming data but also without committing to a fixed path of increases that cannot react to data at all.	23	2
201512	2043	2015-12-16	meeting	LYON	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2044	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2045	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201512	2046	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2047	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I support the action of raising the federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points at this meeting and the language in alternative B.	23	2
201512	2048	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the criteria we’ve set out for liftoff have been met.	23	2
201512	2049	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	We’ve seen some further improvement in the labor market, and economic developments support being reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201512	2050	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	It’s well accepted that monetary policy needs to be forward looking.	23	2
201512	2051	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of the economic outlook, I believe it is prudent to take the first step today on the path of gradual normalization of interest rates.	23	2
201512	2052	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe we will be able to implement this policy change with the tools at our disposal.	23	2
201512	2053	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate the analysis and testing of the tools undertaken by the New York Fed and Board staff that have led to more confidence in our tools.	23	2
201512	2054	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	But I also believe the careful monitoring of developments in financial markets post-liftoff is very appropriate and will help us calibrate the tools to hit the federal funds rate target range.	23	2
201512	2055	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Communications leading up to and subsequent to this action have played and will continue to play a significant role in shaping the expectations and interpretation of future policy.	23	2
201512	2056	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I commend the Chair on the communications she’s undertaking during the intermeeting period to help ensure that market participants and the public are ready for this change.	23	2
201512	2057	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think she could have done anything more to prepare them.	23	2
201512	2058	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Despite the preparation, I do expect some reaction in the financial markets.	23	2
201512	2059	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	It is, after all, the first change in the federal funds rate in seven years and the first rate increase in nine and a half years.	23	2
201512	2060	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	But I don’t expect the volatility to be economically significant.	23	2
201512	2061	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Alternative B, as amended and published in the Tealbook, seems to do a plausible job of capturing the various views expressed around the table and explaining the various factors that had to be balanced in deciding to take this action.	23	2
201512	2062	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	That said, I continue to think we could evolve the statement in a beneficial way by putting less emphasis in paragraph 1 on small, short-run changes in the economic data.	23	2
201512	2063	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The description of economic developments in paragraph 1 tends to reinforce the natural inclination of market participants and others to focus on short-run developments in the economy rather than on the medium-run outlook, which is the more appropriate time horizon for monetary policy decisions.	23	2
201512	2064	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	But that’s a longer-run issue and not one for today.	23	2
201512	2065	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	In light of an action today, the focus from now on is going to be on the future policy rate path.	23	2
201512	2066	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The statement walks the careful line of explaining that we currently expect the economy to evolve in a way that warrants, for some time, keeping interest rates lower than the level we expect to prevail over the longer run while conveying the idea that policy will respond appropriately to changes in the outlook.	23	2
201512	2067	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Thus, there is uncertainty about our policy rate path because there’s uncertainty about the outlook.	23	2
201512	2068	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Our actual policy rate path could turn out to be shallower or steeper than currently anticipated.	23	2
201512	2069	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Here I think the SEP and its dot plot of federal funds rate projections, as well as the evolution of that plot over meetings to come, will serve the Committee well by giving the public a very good sense of the current views of FOMC participants of the future policy rate path.	23	2
201512	2070	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Another focus of the public will be on reinvestment policy.	23	2
201512	2071	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	The language in the statement that we anticipate continuing reinvestments until rate normalization is “well under way” may hold off people for a time.	23	2
201512	2072	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	But, as they say, inquiring minds will want to know what we mean by that.	23	2
201512	2073	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	On this matter, I think it would be beneficial to clarify in the press conference or testimony that we’re thinking about state-contingent criteria for ending reinvestments and not time-dependent criteria.	23	2
201512	2074	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Finally, I think we have to recognize that today’s move won’t stop the questions leading up to each meeting about whether the Committee will raise interest rates at that meeting.	23	2
201512	2075	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Because we currently anticipate moving rates up more gradually than we did in the past two cycles, this is to be expected.	23	2
201512	2076	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Clear communications will continue to be a challenge, but it also presents a good opportunity because it can help the normalization process go more smoothly and effectively and can help preserve our ability to use the nontraditional policy tools of the future.	23	2
201512	2077	2015-12-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2078	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2079	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201512	2080	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201512	2081	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201512	2082	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the time has come to begin the monetary policy normalization process.	23	2
201512	2083	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve made considerable progress toward our dual-mandate objectives, and I expect that progress to continue.	23	2
201512	2084	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Even after today’s move, monetary policy will remain accommodative.	23	2
201512	2085	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, this is a very historic day because this will be the first rate hike in nearly 10 years.	23	2
201512	2086	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, we shouldn’t really overstate this.	23	2
201512	2087	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	A move of 25 basis points is not going to affect the stance of monetary policy in a very large way, especially as we’re starting from the effective lower bound and we still have a very large balance sheet.	23	2
201512	2088	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So it’s an interesting tension between those two things.	23	2
201512	2089	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The risks we take, I think, are that the economy turns out to be weaker than we expect, that this initial move leads to a more dramatic tightening of financial market conditions than we desire or anticipate, or both.	23	2
201512	2090	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think the risks of not moving at this meeting are even greater.	23	2
201512	2091	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	With regard to the first risk of a forecast error, that’s always a risk.	23	2
201512	2092	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But because I judge such risks to be two sided, I don’t see this as a reason to wait any longer.	23	2
201512	2093	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the risk of financial market conditions tightening too much, that also remains a risk.	23	2
201512	2094	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But not tightening because financial conditions could tighten unduly doesn’t seem compelling to me, either.	23	2
201512	2095	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the risk of financial conditions tightening, I judge the risk of another taper tantrum as quite low for two reasons.	23	2
201512	2096	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	First, other than in the high-yield market, which is undergoing a lot of stress, financial conditions have not tightened appreciably, even as the probability of a tightening move this year has moved up to a 90 percent probability today from a 30 percent probability a few months ago.	23	2
201512	2097	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In areas outside the high-yield market, there’s been some movement, but that doesn’t seem inappropriately sized relative to that shift in monetary policy expectations.	23	2
201512	2098	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Since the October FOMC meeting, equity markets are little changed, the dollar is slightly firmer, and bond yields have risen modestly.	23	2
201512	2099	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Even in high yield, which is under considerable stress, much of the deterioration, to me, seems fundamentally driven by the persistent weakness in energy prices.	23	2
201512	2100	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, it will be interesting to see how the high-yield debt market performs over the next few weeks.	23	2
201512	2101	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I would say, “So far, so good,” but this could intensify into something more substantial.	23	2
201512	2102	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	However, it’s not a reason to delay at this point.	23	2
201512	2103	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think we’ve reduced this risk of a sharp tightening in financial conditions— those are famous last words by me—by emphasizing that the upward path of short-term rates is likely to be shallow, and that the balance sheet will stay large for a while longer.	23	2
201512	2104	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The language in alternative B that investment will continue “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” is helpful in this regard.	23	2
201512	2105	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If we go more slowly in raising short-term rates, this will likely push back the expected timing of ending reinvestment, and that should reassure investors that there won’t be a flood of new supply any time soon.	23	2
201512	2106	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That will also help reduce the risk of a near-term taper tantrum.	23	2
201512	2107	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the risks post-liftoff in achieving our objective of lifting the effective funds rate into the new target range and also raising other money market rates, I fully expect that our tools will work.	23	2
201512	2108	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Our testing has shown that the overnight RRP facility can put a relatively firm floor under money market rates.	23	2
201512	2109	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that we’ll be operating the overnight RRP without an explicit cap initially, limited only by the size of our portfolio of Treasury securities, will also help by reassuring people that we will not run out of headroom here.	23	2
201512	2110	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it will help by underscoring our commitment to monetary policy control.	23	2
201512	2111	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s our first and foremost priority here.	23	2
201512	2112	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Having both a belt, which is the IOER, and suspenders, the overnight RRP, is a very good thing.	23	2
201512	2113	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think that it’s important not to overreact to any short-term sloppiness should that actually occur over the next few days or weeks, especially if we view it as related to the particular circumstances of year-end.	23	2
201512	2114	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Year-end will generate its own set of unique pressures related to bank balance sheets, and I would be very hesitant to overreact to something that might prove short lived.	23	2
201512	2115	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, should the effective funds rate trade persistently outside the target range, then I would favor adjusting the parameters of our tools.	23	2
201512	2116	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, how we would respond would depend on our judgment of why this was occurring and how it was perceived by others in terms of our ability to maintain monetary policy control.	23	2
201512	2117	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, if people weren’t upset about it, then we probably shouldn’t be too upset about it, either.	23	2
201512	2118	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But we do have a number of levers to push and pull.	23	2
201512	2119	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We could change the level of the IOER, the level of the overnight RRP rate, or both.	23	2
201512	2120	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We could raise the maximum bid amount limit to do term RP or use our Term Deposit Facility.	23	2
201512	2121	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think any of this is going to be necessary, but I’m glad that we have these options available, and that we have these briefings scheduled over the next few days so that we can all be kept fully informed and can respond quickly should that prove necessary.	23	2
201512	2122	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I want to commend the Chair for all you’ve done to prepare markets and bring this Committee along in a united fashion.	23	2
201512	2123	2015-12-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Well done.	23	2
201512	2124	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201512	2125	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201512	2126	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we’re close here.	23	2
201512	2127	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I heard considerable support for alternative B as written, although President Harker did make one suggestion pertaining to language.	23	2
201512	2128	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	If I see some overwhelming support for making that change, let me give you an opportunity to express it.	23	2
201512	2129	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, I thought that phrase was acknowledging the lags in monetary policy, and I’d like to hear what you thought.	23	2
201512	2130	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	It was meant to explain why, at a time when inflation is low and we’ve not overshot our employment goal, we would be raising rates.	23	2
201512	2131	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Right.	23	2
201512	2132	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So maybe the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia staff doesn’t believe in lags.	23	2
201512	2133	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	23	2
201512	2134	2015-12-16	meeting	HARKER	I’m just reporting what they said.	23	2
201512	2135	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201512	2136	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I propose that we vote on alternative B as written and the associated directive.	23	2
201512	2137	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on Brian to explain exactly what we’re going to vote on and call the roll.	23	2
201512	2138	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote of the Federal Open Market Committee will be on the statement for alternative B as presented on pages 7 and 8 of Thomas’s package of briefing materials from yesterday.	23	2
201512	2139	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also be on the directive as included in the draft implementation note on page 1 of the package labeled “Updated Implementation Note,” which was distributed this morning.	23	2
201512	2140	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	This directive would supersede the resolution on overnight RRP test operations that was approved by the Committee at its December 16–17, 2014, meeting.	23	2
201512	2141	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes .	23	2
201512	2142	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201512	2143	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	May I enter a divided vote?	23	2
201512	2144	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I would not like the word “unanimously” to appear in the fourth line of the implementation note.	23	2
201512	2145	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	There is, in the fourth line—	23	2
201512	2146	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We haven’t voted on that yet.	23	2
201512	2147	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Oh, it’s going to be a separate vote?	23	2
201512	2148	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Well, let me first mention that there’s no vote on the implementation note per se.	23	2
201512	2149	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Oh, I thought I heard you saying there was.	23	2
201512	2150	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to have some further votes, and we’ll see if they’re unanimous or not.	23	2
201512	2151	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Okay, fine—I’m in favor of alt-B.	23	2
201512	2152	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	23	2
201512	2153	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes .	23	2
201512	2154	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201512	2155	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We have some further votes to take, and these will be votes of the Board of Governors.	23	2
201512	2156	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	First, on interest rates on reserves, I need a motion to increase to 50 basis points from 25 basis points the interest rates paid on required and excess reserve balances, effective December 17, 2015.	23	2
201512	2157	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	23	2
201512	2158	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	23	2
201512	2159	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Second?	23	2
201512	2160	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second.	23	2
201512	2161	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection?	23	2
201512	2162	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201512	2163	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201512	2164	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	23	2
201512	2165	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s turn to discount rates.	23	2
201512	2166	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The vote on discount rates is also a vote of the Board of Governors, and it is going to cover three discount rate actions.	23	2
201512	2167	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	They are, first, to approve the requests of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco to increase the primary credit rate to 1 percent from ¾ percent, effective December 17, 2015.	23	2
201512	2168	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Second, the vote will encompass approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of December 17, 2015, and the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request.	23	2
201512	2169	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The Secretary of the Board would be authorized to inform such Reserve Banks of the approval of the Board of Governors upon notification by the Reserve Banks.	23	2
201512	2170	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, this vote will also encompass approval of the renewal by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under the secondary and seasonal credit programs.	23	2
201512	2171	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion that would cover all three portions of that.	23	2
201512	2172	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	23	2
201512	2173	2015-12-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second.	23	2
201512	2174	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	23	2
201512	2175	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	23	2
201512	2176	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	23	2
201512	2177	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201512	2178	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201512	2179	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we have now taken the steps toward implementing our policy.	23	2
201512	2180	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just mention something.	23	2
201512	2181	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Because I think many of the people around this table have joined the System since the last interest rate cycle and may not be entirely familiar with what I’ll call standard procedures regarding discount rates, let me mention that, commonly, when the discount rate is changed, which occurs usually commensurate with a change in the federal funds rate target that’s approved by the FOMC, some, but not all, Federal Reserve Banks have requested that change.	23	2
201512	2182	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	This time, we have 10 that have requested it.	23	2
201512	2183	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So the standard practice is that the boards of the remaining Reserve Banks, within about a day of the FOMC announcement, request the same change in their primary credit rates—it’s called a conforming rate request—to bring the discount rate up to the approved new national average in all areas of the country.	23	2
201512	2184	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Now, in many Reserve Banks, this requires a vote of the board of directors of the Bank.	23	2
201512	2185	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	In some others, I think this decisionmaking authority is delegated to a committee of the board rather than the full board, or, in some cases, it can be delegated to the president by the board of directors.	23	2
201512	2186	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So there may be different procedures in different Banks, but I did want to note that it is quite standard—and this should occur very rapidly, within 24 hours—that Reserve Banks that have not requested an increase would return to our Secretary of the Board with a request for a conforming change.	23	2
201512	2187	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, the Board of Governors has just voted to, essentially, preapprove those requests.	23	2
201512	2188	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	You know that the implementation note that was just distributed will be published today as an addendum to the Committee’s policy statement, and it includes the domestic policy directive verbatim.	23	2
201512	2189	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Then what we’ve agreed is that if, during the intermeeting period, we need to make changes to policy tools to implement the stance of policy agreed upon in the FOMC statement, we will issue a new implementation note that we will vote on.	23	2
201512	2190	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, let me mention that the Desk will be releasing, also at 2:00 pm, a Desk statement on implementation, and tomorrow the Desk will be releasing a statement on term RRPs.	23	2
201512	2191	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on Lorie to discuss that statement.	238	2
201512	2192	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Matt is handing out a table that I’ll refer to, so I’ll just wait until those are passed out.	238	2
201512	2193	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, is this implementation note we got this morning different from the one we got yesterday?	238	2
201512	2194	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think the blue changes, too, were there yesterday.	238	2
201512	2195	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	On page 2, I believe the phrasing “the discount rate” is new.	238	2
201512	2196	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think it previously said “primary credit.”	238	2
201512	2197	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We thought that might be confusing.	238	2
201512	2198	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Oh, I see.	238	2
201512	2199	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	That part is new?	238	2
201512	2200	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	238	2
201512	2201	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	238	2
201512	2202	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	The public knows about the discount rate.	238	2
201512	2203	2015-12-16	meeting	LACKER	Brilliant changes.	238	2
201512	2204	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	In light of the Committee’s policy decision to increase the target range and to temporarily suspend the cap on the overnight RRP, we wanted to summarize plans for the already announced term operations that cross year-end.	238	2
201512	2205	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	These details are shown in the table of your handout, which is labeled “Material for Briefing on Term RRP Operations over Year End.”	238	2
201512	2206	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Chair approved plans to offer $300 billion in three term operations with 17-, 12-, and 6-day maturities and to offer sizes of $50 billion, $100 billion, and $150 billion on each of these days, respectively, with any unused capacity from the first two operations rolling into the third.	238	2
201512	2207	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	However, unlike the previous term operations—and as shown in the fifth column—these will be offered at a zero basis point spread to the overnight RRP rate.	238	2
201512	2208	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Without offering any financial incentive for investing funds for term instead of overnight, we anticipate there to be limited interest, other than perhaps some modest interest coming from those who value the convenience of not having to reinvest maturing proceeds each day.	238	2
201512	2209	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk plans to release these remaining details at 4:00 this afternoon, and we’d be releasing two other forms of information, also at 4:00 this afternoon.	238	2
201512	2210	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I see—at 4:00 rather than tomorrow.	238	2
201512	2211	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	Right.	238	2
201512	2212	2015-12-16	meeting	LOGAN	And those would be the FAQs associated with the overnight RRP as well as the FAQs on reinvestment policy that I mentioned in the Desk briefing yesterday.	238	2
201512	2213	2015-12-16	meeting	POTTER	We have those available, if people need to look at them.	238	2
201512	2214	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for Lorie or Simon?	238	2
201512	2215	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	238	2
201512	2216	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	238	2
201512	2217	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I have a couple of more things.	238	2
201512	2218	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Our next scheduled meeting will be on January 26 and 27.	238	2
201512	2219	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	That takes me to the issue of our plans for post-liftoff briefings.	238	2
201512	2220	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	As we’ve previously agreed, starting tomorrow, we will have briefings, possibly for as many as two weeks.	238	2
201512	2221	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Or, if things are going very smoothly and we decide they’re no longer necessary, we will cancel them.	238	2
201512	2222	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	But the first briefing is scheduled for tomorrow at 4:00 pm  The remaining briefings, with the exception of two, are scheduled for 2:00 pm  On two dates—Thursday, December 24, and Thursday, December 31—we hope we will be able to cancel briefings, but if we need to have them, they’ve been scheduled for 10:00 am Let me say about these briefings that if we do decide we need to change any of the tools or make intermeeting adjustments, all of these briefings can be converted, even midstream, into FOMC meetings.	238	2
201512	2223	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to remind you that, whether they’re briefings or turn into FOMC meetings, FOMC meeting attendance rules will apply to the briefings.	238	2
201512	2224	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Our plan is to record and prepare transcripts of all of these briefings/meetings, even if they’re briefings and don’t turn into meetings.	238	2
201512	2225	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	If they do turn into meetings, then minutes will be prepared and published with the minutes of the January FOMC meeting.	238	2
201512	2226	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say that the difference between a briefing and a meeting is that, in a briefing, you’re welcome to quiz staff members and ask them questions, but if it looks as though we need to deliberate on policy and make comments that are real policy deliberations, we will need to convert the briefing into a meeting.	238	2
201512	2227	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s it, other than to say that we have boxed lunches available, and anybody who—	238	2
201512	2228	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	May I ask a question?	238	2
201512	2229	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	238	2
201512	2230	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’m sorry to return to this point, but, in the “Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation,” the word “unanimously” appears twice in square brackets.	238	2
201512	2231	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Since the extent of the majority by which this decision is being made by the Board is of no consequence whatever to how we do the monetary policy implementation, I don’t know why we need the word “unanimously.”	238	2
201512	2232	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	No, we do because these are Board votes, and we’re reporting Board votes.	238	2
201512	2233	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	If they’re not unanimous, anyone who dissented would be listed explicitly as a dissenter, potentially with some short statement as to what the dissent was.	238	2
201512	2234	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	So we’re formally recording here, in the implementation note, votes of the Board of Governors.	238	2
201512	2235	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	238	2
201512	2236	2015-12-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	238	2
201512	2237	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	238	2
201512	2238	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, in the past, when we’ve had briefings, have we prepared transcripts and then distributed the transcripts?	238	2
201512	2239	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	No, we haven’t.	238	2
201512	2240	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	But, in light of the fact that any of these briefings could turn into meetings and there would seem to be some historical value for the public in understanding what happened and what our discussions were in the aftermath of this decision, we thought it wise to actually make transcripts of the briefings to have that historical record.	238	2
201512	2241	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We will need it, of course, if any of them turn into meetings.	238	2
201512	2242	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	238	2
201512	2243	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	So the plan is that they will be released after five years with everything else?	238	2
201512	2244	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	If they are turned into meetings.	238	2
201512	2245	2015-12-16	meeting	MADIGAN	A decision has not yet been made if they’re just briefings.	238	2
201512	2246	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	238	2
201512	2247	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	If they’re just briefings, then they may not be.	238	2
201512	2248	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	I see, all right.	238	2
201512	2249	2015-12-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	238	2
201512	2250	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	238	2
201512	2251	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	If I could just clarify what you meant by the distinction between a briefing and a meeting, in a briefing, it’s like a game of Jeopardy! in which all of the comments have to begin with a question.	238	2
201512	2252	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	238	2
201512	2253	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	If we need to change the interest rate on excess reserves today to make our policy work, yes, that—	238	2
201512	2254	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Right.	238	2
201512	2255	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	But as soon as somebody opines in a policy way, that’s not according to the rules.	238	2
201512	2256	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	That’s the way I remember the FOMC briefings in the past, during the crisis.	238	2
201512	2257	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	That’s right.	238	2
201512	2258	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve had these briefings before.	238	2
201512	2259	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Well, President Williams reminded me of that, too.	238	2
201512	2260	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	You mean that you can ask a question that—	238	2
201512	2261	2015-12-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You just don’t opine or bring up the discussion regarding, for instance, the ON RRP rate or something, but you can ask the question.	238	2
201512	2262	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	So it has to be, “Isn’t it true that we need to ...”	238	2
201512	2263	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	238	2
201512	2264	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	“If we don’t change the overnight RRP rate in this meeting ..	238	2
201512	2265	2015-12-16	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, you can do that type of thing, but if it looks like members of the Committee will need to talk to one another about changes, the intention will be to turn it into a meeting.	238	2
201512	2266	2015-12-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	238	2
