201607	1	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We are all a couple of minutes early, but it looks like we’re ready to get going.	50.0	65.0
201607	2	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Today’s meeting, as usual, will be a joint meeting between the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201607	3	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201607	4	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0

201607	6	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201607	7	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin with our first topic, “Long- Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation,” and let me ask Simon to start us off on this.	93.0	65.0
201607	8	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	9	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We will be referring to the materials titled “Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy Implementation.”	93.0	999.0
201607	10	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The briefing today summarizes the work of three foundational workgroups on the foreign experience, lessons from the crisis, and money markets that was distributed to the Committee over the past few weeks.	93.0	999.0
201607	11	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	As you know, this is a System-wide effort with important contributions from a number of divisions of the Board and all of the Reserve Banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	12	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Today, in addition to the presenters at the table—Brian Doyle, David Altig, and Beth Klee—we have Patricia Zobel, Ed Nosal, and Susan McLaughlin seated behind us, who were the co-leads for these presenters.	93.0	999.0
201607	13	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	They’ll also be available to answer questions.	93.0	999.0
201607	14	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	In slide 3 of your rather thick presentation package, you can see the key goals of the project that were agreed to almost one year ago.	93.0	999.0
201607	15	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	These goals have obviously been influenced by the experience of advanced-economy central banks over the past 10 years or so.	93.0	999.0
201607	16	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The foundational workgroups were designed to put this experience into a structure that will feed into the two framework workgroups, which are focused on interest rate targets, operating regimes, and the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	17	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Our current plan is for the framework workgroups to present their findings at the November meeting.	93.0	999.0
201607	18	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The feedback that you will provide today and in November will inform the staff’s work on evaluating comprehensive frameworks that will be presented to the Committee further down the road.	93.0	999.0
201607	19	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The next slide shows an additional set of objectives for alternative operating frameworks.	93.0	999.0

201607	22	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Klee and Remache are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). markets will be an important focus of the presentation today.	93.0	999.0
201607	23	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	As also noted on this slide, the Committee’s normalization principles and plans provide an additional set of criteria when it comes to the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio.	93.0	999.0
201607	24	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Brian will now present on the foreign experience.	93.0	999.0
201607	25	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Thank you, Simon.	93.0	999.0
201607	26	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	To start our presentations, I’m going to talk about monetary policy implementation elsewhere in the world.	93.0	999.0
201607	27	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The foreign experience workgroup, co-led by Patricia Zobel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, primarily surveyed the experience of nine advanced-economy central banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	28	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As noted on slide 6, this survey included how central banks implemented policy before the crisis, how the frameworks evolved since then, and some of the rationale for those frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	29	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In my limited time, I will just touch on some of the highlights from the memorandum that was circulated earlier.	93.0	999.0
201607	30	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in your next slide, there is one finding that is perhaps useful to state right off the bat.	93.0	999.0
201607	31	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	We don’t see dramatic differences in most central banks’ ability to control short-term money market rates or to transmit effects of monetary policy out to longer-term interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	32	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	However, the wide variety of frameworks represents choices that central banks have made regarding how to achieve that control.	93.0	999.0
201607	33	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And a better understanding of these choices may be helpful, as they reflect decisions that these central banks made regarding tradeoffs along other dimensions.	93.0	999.0
201607	34	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	What are the primary differences in these frameworks?	93.0	999.0
201607	35	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	First, as noted in the first row of the table in slide 8, before the crisis, nearly all advanced-economy central banks communicated monetary policy with an overnight interest rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	36	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But what that rate was varied some.	93.0	999.0
201607	37	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	A few central banks, like the Federal Reserve, used a target for a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	38	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Many others used an administered rate—that is, a rate pertaining to some operation that they themselves set.	93.0	999.0
201607	39	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Even in these latter cases, central banks often made reference to a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	40	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The market rates were usually unsecured rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	41	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Inn a couple of cases, however, they were secured rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	42	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown in your next slide, how central banks controlled money market rates also varied.	93.0	999.0
201607	43	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Before the crisis, most used “corridor” regimes, supplying reserves to meet banks’ demand at the policy rate and generally using lending and deposit facilities to create a ceiling and a floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	44	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Within this group, most central banks had some form of reserve requirements to foster a stable demand for reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	45	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	A few central banks used “floor” regimes, providing sufficient liquidity for market rates to trade near the rate of interest that the central bank pays on deposits or reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	46	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	After the crisis began, how central banks implemented policy shifted.	93.0	999.0
201607	47	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Unconventional policies, including large-scale asset programs not only of government, but in some cases private-sector assets; long-term funding programs, such as those of the ECB; and, most recently, negative interest rates, in some cases became the primary means of implementing and communicating policy.	93.0	999.0
201607	48	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And, as indicated by the arrows in the chart, as central banks injected more liquidity under some of these programs, corridor systems in many instances became de facto floor systems.	93.0	999.0
201607	49	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As shown on the next slide, the distinctions between corridor and floor regimes have become blurred a little in recent years, as central banks changed how they remunerate reserves and gave banks a wider degree of choice over how many reserves to hold.	93.0	999.0
201607	50	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	To encourage interbank trading and reduce banks’ hoarding of reserves, central banks using floors began to pay a lower rate on reserves above some threshold or quota—“tiered remuneration.”	93.0	999.0
201607	51	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	This “tiering” is also similar to what has been seen more recently with negative policy rates at the Swiss National Bank and the Bank of Japan, albeit for a very different reason—that is, to limit the costs for banks of holding reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	52	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And, before the crisis, the Bank of England implemented a corridor regime in which banks could choose their own target for reserves—a “voluntary reserves target”—reducing some of the costs associated with reserve requirements.	93.0	999.0
201607	53	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	These regimes influence the nature of activity in money markets, as highlighted on the next slide.	93.0	999.0
201607	54	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Systems characterized by scarce excess reserves generally feature robust interbank trading.	93.0	999.0
201607	55	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In floor systems that featured quotas, in conditions of still- abundant reserves, money market trading is largely between banks that are above their quotas and banks that are below.	93.0	999.0
201607	56	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Likewise, currently in Japan and the United Kingdom, money market trading is largely between nonbank participants without access to remunerated accounts and banks with access.	93.0	999.0
201607	57	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In these economies, as shown in the figure, money market rates trade below the rate on reserves, as is the case in the United States (the red line).	93.0	999.0
201607	58	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Some central banks view arbitrage activity created by remuneration systems as meaningful and robust, while others view activity created by reserve scarcity as providing more insight into money market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201607	59	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Turning the page, another observation from the foreign experience is that central banks have added counterparties and accepted a wider range of collateral during the crisis (or already had broad sets of both) and expect to keep those broader sets.	93.0	999.0
201607	60	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	For some central banks, this broadening of counterparties has included nonbank entities, including financial market utilities.	93.0	999.0
201607	61	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The main reason for the expansion during the crisis was a desire to provide liquidity to parts of the financial system that were “cut off.”	93.0	999.0
201607	62	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But some foreign central banks also see advantages in reducing competitive distortions created by conferring counterparty status on a narrow group and in the enhanced information that they receive about interacting with a number of institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	63	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	That said, central banks acknowledge that broader policy comes with costs—increased operational costs, the potential to reduce private market activity— and that accepting a wider set of collateral could create some moral hazard if it encourages banks to hold riskier assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	64	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The next slide, slide 13, notes that a few central banks see liquidity insurance— the readiness to provide broad-based liquidity in the case of a shock—as distinct from either monetary policy implementation or emergency lending and have different operations to meet those separate objectives.	93.0	999.0
201607	65	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Bank of England views liquidity insurance as operations with clear criteria for use and broad access, and its scheme allows financial institutions to obtain reserves or liquid assets for less liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	66	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	They view the clarity about the purpose of these operations as, it is hoped, reducing stigma and clarity about when these facilities would be used as limiting contagion during stress events.	93.0	999.0
201607	67	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	That said, although some central banks provide greater clarity about their plans to employ such operations in stress events, others prefer some ambiguity about the circumstances of when they would use such operations.	93.0	999.0
201607	68	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Turning to your next slide, foreign central banks are still considering other features of their long-run frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	69	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	For example, most central banks think that they should be ready to use unconventional policies if needed and expect to maintain some operational preparedness.	93.0	999.0
201607	70	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And central banks have diverse views about the appropriate size and composition of their balance sheets in the long run.	93.0	999.0
201607	71	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Many central banks that have expanded their balance sheets with asset purchases in recent years hope to return to some form of smaller balance sheet in the future.	93.0	999.0
201607	72	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But they also acknowledge that higher demand for reserves by banks may leave their balance sheets larger than before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	73	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Some have also noted that exceptionally large balance sheets can complicate relationships with fiscal authorities.	93.0	999.0
201607	74	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	As highlighted in the final slide for this portion of the presentation, most central banks are still learning about how they should adapt policy implementation to the effects of new regulations.	93.0	999.0
201607	75	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But one effect that most central banks do expect is that demand for reserves will increase.	93.0	999.0
201607	76	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Excess reserves qualify as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), and getting excess reserves for less liquid collateral (where possible) boosts the LCR.	93.0	999.0
201607	77	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Central banks are split on how they should complement this effect.	93.0	999.0
201607	78	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Reserve Bank of Australia introduced a facility to help banks meet this demand in some instances, in part because Australia has a low stock of government debt.	93.0	999.0
201607	79	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Other central banks will only take HQLA as collateral or are considering making changes to the costs of reserves to discourage banks from relying on the central bank to meet the LCR.	93.0	999.0
201607	80	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I’ll now turn to Dave Altig, who will turn the focus back “stateside” and share some lessons from the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	81	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Thanks, Brian.	93.0	999.0
201607	82	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The task of the lessons from the financial crisis workgroup was to evaluate the performance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation framework during the period of the financial crisis, which we defined as running from August 2007 to May 2009.	93.0	999.0
201607	83	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Slide 17 provides several metrics pertaining to stress in various funding markets during this time frame.	93.0	999.0
201607	84	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	There is disagreement among scholars as to the relative roles of illiquidity, counterparty concerns, and asset-risk repricing as drivers of these spreads, and in the memo, we review the research literature devoted to disentangling these effects.	93.0	999.0
201607	85	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our reading of the literature suggests that all three elements were at play during the crisis, but we emphasize that our analysis was not aimed at evaluating the necessity or the efficacy of specific tools.	93.0	999.0
201607	86	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our objective was to assess the efficacy of the pre-crisis framework in supporting the implementation of these tools once a policy course was chosen.	93.0	999.0
201607	87	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As described by slide 18, the pre-crisis framework can be summarized as follows: One, rate control was based on reserve scarcity.	93.0	999.0
201607	88	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The level of excess reserves was minimal, and the banking system operated on the downward-sloping part of its net demand curve.	93.0	999.0
201607	89	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The Desk supplied reserves to meet demand through daily open market operations in order to manage the effective federal funds rate to the FOMC’s target.	93.0	999.0
201607	90	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Two, liquidity was provided through two tools.	93.0	999.0
201607	91	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Daily monetary policy operations provided liquidity to the banking system via repurchase agreements with primary dealers against government securities, and Reserve Banks made discount window, or primary credit, loans to individual depository institutions collateralized by a broad set of assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	92	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	And, three, the portfolio was not a policy tool.	93.0	999.0
201607	93	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The portfolio was simply a byproduct of the various activities the Federal Reserve undertook as part of its implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	94	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	SOMA holdings were sized nearly equal to, and over time grew at the same rate as, the quantity of currency in circulation.	93.0	999.0
201607	95	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The portfolio’s size was maintained by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities; portfolio growth occurred through outright purchases of Treasury securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	96	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	It’s worth noting that before the crisis, stress events had been moderate in both the duration and scale of their effect on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and had been managed adequately through the pre-crisis framework’s combination of traditional open market operations and discount window lending.	93.0	999.0
201607	97	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The 2007–09 crisis represented an unprecedented stress test of the pre-crisis framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	98	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The nature of the pain points that were revealed and experience with new tools introduced to address these shortcomings form the foundation of our analysis.	93.0	999.0
201607	99	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	I’ll highlight five key takeaways from our review of the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	100	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	These lessons, many of which will be quite familiar, were informed by research studies, transcripts of FOMC meetings, archival MarketSource commentary, and the recollections of Federal Reserve staff actively involved in policy implementation during that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	101	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our list of lessons begins on slide 19 with the observation that, in the absence of IOER and adequate reserve draining tools, the pre-crisis “reserve scarcity” framework set up a tradeoff between interest-rate control and large-scale liquidity provision, a tension that persisted until that framework was effectively abandoned post-Lehman.	93.0	999.0
201607	102	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As the chart on this slide illustrates, most of the liquidity provision programs implemented over the course of the crisis represented additions to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	103	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	In the absence of the ability to pay interest on reserves, maintaining rate control required the Open Market Desk to keep the level of reserves in a relatively narrow band.	93.0	999.0
201607	104	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This meant that additions to reserves or liquidity arising from various liquidity programs required offsetting reductions in reserves, or “sterilization.”	93.0	999.0
201607	105	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Reserve draining prior to the crisis relied primarily on redemptions of maturing securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	106	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This strategy for draining reserves became increasingly inadequate following the collapse of Bear Stearns, as redemption capacity hit its limit and liquidity programs expanded.	93.0	999.0
201607	107	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our second conclusion, noted on the next slide, is that the two pre-crisis liquidity tools, open market operations and the discount window, were themselves not adequate to provide the type of large-scale liquidity insurance that was needed during the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	108	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Open market operations and discount window lending were confined to limited sets of counterparties and, particularly in the case of open market operations, collateral types.	93.0	999.0
201607	109	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Other tools had to be created to overcome their limitations—for example, highlighted in green text on this slide, the Term Auction Facility (or TAF) was introduced to circumvent the stigma problem associated with the discount window.	93.0	999.0
201607	110	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	FX swap lines with foreign central banks were activated to address broader global demand for dollar funding in order to contain spillover to domestic markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	111	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The schematic on slide 20 emphasizes that the broadly based 13(3) facilities implemented in 2008, highlighted in blue text, supported policy transmission by reaching counterparties and collateral types beyond our normal monetary policy operating framework of the time.	93.0	999.0
201607	112	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The chart on slide 21 illustrates our third takeaway.	93.0	999.0
201607	113	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Although the federal funds effective rate was successfully managed to the policy target for most of the period before Lehman, intraday rate volatility was elevated throughout the crisis period and posed an ongoing challenge to policy implementation.	93.0	999.0
201607	114	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Intraday volatility emerged early in the crisis as aggressive foreign bank demand in the morning gave way to weak domestic demand in the afternoon.	93.0	999.0
201607	115	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The primary credit rate turned out to be a very “leaky” ceiling; once implemented, the IOER turned out to be a leaky floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	116	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The lack of a firm ceiling or floor complicated the day-to-day task of policy implementation.	93.0	999.0
201607	117	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Our fourth takeaway is spelled out on slide 22:  The System was not well prepared to implement large-scale asset purchases once the funds rate hit the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201607	118	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	In particular, there was a significant degree of “on-the-job learning” in order to develop a purchase program.	93.0	999.0
201607	119	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The learning process and implementation took time, reflecting the lack of preexisting arrangements to support these transactions.	93.0	999.0
201607	120	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Finally, as also noted on slide 22, the pre-crisis framework was not sufficiently robust or flexible in the face of significant liquidity stress and disruptions to the monetary transmission mechanisms.	93.0	999.0
201607	121	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	For example, the growth of offshore intermediation in US dollars shown on slide 23 and the expansion of nonbank intermediation shown on slide 24 introduced new linkages across market segments, which expanded the channels of monetary transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	122	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The pre-crisis framework was not designed with these secular developments in mind and proved inadequate when these new channels were disrupted.	93.0	999.0
201607	123	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Notably, the FOMC has already decided to retain standing swap arrangements with the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank and has used them since the crisis period.	93.0	999.0
201607	124	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	Swap lines with these central banks have become part of the FOMC’s normal framework and represent an increase in the robustness of offshore market developments.	93.0	999.0
201607	125	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	On slide 25, we summarize the timeline of tools implemented over the course of the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	126	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	As indicated by the darker bars representing instruments created over the course of the crisis, the Federal Reserve was innovative in designing and implementing new tools to address emerging liquidity problems.	93.0	999.0
201607	127	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	This, however, required venturing well beyond the core framework and investing heavily to overcome gaps in our existing knowledge and infrastructure.	93.0	999.0
201607	128	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The System lacked the flexibility to pull nonstandard tools off the shelf to address unusual market stress.	93.0	999.0
201607	129	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	The ad hoc nature of the response to emerging stress prolonged the time it took to implement facilities in response and increased the System’s exposure to operational risks.	93.0	999.0
201607	130	2016-07-27	meeting	ALTIG	I’ll now turn the stage over to Beth Klee, who will summarize the work of the money markets group.	93.0	999.0
201607	131	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Thanks, Dave.	93.0	999.0
201607	132	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As detailed on slide 27, we now turn our focus to the set of short-term wholesale funding markets often referred to as money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	133	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Money markets collectively help determine short-term interest rates and are a key link in monetary policy transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	134	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	These markets were at the center of many of the problems that arose in the financial crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	135	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To provide some background on the behavior of money markets, the next slide shows that prior to the financial crisis, major overnight money market rates— including those for CP, repo, federal funds, and Eurodollars—were highly correlated.	93.0	999.0
201607	136	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Indeed, a statistical common factor can explain nearly 95 percent of the daily variation in these four interest rates from 2001 to 2006.	93.0	999.0
201607	137	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In addition, money markets operated in a way that made it fairly easy for the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy to keep the effective federal funds rate close to its target.	93.0	999.0
201607	138	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In this way, the Federal Reserve’s ability to influence rates in the federal funds market allowed it to strongly influence rates in these related markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	139	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As shown on the next slide, post-crisis, measured at high frequencies, money market rates may now be somewhat less tightly connected than in the past, although they still retain a high degree of pass-through.	93.0	999.0
201607	140	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In particular, the share of daily variation explained by a common factor has declined to about 85 percent from 2010 to 2015, suggesting that there are somewhat looser linkages and greater dispersion across these money market rates than there were in the pre-crisis period.	93.0	999.0
201607	141	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Although it is difficult to identify precisely all of the factors that have led to this change in the behavior of money market rates, the memo focused on three.	93.0	999.0
201607	142	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Specifically, as shown on slide 30, since the crisis, significant changes in the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy implementation framework, the business practices of some market participants, and new regulations have left an imprint on money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	143	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Today we’ll highlight a few key themes of the memo.	93.0	999.0
201607	144	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	First, as noted on slide 31 and as Dave mentioned earlier, in the wake of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve altered its policy implementation framework in a few key ways:  Asset purchases contributed to a huge expansion of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the volume of excess reserve balances held by the banking system.	93.0	999.0
201607	145	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The Federal Reserve also implemented IOER, developed supplementary tools to support monetary policy implementation, and expanded the set of counterparties eligible to participate in reverse repurchase agreements.	93.0	999.0
201607	146	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As noted on the next slide, in part reflecting the increase in reserve balances, the character of trading in the federal funds market changed.	93.0	999.0
201607	147	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Banks no longer needed to trade in the federal funds market to meet reserve requirements and manage payment flows because most banks found themselves flush with reserves.	93.0	999.0
201607	148	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Instead, most federal funds trading today reflects arbitrage activity—that is, lending by FHLBs to banks and DIs, with the latter earning the IOER.	93.0	999.0
201607	149	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Because FHLBs do not earn IOER, virtually all federal funds trades now take place at rates below the IOER rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	150	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Still, the federal funds rate remains linked to other money market rates and has responded to changes in the Federal Reserve’s administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	151	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In particular, increasing the target range for the federal funds rate and raising the IOER and overnight RRP rates proved effective in lifting the constellation of money market rates in December 2015.	93.0	999.0
201607	152	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Nonbank financial institutions are active lenders in money markets, both to banks and to other nonbanks.	93.0	999.0
201607	153	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	As noted on slide 33, the introduction of the overnight RRP operations created an additional direct linkage between FOMC policy actions and nonbank financial institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	154	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Moreover, market participants suggest the overnight RRP is a relevant “comparator rate”—that is, a rate that provides a reference point for repo market participants.	93.0	999.0
201607	155	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Furthermore, the volatility of triparty and primary-dealer- reported overnight repo rates declined with the introduction of the overnight RRP, and, more generally, the Federal Reserve’s overnight RRP operations have established an effective floor on the level of repo rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	156	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The next slide highlights the second factor brought up in the memo, which is, namely, how changes in market participants’ business practices have affected money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	157	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Specifically, many firms have become more cautious in managing credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks since the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	158	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceased their unsecured lending in the federal funds market.	93.0	999.0
201607	159	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Fannie’s and Freddie’s withdrawal occurred amid acute stresses in European peripheral sovereign debt markets and perhaps reflected a desire to minimize these risk exposures.	93.0	999.0
201607	160	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The next slide notes the third factor that was brought up in the memo that has affected money markets:  regulations.	93.0	999.0
201607	161	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Since the crisis, a global regulatory reform program has put into place important new regulations to limit imprudent risk-taking, intended to increase the safety and resiliency of the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201607	162	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Looking narrowly at money markets, the regulations that should have the greatest effect include the expanded FDIC base, the money market mutual fund reforms, and the Basel III regulatory changes, which include the supplementary leverage ratio, the liquidity coverage ratio, and the net stable funding ratio.	93.0	999.0
201607	163	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Against this backdrop, individual institutions may now find it less attractive to expand their balance sheets without a commensurate rise in capital and liquidity positions.	93.0	999.0
201607	164	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Consistent with this hypothesis, as shown on slide 36, the spread between the Treasury GCF and triparty repo rates has widened considerably since 2014.	93.0	999.0
201607	165	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Absent frictions, arbitrage should ensure that these two rates should be identical.	93.0	999.0
201607	166	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The wider spread reportedly in part reflects institutional frictions, which could include some tiering of rates for smaller dealers that generally have less access to direct lending from money fund counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	167	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Under this scenario, larger dealers borrow from money market funds in the broader triparty market and lend the funds to smaller dealers in the GCF market.	93.0	999.0
201607	168	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Because the initial borrowing expands the larger dealer’s balance sheet, the GCF rate can rise notably above the triparty rate to compensate dealers for that expansion.	93.0	999.0
201607	169	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Slide 37 outlines some open issues regarding the future evolution of money markets and their connection to an implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	170	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Conversations with market participants suggest that the structural demand for reserves likely has increased significantly over the pre-crisis experience, and demand for reserves may also be more variable.	93.0	999.0
201607	171	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The increased reserve demand stems from both precautionary and regulatory factors as well as changes in business practices.	93.0	999.0
201607	172	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Of course, the effects of these factors on reserve demand are likely to be most pronounced if the Federal Reserve also remunerates excess reserves at rates close to the level of market interest rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	173	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	If underlying demand for reserves is much higher than in the past, there could be upward pressure on the level of short-term interest rates and a resumption of interbank trading in the federal funds market sooner than the point at which the staff’s current projections involve an assumption that scarcity effects set in as a result of SOMA redemptions.	93.0	999.0
201607	174	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	In addition, US money markets may be more stable now than pre-crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	175	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	This year there have been two episodes of stress in financial markets, and in both of these cases, US money markets continued to operate well.	93.0	999.0
201607	176	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Policymakers’ views on the fundamental stability of money markets may inform their judgments about a range of issues associated with the long-run framework, including the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the appropriate level of preparedness to provide liquidity on a large scale.	93.0	999.0
201607	177	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To summarize, as noted on slide 38, the new regulatory environment and changes in business models are factors that will likely have implications for various designs of the monetary policy framework that best achieves the FOMC’s monetary policy objectives.	93.0	999.0
201607	178	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Some important regulatory changes are not yet in place, and market participants may adjust their business models further in response.	93.0	999.0
201607	179	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	The monetary policy framework can be designed to support and enhance the benefits of the new regulatory approach in fostering a more resilient financial system with the understanding that a central bank’s implementation framework is a critical determinant of behavior in money markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	180	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I’ll now turn the presentation over to Julie Remache.	93.0	999.0
201607	181	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Beth.	93.0	999.0
201607	182	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Before turning the session over to your questions and comments and as a way to summarize our work, I’d like to highlight a few significant themes emerging from the work presented today as they relate to the set of key goals for a future implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	183	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Simon began our presentation with these, and they are repeated for your reference on slide 40.	93.0	999.0
201607	184	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The first goal highlights the need for the framework to be robust during periods of financial stress and in response to structural changes in the financial system.	93.0	999.0
201607	185	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The money market work highlighted many of the important regulations that have been put in place in recent years.	93.0	999.0
201607	186	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	As Beth noted, these regulations, which are meant to improve the stability of the financial system, require that financial institutions increase the amount of liquid assets that they hold to provide some measure of self- insurance.	93.0	999.0
201607	187	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	These regulations certainly increase the demand for high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	188	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	And it’s possible that they may also affect the demand for reserves—as Beth noted, particularly so if they are remunerated at a rate close to market rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	189	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	This may lead to a higher overall level of reserves than in the pre-crisis regime, leading the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet to be somewhat larger, even if it were to return to a scarce reserves regime.	93.0	999.0
201607	190	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The second goal stipulates that the framework should allow the Federal Reserve to achieve its macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at the effective lower bound.	93.0	999.0
201607	191	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The foreign experience work highlights a range of policy actions undertaken by other central banks, including the use of asset purchases, long-term funding programs, and negative rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	192	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	If the probability of revisiting the effective lower bound, perhaps routinely, in the future is reasonably high, and the duration of those visits is as long as the one we have just experienced, this will have a pronounced effect on the structure of the framework, including the set of tools that are chosen and the structure of the balance sheet.	93.0	999.0
201607	193	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The third goal stipulates that the framework should support the ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and to support financial stability.	93.0	999.0
201607	194	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	The work presented this morning highlights a range of issues related to the interaction of liquidity insurance and the monetary policy implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	195	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	These included tradeoffs in the pre-crisis framework between providing liquidity to address marketwide stress and maintaining interest rate control, the role that liquidity insurance operations played during the crisis in supporting the transmission of policy rates, and the experience not only in the United States during the crisis, but also at other central banks subsequently, with the benefits of providing liquidity to a broader range of counterparties and against a wider set of collateral to support policy transmission.	93.0	999.0
201607	196	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Of course, such potential benefits should be weighed against potential costs—which may include increased operational complexity and possible incentives created for counterparties to increase allocation to less liquid assets.	93.0	999.0
201607	197	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	198	2016-07-27	meeting	REMACHE	That completes our presentation.	93.0	999.0
201607	199	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	200	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we turn to Q&A on the presentations and papers, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our presenters and all of the staff across the System who have contributed to this very extensive project.	93.0	65.0
201607	201	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The documents we received for today’s meeting come from the foundational workgroups.	93.0	65.0
201607	202	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe they serve the very useful function of helping to establish a common understanding of our implementation framework, its evolution through the crisis, features of frameworks at foreign central banks, and the operation of money markets.	93.0	65.0
201607	203	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As described in the staff memos, our pre-crisis approach for implementing policy was not adequate for dealing with the severe disruptions caused by the financial crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	204	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In response, we made many innovations to provide liquidity to the financial system and to provide additional monetary policy accommodation once the federal funds rate was lowered to the effective lower bound.	93.0	65.0
201607	205	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of these innovations remain key elements of our current framework.	93.0	65.0
201607	206	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, in thinking about our framework in the longer run, it’s useful to recognize how much has changed since before the crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	207	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	To my mind, perhaps the most significant enhancement to our implementation framework has been the authority granted to us by the Congress to pay interest on reserve balances.	93.0	65.0
201607	208	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The IOER effectively severed the link between the quantity of reserves in the banking system and the level of short-term interest rates.	93.0	65.0
201607	209	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, the tensions we faced in the early stages of the crisis between providing liquidity on a large scale and maintaining control of the federal funds rate is largely resolved.	93.0	65.0
201607	210	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The ability to pay interest on reserves also helped enable us to employ another key policy tool—namely, large-scale asset purchases.	93.0	65.0
201607	211	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	LSAPs are an effective tool for providing monetary stimulus.	93.0	65.0
201607	212	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But in the absence of a predictable means by which we can subsequently scale back policy accommodation as the economy recovers, of the kind made possible by IOER, LSAPs would carry greater risks—and, therefore, would be less effective.	93.0	65.0
201607	213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Looking ahead, if the equilibrium federal funds rate remains lower in future decades than in past ones, the effective lower bound may bind more frequently.	93.0	65.0
201607	214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It seems likely, then, that LSAPs will remain an important part of our toolkit to respond to the wide range of shocks we face.	93.0	65.0
201607	215	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A third innovation in our framework has been the establishment of standing swap lines with foreign central banks.	93.0	65.0
201607	216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	These lines provide an important backstop with which to limit funding strains in offshore dollar funding markets.	93.0	65.0
201607	217	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As we saw in the crisis, such strains can have material adverse effects on our financial system and the domestic economy.	93.0	65.0
201607	218	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the key objective of the long-run framework project is to identify changes that could further enhance our implementation framework, and I hope you will mention such areas in your remarks today.	93.0	65.0
201607	219	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	One area I would highlight is the discount window.	93.0	65.0
201607	220	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have long grappled with the problem of stigma, which interferes with the efficient provision of liquidity to depository institutions and prevents the primary credit facility from serving as an effective ceiling on the federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201607	221	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As the experience of other countries shows, this need not be the case.	93.0	65.0
201607	222	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	This problem is an undesirable feature of our framework, and I believe it merits further attention.	93.0	65.0
201607	223	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Another shortcoming of our current framework is the inability of IOER to provide a firm floor on the federal funds rate.	93.0	65.0
201607	224	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our supplementary tools—notably, the overnight RRP as well as our term draining tools—may well give us all the control we need over short-term interest rates from a macroeconomic perspective.	93.0	65.0
201607	225	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But having the market-determined level of the federal funds rate and other overnight rates trade below IOER contributes to the impression that banks are getting a special deal with us.	93.0	65.0
201607	226	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That impression is amplified by the very large amount of reserves in the banking system and the associated large payments to commercial banks of interest on their reserve balances.	93.0	65.0
201607	227	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s easy to explain why we have such a configuration of interest rates, due to the elevated level of reserves in the banking system.	93.0	65.0
201607	228	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But it does put us in a defensive position.	93.0	65.0
201607	229	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there.	93.0	65.0
201607	230	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have allocated plenty of time today for a good discussion, so please feel free to ask a lot of questions and to make comments.	93.0	65.0
201607	231	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I know that the staff would appreciate hearing your thoughts about the direction of future work.	93.0	65.0
201607	232	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	At the November FOMC meeting, we will have an opportunity to discuss the work of the framework workgroups, which are examining interest rate targets, operating regimes, and balance sheet policies.	93.0	65.0
201607	233	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	While I don’t anticipate that we will need to make critical decisions about our longer-run framework anytime soon, I hope that this discussion and our next one will better position us for that eventuality.	93.0	65.0
201607	234	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s now open the floor for questions to the staff, and after the Q&A, we will have an opportunity to comment for anyone who would like to do so.	93.0	65.0
201607	235	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201607	236	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question, and I don’t know that the staff has the answer to it or that I have an answer to it.	93.0	96.0
201607	237	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The framework objectives basically imply that this is about monetary policy implementation, it’s about financial stability, and it implies that financial stability is important in terms of thinking about what the right framework is.	93.0	96.0
201607	238	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But then, when we come down to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, a framework should involve holding “no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.”	93.0	96.0
201607	239	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So one seems narrower than the other, and I just was wondering how the staff was thinking about that.	93.0	96.0
201607	240	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s imagine that we have a monetary policy framework that has huge benefits for financial stability but might require somewhat more securities.	93.0	96.0
201607	241	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Do we think that the policy normalization principles are cast in stone, or could they be potentially modified?	93.0	96.0
201607	242	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I just would like the staff’s view on this.	93.0	96.0
201607	243	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I’m not sure that’s a question for the staff.	93.0	999.0
201607	244	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	93.0	999.0
201607	245	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let me ask it this way:  Is there a tension between these two things?	93.0	96.0
201607	246	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They do seem a little bit in opposition to one another.	93.0	96.0
201607	247	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it would be interesting, as we discuss this, to decide:  Do we really believe the framework should be broad and include financial-stability objectives, or should it be narrow and just focused on monetary policy implementation?	93.0	96.0
201607	248	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	249	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	My recollection, Vice Chairman Dudley, is that when we were talking about that stated principle of normalization, there was a little bit of back-and- forth within the Committee, basically saying that’s an issue that does have some tension in it because you could interpret effective monetary policy as meaning:  You don’t want a monetary policy that creates financial instability, because that would require reactions later.	93.0	97.0
201607	250	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But my recollection is, we self-consciously tabled the tensions inherent in that issue, and so my sense was that it’s precisely one of the things that this exercise is going to have to address.	93.0	97.0
201607	251	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	252	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I just wanted to get that out on the table.	93.0	96.0
201607	253	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for the presenters?	93.0	65.0
201607	254	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me see, President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	255	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is on the international side, and it relates to one of the things that came out of the crisis, nonbank SIFIs, which wasn’t something that most countries were thinking about before the crisis.	93.0	90.0
201607	256	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For most countries, those were insurance companies and broker-dealers, depending on whether they were included or not included in commercial banks.	93.0	90.0
201607	257	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do other countries make liquidity available to anybody classified as a SIFI?	93.0	90.0
201607	258	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are we unique in that respect, or is that fairly common internationally?	93.0	90.0
201607	259	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So, for example, we had GE, we have insurance companies, and we’re viewing them as systemically-important institutions, but we’re not giving them access to the discount window, which presumably means that even though they are systemically important, we’re not worried about liquidity problems with those organizations or we’re choosing not to address that.	93.0	90.0
201607	260	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are we unique among the countries that you interviewed, or perhaps this may be a little too institutional?	93.0	90.0
201607	261	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	No, not at all.	93.0	999.0
201607	262	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	There are some central banks that have extended their counterparties beyond banks, even beyond broker-dealers.	93.0	999.0
201607	263	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The Bank of England is one example that has, in effect, explicitly said:  Our framework is to give liquidity insurance to anyone we feel is systemically important for liquidity, subject to liquidity shocks, and is adequately regulated.	93.0	999.0
201607	264	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And so the Bank of England allows, for example, for CCPs.	93.0	999.0
201607	265	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Another case is the Swiss National Bank’s inclusion of insurance companies, although I am not sure whether it is explicitly thinking about SIFIs.	93.0	999.0
201607	266	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In fact, the Swiss National Bank also includes banks that aren’t actually operating in Switzerland but might be operating in Swiss franc markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	267	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So it takes regulation in the euro area, regulation in the United Kingdom, as being adequate for its purposes in order to lend to those institutions.	93.0	999.0
201607	268	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	93.0	90.0
201607	269	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	270	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	93.0	81.0
201607	271	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	272	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I have two questions.	93.0	81.0
201607	273	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One is for Dave Altig.	93.0	81.0
201607	274	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This has to do with the narrative about the lessons of the crisis.	93.0	81.0
201607	275	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The paper, I think early, mentions sales of US government securities and the extent to which we resorted to that to sterilize and offset the effect of lending programs on aggregate reserves, in order to avoid driving interest rates down.	93.0	81.0
201607	276	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Then, later on, the paper seems to drop that option and says we didn’t have any way to do that.	93.0	81.0
201607	277	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And my sense from the narrative is that we didn’t sell all the securities we could have, and it wasn’t clear why not.	93.0	81.0
201607	278	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, I know some were pledged or lent out in the TSLF, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	279	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But my sense is, not all of them, but I guess I could look that up.	93.0	81.0
201607	280	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Did we sell or encumber all of the US Treasury securities we could have?	93.0	81.0
201607	281	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we didn’t, why did we stop short of selling US government securities at the time we did?	93.0	81.0
201607	282	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We sold quite a few securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	283	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Between March and May of 2008, we sold about $8 billion or $9 billion in bills, which is about 45 percent of the holdings at that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	284	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	That’s actually after we had redeemed a substantial number of securities in the run-up to the Bear Stearns time frame.	93.0	999.0
201607	285	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	We also sold about $55 billion in coupon securities, which represented about 12 percent of our holdings.	93.0	999.0
201607	286	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	So we had run down a fair amount of the portfolio, and then in that March and May period, we sold another very sizable chunk.	93.0	999.0
201607	287	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	It’s true that we didn’t sell all of them, and it’s also true, as you noted, that some of the securities we needed to hold, in part because those securities were serving as collateral or lend-out securities for programs like the TSLF.	93.0	999.0
201607	288	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So there were a couple hundred billion we could have sold?	93.0	81.0
201607	289	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	290	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	I don’t have the exact numbers.	93.0	999.0
201607	291	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	There were some securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	292	2016-07-27	meeting	MCLAUGHLIN	They were, I believe, principally long-duration securities.	93.0	999.0
201607	293	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Isn’t the point, though, that we didn’t need to sell them because we hadn’t added sufficient reserves that we had to offset?	93.0	96.0
201607	294	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, there’s this point at which we did, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	295	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	No, no.	93.0	96.0
201607	296	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I know, I know.	93.0	96.0
201607	297	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But the point is, at the time, we were basically saying, “Well, we can sell securities, and we can expand our liquidity provisions, but we don’t want to be too aggressive in terms of our liquidity provision, because then we might have to sell a whole lot of securities, and then we’re not sure what the market effect is going to be.”	93.0	96.0
201607	298	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So we basically were very conscious of how the liquidity provisions were going to add reserves to the banking system and our ability to actually offset that by draining.	93.0	96.0
201607	299	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, we did sell securities, because that’s what we had to do to offset the reserves that we added.	93.0	96.0
201607	300	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	301	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We didn’t do more because that’s the volume of reserves we essentially had issued.	93.0	96.0
201607	302	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	So I think your point, President Lacker, might be that the Desk could have sold all of the outrights and just run a repo book.	93.0	999.0
201607	303	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That repo book would have been more flexible, and that would have perhaps given you three or four days in September 2008.	93.0	999.0
201607	304	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We would have had more capacity.	93.0	96.0
201607	305	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So let me see if I get this straight.	93.0	81.0
201607	306	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Before this chart does the hockey- stick thing on page 19, no question, we sold what we did, and we sterilized effectively.	93.0	81.0
201607	307	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not disputing that.	93.0	81.0
201607	308	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But the assessment that comes out—and, Madam Chair, you repeated this—that our crisis framework was inadequate for the liquidity provision.	93.0	81.0
201607	309	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I just want to pinpoint in what way it was.	93.0	81.0
201607	310	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We could have built up more capacity.	93.0	96.0
201607	311	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that resting on the notion that we didn’t have enough securities to sell—following what happened after October 2008, in view of the reserve injections that occurred after that, in light of the lending that occurred after that?	93.0	81.0
201607	312	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We didn’t have enough securities to sell—is that the idea?	93.0	81.0
201607	313	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, there is the gap between September and October when the TARP legislation gives us the authority to pay interest on reserves?	93.0	96.0
201607	314	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s really during that month that we were exposed.	93.0	96.0
201607	315	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	316	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Well, there’s clearly that.	93.0	999.0
201607	317	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	There is the issue in the spring and the summer of 2008 when the TAF and swaps were there, but they had a limit on the usage.	93.0	999.0
201607	318	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We’ve had a long discussion on this.	93.0	999.0
201607	319	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think this was the first binding constraint in policymakers’ minds, but from the operational perspective, when Vice Chairman Dudley and his staff were thinking through about how to describe for you what we could do, they were constantly thinking at the back of their minds, “We have to be careful here, because there’s only a limited amount we can do if we have a lot of usage of, say, the TAF, or the swaps, to control the federal funds rate.”	93.0	999.0
201607	320	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	And the federal funds rate was well above zero.	93.0	999.0
201607	321	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It was about 2¼ percent at that time.	93.0	999.0
201607	322	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, then we could have sold more securities outright, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	323	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Exactly.	93.0	999.0
201607	324	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The Desk could have come to you and said, “Over the next few months, we are now going to liquidate all of the Treasury portfolio, run a repo book, and that will give you more flexibility to size up these programs.”	93.0	999.0
201607	325	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But, even short of that, I don’t see what the problem would have been then.	93.0	81.0
201607	326	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Part of the issue is, you don’t have foresight about what’s going to come.	93.0	96.0
201607	327	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t know that Lehman weekend is coming down the road, right?	93.0	96.0
201607	328	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You could sell a lot of securities to build up your capacity, but then you have the cost of how that could potentially disrupt the Treasury securities market, and do you want to do that or not?	93.0	96.0
201607	329	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, we were lowering rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	330	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	93.0	96.0
201607	331	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Selling bills and short-dated coupon securities is probably not going to have much effect on the Treasury securities market or the Treasury yield curve, but if we had sold a lot of longer-dated Treasur securities, I think there’s a question of what that would do to the market.	93.0	96.0
201607	332	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a judgment call.	93.0	96.0
201607	333	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I think if we look back, there are many things we would have done in a different way.	93.0	999.0
201607	334	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Oh, absolutely.	93.0	96.0
201607	335	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s certainly true, but from the interviews that we’ve done, this was a constraint in people’s minds.	93.0	999.0
201607	336	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it was a primary constraint in policymakers’ minds.	93.0	999.0
201607	337	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	For them, there were a lot of issues—moral hazard and dealing with whether we could have such large programs and what that would look like.	93.0	999.0
201607	338	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Optically, that ended in the middle of September 2008.	93.0	999.0
201607	339	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Didn’t the Treasury come along and help us manage this problem substantially by running up its own balances?	93.0	65.0
201607	340	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Correct, and it helped drain reserves by holding more.	93.0	96.0
201607	341	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And that was before October?	93.0	65.0
201607	342	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	343	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I have a second question.	93.0	81.0
201607	344	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s for Beth Klee.	93.0	81.0
201607	345	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In your presentation, you talked about linkages, and this shows up in the paper, too.	93.0	81.0
201607	346	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s this graph on slide 28 that shows pre-crisis rates are highly correlated, and then on slide 29 it says that rates may be less connected at high frequencies.	93.0	81.0
201607	347	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On 28, all the rates are really close to each other and the lines kind of overlap, and then on 29, they wiggle around a lot and they’re far apart.	93.0	81.0
201607	348	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But then, the scales are different.	93.0	81.0
201607	349	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To your credit and in all fairness, you cite, I think, some econometric work, something about what fraction of variance is explained by a common factor.	93.0	81.0
201607	350	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	351	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	That’s just doing a simple principal component analysis.	93.0	999.0
201607	352	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	93.0	81.0
201607	353	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So when I look the one on 28, the pre-crisis, and I think about a common factor there, I’m thinking, that would be us, right, moving interest rates around?	93.0	81.0
201607	354	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	355	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And then in your second sample, we’re not moving interest rates around much at all.	93.0	81.0
201607	356	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We do it once at the end.	93.0	81.0
201607	357	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re not going to get the federal funds rate target or some policy rate as being the common factor.	93.0	81.0
201607	358	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So, you’d expect the fraction of variance explained by the common factor to go down, right, and that would not to really reflect any difference in meaningful linkages or the extent to which market rates would move if we raised rates as much as we did on slide 28.	93.0	81.0
201607	359	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that intuition correct, Beth?	93.0	81.0
201607	360	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I think it is to some degree.	93.0	999.0
201607	361	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	It’s basically a statistical exercise—it’s pretty agnostic.	93.0	999.0
201607	362	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	I think that you’re going to see the rates travel more together if you have the policy rates moving things, and so, therefore, that will explain more.	93.0	999.0
201607	363	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	To be technical about it:  We take out the mean.	93.0	999.0
201607	364	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	We control for these kinds of things, but—	93.0	999.0
201607	365	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You don’t take out the movement in the funds rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	366	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	No, we don’t take out the movement in the funds rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	367	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	93.0	81.0
201607	368	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	But in terms of the behavior of the constellation of rates when you move, let’s say, either the federal funds rate target or, in this case, the administered rates, in both cases the constellation of money market rates moved up.	93.0	999.0
201607	369	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	And so is 95 percent very different from 85 percent, particularly when you’re at the effective lower bound?	93.0	999.0
201607	370	2016-07-27	meeting	KLEE	That’s probably a judgment call.	93.0	999.0
201607	371	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	372	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	373	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fisher.	93.0	65.0
201607	374	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	375	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Somebody said earlier that they weren’t sure they should raise this issue, and I’m not sure I should raise this issue except that it’s important.	93.0	108.0
201607	376	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The big thing that happened last time was at the time of the failure of Lehman Brothers.	93.0	108.0
201607	377	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And that made a difference to the entire world.	93.0	108.0
201607	378	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, there’s nothing as far as I can see that prevents us coming to a day on which we don’t have a tool to deal with a similar situation.	93.0	108.0
201607	379	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what are we going to do on that day?	93.0	108.0
201607	380	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Are you waiting for an answer, sir?	93.0	97.0
201607	381	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the question I’m raising is what are we allowed to do?	93.0	108.0
201607	382	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do you mean what facilities do we have?	93.0	65.0
201607	383	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes,  Are we allowed to go to the FDIC and start putting this institution into bankruptcy or at least into the FDIC’s care, with some hope that we’ve done enough work that will enable us to prevent that having massive repercussions?	93.0	108.0
201607	384	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Under Title 2?	93.0	65.0
201607	385	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Under Title 2.	93.0	108.0
201607	386	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the FDIC has the ability to tap liquidity and lend to that institution.	93.0	65.0
201607	387	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	93.0	108.0
201607	388	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We still have 13(3) powers to put in place broad-based programs if it’s not a single institution.	93.0	65.0
201607	389	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, well, if we had five Lehmans, we would have had a bigger problem.	93.0	108.0
201607	390	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Five investment banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	391	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But, Governor Fischer, just to be clear, for the purpose of this project, we decided deliberately—and I believe also with your blessing—that we would actually stay away from the explicit evaluation of, for example, 13(3) facilities, because we felt that they were not part of a normal implementation framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	392	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, as you saw from the material, clearly there is a bit of a gray area here, in the sense that you cannot completely exclude the topic of liquidity provision, because it turns out that liquidity provision and the implementation framework are very closely tied.	93.0	999.0
201607	393	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That said, I think what our work here has primarily focused on are questions such as, If you had to greatly expand the provision of liquidity, how would you still be able to control short-term interest rates in order to implement the particular chosen stance for monetary policy?	93.0	999.0
201607	394	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m afraid that it was by design that this project was not intended to address the question that you just raised.	93.0	999.0
201607	395	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s clear, and if I agreed with that some time ago, then I plead guilty.	93.0	108.0
201607	396	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, at some point, we’re going to have to look at this issue.	93.0	108.0
201607	397	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got a plan, which is not entirely “fair weather” sailing, but there are things that it doesn’t quite go into in the same depth that it might.	93.0	108.0
201607	398	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve got to find a way of doing the best we can to figure out what we would do in similar circumstances because they can quite well arise.	93.0	108.0
201607	399	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s not that we banned them by saying that you got rid of too-big-to-fail.	93.0	108.0
201607	400	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If somebody eventually says “yes,” then it’s gone, but that hasn’t happened, so we had better come back to it in some way, shape, or form, with the attendant political difficulties being taken into account.	93.0	108.0
201607	401	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a very tough issue, as I’m sure I don’t have to say.	93.0	108.0
201607	402	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And our powers have been restricted in Dodd-Frank, but we still do have substantial 13(3) powers to create facilities to address strains, and in Dodd-Frank we got the ability, if we deemed it important, to lend to a CCP or a designated financial market utility if it encountered strains, which could be a different kind of problem that afflicts the financial system.	93.0	65.0
201607	403	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re not completely without powers, but they’re certainly not as broad as some other countries have and have regularly put into effect.	93.0	65.0
201607	404	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	93.0	108.0
201607	405	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for the staff?	93.0	65.0
201607	406	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	407	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201607	408	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sorry for the second question.	93.0	90.0
201607	409	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Please feel free.	93.0	65.0
201607	410	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve got a lot of time.	93.0	65.0
201607	411	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is an international question again.	93.0	90.0
201607	412	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’m looking at slide 8 on the policy rates and the distinction between market and administered rates, and it’s striking how many chose administered rates rather than market rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	413	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I think of the IOER, it’s a leaky floor, which is, in some sense, by design.	93.0	90.0
201607	414	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s a leaky floor because we didn’t give nonbanks access to the administered rate.	93.0	90.0
201607	415	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are there any other central banks that chose to have a leaky floor by design?	93.0	90.0
201607	416	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, you could view us as having an administered rate, because it’s really weird that only the GSEs are trading in the federal funds market.	93.0	90.0
201607	417	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we’ve created, kind of by design, an artificial market that’s very tied to the administered rate.	93.0	90.0
201607	418	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The arbitrage works through foreign banks, but because of the FDIC, they’re getting arbitrage profits relative to the GSEs, which are government entities.	93.0	90.0
201607	419	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s kind of a weird set of constraints that we’ve imposed to make this a market.	93.0	90.0
201607	420	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, I’d be interested whether anybody else has this kind of characteristic.	93.0	90.0
201607	421	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are all of these administered rates truly administered rates, or is what they’ve done to avoid leaky floors to allow other people to participate in the administered rate besides depositories?	93.0	90.0
201607	422	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	If you turn to slide 11, I don’t know if they tried to do this by design or not, but you can see in the case of both the Bank of England, which is depicted in the purple line, and the Bank of Japan, shown in the dark blue line, money market rates are trading far below their floor.	93.0	999.0
201607	423	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And that includes some nonbank participants who are not part of or don’t have access to accounts that get remunerated trading with banks that do have access.	93.0	999.0
201607	424	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So it is this sort of arbitrage activity.	93.0	999.0
201607	425	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I don’t know whether it’s by design or not.	93.0	999.0
201607	426	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So those are administered rates or market rates when they have those examples.	93.0	90.0
201607	427	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s similar to us, right?	93.0	90.0
201607	428	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	In both of these cases, they are administered rates.	93.0	999.0
201607	429	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think they have a government-sponsored enterprise that has an account at the central bank that can run transactions through that account but is not eligible to earn that central bank rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	430	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That is somewhat different, and it affects the federal funds market.	93.0	999.0
201607	431	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	If you paid out to the GSEs, the federal funds rate would likely then trade above the effective rate where the IOER is.	93.0	999.0
201607	432	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Remember, that market is relatively small compared with the Eurodollar market in which the nonbanks, which are the money funds, are much bigger transactors.	93.0	999.0
201607	433	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	You’d still have that wedge, and that’s really what you see in the United Kingdom and Japan.	93.0	999.0
201607	434	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	This is a conjecture.	93.0	999.0
201607	435	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I also don’t know if the statement is 100 percent true.	93.0	999.0
201607	436	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	It is the case that you see that the rates trade not as below the floor in the case of the BOJ and BOE.	93.0	999.0
201607	437	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	And that may be due to their having a broader set of counterparties, and it may also be due to their having a much smaller nonbank sector.	93.0	999.0
201607	438	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	But, you know, that’s a conjecture.	93.0	999.0
201607	439	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	93.0	90.0
201607	440	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	93.0	65.0
201607	441	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201607	442	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On page 12, there’s a discussion about liquidity provision to a broader range of institutions, and then there’s bullet 4, which is that central banks see advantages to having a more level playing field and to getting information about the institutions to which they are lending, but that we need to be worried about moral hazard.	93.0	108.0
201607	443	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not written—that was said.	93.0	108.0
201607	444	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	As far as I can see—and I think you said this in the written paper—the Bank of England, for instance, has just tried to get rid of the moral-hazard aspects in the way it has set up these facilities, or something like these facilities.	93.0	108.0
201607	445	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the question is, should we be saying, well, in essence, moral hazard is a barrier that we can’t overcome, or should we try to think of institutional arrangements like the Bank of England has developed?	93.0	108.0
201607	446	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	One thing that a number of foreign banks expressed was that getting at moral hazard might be more of a supervisory and regulatory issue than an issue for liquidity insurance.	93.0	999.0
201607	447	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, of course, the Bank of England is the supervisor.	93.0	97.0
201607	448	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	449	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	So they would try to use those powers, although they were not the supervisor, necessarily, in all instances, I guess.	93.0	999.0
201607	450	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They are the only prudential supervisor.	93.0	97.0
201607	451	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Okay.	93.0	999.0
201607	452	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	They are now.	93.0	999.0
201607	453	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Yes, you’re right, I’m sorry.	93.0	999.0
201607	454	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	That wasn’t the case partly when they designed this, but that’s the situation now.	93.0	999.0
201607	455	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Now.	93.0	999.0
201607	456	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s also true that that’s the change at the ECB.	93.0	999.0
201607	457	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Although, in the case of the ECB, they don’t have the broadest set of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	458	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201607	459	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll get to this in the comments, but I gathered in reading all this—which I thought was very well done and obviously very helpful for me—that while you didn’t address some of the sensitivity about what powers we have and don’t have, you laid it out so that part of the guidance we can offer in our comments should be:  What should we have?	93.0	110.0
201607	460	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And then we can have a separate discussion about how to get from here to there?	93.0	110.0
201607	461	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And the BOE is the one that naturally you gravitate toward, because what they have—and we’ll get to this later—seems like a good thing to have.	93.0	110.0
201607	462	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The issue here I gather is:  How do we get to where we actually have the ability to do the same thing the Bank of England does?	93.0	110.0
201607	463	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I take it that’s a little trickier question.	93.0	110.0
201607	464	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	My view is that the law, especially the Federal Reserve Act, is what we take.	93.0	999.0
201607	465	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It gives the Federal Reserve tremendous power.	93.0	999.0
201607	466	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Before the crisis, the Bank of England operated in a way that was much narrower in terms of the collateral that they would take.	93.0	999.0
201607	467	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	The discount window will take a range of collateral, which is very wide compared with most central banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	468	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we might actually have the power.	93.0	110.0
201607	469	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	There, you limit the type of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	470	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	With open market operations, if you’re prepared to narrow to a particular type of collateral, you can have a wide range of counterparties.	93.0	999.0
201607	471	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	93.0	110.0
201607	472	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Within that construction, subject to some really important issues, whatever decisions that you take, you have to think about the incentives you are putting into money markets and about the financial institutions there.	93.0	999.0
201607	473	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We can’t just be thinking of the case of how would we lend a lot of money at a certain time?	93.0	999.0
201607	474	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	We have to think of how likely we are to get to that situation, because we have incentives in place for those folks to take risks, because they know that the Federal Reserve is there.	93.0	999.0
201607	475	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But that’s why we’re doing this exercise, to think through these things in advance, right?	93.0	110.0
201607	476	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s part of the reason, yes.	93.0	999.0
201607	477	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	I guess I’d only add that part of the reason we cite the Bank of England frequently is that it is a central bank that has done a lot of thinking and enacted a lot of change from where it was pre-2006, even before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	478	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	The BOE changed its system before the crisis, and we saw a lot of evolution during the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	479	2016-07-27	meeting	DOYLE	Because they’ve done a lot of thinking, it’s a lot of grist in the mill.	93.0	999.0
201607	480	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	93.0	110.0
201607	481	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	482	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	93.0	65.0
201607	483	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair—	93.0	81.0
201607	484	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	485	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	93.0	81.0
201607	486	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Let me just add a comment to echo what Thomas Laubach said.	93.0	81.0
201607	487	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We have the luxury now of separating questions of monetary control and interest rate control from credit extension.	93.0	81.0
201607	488	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When we were founded, the founders made a choice to combine those two, and it was based on the monetary system at the time of the gold standard and the fact that government finance, if it was monetized, tended to be associated with wartime departures from the gold standard and inflation—or, if done in peacetime, associated with inflation.	93.0	81.0
201607	489	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The founders explicitly chose not to focus on government-debt backing for the money we would issue but instead used the discount window in its mechanism.	93.0	81.0
201607	490	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Very rapidly after that, we got plenty of government securities, and we’ve figured out over the last century how to run central banks with a portfolio in which the money they issue is backed by government securities and without having that be inflationary.	93.0	81.0
201607	491	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It was for a time in the ’70s, but it isn’t now.	93.0	81.0
201607	492	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But that gives us the luxury of separating granting credit to the private sector from how much liquidity we provide—and I use that word in the sense of our monetary liabilities that we provide to the system.	93.0	81.0
201607	493	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, liquidity is also used in these papers—a little sloppily—to refer to credit extension, in which you are lending somebody those assets.	93.0	81.0
201607	494	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To provide them to the system, people can exchange assets to acquire our liabilities.	93.0	81.0
201607	495	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But that’s not the same as our lending them to them.	93.0	81.0
201607	496	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That division we can do, and so I think, on Thomas’s point, either we separate thinking about liquidity provision and liquidity extension from monetary control or we don’t.	93.0	81.0
201607	497	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And if we are going to go down the road of combining the two, using credit extension as part of monetary control, opens up a big can of worms.	93.0	81.0
201607	498	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I would just put in a pitch for keeping those separate in our discussions.	93.0	81.0
201607	499	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	93.0	65.0
201607	500	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a follow-up for President Lacker.	93.0	94.0
201607	501	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Could you elaborate on what you mean?	93.0	94.0
201607	502	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because I took the point of the memos to be that these are not really separable things, and therefore we have to design a system that appropriately balances the ability to provide monetary control and the ability to provide liquidity in a crisis.	93.0	94.0
201607	503	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And you just said, you could separate these two things.	93.0	94.0
201607	504	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So, what do you mean?	93.0	94.0
201607	505	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, I was going to get to this in my prepared remarks.	93.0	81.0
201607	506	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the risk of some perseveration, I’ll just say that what I am proposing is a very simple regime in which we pay interest on reserves and ignore everything else in the world—not ignore it, but don’t adopt an explicit target for the funds rate, just drop that.	93.0	81.0
201607	507	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Our policy rate is our administered rate, and that’s it.	93.0	81.0
201607	508	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And we count on arbitrage, as we do now, to align rates with that.	93.0	81.0
201607	509	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So that’s a crisp, pure polar model, and in that world, you know, our balance sheet can be whatever it is.	93.0	81.0
201607	510	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	93.0	94.0
201607	511	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So the point would be, it’s an administered rate.	93.0	94.0
201607	512	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	513	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In that simple regime there doesn’t seem to be any tension between monetary control and credit extension, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	514	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We can extend credit, and we keep the IOER where it is, and arbitrage presumably keeps everything where it is.	93.0	81.0
201607	515	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So we don’t have to sterilize anything.	93.0	81.0
201607	516	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We just don’t have an issue.	93.0	81.0
201607	517	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So the tension doesn’t arise in that scenario.	93.0	81.0
201607	518	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	93.0	94.0
201607	519	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So your point would be that a lot hinges on an administered rate versus a market rate?	93.0	94.0
201607	520	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	93.0	81.0
201607	521	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	An administered rate with a floor.	93.0	81.0
201607	522	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	With other systems, like reserve scarcity systems, you have to sterilize things.	93.0	81.0
201607	523	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You have to deal with this issue.	93.0	81.0
201607	524	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That was the point—that, if there is going to be a tension, if the staff is going to ask us to consider something in which there is some tradeoff, we haven’t seen a serious ex post review of our credit programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	525	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They are going to be asking us to make some choice, on the basis of the costs and benefits of preparedness for liquidity provision programs, credit extension programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	526	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we would want something about the economic advantages and disadvantages of various levels of preparedness for credit extension by a central bank.	93.0	81.0
201607	527	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I previewed my comments there.	93.0	81.0
201607	528	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	93.0	94.0
201607	529	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Certainly.	93.0	81.0
201607	530	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	531	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A number of people have asked to comment.	93.0	65.0
201607	532	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If others who are not on this list wish to be added, just let us know.	93.0	65.0
201607	533	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin our comment opportunity with the Vice Chairman.	93.0	65.0
201607	534	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201607	535	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we all have to agree that the staff have given us a lot to digest, and there’s obviously going to be much more to come on this.	93.0	96.0
201607	536	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought this round of work was very thorough and thoughtful.	93.0	96.0
201607	537	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So thank you for that.	93.0	96.0
201607	538	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do think it’s extraordinarily premature to make any strong assertions about what the long-run framework should look like at this point because I think there’s a lot more work and assessment to do before we reach that point.	93.0	96.0
201607	539	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, this is a very big and complex subject, and, speaking for myself, I am going to need some time to get my head fully around the key issues and the potential alternatives and tradeoffs.	93.0	96.0
201607	540	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I’d like to make a couple of comments at this very early stage.	93.0	96.0
201607	541	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My first comment, which is consistent with the framework objectives that were laid out for us, is that we need to pick a framework that’s not just best suited for monetary policy execution, but that is also best suited to achieving our financial-stability objectives.	93.0	96.0
201607	542	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine a framework that had significant financial-stability benefits—because it included a broader set of counterparties, or it had stronger liquidity backstops, or it had liquidity backstops that had less stigma—but it might be a little bit more complex than a simpler system might be in terms of monetary policy execution.	93.0	96.0
201607	543	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I might be willing to accept a little bit more complicated, elaborate monetary policy execution in exchange for those financial stability benefits.	93.0	96.0
201607	544	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we want to cast the net large and understand that we’re maximizing across both of these regimes, monetary policy implementation and financial stability.	93.0	96.0
201607	545	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second point is that, as the SOMA manager in 2007 and 2008, I don’t disagree with anything the staff said.	93.0	96.0
201607	546	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought the lessons of the financial crisis with respect to monetary policy implementation are pretty clear.	93.0	96.0
201607	547	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The setup then was not well suited for providing liquidity to the system.	93.0	96.0
201607	548	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We did encounter a conflict between the goal of supplying liquidity and maintaining monetary control in 2007 and much of 2008.	93.0	96.0
201607	549	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We didn’t move to particularly large liquidity-assisted programs because we were worried about the consequences of that for reserves.	93.0	96.0
201607	550	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Only quite late in the fall of 2008, with the TARP legislation, did we get the opportunity to move to the interest-on-reserves framework under which, in my mind, we were finally able to establish credible, broad backstops without the risk of losing monetary policy control.	93.0	96.0
201607	551	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if you think about it, the crisis might have been less severe if we had been able to put such broad, open-ended backstops in place sooner.	93.0	96.0
201607	552	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We couldn’t do that because we were worried about monetary policy control, but if we had had broad, credible backstops in place, I think there would have been less incentive for counterparties to pull away because they’d know that there would have been a way of getting cash back at the end of the day.	93.0	96.0
201607	553	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think there were a number of other problems that I’d like to avoid in the future.	93.0	96.0
201607	554	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the stigma associated with the discount window borrowing, which the Chair talked about, was a huge problem.	93.0	96.0
201607	555	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, another problem that came up during the crisis that we need to consider was that we did supply a lot of liquidity to the banking system, but that was not necessarily lent on to other important parts of the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201607	556	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In a hybrid system like we have—banks, nonbanks, a pretty big capital market—how do we have a system to ensure that the credit actually gets to the people that need it?	93.0	96.0
201607	557	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Getting it to the banks may not be sufficient.	93.0	96.0
201607	558	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The third point I would just make is, although it’s still in the early day to reach firm conclusions, I have to say that my current inclination is not to go back to the corridor system that we had before the crisis.	93.0	96.0
201607	559	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I viewed that as operationally cumbersome and at times ineffective at keeping the federal funds rate where we want it to be.	93.0	96.0
201607	560	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember the fact that we had these fluctuations in the federal funds rate within a given day—higher in the morning in Europe and then lower later in the day.	93.0	96.0
201607	561	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, that was probably not a big problem in terms of effective monetary policy, but then in September 2008, it actually got worse.	93.0	96.0
201607	562	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We had difficulty keeping the federal funds rate close to our target right after the Lehman Brothers failure.	93.0	96.0
201607	563	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, I don’t think we want or need to operate a regime in which the Federal Reserve has the kind of extraordinary large balance sheet as it does today.	93.0	96.0
201607	564	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the benefits of a floor system can be achieved with a much smaller balance sheet.	93.0	96.0
201607	565	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fourth point I would make is, I hope we all just remain open minded about where all this is going.	93.0	96.0
201607	566	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This means being open minded not just about the framework, but also not prematurely ruling out seeking other changes that might make a particular monetary policy originally more effective.	93.0	96.0
201607	567	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, I can imagine that after all the work is done, we can conclude that seeking changes to the leverage ratio requirements that might exempt bank reserve holdings with the Federal Reserve from the leverage-ratio calculation or seeking changes via legislation or via regulation that would change our set of counterparties might result in a more effective monetary policy regime, and I don’t think we should necessarily rule them out ex ante.	93.0	96.0
201607	568	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We should consider them carefully—What’s the benefit of trying to push down these certain avenues against some of the constraints that we face?—and see if that’s worth it or not.	93.0	96.0
201607	569	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think changing our target from the federal funds rate to some other rate is certainly something we should consider.	93.0	96.0
201607	570	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think an interesting open question is:  What are the pros and cons of targeting an administered rate versus a market rate?	93.0	96.0
201607	571	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I frankly don’t see a particular benefit of targeting a market rate.	93.0	96.0
201607	572	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you target an administered rate and the market rates move consistently with that administered rate, it seem to me like an administered rate works just fine.	93.0	96.0
201607	573	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’d like that issue developed a little bit more fully.	93.0	96.0
201607	574	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I do think there are some important issues that could be more fully developed.	93.0	96.0
201607	575	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One thing that runs through the memo is this issue of interbank activity in the money markets.	93.0	96.0
201607	576	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I have a fundamental question:  In and of itself, is interbank activity in the money market a good thing?	93.0	96.0
201607	577	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When I step back and consider it at a little higher level, we want a financial system that allows efficient intermediation between savers and borrowers.	93.0	96.0
201607	578	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In an ideal system, savers meet borrowers.	93.0	96.0
201607	579	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s no need for anybody in the middle.	93.0	96.0
201607	580	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They meet, and they exchange.	93.0	96.0
201607	581	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re all done.	93.0	96.0
201607	582	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that having a view that we want interbank money market activity means we’re actually putting more stuff in the middle, more cost and more complexity, which might not necessarily be a good thing.	93.0	96.0
201607	583	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m not sure that interbank activity is necessarily a good thing.	93.0	96.0
201607	584	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t go in a priori thinking that’s a positive, and I’d like to see more work on that.	93.0	96.0
201607	585	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second issue I thought that would be interesting to explore a little further is whether the issuance of Federal Reserve bills is in scope for this project.	93.0	96.0
201607	586	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that Federal Reserve bills have a lot of advantages.	93.0	96.0
201607	587	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d have a much broader set of counterparties.	93.0	96.0
201607	588	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It would drain reserves, and we could drain as much of reserves as we want.	93.0	96.0
201607	589	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It would allow us to lean much less heavily on the interest on excess reserves so that you could get away from the idea that we’re favoring banks.	93.0	96.0
201607	590	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me that the Federal Reserve bill issuance is probably worth some consideration.	93.0	96.0
201607	591	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And then the final meta questions I have are:  How does the framework influence the size of the banking system versus the nonbank system, and how is that relevant to financial stability?	93.0	96.0
201607	592	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re going to make choices that could either encourage the banking system to grow because we’re providing benefit to being a bank, or we could offer a system that makes being a bank a little bit less attractive, and so banks could shrink.	93.0	96.0
201607	593	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think we need to think about how we treat banks versus nonbanks as we go through this process and how that’s likely to affect the future evolution of the financial system.	93.0	96.0
201607	594	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	93.0	96.0
201607	595	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	596	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	93.0	65.0
201607	597	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201607	598	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with your opening remarks that this is very useful material.	93.0	102.0
201607	599	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though I’ve been in the Federal Reserve throughout this period, it was nice to have all of the documents together, highlighting the key issues and open questions.	93.0	102.0
201607	600	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of open questions, the thing that struck me in reading through the very thorough memos—and I agree here with the Vice Chairman—was the sense that there are still the same open questions today that we had the last time we discussed this.	93.0	102.0
201607	601	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One example is how regulations—especially in money market funds, in banking—will affect the demand for reserves or affect relative activity in money markets and interest rates and things like that.	93.0	102.0
201607	602	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still an ongoing process, so I think there’s time for us to learn more from that.	93.0	102.0
201607	603	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another open question—and I do have a solution for this, but maybe I’ll save it for tomorrow—is that we haven’t really progressed very far on policy normalization.	93.0	102.0
201607	604	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	605	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some of the big questions we had were on the role of the ON RRP and its size:  what the scale of the ON RRP will be as we raise interest rates and how that will affect market conditions.	93.0	102.0
201607	606	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We started with this very open-ended, large approach to the program so that we could have very good interest rate control.	93.0	102.0
201607	607	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s been successful, but I still think we have a lot to learn as we do raise rates about how that will actually function and the pros and cons of that.	93.0	102.0
201607	608	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So like the Vice Chairman commented, I think it is premature to come to conclusions either here or November.	93.0	102.0
201607	609	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, I guess my main point I would like to make is, I’m worried a little bit about the timeline here.	93.0	102.0
201607	610	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s great that we have a discussion today and maybe in November to intellectually think about these issues.	93.0	102.0
201607	611	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of some of the uncertainties and questions that will still be open, I’m just not sure whether we’re going to have the information we need even in 2017, which is when, I think, we’re supposed to have the kind of meeting at which we actually try to come to agreement on some of this.	93.0	102.0
201607	612	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess my one bit of advice is not to try to hold to some fixed timeline in coming to decisions, but to have that be on the basis of what we’ve learned and the events, say, over the next year.	93.0	102.0
201607	613	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going back to the issue that Governor Fischer and others have brought up in their questions, I do think, in setting up this new framework, we need to consider seriously what we think the risks are and what the distribution of the risks that we’re worried about is.	93.0	102.0
201607	614	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In normal times, I think any framework works fine.	93.0	102.0
201607	615	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	616	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s the international experience.	93.0	102.0
201607	617	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t matter in normal times how we do monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201607	618	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s fine.	93.0	102.0
201607	619	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The issues that you really want to think about the situations that are either very stressful from a financial-sector point of view, the zero lower bound, negative interest rates.	93.0	102.0
201607	620	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think that does force us to actually think about what the likely scenarios are, not specifically about a Lehman Brothers or an AIG kind of scenario, but more generally about what the problem is that we’re trying to solve?	93.0	102.0
201607	621	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Personally, because of my view on the low equilibrium real interest rate or natural rate of interest, I am mostly scared, if you will, about effective lower bounds, and I heard the word “visit.”	93.0	102.0
201607	622	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I feel this was like my son moving back home.	93.0	102.0
201607	623	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The effective-lower-bound episodes are not visits, they’re kind of stay-for-many-years situations.	93.0	102.0
201607	624	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	93.0	102.0
201607	625	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, to me, in thinking about the policy framework, a lot of the important issues come up, as you said, Madam Chair, concerning LSAPs, liquidity insurance, and, obviously, stigma, and I’m not discounting those, but I do think that the effective lower bound is the thing that worries me.	93.0	102.0
201607	626	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I do want to bring up an issue that the Vice Chairman and others brought up, and that’s the issue of the legal restrictions on our ability to conduct monetary policy.	93.0	102.0
201607	627	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m thinking about the types of assets we can buy, whether we can pay negative interest rates, Federal Reserve bills—I was scribbling these down while people were speaking—the various tools that we will have in the future to basically achieve our dual-mandate goals.	93.0	102.0
201607	628	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I recognize that these are legal restrictions.	93.0	102.0
201607	629	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even interest on reserves is a legal restriction.	93.0	102.0
201607	630	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I do think that if we come to the conclusion that we need more powerful monetary policy tools or that we need to be able to use Federal Reserve bills or pay interest to a broader set of institutions, we should, when we come to that view, try our best to convince elected officials that those are the tools that we need.	93.0	102.0
201607	631	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I know we can’t control that, but I do think that should be part of our discussion.	93.0	102.0
201607	632	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we should have discussions only about what can we do under the current law, but we should think seriously about, well, if we could have additional tools, what they would be.	93.0	102.0
201607	633	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last comment is that—and I don’t mean to take up so much time, I apologize for that—I do wonder about stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	634	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Stigma in this conversation today sounds a little bit like too- big-to-fail.	93.0	102.0
201607	635	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re all against it, but it’s actually an equilibrium outcome, right?	93.0	102.0
201607	636	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not about who’s causing the stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	637	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s us, right?	93.0	102.0
201607	638	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re the central bank, and the policies that we set and the decisions we make are what cause banks not to want to come to the discount window.	93.0	102.0
201607	639	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in thinking about stigma, I think we have to go back to what I understand the fundamental issues is: Do we think there is value in telling financial institutions that you should be getting your funding from the markets instead of coming to the central bank, or do we think that, no, in fact, we want the central bank to be your source of funding on a regular basis?	93.0	102.0
201607	640	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I know I’m being very loose in how I talk about that, but I do remember 2007.	93.0	102.0
201607	641	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we said, “The discount window is open, and come,” and no one came, I think the issue was really about the fact that banks understood that you weren’t supposed to come to the discount window unless you were in trouble.	93.0	102.0
201607	642	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so I think that when we say we want to reduce stigma, we might look maybe a little more inwardly and think harder about why it is that we developed that situation in the first place.	93.0	102.0
201607	643	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we had tried to change that through policy changes made before the crisis to reduce the stigma and make it an effective ceiling, but I agree with your point.	93.0	65.0
201607	644	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We hadn’t been successful before that, and that continued to prevail during the crisis.	93.0	65.0
201607	645	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with what you just said, but I remember in 2007, with then- Chairman Bernanke, it was almost like we had an announcement, along with balloons and free hot dogs and soda pop, saying, “Come to the discount window.	93.0	102.0
201607	646	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re open for business,” right?	93.0	102.0
201607	647	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then everyone said, “Not so much.”	93.0	102.0
201607	648	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the TAF, I think, was, in a way, successful in creating a different structure that somehow removed the stigma.	93.0	102.0
201607	649	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m just bringing out the issue that stigma seems to be something about which you can’t just say, “I want there to be no stigma.”	93.0	102.0
201607	650	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have to think about where the stigma came from.	93.0	102.0
201607	651	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	102.0
201607	652	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	93.0	65.0
201607	653	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	654	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll start by also complimenting the staff for their considerable effort and having a wide range of researchers engaged in the project.	93.0	81.0
201607	655	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I found that really useful.	93.0	81.0
201607	656	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	These memos provide a lot of useful material, particularly the money market field research.	93.0	81.0
201607	657	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think no matter what we do, the research that’s being done on this is going to be of lasting value for the System.	93.0	81.0
201607	658	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	A little side comment on “stigma” before we go on—I agree very much with President Williams’s observations that it’s an outcome.	93.0	81.0
201607	659	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If you think about wholly private market transactions, they also are subject to exactly the same thing, that if it’s revealed that Party A borrows at Rate X, that’s going to convey some information about the situation of Party A.	93.0	81.0
201607	660	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We had Citigroup paying exorbitant amounts to raise additional capital in 2008, and that reveals something to the markets about just how dire the situation was at Citi, and I think that’s unavoidable.	93.0	81.0
201607	661	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s part of the market outcome.	93.0	81.0
201607	662	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And the lesson that yields for me is that we are going to have to accommodate ourselves to some amount of stigma.	93.0	81.0
201607	663	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I approached this general subject of the long-range framework with a leaning toward, as I said before, a simple, straightforward floor system, in which the interest rate on reserves is our sole policy instrument.	93.0	81.0
201607	664	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And we supply just enough reserves to satiate the banking system with a fair, high degree of profitability and eschew targeting the federal funds rate or intervening in the RP market.	93.0	81.0
201607	665	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, I’m looking forward to the staff’s future work on this, and, as the Vice Chairman implored us, I’m retaining an open mind.	93.0	81.0
201607	666	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	93.0	81.0
201607	667	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m open to persuasion.	93.0	81.0
201607	668	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But what I’ve learned so far tilts me toward that preference.	93.0	81.0
201607	669	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Beyond my preference about this, I think that that simple regime is a useful benchmark, and I think the way to approach the analysis of this is to take that and then view any other framework as that plus some stuff.	93.0	81.0
201607	670	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And I’ll get back to this.	93.0	81.0
201607	671	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At a broad level, what I take away from this is that there are a wide range of considerations in money markets that affect market outcomes—the observed trading volumes and prices for various money market instruments.	93.0	81.0
201607	672	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The memos do a good job of documenting the array of regulatory factors.	93.0	81.0
201607	673	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I thought that was really useful, sort of a missing element in the overnight RRP discussions we had.	93.0	81.0
201607	674	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we had a sense that they were broad and pervasive and complicated, and I think that’s the picture that emerges.	93.0	81.0
201607	675	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, I was struck by the extent to which relationship considerations seem to affect many money market transactions, and I’m not sure I suspected they’d be as pervasive as they are.	93.0	81.0
201607	676	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Apparently, there are some money market funding deals that are bundled together with other financial transactions and occur between parties that establish a relationship and continue it for some time.	93.0	81.0
201607	677	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So there must be some economies of scope across financial transactions or maybe some fixed costs associated with establishing a relationship.	93.0	81.0
201607	678	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Well, in those cases, the observed transactions don’t represent arm’s-length Walrasian spot trades that are popular in our models, so it’s not obvious to me what it means to target a rate in a market governed by sort of relationship trades like that or whether it’s advisable.	93.0	81.0
201607	679	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I was also struck by the importance of counterparty credit risk.	93.0	81.0
201607	680	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In some markets, sometimes credit risk premiums are negligible or relatively stable outside of crisis periods, but some premiums arguably have been quite relevant to the federal funds market because there’s always been a noticeable dispersion of observed transaction rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	681	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	To me, this makes it tricky to think about targeting something like the average interest rate on federal funds when so many of the transactions build in some tiering or differential, what you’d interpret as credit risk premiums.	93.0	81.0
201607	682	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When counterparty credit risk premiums rise across a broad range of counterparties in that market, which arguably happened in August 2007, then you’d expect the credit risk premiums to rise, right?	93.0	81.0
201607	683	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And if risk-free rates don’t change, then the funds rate will rise.	93.0	81.0
201607	684	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we target the funds rate, if we feel as if we have to hold that constant, then we in essence have to lower what’s essentially the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	685	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, we often do find it appropriate to cut our policy rate at times when credit risk premiums go up, but it’s not obvious that should be automatically one-for-one, and that’s sort of what we imposed on the Desk in August 2007.	93.0	81.0
201607	686	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We were sort of cracking the whip, asking them to keep the average funds rate constant.	93.0	81.0
201607	687	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember that.	93.0	96.0
201607	688	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	93.0	96.0
201607	689	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes, you do.	93.0	81.0
201607	690	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	You were sitting right over there, getting some heat from the Committee about that in September.	93.0	81.0
201607	691	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And yet the situation was that we had these risk premiums rising, and so you had to drive down what was, in essence, the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	692	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So if we worked with an administered rate, then risk premiums do what they do and we make an explicit decision about how much to offset that with a move in the risk-free rate.	93.0	81.0
201607	693	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So, for me, as I said, just the welter of factors that affect various spreads and money markets make the simplicity of adopting an administered rate pretty attractive.	93.0	81.0
201607	694	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They also make me dubious about targeting any particular market rate or aiming our operations at any particular money market beyond this administered rate we have.	93.0	81.0
201607	695	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We have some experience now away from the lower bound.	93.0	81.0
201607	696	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It seems pretty clear that arbitrage among various parties does make the interest rate on excess reserves an effective anchor for other market rates.	93.0	81.0
201607	697	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think the interviews with money market participants confirm that.	93.0	81.0
201607	698	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we just relied on our administered rate, we’d avoid the dependence on the funds market, which could dwindle to nothing pretty rapidly.	93.0	81.0
201607	699	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We could avoid the cost of overnight RRP operations and sort of footprint concerns we’ve had.	93.0	81.0
201607	700	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The information in the staff memos suggests those are superfluous to the degree to which IOER is acting as an effective market anchor already.	93.0	81.0
201607	701	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, with a floor system and a large enough balance sheet to satiate reserves, overnight and intraday lending by us would be fairly minimal.	93.0	81.0
201607	702	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Daylight credit use would be fairly minimal, another advantage I think we need to count.	93.0	81.0
201607	703	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, as I said, I prefer that regime, but I’ll just say that I think if the staff brings back a recommendation for anything else, I think the burden of proof should be on demonstrating that going beyond that simple regime has some benefits.	93.0	81.0
201607	704	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Another way to put that as a question for the staff would be:  What would be wrong with that regime?	93.0	81.0
201607	705	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If we had money market rates configured the way they are, with us just running a simple IOER-based administered rate system, what would be wrong with the funds rate trading we’d see?	93.0	81.0
201607	706	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	What would be wrong with the RP rate?	93.0	81.0
201607	707	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	What would be wrong with money market rates that we’d need to correct by going in and targeting some other rate?	93.0	81.0
201607	708	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And I guess that’s the way to think about it.	93.0	81.0
201607	709	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s one wrinkle that detracts from a simple IOER-based administered rate regime that springs to mind.	93.0	81.0
201607	710	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The Congress gave the power to set the interest rate on excess reserves to the Board of Governors and not to the FOMC—in hindsight, arguably, a blunder.	93.0	81.0
201607	711	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	93.0	81.0
201607	712	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	It might not be the first by the Congress, but—so I’m okay for now with setting the target rate at the funds rate as an interim arrangement until we can get the Congress to fix the legislation.	93.0	81.0
201607	713	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But in response to President Williams’s point:  I think we shouldn’t be shy about deciding we’re going to seek some changes.	93.0	81.0
201607	714	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the meantime, this is sort of a messy aspect of the current framework because we really don’t care about the funds market per se, which is the point our Vice Chairman made.	93.0	81.0
201607	715	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But having an announced target for the funds rate kind of makes it seem like we do, and it’s an awkward aspect to the current regime, as I see it.	93.0	81.0
201607	716	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So in their analysis of alternative frameworks, I’d urge the staff to be candid about governance questions as they bring back their work to us.	93.0	81.0
201607	717	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Let me talk about “liquidity programs,” as they’re called.	93.0	81.0
201607	718	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One memo asks whether the framework should be designed to mitigate the tension between interest rate control and liquidity provision objectives.	93.0	81.0
201607	719	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	As I highlighted in response to President Bullard, in a simple floor system relying on just the interest rate on reserves, there is no tension between our monetary policy framework and liquidity programs.	93.0	81.0
201607	720	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, one of our former Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia colleagues used to oppose floor systems for exactly this reason, because they facilitated credit-market interventions.	93.0	81.0
201607	721	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In case you were wondering, I can assure you that the ease of undertaking credit-market interventions is not the reason I prefer a simple floor system.	93.0	81.0
201607	723	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This obviously isn’t the time to debate the merits of the various ways we intervened in credit markets during the crisis, but if the staff believes that there is a tension or a tradeoff between the ability to undertake liquidity programs and a monetary policy framework that they’d recommend, they’re going to have to come to us with some sense of the economic benefits and costs of such credit programs, and they haven’t done this in the materials they provide.	93.0	81.0
201607	724	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the memo on lessons from the crisis simply takes as an unquestioned premise that various credit market interventions were necessary.	93.0	81.0
201607	725	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They’re referred to as things we had to do in this situation.	93.0	81.0
201607	726	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This is consistent with some popular narratives that emphasize the inherent dysfunctionality in financial markets, but, as David Altig noted at the beginning of his remarks, scholars differ on the interpretation of the events of the crisis.	93.0	81.0
201607	727	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not aware of any economic analysis comparing this popular narrative with alternatives, including ones that emphasize the extent to which volatility and distress in financial markets in that period were induced by the moral hazard effects of the perceived Federal Reserve stance toward credit provisions, particularly following the August 2007 actions that President Williams so vividly described.	93.0	81.0
201607	728	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t conducted such an evaluation internally, and I’m not aware of any credible external assessment.	93.0	81.0
201607	729	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And without such a comparative assessment, I think the necessity of the sequence of credit market interventions we undertook in the crisis is far from obvious.	93.0	81.0
201607	730	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So if the staff believes that the merits of liquidity program capability should be taken into account in monetary framework design, it would seem essential that they take the time to conduct an after-action assessment of our policy choices before, during, and after the crisis, even if that means putting the next phase of the work on the long-run framework on hold.	93.0	81.0
201607	731	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In my view, this type of assessment is long overdue.	93.0	81.0
201607	732	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	81.0
201607	733	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	734	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	93.0	65.0
201607	735	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	736	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Let me start by also adding my sincere thanks to the Federal Reserve System staff for their leadership, insights, and sheer hard work on the implementation framework project.	93.0	999.0
201607	737	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the design of the project as focusing on the longer-run framework first, and then, presumably, we’ll consider the appropriate transition path to that framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	738	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Also, as Governor Fischer suggested, we’ll need to really think about how we address times that are not normal, or crisis periods.	93.0	999.0
201607	739	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’re going to have this further Committee discussion focusing on framework specifics in November, so I thought today I would just provide four questions I think the Committee participants will need to consider in evaluating specifics.	93.0	999.0
201607	740	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	First, how much volatility are we comfortable in tolerating for the policy instrument we’re targeting in normal times and then in times of stress?	93.0	999.0
201607	741	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Presumably, this is going to be one of the considerations in our preference for choosing an administered rate versus a market rate.	93.0	999.0
201607	742	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And if the choice is a market rate, which market rate?	93.0	999.0
201607	743	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	President Lacker, I take your discussion as very interesting about the administered rate avoiding some of the problems.	93.0	999.0
201607	744	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But, presumably, it’s the correlation between that rate and other market rates that is going to matter for what we’re doing.	93.0	999.0
201607	745	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we still have to understand how the money markets are going to be affected by our choices.	93.0	999.0
201607	746	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think our control of some interest rates may be different from the way it was in the past because of the structural and regulatory changes that occurred since the crisis, and I think the memos lay out some of those changes quite well.	93.0	999.0
201607	747	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The bottom line is, I think we have to be focused on:  How much does our control of certain interest rates imply for macro and financial stability?	93.0	999.0
201607	748	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think that’s something that we need to think about.	93.0	999.0
201607	749	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In crisis times, we may be willing to allow for more volatility, but what about periods when we don’t necessarily realize we’re at the beginning of a crisis?	93.0	999.0
201607	750	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I guess I view the case of 2007 and early 2008 as one in which it wasn’t necessarily clear at the time that the situation would develop into the crisis proportions that we saw ex post.	93.0	999.0
201607	751	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	A lot of this is in hindsight.	93.0	999.0
201607	752	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But when you’re actually in the moment, I think those tradeoffs between control and liquidity provision loomed large, but we didn’t necessarily know how things would turn out.	93.0	999.0
201607	753	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Second, how should the governance issues and political economy issues be resolved?	93.0	999.0
201607	754	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And a couple of the commenters have mentioned these.	93.0	999.0
201607	755	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The interest rate on excess reserves is set by the Board of Governors.	93.0	999.0
201607	756	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Monetary policy decisions lie with the FOMC.	93.0	999.0
201607	757	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So far, in the post-crisis world, we’ve resolved this tension by still using the federal funds rate as our way of communicating about monetary policy.	93.0	999.0
201607	758	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If we communicate with a market rate, presumably this helps resolve the issue.	93.0	999.0
201607	759	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The ON RRP rate also resolves the issue, because it’s an FOMC decision.	93.0	999.0
201607	760	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think these kinds of issues also affect the size of the balance sheet we want to operate with.	93.0	999.0
201607	761	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It does have implications for our relationship with the fiscal authority and perhaps a relationship of rates, like the ON RRP versus the IOER has “appearance” complications if we are going to be paying banks.	93.0	999.0
201607	762	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we have to take those kinds of political economy and governance issues head on, and they should factor into our decisions about the long-run framework.	93.0	999.0
201607	763	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Third, what’s our preference about the tradeoff between a framework that is complex enough to handle many possible contingencies versus one that’s similar and presumably less costly that works well in normal times but would need to be augmented in unusual times?	93.0	999.0
201607	764	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is related to but somewhat different, I think, from the staff memo’s definition of robust and flexible frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	765	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The staff defines a robust framework as one that can provide sufficient liquidity outside of the US banking system at times of market stress, and a flexible framework is one that can be adapted to handle evolving market conditions.	93.0	999.0
201607	766	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I have to say, my own preference is for a simpler framework that can be augmented with supplemental tools in times of crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	767	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But this simpler framework would need to have aspects of both robustness and flexibility.	93.0	999.0
201607	768	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In other words, the simpler framework is not likely to be the same one we used before the crisis.	93.0	999.0
201607	769	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In particular, because of the possibility that the equilibrium interest rate will remain lower than it was before the crisis and the probability of returning to the effective lower bound on the policy rate, which has probably increased, we should have a standard approach to providing more accommodation once the effective lower bound has been reached.	93.0	999.0
201607	770	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And I do think we’re going to have to deal with the changes that occurred in money markets, although I understand that our choice of framework then could feed back on some of those changes.	93.0	999.0
201607	771	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I think we need to really understand some of those issues, and the memo has pointed out quite well the kinds of issues we need to be thinking about.	93.0	999.0
201607	772	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think that the Desk has undertaken a useful step in expanding counterparties, but expanding the types of institutions to which we routinely provide liquidity directly could have its own effect on the evolution of financial market structure, as pointed out by Vice Chairman Dudley.	93.0	999.0
201607	773	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It could raise moral hazard problems, and we need to understand those better.	93.0	999.0
201607	774	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And, of course, we’re going to also have to think about operational readiness.	93.0	999.0
201607	775	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Presumably, even if we decide that our standard framework isn’t going to include a lot of these liquidity facilities or credit facilities or what have you, we’re going to have to maintain expertise in that.	93.0	999.0
201607	776	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I would welcome further discussion on the tradeoff between simpler versus complex frameworks.	93.0	999.0
201607	777	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, fourth, which framework design can best maintain the Federal Reserve’s long- standing desire to avoid allocating credit to particular market segments and displacing private- sector financial markets?	93.0	999.0
201607	778	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Maybe I’m channeling my former colleague from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, that an operating framework that puts no limit on the size of the balance sheet might make the Federal Reserve more vulnerable to political pressures that at times would be exerted to get the Federal Reserve to use the balance sheet to support certain markets.	93.0	999.0
201607	779	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And it also might lead to more structural changes in the financial markets that we are going to have to think about deeply as part of the discussion.	93.0	999.0
201607	780	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	There are lot of interrelated considerations.	93.0	999.0
201607	781	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I look forward to our discussion in November, and let me, once again, thank the staffs of the Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors for their efforts.	93.0	999.0
201607	782	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	999.0
201607	783	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	784	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	93.0	65.0
201607	785	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	90.0
201607	786	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I, too, would like to thank the staff for the thought-provoking memos on a long-run framework.	93.0	90.0
201607	787	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say the comments that have already been made around the table were more wide ranging than I was expecting, and that’s a very positive attribute.	93.0	90.0
201607	788	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I want to consider several assumptions that I believe are important in considering the long-run framework.	93.0	90.0
201607	789	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first is whether periods when the federal funds rate reaches its lower bound because of significant slack in the economy will be anomalous or a more common feature of a low inflation environment.	93.0	90.0
201607	790	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My view is that, as long as we have a low inflation target and a low equilibrium real interest rate, a funds rate at or near its bound will become a regular feature of business cycles.	93.0	90.0
201607	791	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This conclusion echoes comments by President Williams.	93.0	90.0
201607	792	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s been seven years since the end of the recession, and we have raised rates only once.	93.0	90.0
201607	793	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, we have yet to shrink our balance sheet.	93.0	90.0
201607	794	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because few recoveries last a decade, it is quite likely that when the next recession occurs, we will still have a large balance sheet and limited room to reduce the federal funds rate before reaching its lower bound.	93.0	90.0
201607	795	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to reduce the frequency with which we hit the effective lower bound would be to raise the inflation target.	93.0	90.0
201607	796	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the time that we set a 2 percent target, few of us would have predicted how many advanced economies would be facing long spells of negative rates, large balance sheets, and inflation rates below target.	93.0	90.0
201607	797	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should have a thorough discussion of the long-run implications of central banks around the world setting inflation targets that may result in the policy rate too often pinned at its lower bound.	93.0	90.0
201607	798	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I hope we have such an open discussion at the end of the year and that we revisit the inflation goal on a regular basis—perhaps every five years, as the Bank of Canada does.	93.0	90.0
201607	799	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it seems likely we choose to maintain a 2 percent inflation target, then we should choose a long-run framework that anticipates the federal funds rate regularly hitting its bound during recessions and allows us to respond flexibly in a manner that best achieves our dual-mandate goals.	93.0	90.0
201607	800	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the funds rate regularly hits zero during future recessions, my second concern is whether we will augment conventional policy with quantitative easing or with negative interest rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	801	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer expanding the balance sheet and possibly the composition of the balance sheet before resorting to negative interest rates.	93.0	90.0
201607	802	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The early assessment of the costs and efficacy of negative interest rates is quite mixed.	93.0	90.0
201607	803	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Most central banks that have gone negative have taken actions to help insulate banks from some of the collateral effects from that policy.	93.0	90.0
201607	804	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the concern about bailouts of banks in the United States, it’s unlikely that policies that insulate banks will be politically feasible in the United States.	93.0	90.0
201607	805	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful to have a fuller discussion of negative interest rates and whether it’s likely to be employed as a policy response to future recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	806	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given our reluctance to raise the inflation target, expanded balance sheets are likely to be a regular feature of recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	807	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, any policy we adopt should flexibly incorporate the need to expand the balance sheet and to change both the duration and composition of holdings.	93.0	90.0
201607	808	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree with President Williams that we should consider asking for a broader set of assets that can be held, along lines similar to the practice of other central banks.	93.0	90.0
201607	809	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If an expanded balance sheet is a regular feature of future policy, we may want to expand our thinking on how we use our balance sheet.	93.0	90.0
201607	810	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, if we decide that supervisory policies are unlikely to be effective for addressing bubbles in real estate, we may want to more actively consider whether to use our balance sheet to address such situations.	93.0	90.0
201607	811	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the face of rising real estate leverage and prices, we might choose to raise rates in this sector by shortening the duration of our holdings and selling some of our MBS.	93.0	90.0
201607	812	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, for this financial stability tool to be possible, we would need to hold long-duration assets and MBS.	93.0	90.0
201607	813	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I would not assume that in the future we will have a small balance sheet that is limited to short-duration Treasury securities.	93.0	90.0
201607	814	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many of us now assume that the equilibrium federal funds rate will be around 3 percent.	93.0	90.0
201607	815	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, we have reduced interest rates more than 3 percentage points in response to most recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	816	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, in those instances, we did not hit the effective lower bound because inflation and the real equilibrium rate were higher.	93.0	90.0
201607	817	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, for the future, we should assume that we will likely hit the effective lower bound, that we will resort to some balance sheet expansion, and, thus, we will need to control short-term interest rates for the foreseeable future and during most recessions.	93.0	90.0
201607	818	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I, somewhat surprisingly, agree with President Lacker on one issue.	93.0	90.0
201607	819	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to focus on the IOER, an administered rate, but I also agree that that rate should be an FOMC decision.	93.0	90.0
201607	820	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, the staff should continue to explore how to be flexible in a situation of a changing structure of our financial system.	93.0	90.0
201607	821	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In particular, the platforms of both political parties are calling for readopting Glass-Steagall restrictions.	93.0	90.0
201607	822	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If that were to occur, we would once again have large standalone broker-dealers that would likely be viewed as SIFIs regulated by the Federal Reserve.	93.0	90.0
201607	823	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Having large standalone broker-dealers implies a greater likelihood of runs on them and calls into question whether the financing system can remain as dependent on repurchase agreements.	93.0	90.0
201607	824	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, we are requiring financial institutions to be more liquid, and justifiably so.	93.0	90.0
201607	825	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there are limited quantities of high-quality liquid assets.	93.0	90.0
201607	826	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Better understanding how our supervisory actions, in trying to increase liquidity in financial institutions, affect demand for short-term money market instruments would be useful.	93.0	90.0
201607	827	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, broker-dealers tend to be highly sensitive to economic conditions.	93.0	90.0
201607	828	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many of the European banks with large broker-dealers operate in the United States and remain troubled to this day.	93.0	90.0
201607	829	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The continued dependence on broker-dealers as counterparties raises the issue of whether the discount window should be available to them to address liquidity issues or whether a more substantive change in their funding model is in order.	93.0	90.0
201607	830	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fourth, the money market fund industry continues to evolve.	93.0	90.0
201607	831	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This has implications for financial institutions’ ready access to market for short-term liabilities.	93.0	90.0
201607	832	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the incentives to shift to government-only funds, the demand for high-quality liquid assets will increase further.	93.0	90.0
201607	833	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The issues raised by the staff were very useful.	93.0	90.0
201607	834	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I would like to see us and the staff spend more time discussing some of these key issues.	93.0	90.0
201607	835	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	836	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	93.0	65.0
201607	837	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	110.0
201607	838	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you to the team around the System that worked on this project.	93.0	110.0
201607	839	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just make a couple of comments that struck me after reading through the papers, understanding these are early days.	93.0	110.0
201607	840	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Regulatory reform, I think, has certainly reduced the probability of financial crises and limited their potential severity.	93.0	110.0
201607	841	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	However, it also probably has reduced incentives for arbitrage in money markets and may introduce some frictions that make money markets work less smoothly, therefore possibly increasing the need for liquidity actions by the Federal Reserve.	93.0	110.0
201607	842	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	A combination of on-the-shelf liquidity facilities and the ON RRP may be needed to ensure future money market functionality and interest rate control in a potential future crisis.	93.0	110.0
201607	843	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So far, the ON RRP facility has helped limit shortfalls and volatility in money markets, and the risk that it might have exacerbated flights to quality really has not materialized.	93.0	110.0
201607	844	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For example, we didn’t see it in January and February of this year, and we haven’t seen it following the Brexit vote.	93.0	110.0
201607	845	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Nevertheless, because crises can hit at unexpected times and in unexpected ways—and, by definition, are surprises that you don’t expect—I do feel strongly that we should do more work on having on-the-shelf liquidity facilities that could help limit the severity of market stress episodes and help address one potential downside of an ON RRP facility.	93.0	110.0
201607	846	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In my view, in that crisis it may well be necessary to assist, in particular, the money market industry, dealers, and nonbank financials.	93.0	110.0
201607	847	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On slide 13 of the briefing materials, the points 2 and 3 that you made are, to me, a couple of the reasons why I would like to have on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	848	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Number one, I think if there’s clarity about the purpose of such operations, it does reduce stigma.	93.0	110.0
201607	849	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in particular, it’s important to emphasize that this is about the provision of liquidity versus emergency lending to individual firms.	93.0	110.0
201607	850	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe that if our communications are well prepared and explain what those facilities are designed for, we won’t eliminate stigma but should help reduce it.	93.0	110.0
201607	851	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, your point about clarity on when liquidity insurance operations would be used—to limit contagion during stress events—is a very key one and is another reason to have on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	852	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would add two other reasons for having on-the-shelf facilities.	93.0	110.0
201607	853	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One, it allows you to move quickly, and, two, when you are in a crisis is not the time to be thinking through and making up provisions and mechanisms to deal with the situation.	93.0	110.0
201607	854	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, I’d rather we did this in advance in the cold light of day rather than on the run.	93.0	110.0
201607	855	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I think we have the opportunity to do that, so I would encourage you to do more work on this.	93.0	110.0
201607	856	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I understand the risk that it may appear to create or induce an overreliance on the Fed, and there are some political sensitivities associated with that.	93.0	110.0
201607	857	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But this work is very, very important, and I think history has shown that we ought to have these facilities in place with our communication well established in advance.	93.0	110.0
201607	858	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I encourage you to do more work on this.	93.0	110.0
201607	859	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	93.0	110.0
201607	860	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	93.0	65.0
201607	861	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	93.0	65.0
201607	862	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201607	863	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to thank all of the contributors to the long-run framework working groups who presented here today.	93.0	91.0
201607	864	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The first installment has been an impressive effort, and I learned a lot from reading the memos and discussing them with my staff.	93.0	91.0
201607	865	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The presentations clearly point to a number of tradeoffs that will be associated with choosing among alternative implementation structures.	93.0	91.0
201607	866	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Before I forget, I agree with the comments that President Williams and President Rosengren made, that the implications of the probability of hitting the effective lower bound should be considered within the context of our long-run framework discussions.	93.0	91.0
201607	867	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it is certainly the case that the choice of our inflation objective is part of that, in terms of how low interest rates will be during normal times and how much capacity we have to lower rates when we need to do so.	93.0	91.0
201607	868	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to say at this point that I remain open minded, no matter what I say after this.	93.0	91.0
201607	869	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	93.0	91.0
201607	870	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I am not strongly wed to many prior views on the long-run framework, and it’s simply useful for each of us to push, in our own way, harder on all of the framework presentations.	93.0	91.0
201607	871	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	So, in that spirit, I will continue.	93.0	91.0
201607	872	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not sure this isn’t just nostalgia for the old days, but I do confess some sympathies for returning to our pre-crisis framework with a small balance sheet, or at least a smaller balance sheet than we have.	93.0	91.0
201607	873	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	At least during normal times, it served us well and in ways that we probably still don’t fully appreciate, at least I think when it comes to minimizing political risks that we previously never considered.	93.0	91.0
201607	874	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	A fundamental question for me is this:  Do the changes in financial markets that we have experienced over the past several years make it clearly undesirable to return to the “old world”?	93.0	91.0
201607	875	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ll describe it that way.	93.0	91.0
201607	876	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that there are numerous details that complicate this return to a more conservative, old-style monetary approach.	93.0	91.0
201607	877	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, we will have to determine if changes in regulation and business practices have had a lasting and unalterable effect on reserve demand and overnight funding markets in general.	93.0	91.0
201607	878	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And, in turn, there are many interactions and interdependencies involved in analyzing this and other important questions.	93.0	91.0
201607	879	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m looking forward to hearing more about the strengths and weaknesses across alternative frameworks, both during normal times and during periods of stress.	93.0	91.0
201607	880	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our ability to achieve our set of macroeconomic outcomes is the most important piece of this decision tree, it seems to me.	93.0	91.0
201607	881	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe it’s the easiest.	93.0	91.0
201607	882	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The social benefits of reducing deadweight losses in some markets might be more uncertain and controversial with respect to possible unexpected outcomes that I just can’t lay out today, because I don’t know that we know them.	93.0	91.0
201607	883	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Again, here is that caveat.	93.0	91.0
201607	884	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I remain open minded, but I am wondering about the following risk.	93.0	91.0
201607	885	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s not just the economics that are difficult.	93.0	91.0
201607	886	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The decisions that we make about the implementation framework will be scrutinized from a political economy perspective as well, and I think President Mester touched on a number of these issues.	93.0	91.0
201607	887	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Inevitably, we will need to consider the possibility that not all of our tools will be available in the future.	93.0	91.0
201607	888	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, you mentioned that there are already “optics” concerns related to the IOER rate being above a market rate.	93.0	91.0
201607	889	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The Congress has wondered whether that is something of a subsidy to certain financial institutions.	93.0	91.0
201607	890	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, large IOER payments to banks may not always be seen as “living the Friedman rule” and reducing regulatory reserve burdens.	93.0	91.0
201607	891	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I worry about the possibility that, when rates increase and get closer to neutral, when we finally do normalize, if we still have a large balance sheet, the size of IOER payments going out to banks may become a political lightning rod.	93.0	91.0
201607	892	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Should we select a best framework or most robust framework, subject to achieving a number of objectives that we specify?	93.0	91.0
201607	893	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to hearing more about this.	93.0	91.0
201607	894	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our previous small-balance-sheet approach may seem 20th century, “old school,” and opaque.	93.0	91.0
201607	895	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But I wonder if those tools and authorities might be more robust to changes in political winds.	93.0	91.0
201607	896	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m just wondering.	93.0	91.0
201607	897	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate the long-run framework project’s commitment to a broad, open, and robust process that considers the issues from many vantage points.	93.0	91.0
201607	898	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It will help us understand important tradeoffs and move us toward adopting an implementation framework that will serve the institution well in years to come.	93.0	91.0
201607	899	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I expect to learn more, and I remain open minded about selecting the best appropriate framework for the years ahead.	93.0	91.0
201607	900	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	91.0
201607	901	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	902	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	93.0	65.0
201607	903	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201607	904	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, would like to add my thanks to the workgroups’ very thorough work products for today’s discussion.	93.0	88.0
201607	905	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While I think the framework in place today seems to be working well for monetary control purposes, I do support this effort devoting time and resources to thinking ahead, exploring options, and, importantly, anticipating various states of the world in which the Committee might be making policy.	93.0	88.0
201607	906	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I do think we have time to do this exercise in a very deliberate way.	93.0	88.0
201607	907	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t have a lean yet.	93.0	88.0
201607	908	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m processing the information in the memos at a somewhat more basic point of consideration.	93.0	88.0
201607	909	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I found the three memos helpful in teasing out what seemed to me to be the first-order pertinent questions.	93.0	88.0
201607	910	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Some of my questions may suggest further work and attention, so here’s what’s on my mind, informed by the memos.	93.0	88.0
201607	911	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Realistically, can we get back to a corridor system and preserve the federal funds rate as a centerpiece of policy setting?	93.0	88.0
201607	912	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Will reserves be scarce or plentiful down the road?	93.0	88.0
201607	913	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If we take as a given the fact that depository institutions will want to hold a higher level of reserves, will their target level reserves vary with changing conditions?	93.0	88.0
201607	914	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And, if so, how?	93.0	88.0
201607	915	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Will the expanded number of counterparties that we now have be a permanent aspect of the operating framework?	93.0	88.0
201607	916	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And if we were to go further, what classes of institutions would we want to include?	93.0	88.0
201607	917	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	What are the benefits and negatives of expanding the range of collateral instruments?	93.0	88.0
201607	918	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If we want to preserve a market rate as the policy rate, how viable is the federal funds rate as a policy instrument?	93.0	88.0
201607	919	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Are the overnight interbank funding rate, which is an unsecured instrument, and/or the GC repo rate, a secured instrument, workable alternatives as a market rate?	93.0	88.0
201607	920	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And do these rates require expanding the number of counterparties?	93.0	88.0
201607	921	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	More generally, what distinguishes one money market rate from another as a potential policy rate?	93.0	88.0
201607	922	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding arbitrage behavior, what can be assumed to be reliable on an ongoing basis?	93.0	88.0
201607	923	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to understand better what incentives and disincentives are associated with regulation as they affect arbitrage opportunities.	93.0	88.0
201607	924	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And, finally, a broader question is suggested by commentary that comes on pages 9 and 10 of the memo “Lessons from the Crisis”	93.0	88.0
201607	925	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	: What conclusions can we draw regarding the features of the US environment that will shape implementation practices?	93.0	88.0
201607	926	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we might gain from an attempt to work back from the environment or the context of policy to the operating framework options and choices.	93.0	88.0
201607	927	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We tend to think of environment features in terms of the structure of money markets and the regulatory picture.	93.0	88.0
201607	928	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As others have raised, including President Evans just before me, I’ll suggest that we might also think about the political support for operating in different ways.	93.0	88.0
201607	929	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As I see it, there is likely to be political pressure on the IOER rate as an instrument.	93.0	88.0
201607	930	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like also to suggest that, as we move this exercise forward, thought be given at some point to the requirements of transition from the current regime to another and to the communications challenges involved.	93.0	88.0
201607	931	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, while these were prepared in advance, I will freelance for just one moment, perhaps responding to Governor Fischer and something that President Williams said, about our regime that will probably work in normal times, with many different versions of it.	93.0	88.0
201607	932	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But I think the times also call for perhaps thinking well outside the box.	93.0	88.0
201607	933	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So to borrow from a different discipline—maybe a little bit of a “Herman Kahn” approach to thinking about the unthinkable— we’re in an era in which it’s not unthinkable that a terrorist act or cyberwarfare could severely affect the operating environment of the Federal Reserve.	93.0	88.0
201607	934	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I would encourage some work on thinking about scenarios that are really extreme and how we would respond to those scenarios.	93.0	88.0
201607	935	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	88.0
201607	936	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	937	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	93.0	65.0
201607	938	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	939	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m going to begin with a procedural point, which picks up on some of the things John said earlier.	93.0	97.0
201607	940	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we have to find a way to explore a variety of ideas here, some of which may be pretty innovative and some of which may be pretty far reaching, without committing anybody ex ante to any particular direction.	93.0	97.0
201607	941	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is hard to do that in this room because discussions here have a tendency to either acquire a certain direction or acquire a certain oppositional quality whereby it seems as though something is being debated.	93.0	97.0
201607	942	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, like President Williams, I see neither the need nor the desirability of rushing to some sort of answer.	93.0	97.0
201607	943	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think that we’re going to need to figure out a way to have an exploration of both a lot of the substantive issues people have raised as well as a blue-skying of ideas that takes place outside this room but in a way that is accessible to people in the room who are currently in the room and who may be able to participate.	93.0	97.0
201607	944	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This can happen through the Jackson Hole symposium and other conferences.	93.0	97.0
201607	945	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It might be able to happen informally.	93.0	97.0
201607	946	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that’s important, because we don’t want to force the staff to either come back only with incremental ideas because they feel it’s not their place to change things fundamentally or to force them to come back with something that’s quite far-reaching, and then for us to say, “Who are you guys to be coming to us with something far reaching like this?”	93.0	97.0
201607	947	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So some sort of iterative process in between, I think, is actually important.	93.0	97.0
201607	948	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me now just identify, as a number of other people have, some of the issues that I think are particularly useful, interesting, or important, or all three, to pursue during this process.	93.0	97.0
201607	949	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	At the very top of that list I will echo Presidents Evans, Rosengren, and Williams in saying that how to think about accommodation in a low-for-long environment is, I think, essential to this exercise, and if it doesn’t address that question, it probably hasn’t succeeded.	93.0	97.0
201607	950	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Other things I’m going to mention now I think are important, but without that first element, it’s a little hard to see why we would have gone through the whole thing to being with.	93.0	97.0
201607	951	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Next, I would say, how to adjust monetary policy to the better regulation of financial institutions and activities that have been put in place since the crisis is actually very important.	93.0	97.0
201607	952	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And in this respect, I would recommend—I know the staff knows about it, because they’ve read it—to the Committee generally a paper on monetary policy and regulation put out, I think, Vice Chairman Dudley, was it a year ago May, by the Committee on the Global Financial System?	93.0	97.0
201607	953	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	93.0	96.0
201607	954	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it was put out in May 2015.	93.0	97.0
201607	955	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is that when it was?	93.0	97.0
201607	956	2016-07-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes, last year—“Regulatory Change and Monetary Policy,” paper number 54.	93.0	999.0
201607	957	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	93.0	97.0
201607	958	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It was, I thought, a very nuanced assessment of how the necessary changes in regulation will need to be accommodated by monetary policies throughout the world, and it was done principally by people from the monetary policy side of shops.	93.0	97.0
201607	959	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It wasn’t done by regulators, which I think is one of the things that made it useful.	93.0	97.0
201607	960	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, we were lucky that our participant was someone from the Division of Monetary Affairs, but someone who knew a lot about regulation, and I think other central banks were able to do the same, which is why it has a nuanced feel to it.	93.0	97.0
201607	961	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In that regard, I would note that the maximum lubrication of the policy transmission system that monetary policy people sometimes talk about as desirable is actually, if not quite the same thing, very close to the same thing as the massive amounts of short-term wholesale funding that support unexamined credit positions and runs at the first real signs of trouble.	93.0	97.0
201607	962	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why the regulation and monetary policy decisions need to be thought of at the same time.	93.0	97.0
201607	963	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	You can’t just think, “Well, we want maximum transmission so that we can get monetary policy through in these very liquid markets” without realizing that it’s those very liquid markets that freeze up when things start to go awry, which leads me to the concept of “liquidity insurance.”	93.0	97.0
201607	964	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I know that is not a term coined by the staff, but it is a pregnant term, which immediately elicited in me the question, “And who exactly is paying the premiums for that liquidity insurance?”	93.0	97.0
201607	965	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And the answer, of course, is not really anybody in some of the countries that the staff was referring to, except insofar as you accept the proposition that being part of a regulatory system is in and of itself a premium, a case pretty hard to make on the basis of the existing state of the financial system.	93.0	97.0
201607	966	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would note in this regard that the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the two countries correctly cited as having some of the more fulsome liquidity facilities, are also two of the jurisdictions that have what we might term “unusually large” financial systems, given their GDPs.	93.0	97.0
201607	967	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think it’s difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is necessary for the central bank to be a very generous lender of last resort in order to sustain what some might characterize as outsized financial systems.	93.0	97.0
201607	968	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This leads to some of the questions that Vice Chairman Dudley was suggesting a moment ago as well about our own financial system, which, although it’s not as outsized relative to our GDP as is the case in either the United Kingdom or certainly the old Switzerland, is still pretty outsized in comparison with the rest of the world.	93.0	97.0
201607	969	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that does get us thinking, as Vice Chairman Dudley said, about the layers of intermediation that take place, but also the kind of things that we want to be backing up, as it were.	93.0	97.0
201607	970	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I actually was a bit bemused by President Lacker’s suggestion that it was moral hazard that created the problems during the crisis.	93.0	97.0
201607	971	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would very much agree with the proposition that moral hazard in the years preceding the crisis led to the conditions that created all of these runs.	93.0	97.0
201607	972	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Personally, I subscribe to the view that when you’re in the middle of a crisis is not the time to create bulwarks against moral hazard.	93.0	97.0
201607	973	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s what you do when things have calmed down.	93.0	97.0
201607	974	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But that is something that we need to be thinking about.	93.0	97.0
201607	975	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And it’s the reason why I have been more skeptical than a lot of you—although, judging by today, I have more allies than I might have feared, and I’m glad to hear that—about always wanting more powers in the central banks to be able to create liquidity, because there is a time-consistency problem that is created when you have those powers, and that’s why it’s a difficult set of issues.	93.0	97.0
201607	976	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That pushes me to the existence, size, and use of the balance sheet, which I think is in the first instance an analytic question.	93.0	97.0
201607	977	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, there’s a positive analysis to be done before the normative analysis comes through.	93.0	97.0
201607	978	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a week ago Friday and had this very interesting experience in which I had breakfast at Harvard University and lunch at MIT.	93.0	97.0
201607	979	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And so at Harvard University, led by Jeremy Stein, as many of you would have guessed, I very much got the demand for safe assets:  “You know, they’re being privately created right now, so the Federal Reserve should think about creating public safe assets” and all the rest—the full dose of that.	93.0	97.0
201607	980	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then a mere two stops down the Red Line, in Kendall Square, I got the exact opposite view, which is, “It is a very dangerous thing for the central bank to be creating safe assets.	93.0	97.0
201607	981	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, a lot of the so-called demand for safe assets will actually dissipate.”	93.0	97.0
201607	982	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	If they could meet in Central Square and have the debate, that would be fun to watch.	93.0	97.0
201607	983	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, analytically, I do think we need to pay attention to that issue because whatever our normative predispositions, if there is, indeed, a substantial exogenous demand for money like our safe assets that is going to be privately created, we have to take that into account not just for regulatory purposes, but also when thinking about the transmission of monetary policy.	93.0	97.0
201607	984	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And if we come to that analytic conclusion, we may or may not decide that we want to do something with the balance sheet, as Jeremy Stein would have us do to create safe assets, but we at least need to take that into account.	93.0	97.0
201607	985	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then as President Rosengren said—so I won’t repeat it at any length—it’s conceivable that you’d also use the balance sheet for monetary policy purposes, with a sort of twist–reverse twist kind of mechanism.	93.0	97.0
201607	986	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s worth exploring as well.	93.0	97.0
201607	987	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And finally, an issue that I don’t think anyone has mentioned to this point is that I do think it’s worth paying some attention to the unique role of the dollar in the global economy and thinking about how we fashion our monetary policy framework.	93.0	97.0
201607	988	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It occurred to me in the first instance as I was reading the memo on foreign central bank frameworks.	93.0	97.0
201607	989	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I said, “Wait a second.	93.0	97.0
201607	990	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is very interesting, but, man, oh, man, this would not work for us, because you’ve got people holding dollar assets as currency reserves all around the world.”	93.0	97.0
201607	991	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I do think it would be worth specifically addressing the question of the degree to which the role of the dollar as the principal global reserve currency both affects us in the effectiveness of monetary policy decisions that we would make—this is back to global savings kinds of issues—and, in turn, affects other people, which has a kind of feedback effect on the performance of the macroeconomy.	93.0	97.0
201607	992	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	97.0
201607	993	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	994	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	93.0	65.0
201607	995	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	111.0
201607	996	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll just make four quick points.	93.0	111.0
201607	997	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	First, let me add my voice to all those who came before in encouraging the staff to do work looking at the effective lower bound.	93.0	111.0
201607	998	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that’s paramount, as others have said.	93.0	111.0
201607	999	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I know you were planning to do it anyway, but I think it’s important.	93.0	111.0
201607	1000	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Second, I’m interested in the staff’s view on some of these on-the-shelf or off-the-shelf tools.	93.0	111.0
201607	1001	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	How often would you expect that we would use them?	93.0	111.0
201607	1002	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	To me this goes right to the core of both stigma and moral hazard.	93.0	111.0
201607	1003	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I view stigma and moral hazard as closely linked.	93.0	111.0
201607	1004	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we have tools that are used frequently, they’re going to have low stigma and potentially increase moral hazard.	93.0	111.0
201607	1005	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Tools that are used infrequently, the opposite.	93.0	111.0
201607	1006	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Would you envision us using these tools in the ordinary course of events every year, every 10 years, every 100 years?	93.0	111.0
201607	1007	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m just interested in getting your perspective on that.	93.0	111.0
201607	1008	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And this is linked to something that Vice Chairman Dudley said, which was, “Would the crisis have been less severe if we had more of these tools ready to go?”	93.0	111.0
201607	1009	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m not sure.	93.0	111.0
201607	1010	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When I think back to my experience during the crisis, when people asked me to reflect on our performance, let’s say, the government entirely—the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, et cetera— the criticism that I offer is that we were always late because, in connection with Loretta’s point, we didn’t know how bad the crisis was, and we were reluctant interveners.	93.0	111.0
201607	1011	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll give you one example.	93.0	111.0
201607	1012	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Just take the TARP, as the most extreme example.	93.0	111.0
201607	1013	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When the Congress passed the TARP, it was about two weeks to when we announced the capital injections, and about a month later we actually had money going into banks.	93.0	111.0
201607	1014	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But it had been sitting on the shelf as a concept for eight months until Bernanke and Paulson said, “Now we finally have to go to the Congress.”	93.0	111.0
201607	1015	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So the delay was not the implementation.	93.0	111.0
201607	1016	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The biggest delay was us having the will to say “We need to do this.”	93.0	111.0
201607	1017	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So it affects, for me, how I think about tools on the shelf.	93.0	111.0
201607	1018	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Is it the time to implement the tool or the time to make the decision to use the tool that ultimately is the delay?	93.0	111.0
201607	1019	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And then the last point I’ll make, because I think we should be humble about our ability to forecast the future, is that if we had gone back 20 or 30 years ago and asked the Federal Reserve System to design tools that would have been useful in 2008, there’s no chance they would have come up with the right set of tools that ended up being implemented in 2008 because the markets evolved.	93.0	111.0
201607	1020	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That tells me that we should err toward simplicity but flexibility to give future participants the tools they need to design tools in the moment, because we’re probably not going to be able to design them right now.	93.0	111.0
201607	1021	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	93.0	111.0
201607	1022	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1023	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	93.0	65.0
201607	1024	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201607	1025	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I want to join others in complimenting the staff on this very interesting set of memos.	93.0	104.0
201607	1026	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	These are tremendously interesting and important questions.	93.0	104.0
201607	1027	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Of course, for those of us who were here, it takes us back to a set of discussions we had in 2013 and 2014, which led up to the adoption of those principles in September 2014, which I’ll come back to in a second.	93.0	104.0
201607	1028	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I think we’re in a different situation now.	93.0	104.0
201607	1029	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The questions we’re asking now really don’t need to be answered.	93.0	104.0
201607	1030	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s a great discussion to have, but I don’t see the wisdom in driving this to conclusions at this point.	93.0	104.0
201607	1031	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I think we have a lot to learn over years to come and reasons to gain from that experience.	93.0	104.0
201607	1032	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The Policy Normalization Principles and Plans were published by the Committee in September 2014, and it’s a reasonably detailed, if not fully worked out, formulation, nor could it have been fully worked out.	93.0	104.0
201607	1033	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I’d say that that framework works pretty well, and, on the basis of the one rate increase we’ve executed so far, we have decent rate control.	93.0	104.0
201607	1034	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But I do think it’s likely to prove vulnerable over time and not just in times of crisis.	93.0	104.0
201607	1035	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The September 2014 principles were wise enough to conclude with the observation that “the Committee is prepared to adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization in light of economic and financial developments,” and that is one principle that I suggest it would be wise to honor.	93.0	104.0
201607	1036	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The note on foreign experience does show that other central banks have used a range of different frameworks to control policy rates:  floor and corridor systems, targeting secured and unsecured rates using administered rates, as well as market rates.	93.0	104.0
201607	1037	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think we do have plenty of flexibility in choosing our own long-run framework—and should feel free to pick one that is tailored to our own institutional setting and that will work in different conditions, particularly at the effective lower bound, both for administering monetary policy and for providing liquidity.	93.0	104.0
201607	1038	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The arbitrage trade that currently sets the federal funds rate, as we all know, is between the Federal Home Loan Banks and the foreign banks, essentially, and that trade could easily go away—for example, if the Federal Home Loan Banks exit the market like Fannie and Freddie did or if regulation or some other factor makes the trade less profitable for FBOs.	93.0	104.0
201607	1039	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More broadly, unsecured borrowing between financial institutions is in secular decline.	93.0	104.0
201607	1040	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So if we were choosing a reference rate to last for a long time, which happens to be exactly what we’re doing on the LIBOR project, the federal funds rate would probably fail the fundamental design criterion of sustainability.	93.0	104.0
201607	1041	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The money market memo points out that there may be a secular increase in reserve demand due to heightened liquidity expectations for banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1042	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If that is so, reserves could become scarcer than expected.	93.0	104.0
201607	1043	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I still suspect that scarcity is a very, very long way off.	93.0	104.0
201607	1044	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Also, higher demands for reserves may or may not translate into higher trading volumes in interbank markets.	93.0	104.0
201607	1045	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And let me add that I don’t see higher trading volumes between banks in federal funds as something that we need to have.	93.0	104.0
201607	1046	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For these reasons, I have growing doubts, actually, that the best long-run solution will be to return to a corridor system targeting the federal funds rate as set through scarcity trades between banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1047	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ve really been in a floor system for eight years now.	93.0	104.0
201607	1048	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s, to me, very likely that it will remain so for some years.	93.0	104.0
201607	1049	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That system has worked.	93.0	104.0
201607	1050	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Markets are now used to it, and it may well be that the better long-run approach will be to continue with a floor system, albeit with a much smaller balance sheet, which can be done if only because markets will have known nothing else for probably well over a decade.	93.0	104.0
201607	1051	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It may also be appropriate to target a secured rate, as secured borrowing does not appear to be in secular decline, and it involves a much wider set of participants.	93.0	104.0
201607	1052	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The overnight bank funding rate is an unsecured rate that represents a middle ground and captures a broader range of transactions and counterparties, and it’s an improvement over the federal funds rate, but it’s still subject to the secular decline in unsecured interbank borrowing.	93.0	104.0
201607	1053	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I will add that I’m also among the open minded when it comes to deciding whether to choose an administered rate versus a market rate.	93.0	104.0
201607	1054	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning to liquidity for a second, the memos show clearly, in my view, that the pre-crisis toolkit did not contemplate, and was not designed to address, the run dynamics that arose during the crisis.	93.0	104.0
201607	1055	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Policymakers improvised, acted on the fly.	93.0	104.0
201607	1056	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And I believe history will judge those efforts as a success achieved under extremely trying conditions.	93.0	104.0
201607	1057	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	There is an understandable desire to avoid having to live through all of that improvisation again and, in that spirit, to keep some or all of the crisis liquidity programs close at hand and in working order.	93.0	104.0
201607	1058	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For now, most of the crisis-era liquidity programs have been wound down.	93.0	104.0
201607	1059	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	One could think of them as being unplugged and in dry storage, except for the swap lines with the five other central banks.	93.0	104.0
201607	1060	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The memos ask whether these programs should be active parts of the framework or instead on the shelf.	93.0	104.0
201607	1061	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I feel like I have a lot to learn on that and, again, am open minded.	93.0	104.0
201607	1062	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I guess, for the most part, I lean toward the idea of keeping them off the shelf rather than right at the edge of the game or part of the framework, which might require investing a lot of resources to keep them operational, but there could be exceptions to that.	93.0	104.0
201607	1063	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In particular, I could imagine a role for the TAF, which would be to provide liquidity to a range of banks in the ordinary course and over time perhaps reduce the stigma associated with the use of the discount window.	93.0	104.0
201607	1064	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I believe we continue to do a good job over time of explaining and defending our traditional lender-of-last-resort role—not so much expanding it but sustaining it—and that role needs to work in the context of financial markets that continue to evolve ever further from the traditional bank-based model.	93.0	104.0
201607	1065	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A wider set of counterparties would provide a more resilient framework and money market system.	93.0	104.0
201607	1066	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	As the financial crisis gradually recedes into memory, I hope that we’ll find more receptive external audiences for that view.	93.0	104.0
201607	1067	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I do also recognize the tradeoff with moral hazard and look forward to hearing more on that.	93.0	104.0
201607	1068	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, while this exercise is a worthwhile one, there’s no need to make decisions that will be better made several years down the road.	93.0	104.0
201607	1069	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And there will be a benefit in not making decisions until we see how markets evolve over time—in particular, adapting to the new regulatory regime.	93.0	104.0
201607	1070	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	104.0
201607	1071	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1072	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	93.0	65.0
201607	1073	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201607	1074	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I appreciate the very high-quality and voluminous material [laughter] that the staff is developing to help inform these policy deliberations, and I’m guessing that all of the comments that we’re making today will lead to even more voluminous material.	93.0	107.0
201607	1075	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s always tempting as policymakers to hark back to an era of greater simplicity with fewer tools.	93.0	107.0
201607	1076	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I think it would be a mistake if we succumbed prematurely to that temptation without carefully assessing the complex nature of the challenges we are facing today and are likely to face in the future in order to fulfill our statutory responsibilities.	93.0	107.0
201607	1077	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the financial markets in particular have evolved considerably and are likely to continue doing so.	93.0	107.0
201607	1078	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s analysis highlights the role of regulation.	93.0	107.0
201607	1079	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think this needs to be further explored.	93.0	107.0
201607	1080	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I also want to make sure that we’re taking into account the role of technology, which is already affecting the wholesale financial markets and changing market structure and is likely to do more of that.	93.0	107.0
201607	1081	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We certainly saw that in the Treasury securities markets in October 2014, and we’re likely to see more disintermediation and changes in market structure associated with technology.	93.0	107.0
201607	1082	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also would highlight, as others have done, that it’s important to take into account the likelihood that we find ourselves in a lower neutral rate environment for a protracted period of time.	93.0	107.0
201607	1083	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is an environment in which the same frequency and size of shocks that we have seen historically would lead us back down to the effective lower bound with greater frequency, which surely needs to be taken into account in our policy framework, and one in which we might see greater international transmission than we have previously.	93.0	107.0
201607	1084	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The analysis, to me at least, suggests that the complicated nature of the challenges we’re likely to face may, in fact, require greater complexity in our implementation framework to achieve in the most effective and compelling way the clear objectives the Congress set out for us.	93.0	107.0
201607	1085	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In my own view, it’s very important to think about provision of liquidity in the wholesale financial markets at times of stress as part of our critical responsibility for financial stability in parallel to our monetary policy objectives.	93.0	107.0
201607	1086	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I do believe that I would like to see some explicit consideration of the demand for safe assets and what our role is likely to be or should be in the future.	93.0	107.0
201607	1087	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems particularly important for us as the central bank that has the deepest, most liquid, largest wholesale financial markets in the world and a currency that is viewed globally as the most important reserve currency.	93.0	107.0
201607	1088	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This is not something we chose, it may not be something we wished for, but it is something that I think matters in terms of our role in the system and the ways that financial stresses spill over into our markets.	93.0	107.0
201607	1089	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So I agree that it should be taken explicitly into account.	93.0	107.0
201607	1090	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That said, I’m certainly keeping a very open mind, and others around the table, I hear, are doing the same.	93.0	107.0
201607	1091	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s quite premature to draw any firm conclusions until we’re better able to assess possible tradeoffs.	93.0	107.0
201607	1092	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I do believe that at some juncture we would benefit from a broader public discussion of these issues—not just with expert communities, but also with nonexpert communities who may not fully understand the kinds of tradeoffs that we faced during the crisis and may well face.	93.0	107.0
201607	1093	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s better to have those discussions ex ante than to try to defend actions ex post.	93.0	107.0
201607	1094	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So, against the background of those considerations, I do think this is a very important set of analyses.	93.0	107.0
201607	1095	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And I hope we’ll have a lot of time before we need to actually draw conclusions about tools and the framework.	93.0	107.0
201607	1096	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	107.0
201607	1097	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1098	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	93.0	65.0
201607	1099	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	1100	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure whether I missed something that Governor Tarullo said, but I heard him talking about the interaction between the need to plan the system to take account of both the regulatory system that you’re changing and the financial system.	93.0	108.0
201607	1101	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think we ought to remind ourselves that we missed that in a big way in 2006, ’07, and ’08, when the supervisory system did not carry out the functions as well as it should have, and that those two elements of our job as the central bank, which are supervision and regulation of the financial system and the provision of a lender-of-last-resort facility, are very intimately connected.	93.0	108.0
201607	1102	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They are connected in the sense that any intelligent human being faced with the choice between creating a recession of the depth that we had in 2008 to prevent moral hazard on some future occasion—which it wouldn’t do anyway, because the people who created that crisis won’t be around for the next one—will, in the end, succumb to what we call “moral hazard”— and what I call “common sense”	93.0	108.0
201607	1103	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So we will not get to that point, and that means we have to make sure that through all the tools that we have at our command, we minimize the probability of being put in such a situation.	93.0	108.0
201607	1104	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But we should never believe that we understand the world and the random events that happen well enough that our successors will not be put in that situation again.	93.0	108.0
201607	1105	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not going to end too-big-to-fail, and we need to take that into account.	93.0	108.0
201607	1106	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We just have to make absolutely sure that we have done everything that we can to minimize the probability that we are put in that situation at some future date.	93.0	108.0
201607	1107	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that has to be part of the discussions.	93.0	108.0
201607	1108	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think several people have already said they would like those issues discussed in the next round of this very, very critical discussion.	93.0	108.0
201607	1109	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	93.0	108.0
201607	1110	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	93.0	65.0
201607	1111	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody else?	93.0	65.0
201607	1112	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	93.0	65.0
201607	1113	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201607	1114	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, let me end by again thanking the staff for their fantastic work.	93.0	65.0
201607	1115	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think the input that you’ve heard will be useful as we prepare for further discussion in November.	93.0	65.0
201607	1116	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we take a break at this point to have lunch and resume at, say, 1:15.	52.0	65.0
201607	1118	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201607	1119	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Will this group come to order?	52.0	65.0
201607	1120	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to begin with the Desk briefing, and let me turn things over to Lorie Logan.	61.0	65.0
201607	1121	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201607	1122	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The UK referendum vote to leave the European Union dominated market attention over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1123	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows the changes in domestic asset prices over various windows during the period, with red indicating declines in risk-asset prices and increases in safe-haven asset prices and blue indicating the reverse.	61.0	999.0
201607	1124	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see from the first two columns, financial markets were highly volatile in the first few days following the UK referendum, though asset prices have largely retraced since.	61.0	999.0
201607	1125	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the third column, on net over the intermeeting period, short-dated Treasury yields and the US dollar were little changed, while the S&P 500 increased about 5 percent and high-yield option-adjusted spreads narrowed roughly 60 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201607	1126	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In explaining the shifts in domestic asset prices over the period, market participants suggested that the Brexit vote outcome increased downside risks to the outlook for global growth, especially for the United Kingdom and the euro area.	61.0	999.0
201607	1127	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This in turn fueled expectations of easier monetary policy across advanced economies and prompted investors to “reach for yield,”	61.0	999.0
201607	1128	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Along with the better-than-expected US economic data, this prompted a reversal of the immediate effects of Brexit on domestic asset prices.	61.0	999.0
201607	1129	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The top-right panel focuses on the changes in expectations regarding monetary policy in advanced foreign economies.	61.0	999.0
201607	1130	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you’d expect, the shift in policy expectations was biggest for the United Kingdom, the red line in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1131	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While the Bank of England left its key policy rate unchanged last week, interest rate futures in the United Kingdom are currently pricing in a full 25 basis point cut at the upcoming meeting, with some also expecting an expansion of the Funding for Lending Scheme or additional asset purchases or both.	61.0	999.0
201607	1132	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the euro area, market-implied rates, the dark blue line, also shifted down, although market participants view the most likely form of additional easing this year to be a six- to nine-month extension of the ECB’s asset purchase program beyond the current soft end date of March 2017.	61.0	999.0
201607	1133	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In Japan, money market rates, the light blue line, are relatively little changed since Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1134	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	However, surveys show expectations for an expansion of the BOJ’s asset purchase program, which may include a doubling of ETF purchases as well as a marginal increase in JGB purchases.	61.0	999.0
201607	1135	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In addition, expectations for Japanese fiscal stimulus increased over the period on the back of Prime Minister Abe’s current ruling coalition winning a supermajority in the Japanese upper house.	61.0	999.0
201607	1136	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the United States, the path of the target federal funds rate implied by market prices was little changed, on net.	61.0	999.0
201607	1137	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, the most recent Desk surveys reveal a notable shift in expectations regarding FOMC policy.	61.0	999.0
201607	1138	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, expectations for the most likely number of rate hikes over the remainder of 2016 moved lower.	61.0	999.0
201607	1139	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Roughly one-fourth of respondents now think that the most likely outcome is for no hikes this year, and no respondents view two hikes as most likely.	61.0	999.0
201607	1140	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Survey expectations for the target rate beyond 2016 also moved lower, with a decline of about 20 basis points in the mean expectation for the target federal funds rate at year-end 2017 and 2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1141	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The decline in expectations was most pronounced among dealer respondents and, as shown in the middle-right panel, resulted in a narrowing in the gap between survey- and market-implied rates.	61.0	999.0
201607	1142	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Commentary by survey respondents suggests these revisions to expectations of FOMC policy were driven primarily by the Brexit outcome.	61.0	999.0
201607	1143	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Alongside the shifts in rate expectations, the median expectation for the timing of a change to the Committee’s reinvestment policy also pushed out notably, from the end of 2017 to the second quarter of 2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1144	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations for more accommodative global monetary policy reportedly contributed to the declines in longer-term US interest rates over the period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1145	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the 5-year nominal Treasury rate 5 years forward reached a historic low in the aftermath of Brexit, and the 10-year yield traded below 1.35 percent.	61.0	999.0
201607	1146	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The declines were driven almost entirely by real rates, as measures of inflation compensation were little changed.	61.0	999.0
201607	1147	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	To better understand the moves in longer-term rates, a new Desk survey question asked respondents to rate the importance of various factors in explaining the declines in the 5-year nominal Treasury rate 5 years forward over two time horizons:  first, over the intermeeting period, and, second, from the start of the year to the June FOMC.	61.0	999.0
201607	1148	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown by the blue diamonds in the bottom-right panel, the highest-rated factors for the intermeeting period were spillover from low or declining yields abroad and safe-haven demand, although conversations with market participants suggest that the effect of safe-haven demand was limited to the immediate aftermath of the UK referendum.	61.0	999.0
201607	1149	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	These spillovers, driven by the relative attractiveness of US fixed- income instruments amid a dearth of yield globally, appear to be a continuation of a trend seen since the beginning of the year.	61.0	999.0
201607	1150	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In fact, as shown by the red diamonds, spillover from global yields was also rated the most important factor contributing to the declines earlier this year, followed by changes in the outlook for US economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201607	1151	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	For context on the low global yields, the top-left panel of your next exhibit shows the portion of sovereign debt in Japan and the euro area with negative yields.	61.0	999.0
201607	1152	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In these markets, most sovereign debt out to the 10- to 15-year maturity range is trading in negative territory and, as a result, roughly 40 percent of all G-4 sovereign bonds yield below zero.	61.0	999.0
201607	1153	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The low yields, driven by weak economic growth prospects, negative policy rates, and expectations for further central bank easing measures, have reportedly prompted many investors to rebalance their portfolios toward higher- yielding assets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1154	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to driving longer-term US yields lower, this “reach for yield” has reportedly served to boost global risk asset prices.	61.0	999.0
201607	1155	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the S&P 500 increased roughly 4 percent to an all-time high, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index gained more than 8 percent over the period and month-over- month inflows into EM equity funds accelerated to year-to-date highs.	61.0	999.0
201607	1156	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the strong performance of global risk assets and the relative resilience of financial markets in the wake of the Brexit decision, market participants continue to highlight several medium-term risks.	61.0	999.0
201607	1157	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The first relates to Brexit itself.	61.0	999.0
201607	1158	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Brexit-related uncertainty is expected to persist for the foreseeable future, and as I noted at the outset, the outcome increased perceived downside risks to economic growth.	61.0	999.0
201607	1159	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants are focused in particular on how political cohesion in the EU will evolve.	61.0	999.0
201607	1160	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thus far, there have been few signs of contagion, although in the wake of Brexit, sentiment toward the European banking sector soured further.	61.0	999.0
201607	1161	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-left panel, the Euro Stoxx Banks Index, the light blue line, has declined more than 10 percent since the referendum and more than 20 percent since the start of the year, as sluggish economic growth and low net interest margins are expected to weigh on profitability.	61.0	999.0
201607	1162	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As Steve will discuss, the Italian banking sector, the red line, has been a notable underperformer.	61.0	999.0
201607	1163	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	A second point of investor concern in Europe as well as globally is the persistently low levels of inflation compensation.	61.0	999.0
201607	1164	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Five-year, five-year-forward inflation swap rates in the United States and euro area have increased a bit from the lows reached post-Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1165	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, however, they remain near historically low levels, perhaps reflecting the effects of constraints on monetary policy at the zero bound.	61.0	999.0
201607	1166	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	A third risk relates to the possibility of renewed US dollar appreciation.	61.0	999.0
201607	1167	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While the broad dollar index, the light blue line in the bottom-left panel, was little changed over the period, this masks a notable appreciation against developed market currencies, the red line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1168	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants continue to view a substantial dollar appreciation and the capital flows that could result as a significant risk to markets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1169	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The most salient concerns regarding dollar appreciation appear to be the risks it poses to Chinese FX and financial markets and, in particular, whether it could accelerate the need to delink the RMB from the dollar and lead to less perceived transparency as Chinese authorities attempt to manage that process.	61.0	999.0
201607	1170	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The RMB reached its weakest level against the dollar since 2010 over the intermeeting period, as shown by the dark blue line in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1171	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, the CFETS renminbi index has now depreciated more than 5 percent since the start of the year, as shown by the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1172	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thus far, investors appear to be taking the gradual weakening of the RMB in stride but are quick to recall the volatility that the RMB’s depreciation against the dollar last summer and earlier this year appeared to produce.	61.0	999.0
201607	1173	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Your final two panels focus on money markets and Desk operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1174	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit, money market rates, particularly repo rates, increased over the intermeeting period, as dealers sought to secure funding ahead of the Brexit vote and the June quarter-end.	61.0	999.0
201607	1175	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The rise in secured rates put upward pressure on unsecured rates, with the effective federal funds rate averaging 39 basis points, 2 basis points above the previous period’s average.	61.0	999.0
201607	1176	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite higher market rates relative to the overnight RRP rate, average daily overnight RRP participation increased, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1177	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in red, Freddie Mac’s participation rose from an average of about $1 billion per day in earlier periods to $12 billion per day, as part of its cash management strategy ahead of planned buyback and reissuance of longer-term debt.	61.0	999.0
201607	1178	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	More notably, government funds’ overnight RRP usage, shown as the dark blue area, also increased.	61.0	999.0
201607	1179	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This increase in usage came alongside a movement in assets under management from prime funds to government funds ahead of the October implementation date for SEC money market fund reforms.	61.0	999.0
201607	1180	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in dark blue in the middle-left panel, approximately $105 billion left prime funds this intermeeting period, while the AUM of funds that invest in government and agency securities, the light blue area, increased $100 billion.	61.0	999.0
201607	1181	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants expect this trend to accelerate in August and September.	61.0	999.0
201607	1182	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Money funds we surveyed in June expected investor flows to generate a migration of about $320 billion from prime to government funds, shown in light blue in the middle-right panel, though estimates ranged widely across respondents.	61.0	999.0
201607	1183	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The realized and expected investor flows come on top of the roughly $350 billion in prime funds that have either converted or are in the process of converting to government funds, the dark blue column in the panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1184	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Altogether, this would leave roughly $850 billion in AUM in prime funds, the red portion of the bar to the right.	61.0	999.0
201607	1185	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the increase in government fund AUM over the intermeeting period, usage of the overnight RRP facility as a proportion of the overall assets under management for RRP counterparties increased only modestly, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1186	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that to date these funds have been able to successfully allocate most of the new cash to private-market investments.	61.0	999.0
201607	1187	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In anticipation of further investor outflows, prime funds have shifted their investments toward shorter-term assets.	61.0	999.0
201607	1188	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the decline in prime fund holdings of commercial paper and time deposits has accelerated, particularly as the three-month tenor recently crossed the reform implementation date.	61.0	999.0
201607	1189	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Increased reluctance by prime funds to hold three-month investments reportedly contributed to the widening over the intermeeting period in the spread between three-month LIBOR and OIS rates, the red line.	61.0	999.0
201607	1190	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	While not shown here, the increase in LIBOR also contributed to the recent increase in US interest rate swap rates, which settle to three-month LIBOR.	61.0	999.0
201607	1191	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants suggested that the effect of money fund reform also contributed to an increase in offshore dollar-funding costs, including the three-month US dollar cross-currency swap bases shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201607	1192	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the basis measures the cost of borrowing US dollars offshore through the FX market relative to the costs of borrowing dollars directly.	61.0	999.0
201607	1193	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Some contacts have noted that a reduction in prime funds’ lending to foreign banks could have increased demand for funding through the FX swap market, and that this may have pushed FX bases wider.	61.0	999.0
201607	1194	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The upward pressure on offshore dollar costs also pushed the implied cost of one- week offshore borrowing, shown in the top-right panel, above the rate on foreign central banks’ one-week US dollar auctions.	61.0	999.0
201607	1195	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Amid the shift in market pricing, we observed higher demand at the BOJ and the ECB dollar auctions over the June quarter-end and some modest usage in the operations that have followed, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201607	1196	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to organizational matters, the middle-right panel summarizes the staff’s work to modernize the documents governing foreign currency operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1197	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	The staff had three objectives in conducting this work:  first, to have the documents reflect the current operating environment; second, to clarify policymaker guidance to the Selected Bank; and, third, to improve the documents’ organization.	61.0	999.0
201607	1198	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	To achieve these objectives, the staff has undertaken a substantial rewrite of the documents, with the proposed updates reflecting a significant number of changes to the existing governance of the foreign currency operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1199	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	In view of the number of changes proposed, we want to ensure that you have enough time to review them before you’re asked for a vote.	61.0	999.0
201607	1200	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	We plan to send you the updated documents and an accompanying memorandum within the next few weeks and to request a vote to approve these documents at the September meeting.	61.0	999.0
201607	1201	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Pending approval of the governing documents in September, the Desk staff plans to begin implementing the new investment framework for the management of the foreign reserves portfolio shortly thereafter.	61.0	999.0
201607	1202	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed at the April meeting, key features of this new framework include establishing a process for assessing policymakers’ investment preferences for the period aheadand using a more robust risk–return methodology that incorporates those preferences.	61.0	999.0
201607	1203	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, I want to mention two operational developments.	61.0	999.0
201607	1204	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	First, last week JPMorgan Chase announced its plans to exit the provision of settlement services for OMO-eligible assets by mid-2018.	61.0	999.0
201607	1205	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	At that time, Bank of New York Mellon is expected to become the sole service provider supporting the clearing and settlement of our domestic open market operations.	61.0	999.0
201607	1206	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	JPMorgan’s announcement will not affect the services it provides as custodian for SOMA agency MBS holdings.	61.0	999.0
201607	1207	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Second, the staff conducted one small value operational test over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201607	1208	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Information on this test, along with a list of upcoming exercises, is summarized in the appendix.	61.0	999.0
201607	1209	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you.	61.0	999.0
201607	1210	2016-07-27	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201607	1211	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201607	1212	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Lorie?	62.0	65.0
201607	1213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201607	1214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing no questions, we need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201607	1215	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201607	1216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And without objection.	63.0	65.0
201607	1217	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201607	1218	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along then to the economic and financial situation, and Steve Kamin is going to start us off.	11.0	65.0
201607	1219	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201607	1220	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials titled “The International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1221	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Let me say at the outset that if I never hear the word “Brexit” again, it will be way too soon.	11.0	999.0
201607	1222	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	If you are of the same mind, we are in for much disappointment, because like campaign robocalls, Pokemon Go, and, as always, the Kardashians, we’re going to be hearing a lot more about Brexit than we’d like in the coming months.	11.0	999.0
201607	1223	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, newly installed Prime Minister Theresa May has stated that she is not even going to initiate the formal process of pulling Britain out of the EU until early 2017, and after that, talks on a new trade deal will drone on for at least two years.	11.0	999.0
201607	1224	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Once the bureaucrats start hashing out the details, the best we can hope for is that the negotiations will be excruciatingly boring.	11.0	999.0
201607	1225	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	At worst, well, I’ll get to that shortly.	11.0	999.0
201607	1226	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	It is still early days, of course, but at least for now, Brexit has turned out about as well as we might have expected.	11.0	999.0
201607	1227	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Lorie has described, outside of Europe, global financial markets have largely reversed their earlier losses, and the dollar—which is a key channel through which foreign events affect the US economy—is up only about 1 percent since your June meeting.	11.0	999.0
201607	1228	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, with financial and confidence spillovers from Brexit largely contained, we see the main effect of Brexit on our baseline foreign outlook being the hit to the economies of the United Kingdom and the euro area, with some fairly small knock-on effects on other foreign economies operating mainly through trade channels.	11.0	999.0
201607	1229	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Given that we’ve never seen an event like Brexit, how do we calculate its effects on economic growth in the United Kingdom and the euro area?	11.0	999.0
201607	1230	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The reduction of trade in goods and financial services should exert some long-term depressive effect on productivity and output, but we believe the more immediate and tangible effects will come through Brexit’s effect on uncertainty, confidence, and financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1231	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 1, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis measure of economic policy uncertainty has ratcheted up this year in both the United Kingdom and the euro area, as have measures of financial stress, shown in panel 2.	11.0	999.0
201607	1232	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To get some sense of the economic effect of these developments, we estimated a vector autoregression model that includes the uncertainty index, financial stress, GDP, and several other variables.	11.0	999.0
201607	1233	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Drawing on this model, we estimate that heightened uncertainty and financial stress should depress UK economic growth quite noticeably over the next year relative to our June projection, as shown by the red solid and dashed lines in panel 3, while euro-area growth, the blue lines, also slows, albeit to a smaller extent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1234	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Later in the forecast period, as progress in Brexit negotiations leads to greater clarity about the economic outlook and thus revived confidence and spending, our new growth projections converge toward those we wrote down in the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1235	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Notwithstanding Brexit’s significant hit to European growth, the effect on the global economy should be relatively muted.	11.0	999.0
201607	1236	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 4, the United Kingdom accounts for only about 3½ percent of US merchandise exports, while the euro area amounts to about 15 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1237	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And outside of Europe, the outlook is little changed from the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1238	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, as shown by the black solid line in panel 5, we have revised down our trade-weighted aggregate of foreign GDP growth only about ¼ percentage point in the second half of this year and 0.1 percentage point next year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1239	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Brexit effects wane by the end of the forecast period, economic growth in both the EMEs and AFEs should be running at roughly their trend paces.	11.0	999.0
201607	1240	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Although the effect of Brexit on our baseline projection is relatively muted, Brexit has revived some serious downside risks for the euro area.	11.0	999.0
201607	1241	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	First, there is some chance that the result of the UK referendum will provide the impetus for anti-EU groups elsewhere in Europe, which already have been gaining political ground in many countries, to either seek similar votes or to restrain the power of EU institutions in other ways.	11.0	999.0
201607	1242	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, a survey of EU residents conducted in November 2015 indicated that, outside of the United Kingdom, people generally favored staying in the EU, but sizable minorities favored leaving and the UK vote could boost those numbers.	11.0	999.0
201607	1243	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The threat of a withdrawal by a continental European economy would create serious concerns about the viability of the euro area and likely trigger a return of the financial stresses seen during the euro zone crisis in 2011 and 2012.	11.0	999.0
201607	1244	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Now besides that, Brexit has revived worries of a crisis in European banking.	11.0	999.0
201607	1245	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	For several years, European banks have struggled with low capitalization and poor profitability, reflecting—to varying degrees—a weak economic environment, shallow yield curves, low-to-negative interest rates, inadequate cost containment, and, as shown in panel 7 on your next exhibit, elevated nonperforming loans.	11.0	999.0
201607	1246	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Lorie has described, following the Brexit vote, stock prices of European banks fell especially sharply.	11.0	999.0
201607	1247	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	For the most part, these declines reflected concerns about profitability rather than solvency, as investors worried that lower economic growth and lower interest rates would further depress bank returns.	11.0	999.0
201607	1248	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, Brexit has also shone the spotlight on banks in serious need of recapitalization.	11.0	999.0
201607	1249	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This spotlight is all the brighter because in three days, the European Banking Authority will be publishing the results of its EU-wide stress test, and banks viewed as having inadequate capital will likely come under additional pressure.	11.0	999.0
201607	1250	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Some of the banks likely to fare poorly in the stress test are in Italy, where NPLs amount to 18 percent of loans and loan loss provisions are inadequate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1251	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Weaker-than- expected results for a major Italian bank could create funding problems for Italian banks in general if markets came to believe that the problems faced by Italian banks were not going to be addressed.	11.0	999.0
201607	1252	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Such tensions could, in principle, lead to heightened financial stresses in other peripheral economies, renewed pressures on peripheral government finances, and, in the worst-case scenario, a return of the euro-area debt crisis.	11.0	999.0
201607	1253	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, for this to happen, many policy missteps would have to occur.	11.0	999.0
201607	1254	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Estimates of the cost of a credible recapitalization of all Italian banks start at about €45 billion.	11.0	999.0
201607	1255	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This is a manageable figure, amounting to less than 3 percent of Italian GDP, and well below the European Stability Mechanism’s remaining lending capacity of €370 billion.	11.0	999.0
201607	1256	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The key stumbling block so far has been that the EU’s new bank resolution rules require any public recapitalization be accompanied by the bail- in of a wide range of claimants, including unsecured bondholders and uninsured depositors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1257	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This is a particular problem for Italy, where many unsecured bonds were sold to retail customers as if they were safe deposit accounts, and forcing those customers to take losses would be politically dangerous.	11.0	999.0
201607	1258	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	At present, the Italian authorities are working with EU officials on a solution to the problem.	11.0	999.0
201607	1259	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The solution will likely involve less ambitious recapitalization, targeting just a few banks, probably involving some private funds, and perhaps exploiting existing exceptions in the bank resolution rules.	11.0	999.0
201607	1260	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	A strategy along these lines will probably suffice to keep a lid on Italy’s banking problems for the time being, but the pot could certainly boil over at some future point.	11.0	999.0
201607	1261	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Besides depressing growth and posing downside risks to the European economy, Brexit appears to have triggered a further notch downward in global interest rates, as shown in panel 8.	11.0	999.0
201607	1262	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We now expect that in response to weaker economic prospects, the Bank of England soon will cut its policy rate 25 basis points to ¼ percent and resume asset purchases, and the ECB will both cut its deposit rate an additional 10 basis points to negative ½ percent and extend its asset purchase program by an additional quarter to mid-2017.	11.0	999.0
201607	1263	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	With Japanese economic growth and inflation also flagging, we think it likely that the BOJ will also bolster its accommodation, probably through a rate cut and stepped-up asset purchases.	11.0	999.0
201607	1264	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Not surprisingly, the value of the dollar against the AFEs has risen over the intermeeting period, as shown by the green line in panel 9, and we have accordingly revised up our forecast path for the dollar against those currencies.	11.0	999.0
201607	1265	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	What is more surprising is that the value of the dollar against EMEs, the blue line, is down slightly over the period.	11.0	999.0
201607	1266	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, as shown in panel 10, since the Brexit vote, EME assets have been experiencing a boom, with flows into emerging market funds soaring and credit spreads narrowing sharply.	11.0	999.0
201607	1267	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The source of the recent strength in EME assets has important implications for the outlook for the dollar.	11.0	999.0
201607	1268	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	If this strength largely reflects a relief rally following the passing of the Brexit risk event, coupled with some impetus from further declines in interest rates in Europe and Japan, gains in EME currencies might persist, consistent with the path of the dollar against EMEs, shown in panel 9.	11.0	999.0
201607	1269	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Conversely, if the boom in EME assets and, in fact, risk assets more generally is being supported by investor expectations of easier US monetary policy, as Lorie discussed, then investor surprise at FOMC tightening could boost the dollar much more sharply than in our forecast against both the AFEs and EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201607	1270	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, we already are anticipating some rise in the dollar as markets discover that the FOMC is tightening by more than they expected.	11.0	999.0
201607	1271	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That is why the dollar rises against AFE currencies in our forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1272	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	This Federal Reserve surprise effect is offset for the EMEs by our assumption that the Chinese RMB will end up rising against the dollar over the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201607	1273	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	But as indicated by panel 11, the sensitivity of the dollar to changes in interest rates may now be higher than we are assuming.	11.0	999.0
201607	1274	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The blue dots and blue regression line show that over the period from January 2010 to April 2014, following FOMC announcements, increases of 1 percentage point in interest rate differentials were associated with a 2.1 percent rise in the dollar against AFE currencies.	11.0	999.0
201607	1275	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We are currently assuming a dollar sensitivity of 2.5 percent in our forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1276	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	But, as indicated by the red dots and regression line, from 2014 to the present, the sensitivity of the dollar to interest rate surprises has risen to about 4.5 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1277	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, the dollar may rise by more in response to a US monetary policy tightening than we are currently assuming.	11.0	999.0
201607	1278	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Another upside risk to the dollar forecast is posed by China.	11.0	999.0
201607	1279	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 12, we are currently assuming that the RMB will stabilize over the next year before appreciating thereafter, consistent with China’s still-high productivity growth and mounting trade surpluses.	11.0	999.0
201607	1280	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, with China apparently content to let the RMB depreciate to support growth and with markets continuing to fret that growing corporate debt could lead to a hard landing, there is some chance that a reemergence of heavy capital outflows could keep the RMB moving downward.	11.0	999.0
201607	1281	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	To conclude, both the normalization of Fed policy and prospects for China pose upside risks to our dollar forecast.	11.0	999.0
201607	1282	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Over the coming intermeeting period, we will be considering how much of this upside might be worth incorporating into our baseline projection.	11.0	999.0
201607	1283	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201607	1284	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1285	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The biggest surprise regarding the baseline outlook for the US economy may be how little it has changed since June despite—among other developments—the event that Steve Kamin would prefer shall not be named.	11.0	999.0
201607	1286	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Accordingly, I will be relatively brief in my coverage of the usual forecast update and instead provide a broader review of the recent contour of the recovery.	11.0	999.0
201607	1287	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The first panel of your forecast summary exhibit shows how various nowcasts of second-quarter real GDP growth have evolved since the time of the June Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1288	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Generally speaking, the nowcasting operations maintained at the Reserve Banks, which are shown by the dashed lines, like the Board’s judgmental forecast (in black), saw the incoming data during the intermeeting period as continuing to point to second-quarter GDP growth in the neighborhood of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1289	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the basis of our own track record over the past decade, we estimate that there’s a 70 percent probability that the BEA’s first estimate, which it will publish this Friday, will lie between about 1½ percent and 2½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1290	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, the BEA’s first estimate will then be revised over time, so uncertainty about the true rate of growth of real GDP in the second quarter is much greater than that.	11.0	999.0
201607	1291	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As for the labor market, the June employment report substantially alleviated the concern we had at the time of the June meeting that a broader deterioration in real activity might have been in train.	11.0	999.0
201607	1292	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Welcome as that report was, I would hasten to note that what one report delivered in terms of reassurance about the vitality of the recovery, another report could just as easily take away.	11.0	999.0
201607	1293	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Taking a longer-term perspective, the pace of improvement in the cyclical position of the economy does seem to have slowed in recent quarters.	11.0	999.0
201607	1294	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The clearest window onto this slowing is given in panel 2, which shows the Board staff’s judgmental estimate of the output gap—the broadest measure of resource utilization in our framework.	11.0	999.0
201607	1295	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	After having narrowed reasonably rapidly during the preceding couple of years, the output gap by our reckoning has been roughly flat since the middle of 2015.	11.0	999.0
201607	1296	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Assuming that our characterization of recent history survives the upcoming annual revision to the national accounts, which is also scheduled to be released on Friday, two questions immediately arise, as we noted in the Tealbook:  First, why did the slowing occur?	11.0	999.0
201607	1297	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And, second, what does it portend for the future?	11.0	999.0
201607	1298	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Regarding why it happened, one important cause of the slowdown has probably been the appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar since mid-2014, and the associated deeper factors that gave rise to that appreciation.	11.0	999.0
201607	1299	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 3, the broad real dollar is currently more than 16 percent stronger than we thought it would be as of the July 2014 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1300	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As Glenn Follette emphasized in his briefing yesterday, business fixed investment has been unexpectedly weak recently and inventory investment has slowed from its rapid pace of a year ago.	11.0	999.0
201607	1301	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	These developments may themselves partly reflect the appreciation of the dollar rather than be additional to it.	11.0	999.0
201607	1302	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In our assessment, the dollar effect helps to explain why the pace of cyclical improvement slowed as much as it did during a period when you increased the target range for the federal funds rate only 25 basis points and the size of the SOMA portfolio relative to GDP didn’t change very much.	11.0	999.0
201607	1303	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed, one can even argue— given the downward adjustment in market expectations for the trajectory of the funds rate over the next few years—that the overall stance of monetary policy actually has eased since mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201607	1304	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	A natural interpretation of all of this is that the appreciation of the dollar since 2014 and all the factors that gave rise to that appreciation put a substantial restraint on domestic economic activity—a restraint that we estimate to be in the neighborhood of about 1 percentage point off the growth of real GDP both last year and this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1305	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Thus, the dollar and the other factors that gave rise to dollar appreciation plausibly substituted, in effect, for tightening that you might have otherwise had to provide in the form of more aggressive increases in the funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1306	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The FRB/US model can give one rough estimate of the magnitude of the substitution.	11.0	999.0
201607	1307	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	According to the model, the unanticipated rise in the dollar’s exchange value over the past two years was equivalent, in terms of its effect on the output gap, to an increase in the federal funds rate of something like 150 to 200 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201607	1308	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Turning to the second question that I posed earlier, if the stronger dollar played an important role in generating the recent cyclical slowing, what does that portend for the future?	11.0	999.0
201607	1309	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, does it make sense that, in the baseline forecast, we have the pace of resource tightening picking up steam again even as the funds rate moves up more decisively?	11.0	999.0
201607	1310	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The answer is that, with dollar and other associated effects waning, there is room both for the pace of resource tightening to pick back up to a slightly more vigorous pace and for you to resume a program of gradually bringing the funds rate up to its neutral level over the next several years.	11.0	999.0
201607	1311	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 5 and 6 show the evolution of two key indicators of labor market conditions broken out by race or ethnicity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1312	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Broadly speaking, as shown in panel 5, the unemployment rates for Hispanics or Latinos and for blacks or African- Americans historically have tended to follow the main contours of the unemployment rate for whites, but with a higher intercept and a larger cyclical sensitivity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1313	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	An ocular regression suggests that there may have been some modest improvement in the relative experience of Hispanics over the past decade but not of blacks, and an actual computer-based simple linear regression—albeit one that makes no attempt to control for changes in age, education, or other relevant characteristics—corroborates that ocular impression.	11.0	999.0
201607	1314	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 6 presents similar estimates for the so-called U-6 rate, which includes marginally attached persons and people working part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201607	1315	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	These estimates were prepared by the staff here at the Board using microdata from the CPS.	11.0	999.0
201607	1316	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This measure tells roughly the same story.	11.0	999.0
201607	1317	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It is certainly discouraging that neither the black–white nor the Hispanic–white differential in either measure is materially smaller than it was a decade or two ago.	11.0	999.0
201607	1318	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although our baseline assessment of the outlook for real activity isn’t much different from June, our perception of the risks to that outlook has been torqued in different directions on the basis of domestic and foreign considerations.	11.0	999.0
201607	1319	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the one hand, the most recent labor market report provided welcome reassurance that the labor market continues to improve, and this suggests that near-term domestic risks have receded.	11.0	999.0
201607	1320	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, I would note that at the time of your June meeting, the UK vote was still seen through the windshield, not in the rearview mirror.	11.0	999.0
201607	1321	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	While the relatively calm response of financial markets in the short amount of time that has transpired since then is also reassuring, I would argue that the vote to leave, which we and others certainly didn’t expect, opens up a range of possibilities that we would have dismissed if the vote had come out the other way, and none of those possibilities look appealing.	11.0	999.0
201607	1322	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The exhibits on the next page summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201607	1323	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our projections of both headline PCE inflation—panel 7—and core PCE inflation—panel 8—are essentially unrevised from June, reflecting both incoming data that have been unusually cooperative and revisions to the medium-term determinants of core inflation that have been quite small.	11.0	999.0
201607	1324	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We continue to expect core PCE inflation to step down modestly over the second half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1325	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As we have noted before, this pattern is partly attributable to the residual seasonality that the BEA has thus far not succeeded in expunging from the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201607	1326	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, we think that first- quarter core inflation was temporarily boosted by some outsized gains in a few erratic components.	11.0	999.0
201607	1327	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The next two panels reproduce the Tealbook’s inflation monitor exhibits, which show the cumulative revisions since December of last year to our projections for total and core PCE inflation and take a first cut at parsing out the sources of those revisions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1328	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the revisions have been mixed but, generally speaking, not very large in either direction thus far.	11.0	999.0
201607	1329	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Focusing on the outlook for core inflation, reported in panel 10, the bulk of the upward revision to our forecast of core inflation this year reflects an upward surprise in the first quarter that we have mostly interpreted as noise.	11.0	999.0
201607	1330	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, we’ve shaved a cumulative tenth out of our forecast of core inflation in 2017 and 2018, reflecting, as you can see, a variety of very small factors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1331	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 11 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201607	1332	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	In recent years, nominal labor compensation growth has been relatively subdued in the face of a steady reduction in labor market slack, although there are signs of a pickup more recently in some measures.	11.0	999.0
201607	1333	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As Glenn Follette also discussed in his pre-FOMC briefing, we think that the recent evolution of compensation can be reasonably well explained by the behavior of trend real wage growth (which is itself related to the growth rate of structural productivity), trend price inflation, and the staff’s estimate of the unemployment gap.	11.0	999.0
201607	1334	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 12 uses one of our models to decompose movements in the ECI into the contributions of these various factors.	11.0	999.0
201607	1335	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the red portion of the bars, the model does view the reduction in labor market slack that has occurred since the beginning of the recovery as a source of upward pressure on compensation growth.	11.0	999.0
201607	1336	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	However, that effect has been largely offset by a reduced contribution of trend real wage growth—the green portion of the bars—that in turn reflects a slowdown in structural productivity growth.	11.0	999.0
201607	1337	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Overall, this model isn’t particularly puzzled by the recent behavior of either the ECI or the productivity and cost measure of compensation per hour.	11.0	999.0
201607	1338	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	At this point, I’ll turn it over to Michael.	11.0	999.0
201607	1339	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	I’ll be referring to your handout on “Financial Stability Developments.”	11.0	999.0
201607	1340	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	My briefing will review developments since our last readout in April, drawing on the quarterly quantitative surveillance report you received last week.	11.0	999.0
201607	1341	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As we highlighted in the report, we continue to see the overall vulnerabilities in the United States as moderate, primarily due to the strong capital and liquidity positions in the banking sector, moderate growth of nonfinancial credit, and lack of widespread valuation pressures.	11.0	999.0
201607	1342	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The period since our last assessment included the decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union.	11.0	999.0
201607	1343	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Note that I avoided the “B word” to spare Steve, but I might not be able to keep it up.	11.0	999.0
201607	1344	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As Lorie and Steve have already discussed, the outcome of the referendum led to sharp declines in risk asset prices and volatility in financial markets that quickly receded.	11.0	999.0
201607	1345	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The first two panels of exhibit 1 illustrate some developments in market functioning.	11.0	999.0
201607	1346	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Foreign exchange markets experienced large volumes and some temporary modest strains, with bid-asked spreads (illustrated for the euro in chart 1) briefly widening to levels far above intraday norms.	11.0	999.0
201607	1347	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Turning to fixed-income markets, our recent assessments have highlighted the concerns expressed by some market participants and others regarding reductions in liquidity.	11.0	999.0
201607	1348	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As can be seen in chart 2, bid-asked spreads for investment- grade corporate bonds, the black line, widened around Brexit but not to an unusual extent.	11.0	999.0
201607	1349	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Stepping back from specific developments, the Brexit experience was a significant real-time, albeit anticipated, stress test of the global financial system.	11.0	999.0
201607	1350	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Reports indicate that trading remained generally orderly and liquidity across markets held up reasonably well.	11.0	999.0
201607	1351	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In addition, supervisory data suggest that unscheduled margin calls were substantial in the immediate aftermath of Brexit but were met without any significant incidents.	11.0	999.0
201607	1352	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Financial markets and institutions have been resilient to the shock to date, which may in part reflect early preparations by a wide range of market participants, reduced leverage in the system, and communications from central banks that they would take the steps necessary to provide liquidity to support the orderly functioning of markets.	11.0	999.0
201607	1353	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	While the prices of many risk assets have more than fully recovered from their post-Brexit lows, this is not true of European bank stock prices, as Steve and Lorie already highlighted.	11.0	999.0
201607	1354	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Equity prices of large European banks, shown in chart 3, fell substantially, and the prices for Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and Barclays have recently been near or even below the lows hit during the worst of the European debt crisis in 2011 and 2012.	11.0	999.0
201607	1355	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In contrast, the stock prices for US banks have largely recovered from their post-Brexit decline and remain notably above their 2011 low.	11.0	999.0
201607	1356	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The relative outperformance of US banks undoubtedly is due importantly to the relative strength of the US economic recovery, although the improvement in loss- absorbing capacity at US banks likely also plays a role.	11.0	999.0
201607	1357	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As shown in chart 4, the largest US banks all met their fully phased-in Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio as of early this year; moreover, all of the US banks participating in this year’s CCAR received nonobjections to their capital plans after demonstrating that their capital levels were sufficient to withstand a severely adverse global recession.	11.0	999.0
201607	1358	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The underperformance of European banks reflects a number of factors, including the weaker outlook for economic growth in Europe, the further drag on already thin net interest margins from low—indeed, negative—interest rates, and greater concerns about the quality of their loan books.	11.0	999.0
201607	1359	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As Steve just mentioned, Italian banks have been under particular pressure recently, and the results of the EBA’s stress tests—to be released this Friday—and any related policy actions bear close watching.	11.0	999.0
201607	1360	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	An important link between European financial institutions and domestic financial stability comes from the sizable exposures of prime money market funds to Europe, illustrated in chart 5.	11.0	999.0
201607	1361	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Overall exposures were more than $500 billion, on average, in recent months.	11.0	999.0
201607	1362	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Much of this exposure consisted of certificates of deposit and commercial paper from financial institutions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1363	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Looking forward, on October 14, new SEC regulations governing money market funds take effect.	11.0	999.0
201607	1364	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Under the new rules, prime institutional funds will be required to float their daily net asset values and have the ability to impose fees and, indeed, outright restrictions, or “gates,” on redemptions.	11.0	999.0
201607	1365	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In response, and as discussed earlier by Lorie, a number of funds have converted to types less influenced by the reforms, with the most common adjustment involving conversion to a government-only fund.	11.0	999.0
201607	1366	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In addition, money fund managers are preparing for potential withdrawals by investors who want to avoid the new regulations and, as shown in chart 6, have shortened maturities and built liquidity buffers in response.	11.0	999.0
201607	1367	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	A survey of money fund managers conducted by the Desk reported projected additional redemptions from prime funds could be on the order of several hundreds of billions of dollars.	11.0	999.0
201607	1368	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	While the reforms should improve the stability of money market funds, there could be some short-term disruptions to wholesale funding markets if large unexpected withdrawals were to occur.	11.0	999.0
201607	1369	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In particular, some foreign banks could experience difficulties in obtaining dollar funding.	11.0	999.0
201607	1370	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Your next exhibit presents developments in nonfinancial credit and asset valuations.	11.0	999.0
201607	1371	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Overall, nonfinancial credit has grown at a rate roughly in line with nominal GDP (not shown), and we continue to see vulnerabilities stemming from nonfinancial borrowing as moderate overall.	11.0	999.0
201607	1372	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	In the nonfinancial corporate business sector, leverage continued to increase, as shown in chart 1, and leverage among speculative-grade and unrated firms—so-called high-risk firms—is now quite elevated.	11.0	999.0
201607	1373	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	High leverage among risky firms leaves them vulnerable to shocks.	11.0	999.0
201607	1374	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	That said, the pace of borrowing by such firms has slowed over the past year, as shown in chart 2, in response to the increase in borrowing spreads (chart 3) and tightening in lending conditions seen since 2014.	11.0	999.0
201607	1375	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Credit spreads have remained on the high side of historical averages this year, although they have clearly moved down from the levels seen early in the year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1376	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Anecdotal reports hint at some pickup in valuation pressures in risk assets from a view that extremely low (if not negative) yields in Europe and Japan leave the United States as the only game in town for investors reaching for yield.	11.0	999.0
201607	1377	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	It remains too early to call a significant uptick in valuation pressures in the United States, and, for example, the required return to equity (chart 4) remains near a historically typical level and the equity premium (the difference between the black and red lines in chart 4) remains relatively high.	11.0	999.0
201607	1378	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Of course, one reason that the equity premium has widened this year is the decline in Treasury yields, highlighting the potential dependence of asset prices on continued low longer-term Treasury rates.	11.0	999.0
201607	1379	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The final two panels provide an update on developments in commercial real estate, in which rapid price appreciation recently has led us to highlight the notable valuation pressures emerging in this sector.	11.0	999.0
201607	1380	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Data through June point to continued price gains and declines in capitalization rates, as shown in the lower-left chart.	11.0	999.0
201607	1381	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As with equity valuation metrics, these capitalization rates do not suggest unusually low expected returns relative to Treasury yields, but their steady decline highlights the momentum in this sector.	11.0	999.0
201607	1382	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	Nonetheless, there have been some indications of slowing investor appetite for commercial real estate.	11.0	999.0
201607	1383	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	For example, the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported a significant fraction of banks tightening lending standards for CRE, shown on the chart to the right, in the first and second quarters of this year.	11.0	999.0
201607	1384	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	The last page of your handout presents our summary heat map of financial-sector vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201607	1385	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	As in previous assessments, valuation pressures, private nonfinancial- sector leverage, and maturity transformation all remain at the midpoint of our scale, while we judge vulnerabilities from financial leverage to be low.	11.0	999.0
201607	1386	2016-07-27	meeting	KILEY	That concludes our set of remarks.	11.0	999.0
201607	1387	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is now open for questions for any of our presenters.	12.0	65.0
201607	1388	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201607	1389	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201607	1390	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a question on “The International Outlook”—exhibit 2, box 9, “Real Dollar Indexes.”	12.0	94.0
201607	1391	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got the dollar appreciating over the forecast horizon.	12.0	94.0
201607	1392	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	One question you might ask is:  Wouldn’t markets already have integrated all of the information that’s available, and, therefore, it wouldn’t really be very predictable where the trade-weighted value of the dollar was going to go?	12.0	94.0
201607	1393	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That insight is exactly right, and that is an important part of the way we forecast the dollar, which is to assume that everything the markets know or anticipate now is already incorporated into the current level of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201607	1394	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	The only reason why we would predict changes in the dollar—particularly the exchange rate against the advanced economies, whose exchange rates are determined by the market—is if we thought the market was going to learn something later that it does not know now.	12.0	999.0
201607	1395	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In general, of course, we don’t think we have any greater insight into future events than the market does.	12.0	999.0
201607	1396	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, there is one area in which we think we might have some insight, and that’s the assumption in our forecast that the federal funds rate will rise at a steeper gradient over the course of the forecast period than the market expects.	12.0	999.0
201607	1397	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So the market expects a relatively small amount of tightening over the next few years.	12.0	999.0
201607	1398	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We have built into our forecast a greater amount of tightening, so we assumed that as the market learns about that and is surprised by the upward shift in the federal funds rate, it will accordingly bid the dollar up, and that’s the rationale for the upward tilt in our exchange rate.	12.0	999.0
201607	1399	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	12.0	94.0
201607	1400	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But, actually, my own forecasts don’t have that policy upswing.	12.0	94.0
201607	1401	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I guess if you’re applying this to what I have, then you’d say that maybe the dollar would even depreciate, or at least you would make no forecast about the dollar.	12.0	94.0
201607	1402	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That could well be.	12.0	999.0
201607	1403	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our forecast regarding the dollar is part of the overall staff forecast of the US economy and depends on the assumptions about US monetary policy that are incorporated into our staff forecast.	12.0	999.0
201607	1404	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201607	1405	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1406	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201607	1407	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a question, diving deep into the Tealbook forecast, and that’s specifically about housing.	12.0	102.0
201607	1408	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You highlight in the Tealbook that the incoming data on residential construction suggest lower growth over the near term, but I’m a little bit puzzled by that.	12.0	102.0
201607	1409	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, I’m thinking ahead to the wording in the draft statement that residential investment is “soft.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1410	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Real residential investment increased at a rate of more than 15 percent in the first quarter.	12.0	102.0
201607	1411	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Outside commentators would describe housing—and this is how my own staff described it when we discussed it—as a sector in which housing starts, permits, and existing home sales have been strong and have been in fact above expectations, and that any slowing that we’ve seen in the data may be just some weather effects, which have affected the timing of activity between Q1 and Q2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1412	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I guess I’m asking for your help in thinking this through:  If you have a really strong Q1, partly boosted by weather, and then a little bit of a takeaway in Q2, how do you view that?	12.0	102.0
201607	1413	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And why would that make your forecast more negative about Q3 and Q4?	12.0	102.0
201607	1414	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	By our lights, starts and permits data have been disappointing over the past couple of months.	12.0	999.0
201607	1415	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And, basically, the permits numbers, which give a much higher signal-to- noise ratio reading on the underlying pace of activity, have been about flat since December of last year.	12.0	999.0
201607	1416	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So we marked down our near-term forecast of single-family permits from the June Tealbook to now.	12.0	999.0
201607	1417	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, part of the reason why the residential investment figure in the national income and product accounts is so strong in the first quarter was that there looks to have been a very large spike in single-family starts in February; the series for single-family starts is pretty noisy.	12.0	999.0
201607	1418	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We think that most of that is just statistical noise around a much steadier trend that’s formed by the adjusted single-family permits.	12.0	999.0
201607	1419	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The starts number does feed mechanically through in a distributed moving lag into the residential investment, but what we think basically is going on there is that the BEA is feeding through a distributed moving lag of noise into the national income and product accounts, and the permits numbers—which are not based on a sample but are essentially a census of permits issued across the country—just give a much smoother picture.	12.0	999.0
201607	1420	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And those numbers continue to disappoint.	12.0	999.0
201607	1421	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve been steadily marking down our assessment.	12.0	999.0
201607	1422	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We still think that the pace of construction is significantly below the demographically indicated pace of units to be added to the capital stock.	12.0	999.0
201607	1423	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the latter point.	12.0	102.0
201607	1424	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess I’m going back to this characterization of residential construction as being soft when it’s been growing, whether there is statistical noise or not.	12.0	102.0
201607	1425	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	If it’s been growing very rapidly and it just doesn’t keep growing or it declines a little bit, that just seems a funny way to characterize residential construction.	12.0	102.0
201607	1426	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Permits have been basically moving sideways since the beginning of the year, and we think that’s just a much better gauge on the pace of activity.	12.0	999.0
201607	1427	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	John, is your concern that it’s an untrue statement, or is your concern that because it’s included in the statement, it suggests that the Committee is putting too much weight on it?	12.0	96.0
201607	1428	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course it’s the latter, right?	12.0	102.0
201607	1429	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Otherwise, I wouldn’t be talking about this.	12.0	102.0
201607	1430	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So if you look at business investment, that has been slow, negative for quarter after quarter—there’s no question that’s been a negative.	12.0	102.0
201607	1431	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But right after, we get a torrid—a term we used back in the ’90s—rate of growth in a category, 15.6 percent, and then it falls by—I think we’re writing down minus 3 percent for Q2, something like that—it just seems a little funny to describe that as a “soft” sector, as opposed to business investment, which has clearly has shown ongoing weakness rather than a big movement up and a little movement down.	12.0	102.0
201607	1432	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even though you’re saying permits are roughly flat, starts have moved up and then they’ve moved down, and it just seems it’s harder to describe to the public why something that has been growing very rapidly is “soft.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1433	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, paragraph 1 is almost always characterized as something like “data received since the previous meeting,” so we’re not stretching back over to the beginning of the year.	12.0	96.0
201607	1434	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right, but it’s the level—“soft” is a level in a way, I think.	12.0	102.0
201607	1435	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Look, I have some sympathy for your point, in the sense that I’m not putting a lot of weight on that softness,  But I agree with the staff that it is soft over that interval.	12.0	96.0
201607	1436	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So is “soft” a relative or absolute term?	12.0	97.0
201607	1437	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, I would like to go back to what David said.	12.0	102.0
201607	1438	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The first-quarter growth rate was 15.6.	12.0	102.0
201607	1439	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you said some of that is “noise.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1440	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even if we take that at face value, then you’re really just saying that you’re taking that noise out of Q2, right?	12.0	102.0
201607	1441	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	You’re saying that the level over the two quarters is going to be up by—I’m going to have to do this math in my head—15.6 minus 3.2 divided by 2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1442	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1443	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the level is up quite a bit.	12.0	102.0
201607	1444	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Say there’s a little bit of noise that pushed up that Q1 number, and you’re taking that away in Q2.	12.0	102.0
201607	1445	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still not soft, in my view.	12.0	102.0
201607	1446	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about quarterly growth rates having some ups and downs—a theme I’m going to come back to tomorrow—overemphasis on quarterly ups and downs in some of these data series.	12.0	102.0
201607	1447	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we know that residential investment has a lot of quarterly volatility in it.	12.0	102.0
201607	1448	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I really don’t want to go to the mat over this issue that’s worth a few basis points in terms of its contribution to GDP.	12.0	999.0
201607	1449	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	If we’re going to get out the number two pencil and put a really fine point on it, we were disappointed by the most recent data on starts and permits.	12.0	999.0
201607	1450	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve marked down our near-term trajectory for single-family permits—it’s a little lower, it’s a little flatter than what it has been before.	12.0	999.0
201607	1451	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	The trajectory of single-family permits is essentially flat since the beginning of the year.	12.0	999.0
201607	1452	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	To use Governor Tarullo’s typology, I guess my answer would be “yes,” it’s soft in relative terms and in absolute terms.	12.0	999.0
201607	1453	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’re significantly below where we think the demographically indicated or neutral level of construction is.	12.0	999.0
201607	1454	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’re not going to get there for years, and the most recent tranche of data was a little disappointing.	12.0	999.0
201607	1455	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I’m going to drop it too—but in a moment.	12.0	102.0
201607	1456	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1457	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I will have an open mind.	12.0	102.0
201607	1458	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our June statement said, “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve.”	12.0	102.0
201607	1459	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you would say, “That’s no longer as true as it used to be,” and you could just kill that sentence.	12.0	102.0
201607	1460	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But what we’ve done instead is to say, “Let’s kill the ‘has continued to improve’ and say ‘is soft.’ ”	12.0	102.0
201607	1461	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s two notches down.	12.0	102.0
201607	1462	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all.	12.0	102.0
201607	1463	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m done.	12.0	102.0
201607	1464	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201607	1465	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	102.0
201607	1466	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	1467	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1468	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12.0	65.0
201607	1469	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think this probably goes to Steve.	12.0	108.0
201607	1470	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On the broad real exchange rate, we talk about the massive appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	108.0
201607	1471	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m looking at the Wilcox presentation, page 1, chart 3.	12.0	108.0
201607	1472	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That shows that from the middle of 2014 to now, we went up from 93 or thereabouts to 110, and that the increase took place, in essence, over two years.	12.0	108.0
201607	1473	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then we’ve basically got it just staying flat here.	12.0	108.0
201607	1474	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m kind of puzzled, because whenever I listen to what we’re told about what the exchange rate has done, the story varies—“recent changes in the exchange rate reduced GDP growth 1½ percentage points, or ½ percentage point, or something.”	12.0	108.0
201607	1475	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then I listen the next time, and that number has been changed because something else happened.	12.0	108.0
201607	1476	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So do we have a reliable set of data on what has happened to imports or exports because of the exchange rate, particularly imports?	12.0	108.0
201607	1477	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t have that off the top of my head, but I could certainly calculate that for you.	12.0	999.0
201607	1478	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	I will say that a couple of things are worth pointing out.	12.0	999.0
201607	1479	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Broadly speaking, our exports over the past year or so have been flat.	12.0	999.0
201607	1480	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And that would compare in some kind of steady state—normal conditions—with export growth of 3 to 5 percent.	12.0	999.0
201607	1481	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, very clearly, the rise in the dollar has depressed the growth of exports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1482	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Now, the rise in the dollar should have also led, given normal GDP growth in the United States, to strong increases in imports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1483	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And as a result of that, we should have seen pretty substantial subtractions from GDP growth from net exports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1484	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We actually have not seen that in the past few quarters.	12.0	999.0
201607	1485	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the first quarter, net exports actually contributed 0.1 percentage point to US GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201607	1486	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the second, we estimate that it subtracted about one-tenth, and there were similarly smaller numbers in the last quarters of 2015.	12.0	999.0
201607	1487	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	With the dollar depressing exports pretty much as we would expect, the mystery in some sense is why imports have been so weak.	12.0	999.0
201607	1488	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	And one possibility, of course, is that somehow exchange rates no longer are a relative price that would affect the choice between domestic and imported goods.	12.0	999.0
201607	1489	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	We have no reason to believe that is the case, although we are certainly exploring that.	12.0	999.0
201607	1490	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our best hypothesis as to what’s going on is that some components of US domestic spending that are particularly intensive in imports, particularly consumer durables and equipment investment, have been quite weak, and that has been exerting a downward effect on imports.	12.0	999.0
201607	1491	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That hypothesis is substantiated, or at least given support by, the fact that models that we’ve estimated in which imports rely not on aggregate GDP growth but rather on the growth of those particular expenditure components I just mentioned do a better job of explaining the weakness of imports recently.	12.0	999.0
201607	1492	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	By that metric, the reason that net exports are not taking away as much from GDP growth as we might imagine is not because the exchange rate appreciation has had no effect, but rather because other shocks to domestic spending have offset.	12.0	999.0
201607	1493	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	So, by and large, we think the exchange rate mechanism still works.	12.0	999.0
201607	1494	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Appreciation of the dollar has, indeed, cooled exports, but other developments in domestic spending have offset the exchange rate effect and depressed imports and have thus led to a smaller net exports drag than we might have anticipated.	12.0	999.0
201607	1495	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	And that the dollar appreciation probably plays some role in explaining why investment has been as weak as it has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1496	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Oh, absolutely.	12.0	999.0
201607	1497	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	Right.	12.0	999.0
201607	1498	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	That’s a good point because that would be a knock-on effect that would not be captured just by the net exports components.	12.0	999.0
201607	1499	2016-07-27	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, if manufacturers and exporters more generally were very chagrined about their future profitability prospects, and they reduced investment, that would not show up in net exports, exactly, but it would still be a drag on US GDP growth attributable to the appreciation of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201607	1500	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12.0	108.0
201607	1501	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	12.0	108.0
201607	1502	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So just to put our dirty laundry out a little further, it’s not unusual for us to be unable to trace dollar effects in the neat way to net exports so that the arithmetic lines up.	12.0	999.0
201607	1503	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nonetheless, when we take more of a top-line view of real GDP overall, the model estimates are loose and imprecise, but they are rules of thumb, which were the basis for the figures that I cited.	12.0	999.0
201607	1504	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	They continue to point to magnitudes of overall GDP effects that are in line with what we’ve got built in.	12.0	999.0
201607	1505	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an uncomfortable fact that tracing it through only to exports and imports doesn’t work very well.	12.0	999.0
201607	1506	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	12.0	108.0
201607	1507	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1508	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	12.0	65.0
201607	1509	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	12.0	81.0
201607	1510	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I was wondering what you know about why you now expect such a large drop in defense in the second quarter—the revision happened over just one meeting.	12.0	81.0
201607	1511	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Also, is there payback?	12.0	81.0
201607	1512	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And do you spread out the payback?	12.0	81.0
201607	1513	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve been surprised by how weak defense spending has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1514	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Glenn Follette is here and can provide more details.	12.0	999.0
201607	1515	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	Yes, we’ve been surprised at how weak defense spending has been.	12.0	999.0
201607	1516	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201607	1517	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	That’s the reason for the large downswing in our Q2 forecast.	12.0	999.0
201607	1518	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	We expect that spending should come back, but it’s not guaranteed to come back next quarter and could be spread out over time.	12.0	999.0
201607	1519	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	And so in the forecast we have defense spending coming back over the next couple of years.	12.0	999.0
201607	1520	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	One way to put it, in sort of Washington-area lingo, is that—Glenn, help me out here—there’s been no surprise in defense appropriations, but for reasons not particularly apparent to us the spend-out from the appropriations has just been slower than expected.	12.0	999.0
201607	1521	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	However, it’s going to be in the pipeline.	12.0	999.0
201607	1522	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We haven’t, as Glenn mentioned, built an immediate snapback in the level, but they will get those authorizations spent eventually.	12.0	999.0
201607	1523	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	So the appropriations that they approved last December are for a fiscal year, but those typically get spent out over a period of four or five years—about 60 percent in the first year and the rest after that.	12.0	999.0
201607	1524	2016-07-27	meeting	FOLLETTE	But it’s not always 60 percent—55, 65, whatever—so there’s some noise in the series.	12.0	999.0
201607	1525	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	12.0	81.0
201607	1526	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For what it’s worth, a contact of ours, a director in a large defense contracting firm, when asked about this, cited some large contracts whose awards were delayed.	12.0	81.0
201607	1527	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Our contact also suggested that at this time of the year—in an election year, with a change of administration—typically, a lot of the workforce who do the contract awards leave, so there are sometimes some delays from that as well, but it could come back in a couple of quarters after that.	12.0	81.0
201607	1528	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I’ll have to wait and see.	12.0	81.0
201607	1529	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	12.0	81.0
201607	1530	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	12.0	65.0
201607	1531	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201607	1532	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	1533	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s an opportunity now to comment on financial stability issues, and I’ve got two people on the list.	94.0	65.0
201607	1534	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anybody else who wishes to comment is welcome to do so as well.	94.0	65.0
201607	1535	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201607	1536	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201607	1537	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The QS report highlights the fact that CRE overvaluation remains a concern.	94.0	90.0
201607	1538	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It concludes that the effects of a sizable decline in CRE prices on financial stability are likely to be small.	94.0	90.0
201607	1539	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I remain concerned that the financial-stability risks associated with CRE are elevated.	94.0	90.0
201607	1540	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Out of the $3.6 trillion total commercial mortgages and multifamily residential mortgages, $1.8 trillion are held by the banking system.	94.0	90.0
201607	1541	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Among asset classes held by leveraged institutions, it is large, although not concentrated in particularly large institutions.	94.0	90.0
201607	1542	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also true that a significant decline in the CRE market is unlikely to occur in isolation.	94.0	90.0
201607	1543	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, if the economy does weaken, I expect that a large decline in CRE collateral value risks significantly reducing access to credit to all but the most creditworthy borrowers.	94.0	90.0
201607	1544	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such conditions conform well to the classic determinants of financial-stability problems—collateral values fall, and payment streams are interrupted.	94.0	90.0
201607	1545	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Commercial and residential price declines account for most of the significant international financial problems in the postwar period in advanced countries.	94.0	90.0
201607	1546	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once prices fall, it is obviously too late to act preemptively.	94.0	90.0
201607	1547	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, now is a great time to test the effectiveness of our preventive actions—a time when persistently low interest rates are encouraging “reach-for-yield” behavior that may eventually be disruptive.	94.0	90.0
201607	1548	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One simple anecdote illustrates my concern.	94.0	90.0
201607	1549	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the third quarter of 2014, my staff produced a table of banks with the highest ratios of total CRE to risk-based capital.	94.0	90.0
201607	1550	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Among those 50 institutions, 11 have already failed.	94.0	90.0
201607	1551	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My concern is particularly heightened because these banks have been unable to survive despite an improving economy, low interest rates, and generally rising commercial real estate prices.	94.0	90.0
201607	1552	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	These 11 banks with high CRE concentration levels represent the preponderance of the total 15 bank failures that have occurred recently.	94.0	90.0
201607	1553	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While failing in the current environment is likely illustrative of problems well beyond just commercial real estate exposure, there would seem to be an exposure level that is sufficiently high that it reflects poorly on management decisions and results in an unsafe and unsound practice that should be limited.	94.0	90.0
201607	1554	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201607	1555	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201607	1556	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	94.0	65.0
201607	1557	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201607	1558	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Over the past several weeks, we have heard a good deal of talk about investors reaching for yield.	94.0	91.0
201607	1559	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In using the word “reach,” this terminology presupposes elements of exuberance.	94.0	91.0
201607	1560	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But when you dig into some details, the recent commentary seems different than the kind of reach-for-yield behavior that often flashes red with respect to financial instability concerns.	94.0	91.0
201607	1561	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	That kind of behavior represents short-term, speculative hot money—chasing nickels in front of steamrollers—with an eye toward a quick and seemingly costless exit through rapidly closing doors when all rates begin to rise.	94.0	91.0
201607	1562	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yikes.	94.0	97.0
201607	1563	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	94.0	97.0
201607	1564	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll keep an open mind.	94.0	108.0
201607	1565	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	94.0	108.0
201607	1566	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s the kind of stuff that gave us the 2013 taper tantrum.	94.0	91.0
201607	1567	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, I don’t see this kind of activity as being behind recent market moves.	94.0	91.0
201607	1568	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Rather, to me, the recent behavior looks more like a capitulation to permanently low yields.	94.0	91.0
201607	1569	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, our bank’s insurance financial monitoring team recently hosted a meeting for President Lockhart and me with seven life insurance executives.	94.0	91.0
201607	1570	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We heard about some substantial reassessments by real money managers with long investment horizons, and, of course, insurance companies are one big piece of this group.	94.0	91.0
201607	1571	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Many of these long-duration asset managers seem to be coming around to the view that persistently slow potential output growth here and abroad will keep real interest rates low for a long time—longer than they likely acknowledged one, two, or even three years ago.	94.0	91.0
201607	1572	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	These investors now seem resigned to locking in the yields they currently can get on safe longer-term fixed-income instruments.	94.0	91.0
201607	1573	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This investment behavior also seems consistent with what we’re hearing from issuers of highly rated corporate debt.	94.0	91.0
201607	1574	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	For instance, a contact at Ford referred to an astonishing fixed-income market in which high-quality debt is routinely oversubscribed.	94.0	91.0
201607	1575	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think the capitulation hypothesis has implications for our thinking about financial vulnerability surrounding potential future monetary policy moves.	94.0	91.0
201607	1576	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Real money investors resigned to lower rates in the long run seem less likely to think that an unexpected tightening will lead to substantially higher longer-term rates.	94.0	91.0
201607	1577	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Rather, such tightening would simply flatten the yield curve.	94.0	91.0
201607	1578	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This implies a reduced risk of outsized and persistent increases in longer-term interest rates if we have to raise policy rates somewhat more quickly than what is currently envisioned in the SEPs.	94.0	91.0
201607	1579	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Put another way, perhaps it is more the case that the decline in longer- term interest rates we’ve seen in the past year or so reflects lower expected policy rates over the longer term as opposed to the large declines in term premium, such as those estimated by our stationary mean-reverting affine finance models.	94.0	91.0
201607	1580	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	91.0
201607	1581	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201607	1582	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody else who would like to comment on financial stability issues?	94.0	65.0
201607	1583	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re welcome to weigh in.	94.0	65.0
201607	1584	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	94.0	65.0
201607	1585	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201607	1586	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no takers, I suggest we begin our go-round on the economy, starting with President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201607	1587	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201607	1588	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since our previous FOMC meeting, stock prices are up, the 10-year Treasury yield has declined, credit spreads have narrowed, the VIX is below average, and the trade-weighted exchange rate is little changed.	13.0	90.0
201607	1589	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the Brexit vote is likely to have negative economic ramifications for the United Kingdom and possibly for Europe, to date the effect on US financial data has been quite benign.	13.0	90.0
201607	1590	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, while we do not have much real data that reflect the post-Brexit period, the data just before Brexit were positive.	13.0	90.0
201607	1591	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, employment rebounded strongly in June, allaying many of the concerns raised by the weak May employment report.	13.0	90.0
201607	1592	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not surprisingly, in light of the generally positive news, my forecast has changed little.	13.0	90.0
201607	1593	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It remains slightly more positive than the Tealbook forecast for the end of 2016, with real GDP slightly higher, core PCE inflation slightly higher, and the unemployment rate slightly lower.	13.0	90.0
201607	1594	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In essence, it looks quite similar to the July Blue Chip forecasts of these variables.	13.0	90.0
201607	1595	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Specifically, my forecast for the end of the year has an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent and core PCE only somewhat below 2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201607	1596	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I expect us to be quite close to achieving our dual mandate by the end of the year.	13.0	90.0
201607	1597	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Hence, it is not surprising that my forecast includes two increases in the funds rate this year, in September and December.	13.0	90.0
201607	1598	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is notable that the Tealbook expects the unemployment rate to fall to 4.3 percent by 2018.	13.0	90.0
201607	1599	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is also notable that all of the scenarios modeled in the Tealbook result in an unemployment rate of 4.3 percent or lower, with the exception of the “Severe Financial Stress in Europe” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201607	1600	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I am comfortable probing to determine how low the natural rate of unemployment may be, I view 4.3 percent as more of a plunge than a probe.	13.0	90.0
201607	1601	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is not that tight labor markets have no benefits.	13.0	90.0
201607	1602	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would like somewhat tighter labor markets than what we have now to offset some of the labor scarring that occurred in the Great Recession.	13.0	90.0
201607	1603	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, history shows that when the unemployment rate gets as low as 4.3 percent, monetary policy tightens in an attempt to raise the unemployment rate back to full employment.	13.0	90.0
201607	1604	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, almost always, our attempt to achieve a smooth landing ends poorly, as the unemployment rate responds much more than intended, resulting in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201607	1605	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	What is striking when looking at unemployment over time is how rarely we are able to keep unemployment rates near anyone’s estimate of full employment for an extended period.	13.0	90.0
201607	1606	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Put differently, part of achieving maximum employment is avoiding significant overshooting of full employment and the recession that typically follows.	13.0	90.0
201607	1607	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One possibility for caution in continuing the normalization of the funds rate might be heightened uncertainty.	13.0	90.0
201607	1608	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The buoyant stock market suggests that this uncertainty is not weighing heavily on market participants.	13.0	90.0
201607	1609	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The widely used VIX measure of uncertainty is currently well below its norm.	13.0	90.0
201607	1610	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A new, broader measure of uncertainty is the news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, which is available daily.	13.0	90.0
201607	1611	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	After being low for most of the year, it spiked for a day or two on the Brexit news and is once again at relatively low levels.	13.0	90.0
201607	1612	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One might think that greater uncertainty would lead some forecasters to predict more dire economic outcomes.	13.0	90.0
201607	1613	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Instead, the Blue Chip’s July survey of forecasters reported the average of the 10 highest forecasts of unemployment at the end of 2016 and 2017 at 4.9 percent and 4.8 percent, respectively.	13.0	90.0
201607	1614	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Perhaps the greatest tail risk right now is the one modeled in the Tealbook as “Severe Financial Stress in Europe.”	13.0	90.0
201607	1615	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that scenario, the unemployment rate peaks at 5.1 percent in 2017.	13.0	90.0
201607	1616	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even so, we continue to raise the federal funds rate but at a slower rate than in the baseline and still noticeably faster than markets currently expect.	13.0	90.0
201607	1617	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, I expect that we are likely to be close to both elements of our dual mandate by the end of the year, and I do not see the risks to the economy as being particularly elevated.	13.0	90.0
201607	1618	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss tomorrow what that implies for policy.	13.0	90.0
201607	1619	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201607	1620	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1621	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201607	1622	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201607	1623	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Both of the Fifth District surveys, just released this morning, improved in July and are now in positive territory.	13.0	81.0
201607	1624	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On the manufacturing side, the composite index swung from minus 10 to plus 10, and the new orders component swung from minus 17 to plus 15.	13.0	81.0
201607	1625	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On the services side, the overall revenue index rose from plus 2 to plus 8.	13.0	81.0
201607	1626	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The wage indexes are strongly positive across all sectors.	13.0	81.0
201607	1627	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the national level, in my mind, the overall outlook has not changed appreciably since the June meeting.	13.0	81.0
201607	1628	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Consumer spending gains are likely to account for most of the growth in real GDP this year, and the June retail sales report increased my confidence in the outlook for consumption.	13.0	81.0
201607	1629	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Other sectors are likely to contribute less to overall economic growth.	13.0	81.0
201607	1630	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Recent data suggest that homebuilding may have flattened out.	13.0	81.0
201607	1631	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We continue to hear frequent reports of residential construction being limited by shortages of buildable lots and skilled workers, so supply-side factors rather than softer demand may be what’s limiting residential investment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1632	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This view is consistent with the home price inflation that we see in the CoreLogic repeat sales index and would point toward “soft” not quite the right adjective for the housing market.	13.0	81.0
201607	1633	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Although business investment remains weak overall, there’s been at least some positive news.	13.0	81.0
201607	1634	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the latest estimate of first-quarter GDP, the growth rate for real intellectual property investment was revised from basically zero to more than 4 percent.	13.0	81.0
201607	1635	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And with the price of petroleum now above $40 per barrel, the rig count has ticked up, suggesting that spending on new oil and gas wells has bottomed out.	13.0	81.0
201607	1636	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Along with the Tealbook, I expect investment in nonresidential structures to begin to grow again in the third quarter.	13.0	81.0
201607	1637	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There are even some signs of near-term firming in equipment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1638	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, one of our roundtable members from the trade association representing what we used to call “machine tools”—they call themselves the Association for Manufacturing Technology now—reported a substantial increase in requests for price quotations in recent months.	13.0	81.0
201607	1639	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At the end of each quarter, he surveys, a couple of dozen contacts within the industry.	13.0	81.0
201607	1640	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	He expects the price quotations to lead to increased orders later this year and bases that on the rate at which these are converted.	13.0	81.0
201607	1641	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They’re expecting a good finish to 2016 and things to pick up in 2017 by10 to 20 percent.	13.0	81.0
201607	1642	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This seems consistent with the Tealbook outlook for investment in equipment.	13.0	81.0
201607	1643	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	My overall outlook, then, is for strong growth in consumer spending and improving growth in business investment to offset a slowdown in housing and yield 2 percent real GDP growth for the next few quarters.	13.0	81.0
201607	1644	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In the labor market, I think we should see falling employment growth this year and very little further decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	81.0
201607	1645	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	With the benefit of the June employment report, it now seems clear that the May payroll number was a fluke.	13.0	81.0
201607	1646	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	That said, employment growth has averaged 147,000 jobs per month in the second quarter compared with 229,000 jobs per month last year.	13.0	81.0
201607	1647	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So it’s pretty clear that we’ve seen some step-down in employment growth.	13.0	81.0
201607	1648	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But even at the current pace, the employment-to-population ratio would continue to rise, and that seems unlikely to go on for much longer.	13.0	81.0
201607	1649	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	As I’ve been arguing since the beginning of the year, I think we should be prepared to see monthly job growth continue to fall, consistent with convergence to a more sustainable steady-state trajectory, notwithstanding President Rosengren’s caution about actually being able to achieve that.	13.0	81.0
201607	1650	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On inflation, I would note that in December, the Tealbook was forecasting 1.4 percent core PCE inflation for both Q1 and Q2 of this year.	13.0	81.0
201607	1651	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now the forecast is for 1.9 percent for the first half, but the forecast for the second half is basically unchanged.	13.0	81.0
201607	1652	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Some of that first-half miss can plausibly be attributed to one-time factors and residual seasonality.	13.0	81.0
201607	1653	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I doubt that all of the pickup in core inflation in the first half is going to prove short lived, so I’m expecting core inflation in the second half to come in close to 2 percent as well.	13.0	81.0
201607	1654	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13.0	81.0
201607	1655	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1656	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201607	1657	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201607	1658	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If we remember where we were six to seven weeks ago, that’s when we decided that the situation was significantly unclear.	13.0	108.0
201607	1659	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, we had the May hiring figure, which we then thought was 70,000—and now know to be 11,000—and we were worried that something bad was going on in the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201607	1660	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then we had the UK referendum just a little less than a week after the meeting, and there was no good reason whatever to make a decision before we knew what happened there.	13.0	108.0
201607	1661	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So we had two reasons.	13.0	108.0
201607	1662	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now we have come through both those reasons pretty well.	13.0	108.0
201607	1663	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The employment number came out at 287,000 for June, as you know, and a little bit of arithmetic made that to be 147,000 per month over the previous three months, which was less than we had forecast four months ago but well above the estimates we have of how much hiring you need in order to keep the unemployment rate from rising.	13.0	108.0
201607	1664	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So that looked okay.	13.0	108.0
201607	1665	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then we had to think about Brexit, if you’ll excuse the expression.	13.0	108.0
201607	1666	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I happened to be near the scene of the crime and woke up at about 2:30 in the morning and turned on the TV, and it was clear it was going to be a disaster, so I went back to sleep.	13.0	108.0
201607	1667	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201607	1668	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	At 5:30 or so you got the truth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1669	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That Friday morning there were quite a few people from the UK in the seminar we were in, and they and we all were feeling very unhappy, and we could imagine terrible scenarios of the breakup of the European Union and all sorts of things that were going to happen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1670	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, where are we now?	13.0	108.0
201607	1671	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We shouldn’t, I think, delude ourselves that the United Kingdom is in for an easy time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1672	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They have got a lot of negotiating to do.	13.0	108.0
201607	1673	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We always want structural change in Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1674	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the British are undertaking a massive structural change.	13.0	108.0
201607	1675	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	They are going to have to renegotiate their entire set of external relations.	13.0	108.0
201607	1676	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s a lot of work.	13.0	108.0
201607	1677	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then they’re going to have to actually implement what they negotiated.	13.0	108.0
201607	1678	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So this is going to take a long time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1679	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s going to be complicated and probably take five years until they have done most of what they need to do.	13.0	108.0
201607	1680	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And during that time we will get bumped around from time to time.	13.0	108.0
201607	1681	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In negotiations like that there are always crisis points, and there are late-night negotiations and concern that the thing is about to break down, and at three o’clock in the morning it transpires that they got a compromise, and so forth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1682	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re going to see those things coming our way from time to time, and they’re going to make our environment a little bit more bumpy than we would have wanted, but they will make it a lot more bumpy for the United Kingdom, and they could make it more bumpy for the rest of Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1683	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are very worrying scenarios about the future of the European Union.	13.0	108.0
201607	1684	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	According to people I speak to and read about, the reaction in Europe actually, at this stage, is, “Gosh, we don’t want to be in the situation like the British are in at the moment.”	13.0	108.0
201607	1685	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So they think it strengthened the European Union.	13.0	108.0
201607	1686	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	However this is after a month- plus, and the actual events are going to play out over several years.	13.0	108.0
201607	1687	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We know very little about what’s actually going to happen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1688	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think that in terms of the United States, the United Kingdom is relatively small from our perspective, with the exception of the financial side, and that the effect on us will come in part through whether our banks stay in London and what happens to London as a great financial center.	13.0	108.0
201607	1689	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	At this moment, the Europeans think they are going to attract it all to Europe.	13.0	108.0
201607	1690	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not entirely clear, but one hears stories about our banks planning their moves or moves of part of their corporations.	13.0	108.0
201607	1691	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The first political news in the United Kingdom was the public opinion poll taken earlier this week, which showed people being very shocked and expectations being very negative.	13.0	108.0
201607	1692	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Bank of England has made it clear it’s going to do something at its August decision, and the ECB has been a little less clear that it’s going to do something.	13.0	108.0
201607	1693	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But both of them seem to think they’re going to do packages—that is, that it won’t be just an interest rate reduction, but an interest rate reduction and some other elements of QE or possibly forward guidance or whatever there is in the bag of tricks at that point.	13.0	108.0
201607	1694	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So something positive will come out of all that, but we’re fairly ignorant.	13.0	108.0
201607	1695	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There hasn’t been a great deal of evidence of difficulty in the capital markets.	13.0	108.0
201607	1696	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In the case of the United Kingdom, the pound depreciated, as one would have expected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1697	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Interest rates are down significantly, as one would have expected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1698	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Bank share prices are down a long way, and there were rumors of liquidity difficulties in the first days after the referendum, and then there were those real estate mutual funds that had to suspend withdrawals.	13.0	108.0
201607	1699	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But it wasn’t a huge thing.	13.0	108.0
201607	1700	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	For the United States, aside from our banks, there hasn’t been a whole lot of the share market that’s been very affected.	13.0	108.0
201607	1701	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So it hasn’t been big for us and probably won’t be big for us, provided we continue to manage ourselves well.	13.0	108.0
201607	1702	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But what about conditions in our economy?	13.0	108.0
201607	1703	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m impressed by the robustness of what has been happening.	13.0	108.0
201607	1704	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I keep thinking of the fact that we’ve just had a series of negative shocks.	13.0	108.0
201607	1705	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I feel very guilty about this, because when I arrived at the IMF in 1994, my arrival was followed three months later by the Mexican crisis, and there was a crisis every few months until the Argentine crisis when I left, and then nothing happened for three or four years.	13.0	108.0
201607	1706	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201607	1707	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They were worried about having a crisis without you there, Stan.	13.0	97.0
201607	1708	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s right.	13.0	108.0
201607	1709	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I feel a little bit guilty about all of these things that have happened to us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1710	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But after the things that have happened to us over the past year or so, including the Chinese letting their exchange rate go—which they seem to be continuing to do in a very controlled manner at the moment as well—and then Brexit and a succession of things that worried us, the economy looks quite similar to what it looked like before except that we’re on a lower path.	13.0	108.0
201607	1711	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Economic growth has been down a little bit, but we’re expecting a catch-up.	13.0	108.0
201607	1712	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And somewhere in this economy and in the labor market, in ways we, or at least I, don’t understand there’s something very robust that’s been happening for a lot of years as employment growth continues, except for that terrible month that worried us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1713	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at the components of aggregate demand, PCE growth has contributed in a major way to GDP growth.	13.0	108.0
201607	1714	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Investment continues to be weak.	13.0	108.0
201607	1715	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know if we can call investment performance “weak.”	13.0	108.0
201607	1716	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Investment has been weak for a long time, and I think we may just be at a new normal on investment, although there are some stories now about US oil production beginning to come back, and that would presumably bring with it some of the associated investment whose disappearance helped reduce aggregate investment for the US economy.	13.0	108.0
201607	1717	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If you look at the rest of the world, Europe is very unknowable.	13.0	108.0
201607	1718	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The Chinese are somewhere around 6 percent, which is fairly good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1719	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But the nature of Chinese economic growth has changed, and it’s less investment intensive, so they’re importing less from the rest of the world than they used to.	13.0	108.0
201607	1720	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	It seems that what they were importing was based more on an acceleration model than on a straightforward multiplier model, and so that’s a slowdown.	13.0	108.0
201607	1721	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then Latin America is just changing disaster places.	13.0	108.0
201607	1722	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now we’ve got Venezuela instead of Argentina and so forth, but there are some positive signs there.	13.0	108.0
201607	1723	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Africa doesn’t look very good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1724	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	India does look very good.	13.0	108.0
201607	1725	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So the rest of the world is not terrible, but it’s not great.	13.0	108.0
201607	1726	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	If we look at other things that might happen here, the money market mutual fund reforms that are coming seem to me to be bothersome, but they’re all anticipated, so maybe they’re not going to be a bother.	13.0	108.0
201607	1727	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we can take some comfort in the fiscal policies we’re going to get whoever wins the elections, because, as far as I can see, both candidates are going to raise spending.	13.0	108.0
201607	1728	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	One’s going to cut taxes—that’s expansionary.	13.0	108.0
201607	1729	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The other’s going to raise spending.	13.0	108.0
201607	1730	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So a year from now we could have a fiscally driven expansion, if all works out, and that will be good for us.	13.0	108.0
201607	1731	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, unfortunately, I don’t know if we’re going to have that.	13.0	108.0
201607	1732	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I won’t make any policy recommendations until tomorrow, but we’re in a situation that is way better than we feared it might be at our previous meeting, and we’re just probably going to wait a little while to see if the situation continues to strengthen.	13.0	108.0
201607	1733	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201607	1734	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1735	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201607	1736	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201607	1737	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I read the incoming data as largely consistent with the view of the economy summarized as follows:  continuing moderate economic growth, near full employment but with some absorbable slack remaining, and signs of gradually rising price pressures with associated movement toward the Committee’s target.	13.0	88.0
201607	1738	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My Bank’s tracking estimate for the second quarter now rests at a 2.4 percent annualized rate, a little stronger than the number in the Tealbook.	13.0	88.0
201607	1739	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In terms of the composition of GDP growth in the second quarter, distinctions between our assessment of the second quarter and the Tealbook are minor.	13.0	88.0
201607	1740	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Business investment remains soft, and that softness is broad based.	13.0	88.0
201607	1741	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The current strength of the economy is largely based on the strength of consumer activity.	13.0	88.0
201607	1742	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Reports from our retail contacts in my District this cycle confirm the strength in consumer spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1743	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Most retailers reported healthy sales levels and a relatively optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2016.	13.0	88.0
201607	1744	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Tourism remains solid, and we heard of a shift in the composition of demand away from international visitors and toward domestic travelers.	13.0	88.0
201607	1745	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In recent meetings, I’ve passed along reports of our director who heads the nation’s largest auto retailer.	13.0	88.0
201607	1746	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He continues to report very high sales volumes but cautions that high fleet sales are in the mix, and consumer sales are being maintained by substantial discounts and incentives.	13.0	88.0
201607	1747	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Whereas, after the May employment report, there seemed to me to be some disconnect between data and anecdote, recent reports from our business contacts in the Sixth District are mostly consistent with my read of the incoming data.	13.0	88.0
201607	1748	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook for the economy remains unchanged from the June meeting and from my last SEP submission.	13.0	88.0
201607	1749	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook resembles this meeting’s Tealbook, with the only exception being that my forecast anticipates a slightly faster closing to the inflation target.	13.0	88.0
201607	1750	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Recent retail price reports are broadly in line with my assumption of firming inflation readings.	13.0	88.0
201607	1751	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	These reports have been encouraging but not definitive.	13.0	88.0
201607	1752	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff cautions that recent component price movements underlying the inflation reports exhibit unusual disparity.	13.0	88.0
201607	1753	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A key assumption in my outlook is an improvement in the pace of business investment.	13.0	88.0
201607	1754	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This assumption carries some risk.	13.0	88.0
201607	1755	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In the most recent contact cycle, my team took every opportunity to probe thinking on capital spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1756	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While most of our conversations suggested some longer-term optimism about prospects for expansionary, capacity-building cap-ex, we heard little that would suggest a near-term resurgence in spending.	13.0	88.0
201607	1757	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Current capital investment is depicted mostly as replacement, oriented toward productivity improvement, or focused on cost takeout.	13.0	88.0
201607	1758	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Some contacts mentioned their excess capacity; we also heard comments on new foreign-sourced product competition responding to global capacity and the stronger dollar.	13.0	88.0
201607	1759	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A number of companies repeated that M&A is their preferred growth strategy.	13.0	88.0
201607	1760	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Acquisitions bring their own incremental revenues and demand.	13.0	88.0
201607	1761	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms continue to be cautious about assumptions of organic growth.	13.0	88.0
201607	1762	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Businesses continue to report little in the way of direct pricing power.	13.0	88.0
201607	1763	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I would note, however, that some retailers indicated that price promotions had eased.	13.0	88.0
201607	1764	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Other firms indicated that they have been able to capture and retain commodity cost reductions in their margins.	13.0	88.0
201607	1765	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, a number of public companies noted greater pressure coming from investors to justify capital investments and, implicitly, higher return hurdles and shorter payback horizons.	13.0	88.0
201607	1766	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So business fixed investment is a sphere of activity in which anecdotal feedback is not currently lining up well with my forecast assumption.	13.0	88.0
201607	1767	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	At this time, I’m prepared to treat business fixed investment as a risk—the risk being a failure to realize an assumed upside.	13.0	88.0
201607	1768	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If improved business investment does not materialize, the outlook on which I’m premising further policy rate increases cannot easily rely on personal consumption in isolation.	13.0	88.0
201607	1769	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Investment, enhanced productivity growth, wage growth, and rising business and consumer confidence must be part of the picture.	13.0	88.0
201607	1770	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Others have commented on the uncertainty factors associated with Brexit.	13.0	88.0
201607	1771	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The outcome of the July 23 Brexit referendum seems to have affected business confidence in the immediate aftermath, but recent soundings suggest that concern among business leaders in my District is modest.	13.0	88.0
201607	1772	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In the week following the referendum, we got 244 responses to a survey of CEOs and CFOs, and roughly one-third indicated Brexit had introduced some uncertainty into their individual business outlooks.	13.0	88.0
201607	1773	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In a second survey a week later of nearly 400 CEOs and CFOs, the portion of firms reporting Brexit affecting their sales had dropped sharply to only about 15 percent.	13.0	88.0
201607	1774	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m satisfied that we’ve gotten beyond the immediate uncertainty that drove the Committee’s caution at the June meeting, and I see the appropriate focus in coming weeks being mostly on domestic economic performance.	13.0	88.0
201607	1775	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201607	1776	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1777	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201607	1778	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201607	1779	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	At the time of the June meeting, three factors raised concerns about the economy’s underlying momentum.	13.0	104.0
201607	1780	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	First, economic growth appeared to have downshifted from its long-time post-crisis path of about 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201607	1781	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, payroll growth seemed to be slowing, possibly quite sharply.	13.0	104.0
201607	1782	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A third factor was the impending referendum, to use the Kamin-friendly term.	13.0	104.0
201607	1783	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the June meeting, incoming data have provided some reassurance on all three fronts.	13.0	104.0
201607	1784	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Most forecasts show second-quarter GDP rebounding nicely to the mid-2s, although, at 1.8 percent, our Tealbook forecast is lower than that and at the low end of the estimates.	13.0	104.0
201607	1785	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the BEA, of course, will provide a first official estimate for second-quarter GDP growth later this week.	13.0	104.0
201607	1786	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The June payroll report was surprisingly strong, as has been noted.	13.0	104.0
201607	1787	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the referendum vote, while a surprise, seems likely to have little near-term implications for the US outlook.	13.0	104.0
201607	1788	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning to economic growth, GDP growth has now been only 1.6 percent over the past four quarters ending in the second quarter, taking the staff forecast for the second quarter.	13.0	104.0
201607	1789	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The same figure for the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2015, as Glenn Follette pointed out yesterday, was 1 full percentage point higher.	13.0	104.0
201607	1790	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	A good part of that downshift has been in business investment, which goes well beyond the energy sector, for which low oil prices provide a sufficient explanation for the decline.	13.0	104.0
201607	1791	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And, of course, a lower path for cap-ex reduces the likelihood that we will see a near-term rebound from the awful productivity growth we have had.	13.0	104.0
201607	1792	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s also a signal perhaps that businesses’ expectations for further growth have moved down, as a Tealbook box indicated.	13.0	104.0
201607	1793	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And then, echoing what President Lockhart just said, it’s hard to see, as a matter of arithmetic, how we get back to sustainable 2 percent GDP growth without higher investment as another engine of demand.	13.0	104.0
201607	1794	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Consumption alone is not likely to be a strong enough engine.	13.0	104.0
201607	1795	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The 15 percent or so appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 has been weighing on demand through net exports, including some that is counted as E&I spending.	13.0	104.0
201607	1796	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the dollar remains broadly stable, that effect should wane over the next year or two.	13.0	104.0
201607	1797	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Like many others, I have thought of the outsized appreciation of the dollar as a tightening in overall financial conditions, which David Wilcox estimated earlier, if I followed him correctly, in the range of 150 to 200 basis points.	13.0	104.0
201607	1798	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But 2016 has actually been a time of significant loosening in financial conditions.	13.0	104.0
201607	1799	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the beginning of the year, the dollar is about flat on a trade-weighted basis, stock prices are up, and the 10-year Treasury is down 70 basis points.	13.0	104.0
201607	1800	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And the implied federal funds rate path has flattened significantly.	13.0	104.0
201607	1801	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So the tightening cycle that began in December 2015 with a single rate hike has actually so far been a period of significant loosening.	13.0	104.0
201607	1802	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Perhaps others on the Committee are still taking on board the full extent of the decline in the neutral rate of interest.	13.0	104.0
201607	1803	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That has certainly been the case for me.	13.0	104.0
201607	1804	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In any case, it is notable to me that the apparent weakening in demand and in job growth is happening even as anticipated policy is becoming materially more accommodative.	13.0	104.0
201607	1805	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In effect, monetary policy has had to work harder and harder just to sustain a fairly weak economic growth forecast.	13.0	104.0
201607	1806	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	To me, this argues for patience and a bit of caution, not panic.	13.0	104.0
201607	1807	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Some of the apparent slowdown in demand probably reflects transitory factors or statistical noise.	13.0	104.0
201607	1808	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The fundamentals driving household and business spending still seem quite supportive of economic growth, including solid increases in real income, accommodative financial conditions, low gas prices, and healthy levels of business and household confidence.	13.0	104.0
201607	1809	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, this easing of financial conditions should add a bit of momentum in the second half.	13.0	104.0
201607	1810	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Accordingly, despite the lackluster first-half performance, I still see 2 percent GDP growth or thereabouts for 2016, although I would say there is some modest downside risk to that.	13.0	104.0
201607	1811	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Turning briefly to the labor market, the pace of job growth is far from clear, with 11,000 new payroll jobs in May and 287,000 in June.	13.0	104.0
201607	1812	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We’re going to need a couple more readings to assess the new trend.	13.0	104.0
201607	1813	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It does seem likely that the pace of job gains is slowing, down to an average rate of about 150,000 in the second quarter.	13.0	104.0
201607	1814	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	That is enough to drive further declines in unemployment or increases in participation or both, albeit at a slower pace.	13.0	104.0
201607	1815	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see this downshift as desirable or necessary to avoid overheating.	13.0	104.0
201607	1816	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Desirable or not, though, the downshift has probably arrived, and it is tolerable as long as payrolls are increasing faster than the breakeven rate.	13.0	104.0
201607	1817	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Core PCE inflation was 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in May, up from 1.3 percent a year earlier, still being held down by the indirect effects of lower oil prices and the stronger dollar.	13.0	104.0
201607	1818	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Looking through those transient factors, I see the underlying inflation rate as close to 2 percent, suggesting that inflation should move up to our target as these influences fade.	13.0	104.0
201607	1819	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Low inflation expectations remain a concern.	13.0	104.0
201607	1820	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Downside risks to the outlook have diminished, although the risks in the international arena remain substantial.	13.0	104.0
201607	1821	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The referendum is probably not an important near-term risk for us, but, as Stan indicated, the coming period of negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union could well involve risk-off episodes, and we could feel those here in the United States.	13.0	104.0
201607	1822	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the weaker condition of the European banking system will restrain European economic growth while also creating some tail risk of broader financial turmoil.	13.0	104.0
201607	1823	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More generally, European and Japanese authorities have limited remaining scope to address ongoing weakness and any new shocks.	13.0	104.0
201607	1824	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And while data regarding China have been positive, the need for its authorities to turn to stimulus measures suggests that the risks are concentrated on the downside there as well.	13.0	104.0
201607	1825	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	In sum, I expect both spending and labor market data to remain solid for the next few quarters, with inflation still quiescent.	13.0	104.0
201607	1826	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It is to our advantage to see more data to get a better assessment of the underlying strength of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201607	1827	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201607	1828	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201607	1829	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1830	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201607	1831	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201607	1832	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The most noteworthy event of the intermeeting period was the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the EU.	13.0	107.0
201607	1833	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s reassuring that financial markets proved resilient in the wake of the vote, although this development increases uncertainty in the global outlook.	13.0	107.0
201607	1834	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In parallel, reassuring reports on real activity in the United States, in particular the June reports on employment and retail sales, have reduced concerns about an abrupt slowing in domestic demand growth.	13.0	107.0
201607	1835	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, reductions in the pace of job gains and GDP growth over the past few quarters suggest a notable slowing in economic momentum.	13.0	107.0
201607	1836	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me take each of these developments in turn.	13.0	107.0
201607	1837	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	First, recent developments have reduced some near-term uncertainty that weighed on the outlook at our previous meeting.	13.0	107.0
201607	1838	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Most importantly, financial markets have appeared resilient in the face of the “leave” vote.	13.0	107.0
201607	1839	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	After an initial selloff in risky assets US financial conditions appear little changed, on net, apart from a modest increase in the exchange rate.	13.0	107.0
201607	1840	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the Brexit vote outcome surprised many, it’s important to note that policymakers were well aware of the possibility in advance and took precautionary steps.	13.0	107.0
201607	1841	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the market reaction appears to reflect, in part, expectations of additional policy support in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201607	1842	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Here at home, we’ve had some reassuring data on the labor market and aggregate spending.	13.0	107.0
201607	1843	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment growth bounced back sharply in June after registering essentially no gain in May.	13.0	107.0
201607	1844	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting data on wages have been consistent with previous signs of a moderate step-up in wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201607	1845	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And the labor force participation rate ticked back up last month and appears to have been about flat over the past two years, consistent with continued moderate cyclical improvement.	13.0	107.0
201607	1846	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumption has also proven robust.	13.0	107.0
201607	1847	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	After weak first-quarter growth, consumption likely increased strongly last quarter and looks to have advanced at close to a 3 percent pace over the first half of the year, a value similar to the average pace over the past two years.	13.0	107.0
201607	1848	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, it’s important to note that consumption accounted for virtually all of GDP growth over the past two years and continues to be the main driver of aggregate demand.	13.0	107.0
201607	1849	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Buoyant sentiment, further gains in equity and home prices, and continued growth in jobs and wages should continue to provide support.	13.0	107.0
201607	1850	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, we see a notable slowing in economic momentum in other components.	13.0	107.0
201607	1851	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Taking the staff’s Q2 forecast as given, GDP has risen at an average annual rate of about 1½ percent over the past three quarters compared with growth of 2 percent last year and 2½ percent in the preceding two years.	13.0	107.0
201607	1852	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Business investment, as has been noted, has been a particular drag.	13.0	107.0
201607	1853	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This likely reflects the earlier depressing effects of a higher dollar and lower oil prices.	13.0	107.0
201607	1854	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In the period ahead, it may be that uncertainty associated with the weak global outlook, an election year, and now Brexit, may be restraining investment.	13.0	107.0
201607	1855	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, it appears that the credit cycle may be turning.	13.0	107.0
201607	1856	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Data from the SLOOS point to a marked tightening in standards for CRE loans as well as a modest tightening in C&I loan standards.	13.0	107.0
201607	1857	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Residential investment has also slowed as single-family building permits have flattened out.	13.0	107.0
201607	1858	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We might expect housing activity to strengthen in coming months as house prices continue to increase, as they did today.	13.0	107.0
201607	1859	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Mortgage rates are extremely low, and credit conditions for well- qualified borrowers have eased further, according to the SLOOS, but it’s also possible that the sluggish recovery and recent flattening out in residential investment could reflect a lasting change that will continue to hold the growth in new units below levels suggested by demographics.	13.0	107.0
201607	1860	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment growth has also slowed in recent quarters, as has been noted.	13.0	107.0
201607	1861	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Monthly payroll gains averaged about 150,000 over the previous quarter, a notable step-down from 200,000 in the first quarter and 230,000 last year, and it appears that this has happened despite the fact that some slack in the labor market remains.	13.0	107.0
201607	1862	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The prime-age employment-to-population ratio is still 1¾ percentage points below its pre-crisis level, and the number of workers working part time for economic reasons is still elevated.	13.0	107.0
201607	1863	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, recent data on price inflation suggest little evidence that resource constraints are starting to bind, and the greater concern may be soft inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201607	1864	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The most recent 12-month change in core PCE, at 1.6 percent, remains below our target, and core inflation has now been below the target for 88 of the past 92 months.	13.0	107.0
201607	1865	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m concerned by any signs that inflation expectations will remain soft.	13.0	107.0
201607	1866	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent changes in survey measures of inflation expectations from Michigan and the New York Federal Reserve were positive, but they still remain below their pre-crisis norms, and inflation compensation remains stubbornly mired at an extremely low level.	13.0	107.0
201607	1867	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite the limited near-term fallout from the leave vote, the associated medium-term risks, I think, are still weighed to the downside.	13.0	107.0
201607	1868	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s still too early to know what the macroeconomic reaction to the process of redefining the relationship with the EU will be, but both staff forecasts and the IMF do project a materially slower growth rate in the United Kingdom and somewhat slower growth in the euro area.	13.0	107.0
201607	1869	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	July’s PMI reading for the United Kingdom was consistent with that outcome.	13.0	107.0
201607	1870	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Unfortunately, this expected slowing occurs at a time when weak European growth was already a concern, and the ECB is not in a great position to respond to it.	13.0	107.0
201607	1871	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The step-down in demand will pose challenges to European banks, which have struggled with low capital ratios and stagnant earnings, and to the ECB’s attainment of its inflation target.	13.0	107.0
201607	1872	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Italian banks, as has been noted earlier, are a particular concern, as a decade and a half of poor macroeconomic performance has led to a large rise in nonperforming loans.	13.0	107.0
201607	1873	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The combination of EU requirements of private debt bail-ins and a significant and vocal number of retail investors in the Italian bank debt makes the recapitalization process very complicated.	13.0	107.0
201607	1874	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Prior to the leave vote, the ECB was already struggling to meet its inflation target, and the fragile position of European banks appears to be limiting the ECB’s policy options by reducing the attractiveness of further reductions in short rates or further flattening of the yield curve.	13.0	107.0
201607	1875	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Beyond the immediate hit to economic growth, the leave vote also ushers in a period of uncertainty that could see bouts of financial volatility associated with the negotiations or political events in other European countries.	13.0	107.0
201607	1876	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also worth noting that China remains another prominent locus of global downside risks.	13.0	107.0
201607	1877	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While the recent data provide reassurance on near-term economic growth and capital outflows, risks over the medium term are likely continuing to build.	13.0	107.0
201607	1878	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Much of the near-term boost to the economy appears to have been provided by a large policy-induced jump in debt growth, which is a worrying development in an economy with an uncomfortably high corporate debt-to-GDP ratio.	13.0	107.0
201607	1879	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	There has also been little coherence in plans to reduce capacity in state- owned enterprises, which is necessary for successful rebalancing.	13.0	107.0
201607	1880	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And China’s monetary policy and exchange rate framework remain extremely opaque and subject to considerable discretion, with the currency recently depreciating noticeably against both the dollar and the designated basket of currencies despite a stated commitment that targets stability against the basket.	13.0	107.0
201607	1881	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, negative surprises in China and Europe pose risks to the United States through weaker demand, heightened volatility, and exchange rate appreciation.	13.0	107.0
201607	1882	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And, as was highlighted in two presentations earlier, dollar movements and reactions to surprises have been quite elevated in recent months, and the feed-through to the US outlook has been very material.	13.0	107.0
201607	1883	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Pulling all of these pieces together, I, like Governor Powell, believe that additional data will be very important in assessing how much slack remains and how responsive inflation is likely to be to rising resource utilization as we also assess how resilient our economy is to downside risks beyond our borders.	13.0	107.0
201607	1884	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	When uncertainty about the cyclical position of the economy is relatively large, as it appears to be at present, the chances of policy settings being either too accommodative or too tight are higher, which puts a high premium on being attentive to the balance of risks.	13.0	107.0
201607	1885	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With risks skewed to the downside and with less conventional policy space to deal with adverse shocks than with upside shocks, the costs of adjusting policy in anticipation of favorable data are likely greater than waiting to remove the accommodation until the data provide a higher level of certainty that such a policy adjustment is warranted.	13.0	107.0
201607	1886	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we will return to this topic tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201607	1887	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201607	1888	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1889	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201607	1890	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201607	1891	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Soft commodity prices have weighed on the 10th District economy, with both employment and wage growth slowing over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201607	1892	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In energy-intensive states, the downturn in the energy sector has spread to other segments of the local economy.	13.0	103.0
201607	1893	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	State budgets are making substantial adjustments in response to falling tax revenue, particularly in states like Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico.	13.0	103.0
201607	1894	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In the ag sector, corn futures prices have fallen sharply, and cattle prices have continued to decline.	13.0	103.0
201607	1895	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The persistent downturn in the farm economy has continued to drive demand for agricultural loans, and our recent Agricultural Finance Databook shows past-due farm loans are starting to trend modestly higher.	13.0	103.0
201607	1896	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Despite these areas of weakness, the District economy overall continues to grow modestly.	13.0	103.0
201607	1897	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Layoff announcements have abated.	13.0	103.0
201607	1898	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Residential construction activity is picking up outside of energy states, and both our services and manufacturing surveys indicate expanding activity in June.	13.0	103.0
201607	1899	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, incoming data since the previous meeting have largely supported my economic outlook.	13.0	103.0
201607	1900	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The employment report for June suggested that the soft May number was more noise than signal, and the burst of market uncertainty following the UK referendum vote has largely subsided, even with significant questions remaining.	13.0	103.0
201607	1901	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In general, I continue to expect moderate economic growth and an inflation rate rising toward 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201607	1902	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Consumers appear well positioned to continue to move the economy forward.	13.0	103.0
201607	1903	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Growth in consumer spending is expected to exceed 4 percent in the second quarter, and consumer confidence readings for current conditions have remained high in July.	13.0	103.0
201607	1904	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continued improvement in the labor market should support the consumer, although I do expect some deceleration in the pace of employment growth that is consistent with an economy at or near full employment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1905	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	My staff projects employment growth to average about 150,000 per month for the remainder of the year, well above the pace of labor force growth.	13.0	103.0
201607	1906	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This projection is supported by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s Labor Market Conditions indicator, which shows that although labor market momentum has eased from a high level at the beginning of the year, the current reading remains well above the historical average.	13.0	103.0
201607	1907	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	While the outlook for consumption remains solid, as others have noted, weakness in business fixed investment persists, and in that regard I appreciated the analysis in the Tealbook box on this topic.	13.0	103.0
201607	1908	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As I look at the categories of equipment investment, two things stand out to me.	13.0	103.0
201607	1909	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	First are the influences related to the energy and agricultural sectors as well as the headwinds faced by the manufacturing sector that have weighed on equipment investment the past two years.	13.0	103.0
201607	1910	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This shows up clearly in falling equipment investment in mining and oil field machinery, agricultural machinery, and railroad equipment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1911	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The second factor is the notable slowing in the pace of growth for computer and peripheral equipment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1912	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Spending in the remaining equipment categories, however, is increasing at a pace roughly consistent with past expansions.	13.0	103.0
201607	1913	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This suggests to me that the softness in equipment investment is not broad based but may instead reflect special factors in those areas.	13.0	103.0
201607	1914	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	A weaker path of residential investment is highlighted in the Tealbook’s near-term outlook, and although I would agree that growth in this category is likely to decelerate, I would not have categorized the sector as being soft.	13.0	103.0
201607	1915	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Residential investment has been the fastest- growing NIPA component since late 2014.	13.0	103.0
201607	1916	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Some recent slowing in single-family permitting could well reflect a limited amount of land for new development in desired locations, and steady increases in housing prices suggest demand remains relatively strong.	13.0	103.0
201607	1917	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	CoreLogic house prices have increased in the past six months at a pace similar to that in 2015.	13.0	103.0
201607	1918	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, home renovations have been increasing, which is a category that accounts for a large share of residential investment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1919	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, I expect this sector to continue making positive contributions to GDP growth with ongoing home renovations and steady home sales, which support brokers’ commissions, another substantial component of residential investment.	13.0	103.0
201607	1920	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I see inflation as consistent with our statutory goal of price stability.	13.0	103.0
201607	1921	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Year-over- year, core PCE inflation has increased to 1.6 percent in May, and the core CPI index has increased 2.3 percent over the past year.	13.0	103.0
201607	1922	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, longer-term expectations look consistent with our goal.	13.0	103.0
201607	1923	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I took note of the special question in the recent Survey of Professional Forecasters, which asked, “Is your long-run forecast of PCE inflation different from 2 percent by an amount you consider economically meaningful?”	13.0	103.0
201607	1924	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And its follow-up was, if so, explain why.	13.0	103.0
201607	1925	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Responses indicate that 24 of 32 forecasters have a long-run inflation forecast in the vicinity of 2 percent.	13.0	103.0
201607	1926	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	The 8 forecasters who submitted long-run expectations meaningfully different from 2 percent all had expectations above it and not below.	13.0	103.0
201607	1927	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And 6 of those 8 pointed to monetary policy as the reason for their above-target long-run inflation forecast.	13.0	103.0
201607	1928	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I also found the recent release of the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations reassuring, as the median inflation expectations at the three-year-ahead horizon increased from 2.7 percent in May to 2.9 percent in June.	13.0	103.0
201607	1929	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201607	1930	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1931	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201607	1932	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201607	1933	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This year has been a challenging one for the 11th District primarily because of weak oil prices, particularly in the first quarter, as well as a strong dollar.	13.0	110.0
201607	1934	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Job growth during the first quarter was revised down by the Texas Workforce Commission, which now estimates that it was negative 1.3 percent, annualized.	13.0	110.0
201607	1935	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Consistent with that, we have changed our overall forecast for 2016 job growth for Texas to just ½ percent versus 1.3 percent last year and 3.7 percent in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201607	1936	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Our most recent Texas outlook surveys show some stability in the manufacturing sector after several months of declines and continued growth in the services sector.	13.0	110.0
201607	1937	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Home sales and prices continue to firm for most major Texas metro areas except Houston.	13.0	110.0
201607	1938	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Texas exports through May year-to-date are down approximately 4 percent, year over year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1939	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is primarily due to, again, the strong dollar and weak global growth outlook.	13.0	110.0
201607	1940	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We think our exports will remain weak for the remainder of 2016, which is very significant for Texas.	13.0	110.0
201607	1941	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We are a large exporter; exports are about 16 percent of the state’s GDP, so the weakness is a significant drag.	13.0	110.0
201607	1942	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Contacts report little evidence of wage pressure, at least in our District, other than, as we’ve said before, in skilled trades, high-tech manufacturing, legal services, construction trades, IT, and so on.	13.0	110.0
201607	1943	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In the energy sector, with substantial cuts to rig count and capital spending over the past two years, US oil production is estimated at approximately 8½ million barrels per day in the month of July.	13.0	110.0
201607	1944	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is down approximately 10 percent from a year earlier.	13.0	110.0
201607	1945	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite that decline, global oil production actually is going to be modestly higher for 2016, because OPEC production is expected to rise due, importantly, to increases in production in Iran and Iraq.	13.0	110.0
201607	1946	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So 2016 will be up over 2015, but the rate of increase has slowed.	13.0	110.0
201607	1947	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect global supply and demand to move into rough balance during the first half of 2017, on the basis of our expectation of increasing demand of approximately 1.3 million barrels a day, on average, in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201607	1948	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s been our view that the recent uptick in prices may have been overdone because of temporary production outages in Nigeria and Canada.	13.0	110.0
201607	1949	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Those outages have now been substantially restored, so we’re not surprised by the recent reduction in oil prices.	13.0	110.0
201607	1950	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	However, on the basis of the expected trend toward balance in terms of global supply and demand, we do continue to expect oil prices to firm as we head into year-end and into next year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1951	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	With this firming, we’ve now been seeing in the past few months, for the first time in 18 months, some very modest oil rig count increases.	13.0	110.0
201607	1952	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This activity is primarily in the Permian Basin, in which breakeven costs are the most attractive.	13.0	110.0
201607	1953	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still expect, though, that rig increases will be very limited over the next several months because, on the basis of our discussions with our contacts and our new energy survey, we continue to think that breakeven prices for new drilling still range between $50 to $60 per barrel in the most attractive fields in the Permian and higher in other fields.	13.0	110.0
201607	1954	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we still are not yet at a market price that allows people to drill and make a profit.	13.0	110.0
201607	1955	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result of this and the fact that many industry participants are highly leveraged, we continue to expect to see more mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings in this industry for the remainder of the year.	13.0	110.0
201607	1956	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in the service sector, we wouldn’t be surprised to continue to see more job losses.	13.0	110.0
201607	1957	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For the next few years, because of very high levels of capacity utilization in OPEC, the US shale industry is likely to provide the short-cycle supply increases needed to meet growing global demand, mainly because, as we’ve said before, long-lived project investments have been relatively dormant for the past two, two and a half years.	13.0	110.0
201607	1958	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’re more optimistic that we will have some tailwind as we head into 2017 and beyond.	13.0	110.0
201607	1959	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Turning to the national forecast, we do believe we’re making progress toward reaching our dual-mandate objectives.	13.0	110.0
201607	1960	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Labor market slack has continued to be reduced, and we believe we are making gradual progress toward meeting our inflation objective.	13.0	110.0
201607	1961	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean 12-month reading is holding steady at 1.8 percent versus approximately 1.65 percent a year ago, which to us is consistent with gradual, although modest, increases in core inflation.	13.0	110.0
201607	1962	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe the recent deceleration in the pace of job growth is consistent with a labor market approaching full employment.	13.0	110.0
201607	1963	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we see the average of 150,000 per month that we’ve experienced the past few months as not surprising and still, as has been said, consistent with continuing reductions to the unemployment rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1964	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Our own forecast is that the unemployment rate is going to reach approximately 4.6 percent by the second quarter of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201607	1965	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to estimate 2016 real GDP growth in the United States at approximately 2 percent.	13.0	110.0
201607	1966	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For us, the risk in our forecast is actually modestly to the upside.	13.0	110.0
201607	1967	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Although Brexit may have muddied the waters for the United Kingdom and the euro area, and it will take time to assess the ultimate effects, our working assumption is that the effect on the United States is going to be very limited.	13.0	110.0
201607	1968	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Discussions we had with our industry contacts in the United States suggest that the consumer is solid and stable—not better than that, but certainly solid and stable.	13.0	110.0
201607	1969	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We note, by the way, that despite Brexit, junk-bond spreads have narrowed in the intermeeting period, and, in fact, real household wealth likely turned up in the second quarter, all things netted out.	13.0	110.0
201607	1970	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As has been mentioned, we keep a close eye on and do our own models of the neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1971	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We note that slower five-year economic growth expectations as well as growing demand for safe assets around the world are drivers of recent declines in world interest rates, which are consistent with declines in our internal estimates of the real neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201607	1972	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, we believe that the FOMC is less accommodative, even at 25 to 50 basis points than is widely believed.	13.0	110.0
201607	1973	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’d like to make one more comment on business investment.	13.0	110.0
201607	1974	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of extensive discussions with our contacts, we assess that while people are pleased with their debt borrowing costs—and, if they are public companies, with their stock prices—most business leaders we speak to fear that we are in for a prolonged period of sluggish GDP growth both in the United States and across advanced economies.	13.0	110.0
201607	1975	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, they see, as I’ve said before, very high levels of disruption in their respective industries—either new entrants that are threatening their model or, at a minimum, consumers having greater leverage that is limiting their pricing power and lowering margins.	13.0	110.0
201607	1976	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The result of this is that CEOs are very hesitant to make major additions to capital spending plans or capacity additions until they see some greater clarity regarding their future growth prospects.	13.0	110.0
201607	1977	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, we are finding this pretty broadly across contacts in our District.	13.0	110.0
201607	1978	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201607	1979	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	1980	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201607	1981	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	1982	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Overall economic activity in the Third District is little changed from June.	13.0	999.0
201607	1983	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	But looking ahead, things appear to be on the upswing.	13.0	999.0
201607	1984	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth has slowed a bit, and the unemployment rate ticked up to 5.3 percent in May.	13.0	999.0
201607	1985	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Comparing labor force developments in my region with those of the nation, the Third District continues to grow a bit more slowly than the nation, but that’s not unusual.	13.0	999.0
201607	1986	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	We typically do.	13.0	999.0
201607	1987	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The manufacturing sector continues to struggle a bit, but expectations in the business community remain fairly upbeat:  Of the firms surveyed in our latest Business Outlook Survey, 46 percent expect an increase in activity over the next six months, while only 12 percent anticipate a decline.	13.0	999.0
201607	1988	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, a large majority of firms reported stable employment in July.	13.0	999.0
201607	1989	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, a contact with broad exposure in manufacturing indicated that a number of lines of business are beginning to see profits turn positive, with July being the best month of his year.	13.0	999.0
201607	1990	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Growth is strong in transportation, health care, and areas associated with construction.	13.0	999.0
201607	1991	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And he reports there have been no negative effects from “the Kamin,” we’ll call it, as he walks out of the room [laughter], formerly known as “the Brexit.”	13.0	999.0
201607	1992	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Even in his businesses that deal heavily with Europe, he’s not seeing any real effect.	13.0	999.0
201607	1993	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Another contact indicated that the British arm of a major flooring company is reporting stronger growth as a result of the Brexit vote.	13.0	999.0
201607	1994	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	However, one of our bankers indicated that a major multinational firm in our District is starting to lay people off, and the excuse it gave was that, because of the Brexit result, it started to see some slowdown in its business.	13.0	999.0
201607	1995	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Who knows whether that is true, but that’s what it is reporting.	13.0	999.0
201607	1996	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Bankers in our region are experiencing strong loan growth and high profitability as well as a continued decline in delinquencies.	13.0	999.0
201607	1997	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Residential investment is strong in the Philadelphia area, and the Jersey Shore is absolutely booming.	13.0	999.0
201607	1998	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Although these numbers will not excite President Williams, beachfront property on Long Beach Island, New Jersey, is going for upward of $4 million to $5 million.	13.0	999.0
201607	1999	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I know, that’s a condo in San Francisco.	13.0	999.0
201607	2000	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lean-to.	13.0	102.0
201607	2001	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201607	2002	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	A supplier of homebuilding materials has seen a 60 percent increase in business during the second quarter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2003	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And, as others have reported, for difficult-to-find workers such as truck drivers, this one contact says his firm has raised wages three times this year alone to try to find truck drivers.	13.0	999.0
201607	2004	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, a number of contacts did mention that the uncertainty arising from this year’s presidential election was damping their capital spending for the second half of this year and possibly into 2017.	13.0	999.0
201607	2005	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly at a somewhat slower-than-historical rate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2006	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Readings are a bit mixed, as we are seeing declining activities at malls but very strong growth in tourism and hospitality.	13.0	999.0
201607	2007	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The DNC helped that, by the way, this week.	13.0	999.0
201607	2008	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Like our manufacturers, area service providers remain relatively optimistic with respect to future activity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2009	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Further, commercial construction has begun to pick up in the region, which makes us an outlier nationally.	13.0	999.0
201607	2010	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, the value of residential contracts continues on a steady upward trend, although permits continue to fall, mostly as a result of weakness in the multifamily sector of the market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2011	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	House prices are appreciating at a modest pace, growing at less than half the US average.	13.0	999.0
201607	2012	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So, overall, the Third District should see steady, if unspectacular, economic growth, and contacts are generally upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201607	2013	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, the latest employment report greatly allayed my concerns over the underlying strength in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2014	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Averaging through the past few months indicates that job growth has decelerated from earlier in the year, but that the economy is still creating jobs at a healthy clip.	13.0	999.0
201607	2015	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In light of the tightness in the labor market, I also believe that a gradual slowdown in job creation is, as many have said, to be expected.	13.0	999.0
201607	2016	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	My other concern over the potential destabilizing influence of Brexit, as others have noted, has not materialized.	13.0	999.0
201607	2017	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	If anything, financial markets have shown amazing resiliency, and it is still not clear if and when actual Brexit will occur.	13.0	999.0
201607	2018	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Overall, I view the data we have received since we last met as reassuring.	13.0	999.0
201607	2019	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Consumer spending and residential real estate are contributing to economic growth, the job market has retained its dynamism, and core inflation numbers appear to be heading toward our target.	13.0	999.0
201607	2020	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I anticipate that headline inflation will follow and that the economy will grow at or slightly above trend.	13.0	999.0
201607	2021	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In that regard, I’m a bit more optimistic than the staff in the Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201607	2022	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, some of my optimism is informed by my greater reliance on GDPplus rather than expenditure GDP, or simply GDP, as a measure of underlying economic activity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2023	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This latent variable is calculated by the staff at the Philadelphia Fed and combines GDP and GDI using a Kalman filter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2024	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Interestingly, the staff finds that GDPplus does not suffer from the residual seasonality problem and is a better predictor of GDP than GDP itself.	13.0	999.0
201607	2025	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Further, real-time forecasts of GDPplus are more informative about future GDP than our current real-time estimates of GDP itself.	13.0	999.0
201607	2026	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This suggests that current GDPplus contains valuable information about underlying economic activity as well as about future revised BEA estimates of GDP.	13.0	999.0
201607	2027	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The current estimate we have for first- quarter GDPplus growth is 2.7 percent, and this measure indicates that there was no fourth- quarter economic slowdown.	13.0	999.0
201607	2028	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Also, using GDPplus as a gauge of first-quarter economic activity substantially attenuates the puzzling weakness in labor productivity.	13.0	999.0
201607	2029	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	My somewhat optimistic outlook will inform my view on policy tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201607	2030	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2031	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2032	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me suggest at this point, for good behavior, we take a short break—maybe 20 minutes.	52.0	65.0
201607	2033	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think coffee and refreshments are available outside.	52.0	65.0
201607	2035	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201607	2036	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next speaker is Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201607	2037	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201607	2038	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As everybody has pointed out, the significant short-term downside risks that loomed over the June meeting have largely dissipated, although I don’t think that means that we’ve reverted to the situation we were in, say, in mid-May.	13.0	97.0
201607	2039	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think Jay did a very nice job of identifying several of the reasons why that’s the case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2040	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, there’s been a slowing in the job creation numbers.	13.0	97.0
201607	2041	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know why we think that necessarily we’ve slowed and now plateaued at 150,000.	13.0	97.0
201607	2042	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me there’s at least an open question as to whether that trend line will continue to be down or whether it will plateau at 150,000.	13.0	97.0
201607	2043	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, while longer-term Treasury securities have retraced some of the decline in the immediate aftermath of Brexit, they didn’t get all the way back.	13.0	97.0
201607	2044	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This may be due, at least in part—as I think people have already suggested—to changes in the expected path of monetary policy both here and abroad, which is in turn associated with somewhat less-sanguine expectations for economic growth.	13.0	97.0
201607	2045	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Those anticipated changes probably have also contributed to the rebound in asset prices.	13.0	97.0
201607	2046	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And third, Governor Powell mentioned Brexit, but I want to invoke David Wilcox’s formulation here, which seems to me the right way to look at it.	13.0	97.0
201607	2047	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Back in June we regarded Brexit, depending on the individual, as a somewhat unlikely outcome, but that if there was such an outcome, bad things could happen from it.	13.0	97.0
201607	2048	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We were implicitly putting a discount factor on the likelihood that there would be Brexit.	13.0	97.0
201607	2049	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But now Brexit is probably a reality, and so those potential bad things coming out of Brexit now have to be evaluated as real risks rather than one of the different layers of contingencies.	13.0	97.0
201607	2050	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t know what the magnitude of the negative effects will be, but I think it’s hard to argue that the sign is going to be anything but negative.	13.0	97.0
201607	2051	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	With the dissipation of the immediate downside risks, I thought it was a good moment to reflect on the risks associated with the policy approach that I personally have been taking.	13.0	97.0
201607	2052	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This is on the theme of having an open mind.	13.0	97.0
201607	2053	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, none of us, I hope, has an entirely open mind, meaning no priors, no ways of looking at things.	13.0	97.0
201607	2054	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I think that we all have to be careful not to fall into defending positions that we’ve taken, like a debater or a litigator, using whatever evidence is available to defend that position—as if you’re just trying to get a particular outcome for a client or in front of bunch of judges in a debating tournament—and to think more about being a policymaker who is trying to absorb changes and, thus, change one’s own position.	13.0	97.0
201607	2055	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, in all honesty, I actually think the Committee structure we’ve got makes it harder to do that because it pushes us a little bit into staking out positions that we then defend.	13.0	97.0
201607	2056	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I thought I would try, with myself, to think through what the risks may be to the approach that I’ve been taking when thinking about monetary policy decisions.	13.0	97.0
201607	2057	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It won’t be surprising to anticipate the conclusion that I don’t currently find those risks significant—and I’ll explain why in a minute— but at least it helped me think about what things might change that should, in turn, force me to change the position I’ve been taking on monetary policy.	13.0	97.0
201607	2058	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, thus, it was a useful exercise.	13.0	97.0
201607	2059	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Plus, by explaining it, it gives people an opportunity to explain why they think the risks are actually somewhat greater.	13.0	97.0
201607	2060	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	To recapitulate what I’ve said before, my basic approach is that I would prefer to wait for more convincing evidence that inflation will get to, and then remain around, the 2 percent target before we raise rates further.	13.0	97.0
201607	2061	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Basically, I have three reasons for taking this approach.	13.0	97.0
201607	2062	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, so long as the price-stability side of the dual mandate is not in danger of being breached on the upside, it’s important to take to heart the statutory injunction that we seek maximum employment, not some sort of constructed view of full employment.	13.0	97.0
201607	2063	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, due to the asymmetry of the policy tools currently available to us for tightening and for loosening, we should err on the side of an accommodative policy to avoid increasing—even if only incrementally—the vulnerability of the economy to some shock, anticipated or unanticipated, that would be effected by an additional rate increase.	13.0	97.0
201607	2064	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, third, in light of recent experience of persistently below-target inflation and the possibility that secular forces will make it more difficult to reach and maintain inflation of around 2 percent, it seems reasonable to wait for clearer evidence that the target will be reached.	13.0	97.0
201607	2065	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So at least the first and second of these reasons rest on the expectation that we’ll have ample time to react if and as inflation were to move upward in a way that threatened the target on the upside.	13.0	97.0
201607	2066	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I want to focus in particular on the risk that this expectation may prove to be ill founded.	13.0	97.0
201607	2067	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, first, I wanted to address financial-stability risks briefly.	13.0	97.0
201607	2068	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I made clear in our previous discussions, I’m not opposed in principle to the notion that, in some relatively unusual circumstances, short-term rates may need to be raised in order to diminish risks to financial stability that may be associated with a broad range of asset prices moving well above historical averages due to increasing amounts of leverage.	13.0	97.0
201607	2069	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, as I noted earlier, I hope that in thinking through possible longer-range frameworks for monetary policy, we will at least explore the development of other financial stability tools.	13.0	97.0
201607	2070	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the present, though, a rate increase is the most obvious such tool that can be used among monetary policy tools to try to stave off adverse financial stability effects.	13.0	97.0
201607	2071	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I agree that the conditions in which one would worry about financial stability are more likely to develop in an environment in which interest rates have remained very low for a long time.	13.0	97.0
201607	2072	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But even if these conditions were to occur, one would want to do a careful assessment of the relative risk to the economy of tightening versus the risk to the economy stemming from a painful and possibly rapid deleveraging if prices and leverage continue to rise well above sustainable levels.	13.0	97.0
201607	2073	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, more to the immediate point, I don’t think the conditions that I hypothesized a moment ago are with us today.	13.0	97.0
201607	2074	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It is true that CRE markets in six or seven so- called gateway cities do present grounds for concern.	13.0	97.0
201607	2075	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s also true that the inventory of leveraged loans held by a variety of financial intermediaries may yet return significant losses and have some negative macroeconomic effects.	13.0	97.0
201607	2076	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And one might argue the case that equity markets are overvalued.	13.0	97.0
201607	2077	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s very hard to make a case, looking at the economy as a whole, that we have a wide range of unusually high asset prices supported by large amounts of leverage, which would present an appropriate case for a monetary policy rate increase as opposed to either supervisory actions, regulatory actions, seeing if markets calm down, and engaging in that risk– reward assessment I suggested a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2078	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, the greatest risks that may be present are more weighted in smaller banks and nonbank intermediaries rather than in the large banks, whose strength or weakness is still an important determinant of the overall stability of the financial system as a whole.	13.0	97.0
201607	2079	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, I agree with the proposition that we ought to keep financial stability considerations in front of us, but I also agree with those who have said the threshold should be pretty high for a policy rate increase.	13.0	97.0
201607	2080	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think one would need to see a much broader range of asset price concerns than those in a couple of discrete areas.	13.0	97.0
201607	2081	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Turning now to inflation, for the purposes of my remarks today I don’t want to focus on the likelihood that, in the absence of interest rate increases, core PCE inflation does get back to and stay around 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201607	2082	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I noted earlier, that’s an important question, and no matter where we began, I think we’re all having to give a little bit more credence to secular stagnation arguments than maybe we did 6 or 12 or 18 months ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2083	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But whatever answer you give to that question really doesn’t implicate the riskiness of the overall approach to monetary policy I suggested a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2084	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	A steady and apparently sustainable move of inflation upward would allow even the most patient of us time to react.	13.0	97.0
201607	2085	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And because it seems unlikely that r* is very large right now, we wouldn’t have to go very far before reaching a neutral or even a contractionary rate.	13.0	97.0
201607	2086	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The risk that’s most salient to the monetary policy approach that I’ve been taking is that inflation would start moving up sufficiently rapidly as to put the Committee “behind the curve.”	13.0	97.0
201607	2087	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, as I understand the position of some on the Committee, the real fear is that it would force us to raise rates so sharply as to induce a recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2088	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The scenario that seems to lie behind that fear is that we undershoot the natural rate by so much that inflation either jumps well above 2 percent fairly quickly or that it’s put on a trajectory in that direction.	13.0	97.0
201607	2089	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In either case, the concern is that significant, fairly rapid increases in rates would be necessary to bring it back down to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201607	2090	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I’d note in passing, I think this scenario must also embed a hypothesis that inflation expectations either don’t play the role that the majority of this Committee has assigned them or that those expectations become unanchored to the upside very quickly, despite the fact that recent experience suggests that the risk of expectations becoming unanchored have been toward the downside.	13.0	97.0
201607	2091	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	One of the reasons I’ve resisted the policy implications of this scenario, at least at the present time, is that I think the natural rate may be lower than estimated by the staff, in which case even if the dynamic of the scenario has validity, it wouldn’t kick in until unemployment was lower than would be suggested under current assumptions.	13.0	97.0
201607	2092	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	This gets us back to the question of how much slack remains in the labor market, how much trend labor force participation is sensitive to overall luck, labor market conditions, and related issues.	13.0	97.0
201607	2093	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I suspect that differences in views among the Committee on these matters will persist, based probably on everybody’s own priors, well beyond the time that we have to act or not act.	13.0	97.0
201607	2094	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I’m not sure that that’s going to be a convincing argument one way or the other.	13.0	97.0
201607	2095	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	A second reason I haven’t found this scenario compelling is that for it to play out, the Phillips curve would not only have to be somewhat steeper than the slope it has maintained for the past 20 or so years, but it would also probably have to be notably nonlinear so that the move through full employment resulted in a fairly quick, fairly sizable increase in price inflation.	13.0	97.0
201607	2096	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	While this is, of course, possible, and there is at least some empirical work suggesting the possibility of nonlinearity of the Phillips curve in some circumstances, there don’t seem to be compelling reasons to believe that it would suddenly and significantly steepen in the circumstances of an economy running, at most, moderately above trend and with the increasing evidence that the flat slope of the Phillips curve has been persistent across time in the United States and has been similarly flat in most of the world’s major economies.	13.0	97.0
201607	2097	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Third, I am not sure that there really are a lot of precedents for the negative scenario that people have in mind in wanting to raise rates, if I can put it this way, a little bit preemptively, although I know that’s not the way people would put it themselves.	13.0	97.0
201607	2098	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First off, the problems of the 1960s and 1970s—which almost present the classic case of the FOMC slamming on the brakes and not being able to engineer a soft landing but, instead, inducing a recession—didn’t just spring up overnight.	13.0	97.0
201607	2099	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	They were years in the making.	13.0	97.0
201607	2100	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the more recent experiences, in the 2000s, although the Federal Reseve may bear some of the blame for the financial crisis and the Great Recession, I don’t think you can make the case that the financial crisis and the Great Recession were catalyzed by FOMC funds rate increases because of waiting around too long to act.	13.0	97.0
201607	2101	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	There are obviously, as President Lacker would suggest, debates we should have, and we can all have debates, but I think it’s hard to make that case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2102	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	It was surely not the classic kind of central bank-induced recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2103	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I also think the recession of the early 2000s is a murkier picture.	13.0	97.0
201607	2104	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, it was a very mild recession.	13.0	97.0
201607	2105	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second, I think you can make a pretty good case that it was a byproduct of the bursting of the tech bubble, which may have had something to do with preexisting monetary policy, I would acknowledge.	13.0	97.0
201607	2106	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, it doesn’t present that classic case.	13.0	97.0
201607	2107	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I think those precedents are limited in their applicability to where we are now.	13.0	97.0
201607	2108	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, as I noted in the previous meeting, the unemployment rate has been more or less steady for nearly a year now, during which time the economy has continued to create jobs well above even a generous estimate of the number of new entrants in the labor force.	13.0	97.0
201607	2109	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	So, stipulating for a moment that we should act before we undershoot by too much the natural rate—which, again, for purposes of argument, I’ll stipulate is at about the current level—right now we’re clearly not racing past the natural rate.	13.0	97.0
201607	2110	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	If the unemployment rate were to begin moving down again in a nontransitory fashion, the reasoning that lies behind this scenario would, at least in my judgment, be stronger whether or not I became completely convinced after taking account of the Phillips curve and some of the other factors that I mentioned a moment ago.	13.0	97.0
201607	2111	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	In conclusion, I don’t want to suggest, now or at any time, that there’s no risk in the monetary policy approach that I’ve been taking.	13.0	97.0
201607	2112	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, anyone who thinks his or her policy preference carries no risks or costs is almost surely wrong.	13.0	97.0
201607	2113	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, in the current circumstances, I think it’s particularly incumbent on those of us subscribing to a more patient approach to continue to evaluate how changing conditions might increase those risks and, thus, might affect the calculus of when the right time for another rate increase has come about.	13.0	97.0
201607	2114	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	For the moment, though, it seems to me, at least, that the risk of a rapid, significant undershoot of the natural rate taking place before we can react and leading to nontransitory, above-target inflation seems quite modest.	13.0	97.0
201607	2115	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	And financial stability vulnerabilities also seem to me well short of the kind of pervasiveness that would warrant a monetary policy action.	13.0	97.0
201607	2116	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I have a feeling there’s not going to be too much doubt about what I’ll say about my preferred monetary policy stance tomorrow, but I will leave that until tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201607	2117	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	13.0	97.0
201607	2118	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2119	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201607	2120	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2121	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	You may have heard a loud cacophony coming from the Cleveland District in the intermeeting period.	13.0	999.0
201607	2122	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201607	2123	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It was actually a big sigh of relief.	13.0	999.0
201607	2124	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cavaliers finally won the NBA championship, Cleveland’s first national sports championship in 52 years; national employment rebounded strongly in June; financial markets calmed down fairly quickly after the vote of the UK referendum; and the political conventioneers finally got out of Dodge.	13.0	999.0
201607	2125	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Overall, economic conditions in the Fourth District have changed little during this intermeeting period, save for indications of building price pressures.	13.0	999.0
201607	2126	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions rose from plus 9 at the time of our previous meeting to plus 18, a reading consistent with the moderate pace of economic growth we’ve been seeing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2127	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In a special staff survey, the vast majority of District contacts reported that they don’t expect any consequential effect on their firms from the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, and even among exporters, fewer than 20 percent expect any effect.	13.0	999.0
201607	2128	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets in the District remain healthy, with further signs of tightening.	13.0	999.0
201607	2129	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Firms increasing employment outnumber those reducing it, and the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that year-over-year growth in payrolls remained at 1.2 percent in June, the same as in April.	13.0	999.0
201607	2130	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable, estimated at 5.1 percent in June.	13.0	999.0
201607	2131	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Nearly all District contacts reported some upward pressure on wages.	13.0	999.0
201607	2132	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Notably, this was reported even in some sectors, like manufacturing, in which job growth has not been particularly strong.	13.0	999.0
201607	2133	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Higher wages are increasingly being reported for entry-level positions.	13.0	999.0
201607	2134	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland staff’s diffusion index for prices received had been gradually moving up since the beginning of the year, but it more than doubled over this intermeeting period to its highest reading in two years, since the start of the survey.	13.0	999.0
201607	2135	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In the survey, 43 percent of respondents across a set of industries that includes construction, retail, and energy reported increasing prices, all at least modestly.	13.0	999.0
201607	2136	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, my outlook for the US economy over the medium run is little changed since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2137	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Once again, the resiliency of the US economy stands out for me.	13.0	999.0
201607	2138	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At the time of our previous meeting, the upcoming vote on the UK referendum loomed large, and we had a very weak May employment report in hand.	13.0	999.0
201607	2139	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The outcome of the UK vote was a surprise and generated considerable volatility in financial markets.	13.0	999.0
201607	2140	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Since the vote, financial markets have calmed, and financial conditions are now more accommodative than they were at the time of our June meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2141	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, we will be living with heightened political and economic uncertainty for a while as the United Kingdom and Europe establish the terms of their new relationship, but it’s gratifying to see that the worst-case scenarios that had been contemplated have, so far, been avoided.	13.0	999.0
201607	2142	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The jobs report showed a sizable rebound for May, which was even more disappointing than originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2143	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The rebound allayed concerns among some that we were at the start of a reversal of the considerable progress that has been made in labor markets, and it was another reminder that monthly data can be volatile.	13.0	999.0
201607	2144	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I’m not saying we should ignore the monthly reports, only that we need to be somewhat careful not to read too much into any one report, and we have to assess conditions on the basis of a broad set of indicators.	13.0	999.0
201607	2145	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	For labor markets, those include claims for unemployment insurance and the unemployment rate, which are low, and the rates of job openings, hiring, and quits, which are high.	13.0	999.0
201607	2146	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Averaging through the past three months, as many people have indicated, monthly payroll gains have averaged 147,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2147	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is a deceleration from the 200,000 monthly average seen in the first quarter, but it’s above current estimates of the pace of job growth consistent with stable labor utilization.	13.0	999.0
201607	2148	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook estimates this to be roughly 85,000 jobs per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2149	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Across several models that take into account the aging of the population and other demographic factors affecting labor force participation, the estimates range from about 75,000 to 120,000 per month, with the most recent estimates in the lower part of or even below that range.	13.0	999.0
201607	2150	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	For example, in the Cleveland staff model, the estimated trend pace of job gains is about 120,000 per month.	13.0	999.0
201607	2151	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The CBO currently estimates average monthly payroll growth of 75,000 over 2021 to 2026.	13.0	999.0
201607	2152	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Some relatively recent research done by Cleveland Federal Reserve economists puts it between 50,000 and 85,000, and a more recent study by Chicago Federal Reserve economists estimates trend monthly payroll employment growth to be about 50,000 now and rising to about 70,000 by 2020.	13.0	999.0
201607	2153	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In any case, the current pace of job growth, though slower than earlier in the year, is sufficient to generate further increases in labor utilization, provided labor force participation behaves roughly as anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2154	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think this is a point worth emphasizing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2155	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ll have two employment reports before our next meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2156	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems fairly likely that the next report won’t match June’s outsized increase of 287,000 jobs.	13.0	999.0
201607	2157	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It could be quite a bit lower and below analysts’ estimates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2158	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This poses a communications issue for us.	13.0	999.0
201607	2159	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Without the context, the headlines could be quite negative when in fact the pace is consistent with further improvement in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2160	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Current estimates indicate a rebound in GDP growth in the second quarter, back to a pace at or slightly above trend, with consumers leading the way but business investment remaining weak.	13.0	999.0
201607	2161	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The increase in oil prices has started to bring some investment activity in the energy sector back online.	13.0	999.0
201607	2162	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	However, the slowdown in investment has been broader, and it does pose a risk to longer-run potential economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201607	2163	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Like President Williams and President Lacker, I noticed that the Board staff had made a fairly large downward revision to their forecast of residential investment growth for this year.	13.0	999.0
201607	2164	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In contrast, I haven’t revised my outlook for the housing sector since the previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2165	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect moderate growth in residential investment.	13.0	999.0
201607	2166	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with other private-sector forecasters.	13.0	999.0
201607	2167	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Single-family building permits rose in June and are moderately higher than a year ago.	13.0	999.0
201607	2168	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Sales of both new and existing homes have been moving higher, and we’ve been receiving positive reports on current and future housing activity from a District contact who is a large provider of coating materials to the national housing market.	13.0	999.0
201607	2169	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Mortgage rates are expected to remain low.	13.0	999.0
201607	2170	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated a pickup in mortgage loan demand.	13.0	999.0
201607	2171	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And while residential real estate lending standards remain tight, standards for GSE-eligible loans are easier than they’ve been, on average, since 2005.	13.0	999.0
201607	2172	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition, the Board staff estimates the annual NIPA revisions will show a higher level of residential investment last year than originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201607	2173	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Perhaps this will result in a higher growth rate for last year, too, offsetting a slower rate this year.	13.0	999.0
201607	2174	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the inflation outlook as largely unchanged since our previous meeting and consistent with inflation gradually rising back to our 2 percent goal over time, with some ups and downs along that path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2175	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This seems like a reasonable forecast, reflecting my expectation that economic growth will continue to be at or slightly above trend, that the unemployment rate will fall below estimates of this longer-run trend, and that inflation expectations have been and will continue to be reasonably stable.	13.0	999.0
201607	2176	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I note that the troubling dip in inflation expectations seen in the preliminary June Michigan survey was revised away in the final numbers.	13.0	999.0
201607	2177	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We might see headline inflation move down in the immediate term, due to the drop in food prices and residual seasonality, but a gradual upward climb back to our goal seems reasonable to me, conditional on the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201607	2178	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	When you look at the trajectory of inflation over the past year, you see that we have indeed made progress as the earlier declines in energy prices and the effects of the sharp dollar appreciation have been passing through.	13.0	999.0
201607	2179	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Both headline and core measures of inflation have gradually moved up since last fall.	13.0	999.0
201607	2180	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we should take some comfort in that trajectory.	13.0	999.0
201607	2181	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In thinking about appropriate monetary policy, I’m guided by the medium-run outlook and risks associated with that, as well as the progress we have made and future progress we anticipate making on our two monetary policy goals.	13.0	999.0
201607	2182	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we’re basically at our goal of maximum employment from the standpoint of what we can do with monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2183	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And even if there’s some uncertainty associated with that, I think it’s pretty clear that we’re close to that goal.	13.0	999.0
201607	2184	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Inflation remains below our goal, but here, too, we’ve been moving in the right direction.	13.0	999.0
201607	2185	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Forecasts, including the Tealbook and the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff model, show the unemployment rate moving down and inflation moving up, even as the federal funds rate rises gradually over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201607	2186	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	While there are downside risks to the forecast, those have subsided somewhat since our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2187	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The worst-case scenarios after the UK referendum were not realized, and fears about employment were allayed after the June report.	13.0	999.0
201607	2188	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	There are also upside risks to the forecast.	13.0	999.0
201607	2189	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I found the alternative scenario “Weaker Productivity with Higher Inflation” a good illustration of the type of upside risk we should not ignore.	13.0	999.0
201607	2190	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In this simulation, the policy rate path needs to be considerably steeper than the one we are anticipating.	13.0	999.0
201607	2191	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition longer-term yields on Treasuries are down since the start of the year, but the Board staff estimates about two- thirds of the decline reflects lower term premiums, while one-third represents lower average expected future short rates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2192	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The lower term premiums represent an easing in financial conditions that should be supportive of economic activity and, if sustained, is an upside risk to the forecast.	13.0	999.0
201607	2193	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	That said, I don’t believe we are “behind the curve” yet with respect to monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2194	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the gradual upward path of policy, as indicated in our FOMC communications and in the June SEPs, continues to be appropriate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2195	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	No one’s talking about the need to sharply raise interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201607	2196	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	What’s left to talk about is timing.	13.0	999.0
201607	2197	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It reminds me of that old joke that ends: “We’ve established what you are, Madam, now it’s just a matter of haggling over the price.”	13.0	999.0
201607	2198	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So if we continue to communicate that a gradual upward path is appropriate, then at some point we will need to take another step on the path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2199	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, if we no longer think such a path is appropriate, then it’s incumbent on us to say that.	13.0	999.0
201607	2200	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Now, it could very well be that we are in a new economic environment with low equilibrium real rates that will last for a long time, meaning that the same level of the funds rate is less accommodative than in the past.	13.0	999.0
201607	2201	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And the policy trajectory may need to be even more shallow than we think.	13.0	999.0
201607	2202	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But the anticipated gradual policy rate path takes this possibility into account and allows for recalibration along the way.	13.0	999.0
201607	2203	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It recognizes that there are large error bands around the SEP forecasts regarding the economy and the policy rate path, even if we, as a Committee, can’t agree to show those confidence bands to the public.	13.0	999.0
201607	2204	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But even if r* is low, it isn’t a situation that supports maintaining the funds rate at 25 to 50 basis points indefinitely, even as we continue to make progress on our goals.	13.0	999.0
201607	2205	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to believe monetary policy should be forward looking.	13.0	999.0
201607	2206	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Trying to purposely drive the economy to overheat in an attempt to generate a faster return to 2 percent inflation and a cyclical rebound in labor force participation seems ill advised and risky.	13.0	999.0
201607	2207	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I can’t point to any historical examples of central banks pursuing this strategy that have ended well.	13.0	999.0
201607	2208	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I think it overestimates our ability to control things, and it seems inconsistent with a gradual policy rate path.	13.0	999.0
201607	2209	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems more likely that it would require an L-shaped path, low for long and then steeper thereafter.	13.0	999.0
201607	2210	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	So I really couldn’t support pursuing that strategy.	13.0	999.0
201607	2211	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, conditional on the outlook and associated risks, we will need to raise the funds rate.	13.0	999.0
201607	2212	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And then, consistent with the gradual path, we can take some time to assess the situation.	13.0	999.0
201607	2213	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The gradual path doesn’t anticipate increases at each FOMC meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2214	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, I recall we settled on the language of “gradual path” to dissuade the public from thinking that once we started, we expected to move at every meeting.	13.0	999.0
201607	2215	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If the medium-run outlook changes significantly, then we can hold rates there for a while or even reverse course.	13.0	999.0
201607	2216	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I wouldn’t view that as an error, just as I don’t view December’s increase as an error, even though we haven’t raised the rate since then.	13.0	999.0
201607	2217	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	The exact timing and ultimate policy rate path are data dependent, meaning they depend on how economic conditions, the outlook, and the risks to the outlook are evolving.	13.0	999.0
201607	2218	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is the nature of policymaking when the future is uncertain.	13.0	999.0
201607	2219	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But that’s nothing new—the future is always uncertain.	13.0	999.0
201607	2220	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201607	2221	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2222	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201607	2223	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201607	2224	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	On balance, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were somewhat more upbeat this round.	13.0	91.0
201607	2225	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The commentary still seemed in line with the roughly 2 percent economic growth we’ve seen for some time.	13.0	91.0
201607	2226	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But whereas my contacts before were only hopeful that they would achieve their 2016 business plans, now they have more confidence that they will actually meet these goals.	13.0	91.0
201607	2227	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Among the positive reports this round, my director who heads Motorola Solutions reported an increase in his order backlog and a better outlook from a variety of customers.	13.0	91.0
201607	2228	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding President Williams’s comments on housing, several other directors pointed to improved residential construction, with one noting a change in the composition of activity from multifamily to single-family units.	13.0	91.0
201607	2229	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	My director from Commonwealth Edison reported stronger usage across its customer base and noted that it was hiring to meet increased demand for new connections, and residential is a large part of that.	13.0	91.0
201607	2230	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	More generally, my contact at Manpower Employment Services described increasing labor demand and a modest pickup in nominal wage growth, consistent with a tightening labor market.	13.0	91.0
201607	2231	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	He noted that the pickup in wages extended beyond just high-skilled workers.	13.0	91.0
201607	2232	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Firms in the services sector have been doing quite well, which is bolstering demand for lower-skilled and entry-level workers as well.	13.0	91.0
201607	2233	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	None of my contacts expressed serious concerns about Brexit, although some said it was too early to tell.	13.0	91.0
201607	2234	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	To be sure, not all reports were positive.	13.0	91.0
201607	2235	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In particular, most manufacturing firms are still struggling, and I found President Lacker’s positive comments from the Machine Technology Association to be very interesting.	13.0	91.0
201607	2236	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I look forward to learning more about that.	13.0	91.0
201607	2237	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Caterpillar and Deere continue to note challenges.	13.0	91.0
201607	2238	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Business lines related to natural resource extraction and construction remain soft.	13.0	91.0
201607	2239	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It was also noted that their earlier projections for increases in state and local government infrastructure spending had been slower to materialize than expected.	13.0	91.0
201607	2240	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Other manufacturers had similar stories.	13.0	91.0
201607	2241	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Turning to my macroeconomic outlook, our GDP forecast is a tad stronger than the Tealbook’s.	13.0	91.0
201607	2242	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We see GDP growth at about 2 percent this year and then a bit stronger in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201607	2243	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Another difference is that we currently think that there’s a little more slack in labor markets than indicated in the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2244	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Still, under our forecast, slack is essentially gone by early next year.	13.0	91.0
201607	2245	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The June labor market report and incoming consumer spending data increased our confidence in this outlook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2246	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We also see somewhat stronger investment growth than the Tealbook, although it’s not gangbusters.	13.0	91.0
201607	2247	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This, in part, reflects analysis of a new data source by my staff.	13.0	91.0
201607	2248	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve obtained data from a local firm, Textura, that processes commercial construction contract payments and budgets.	13.0	91.0
201607	2249	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This is one of those new high technologies being brought to bear on business procedure today.	13.0	91.0
201607	2250	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It basically is working with an old construction payments mechanism in which people put liens on the building every time they finish part of it, then get paid and take the lien back, and then put another lien on so that somebody won’t fail to pay you when you’ve done something for them.	13.0	91.0
201607	2251	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	They now do this digitally and as a clearinghouse for people, and that’s basically the value proposition.	13.0	91.0
201607	2252	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	The contracts represent about 4 percent of total US construction spending, but have a national reach.	13.0	91.0
201607	2253	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our experimental indicator, on the basis of the budgeting data, appears to provide a six-month lead for predicting total US construction spending.	13.0	91.0
201607	2254	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Right now, on the basis of the data we have, it is pointing to a modest pickup in construction spending in the second half of the year.	13.0	91.0
201607	2255	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	While I’m feeling somewhat better about my projection of economic growth, I still see the balance of risks as weighted somewhat to the downside, and I remain concerned that the international situation could deteriorate with attendant movements in the dollar and financial conditions weighing on spending.	13.0	91.0
201607	2256	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I thought Governor Brainard covered that territory extremely well.	13.0	91.0
201607	2257	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, if, for some reason, the US consumer were to falter, I don’t see the other components of domestic demand picking up the slack.	13.0	91.0
201607	2258	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Turning to inflation, my outlook, again, is close to the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201607	2259	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m projecting 2016 core inflation to be 1.6 percent.	13.0	91.0
201607	2260	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Further ahead, I see both core and total inflation moving up gradually but still falling a bit short of our 2 percent target at the end of 2018.	13.0	91.0
201607	2261	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, as I discussed at our previous meeting, I see meaningful downside risks to this forecast.	13.0	91.0
201607	2262	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Most important, inflation compensation in financial markets and survey measures of inflation expectations continue to bounce along at extremely low levels, and my business contacts still report no significant inflationary pressures or pricing power to pass along any cost pressures they actually do face.	13.0	91.0
201607	2263	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If we were really going to see a quick return to 2 percent core inflation, I would expect to see something more bubbling up with these indicators.	13.0	91.0
201607	2264	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I hope that these will turn around as we move through the year, but I remain skeptical.	13.0	91.0
201607	2265	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with Governor Tarullo’s risk-management assessment regarding upward inflation realizations relative to our expectations as well as the financial stability risk responses.	13.0	91.0
201607	2266	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201607	2267	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2268	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201607	2269	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201607	2270	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	At the June FOMC meeting, I discussed the St Louis Fed’s new approach to the macroeconomic outlook.	13.0	94.0
201607	2271	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my remarks today, I plan to compare that outlook with the July Tealbook to try to better illustrate what the differences may be.	13.0	94.0
201607	2272	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As you may recall, the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis’ new approach is based on a regime conceptualization that does not rely on convergence properties of an economy returning to a long-run steady state.	13.0	94.0
201607	2273	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There are three parts to the current regime, as we view it:  number one, low productivity growth; number two, a very low real return on short-term government debt, which we labeled r†; and, three, no recession.	13.0	94.0
201607	2274	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	To see r†, the staff has kindly provided in Michael Kiley’s report, exhibit 2, chart 4, the expected real equity return.	13.0	94.0
201607	2275	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This shows the staff’s estimate of the expected 10-year real equity return as well as the expected real yield on the 10- year Treasury, with a substantial difference between the two.	13.0	94.0
201607	2276	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The expected real return on the Treasury is negative, as it has been for the past several years on and off.	13.0	94.0
201607	2277	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	What we’re talking about is short-term debt, so this would be even lower than the red line in this figure.	13.0	94.0
201607	2278	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a big part of our regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2279	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Also, very helpfully, this picture shows the long-term decline in the red line from the 1980s.	13.0	94.0
201607	2280	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because this thing’s been declining secularly for a long time, we see no reason to predict that this is going to suddenly turn up and go to a higher value.	13.0	94.0
201607	2281	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Or, if you want to look at related evidence, I think it would give you the same story here.	13.0	94.0
201607	2282	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As of today, we see no evidence that we have or are likely to switch out of any of the three elements of the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2283	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real returns to government debt remain exceptionally low, productivity growth remains exceptionally low, and recession probabilities are low as well.	13.0	94.0
201607	2284	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We therefore think the most appropriate forecast, as most cyclical adjustment is likely over, is that the US economy will remain in the current regime for the foreseeable future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2285	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal evidence from around the Eighth District seems to corroborate this judgment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2286	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we continue to forecast real GDP growth of 2 percent for 2016, 2017, and 2018; fourth-quarter average unemployment of 4.7 percent for all three years; and trimmed mean inflation of 2 percent for all three years.	13.0	94.0
201607	2287	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Given the regime, the appropriate policy rate supporting this outcome is just 63 basis points over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201607	2288	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Essentially, because there’s no concept of a long-run steady state, there’s no requirement that the policy rate begin a long march back to its longer-run average level.	13.0	94.0
201607	2289	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is true so long as the current regime remains the best description of the macroeconomic environment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2290	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The July Tealbook, in contrast, has 1.7 percent real GDP growth for 2016, somewhat lower than us, accelerating to 2½ percent for 2017.	13.0	94.0
201607	2291	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Faster growth is just around the corner.	13.0	94.0
201607	2292	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But if you average these two figures, you will get 2.1 percent, approximately the same as the St Louis forecast with a bit of difference in timing.	13.0	94.0
201607	2293	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment falls, according to the Tealbook, but only to 4.6 percent at the end of 2017, almost the same as the St Louis forecast.	13.0	94.0
201607	2294	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Tealbook forecast, inflation rises toward 2 percent only slowly.	13.0	94.0
201607	2295	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Tealbook baseline uses the new version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule and forecasts a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate to support these outcomes through the end of 2018.	13.0	94.0
201607	2296	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is just a little less than one move per quarter.	13.0	94.0
201607	2297	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In reality, since the end of quantitative easing, we are moving at a pace closer to once per year.	13.0	94.0
201607	2298	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets think we may go even slower than this.	13.0	94.0
201607	2299	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this mismatch is hurting our credibility.	13.0	94.0
201607	2300	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is the main difference between the Tealbook forecast and the new St Louis Federal Reserve approach.	13.0	94.0
201607	2301	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Tealbook, there’s a long-run steady state to which the economy must converge.	13.0	94.0
201607	2302	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As gaps are closed, the policy rate essentially has to return to its long-run normal level.	13.0	94.0
201607	2303	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This leads to a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201607	2304	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the regime-based approach, the policy rate can be set for the regime.	13.0	94.0
201607	2305	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Gaps can be zero, but the policy rate can remain low because the regime does not require a high value of the policy rate in order to remain consistent with the inflation target.	13.0	94.0
201607	2306	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Which approach is better?	13.0	94.0
201607	2307	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	At this juncture, I think the regime’s [laughter], with low unemployment, allows for a better match between the policy choices and the policy environment.	13.0	94.0
201607	2308	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	What are the risks to this outlook?	13.0	94.0
201607	2309	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Although the comments on Brexit have been extensive, I’m going to comment, nevertheless.	13.0	94.0
201607	2310	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I was actually in Europe as Brexit passed, including in London for part of that trip.	13.0	94.0
201607	2311	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is that the ultimate effects on the United States are negligible.	13.0	94.0
201607	2312	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a trade negotiation that will likely take many years.	13.0	94.0
201607	2313	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, the incentives are for both sides to reach a deal eventually.	13.0	94.0
201607	2314	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This deal will not be that different from current arrangements.	13.0	94.0
201607	2315	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of conversations that I had in Europe, it seems that contagion to other EU members in the east or south of the EU is unlikely.	13.0	94.0
201607	2316	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Many of those countries have their own reasons for wanting to be in the EU and would not likely vote to get out.	13.0	94.0
201607	2317	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Trade negotiations are going on all around the world all the time.	13.0	94.0
201607	2318	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	One recent example is Canada, which was in a seven-year negotiation with the EU.	13.0	94.0
201607	2319	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I never saw it come up here as a concern one way or the other or as a positive upside.	13.0	94.0
201607	2320	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think that this is the kind of thing that’s going to affect US monetary policy over the near term or in the medium term.	13.0	94.0
201607	2321	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a question of another risk, which would be a stronger dollar post-Brexit.	13.0	94.0
201607	2322	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The current dollar move is relatively small compared with the big dollar move in the second half of 2014.	13.0	94.0
201607	2323	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The dollar is actually lower today than it was earlier this year.	13.0	94.0
201607	2324	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, furthermore, I think the dollar gets overemphasized around this table.	13.0	94.0
201607	2325	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The contribution of net exports to the US real GDP growth, which was discussed earlier, has actually been close to zero over the past four quarters for which we have data—that is, from 2015:Q2 to 2016:Q1.	13.0	94.0
201607	2326	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That zero contribution over those four quarters is actually stronger than the net export contribution to GDP growth during 2001 to 2007 or during the 1990s expansion.	13.0	94.0
201607	2327	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So in terms of contributions to GDP growth, we’re actually doing better over the past year than we did during the entire 1990s expansion or the 2000s expansion.	13.0	94.0
201607	2328	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The zero number is despite the very large trade-weighted dollar move in the second half of 2014, which was significant, on the order of 15 to 20 percent, and persistent.	13.0	94.0
201607	2329	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	You got a big move up and it leveled out, so it was just the kind of experiment that you’d like to see if you wanted to see a large effect from the exchange rate.	13.0	94.0
201607	2330	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There was an effect of the dollar move, I think, on net exports, but it looks like it was mostly in 2014:Q4 and 2015:Q1.	13.0	94.0
201607	2331	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	In those two quarters, we did get outsized negative contributions of net exports to GDP growth.	13.0	94.0
201607	2332	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	That period seems to have borne the brunt.	13.0	94.0
201607	2333	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	My anecdotal reports from manufacturers around the Eighth District seem to suggest that the big dollar move at that point was a big surprise.	13.0	94.0
201607	2334	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It did affect their businesses.	13.0	94.0
201607	2335	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	They did have to reorganize internationally.	13.0	94.0
201607	2336	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But it’s not like they hadn’t thought about this before.	13.0	94.0
201607	2337	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	They knew how to go about it.	13.0	94.0
201607	2338	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It takes about a year to make adjustments, and it sounds to me like all of these adjustments have now been made, so you wouldn’t expect further effects from that particular move in the dollar.	13.0	94.0
201607	2339	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As far as a stronger dollar post-Brexit, I don’t see that as a risk.	13.0	94.0
201607	2340	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, I think future monetary policy is already priced in, both for the US central bank and for other major central banks, so I doubt dollar moves are predictable, and I would not count on them as part of the outlook.	13.0	94.0
201607	2341	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, other risks to the regime conceptualization of the US macroeconomy:  One is Phillips curve effects.	13.0	94.0
201607	2342	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We’re downplaying Phillips-curve effects.	13.0	94.0
201607	2343	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	There’s no question about it.	13.0	94.0
201607	2344	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have a relatively strong labor market over the past couple of years, and yet this doesn’t create any inflation.	13.0	94.0
201607	2345	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s very possible that the Phillips curve would reassert itself, but we’re listing that as a risk to the outlook, not as something that we’re putting into the baseline case.	13.0	94.0
201607	2346	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Also, as several people have mentioned tangentially here, that market-based measures of inflation expectations are extremely low is a concern.	13.0	94.0
201607	2347	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Right now, I’m listing it as a risk to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis forecast.	13.0	94.0
201607	2348	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And, finally, several people here have discussed asset bubbles.	13.0	94.0
201607	2349	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Our approach, frankly, has little to say about this, so we’re just listing that as something that is outside the model and something that we will have to make a judgment about at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2350	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t see asset bubble risk as being heightened at this juncture, but it is something I may be concerned about at some point in the future.	13.0	94.0
201607	2351	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	But the approach that we’ve written down really has very little to say to help us make a judgment on that dimension.	13.0	94.0
201607	2352	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201607	2353	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201607	2354	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201607	2355	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201607	2356	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well.	13.0	111.0
201607	2357	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment has been growing modestly overall, hampered by anecdotes of ongoing poor labor availability.	13.0	111.0
201607	2358	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We often hear that worker scarcity is a problem, that employers can’t find workers with the skills that they need.	13.0	111.0
201607	2359	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And then usually I turn around and ask them, “Okay.	13.0	111.0
201607	2360	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Are you raising wages?”	13.0	111.0
201607	2361	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	“No.	13.0	111.0
201607	2362	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’re not in a position to do that.”	13.0	111.0
201607	2363	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I take these anecdotes with a grain of salt.	13.0	111.0
201607	2364	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Until we see them raising wages, I don’t take much information from them.	13.0	111.0
201607	2365	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The national economy continues to grow at a modest pace.	13.0	111.0
201607	2366	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The labor market is in good health overall, but I don’t see any signs of overheating.	13.0	111.0
201607	2367	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Rather, on balance, when I look at all of the data over the past year, it seems to be moving more or less sideways—not huge wage growth, not employment cost growth, et cetera.	13.0	111.0
201607	2368	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think we’re going to be lucky if we see overall 2 percent GDP growth for 2016 as a whole.	13.0	111.0
201607	2369	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	On the inflation front, inflation continues to run below target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2370	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see clear evidence of a sustained move upward toward our 2 percent target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2371	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, as others have noted, some measures of inflation expectations are worryingly low.	13.0	111.0
201607	2372	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Internationally, I have more concerns.	13.0	111.0
201607	2373	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If I just think objectively, developments since our previous meeting have not been positive.	13.0	111.0
201607	2374	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Our base case was “No Brexit.”	13.0	111.0
201607	2375	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We had the Brexit, so that’s a negative even if it wasn’t as bad as we’d feared.	13.0	111.0
201607	2376	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve seen fresh strains in global banks, especially in Italian banks.	13.0	111.0
201607	2377	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We saw a potential coup in Turkey.	13.0	111.0
201607	2378	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We’ve seen repeated terrorist attacks.	13.0	111.0
201607	2379	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Some of these are not economic events, but they nonetheless affect confidence, and they’re all tilted to the negative.	13.0	111.0
201607	2380	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Now, I hope that the US economy will mostly escape these headwinds coming from abroad, but, like the Tealbook, I do continue to see the risks to the outlook for the real economy and for inflation as tilted to the downside.	13.0	111.0
201607	2381	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t see these risks as having materially diminished since we last met in June.	13.0	111.0
201607	2382	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One other comment I’ll make is that this discussion today makes me think about the optimal control exercise in Tealbook B.	13.0	111.0
201607	2383	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I struggle with this notion.	13.0	111.0
201607	2384	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	No one is suggesting this today, but I struggle with the notion that there may come a time when inflation is low but we need to get the unemployment rate up.	13.0	111.0
201607	2385	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I just struggle with that as not being credible, that we need to get the unemployment rate up when there’s no inflation immediately on the horizon.	13.0	111.0
201607	2386	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that that runs afoul of, really, the mandate that we have been given.	13.0	111.0
201607	2387	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me, the optimal control exercise with the asymmetric weight on the unemployment rate gap is the one that I found compelling.	13.0	111.0
201607	2388	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We say that 2 percent is a target, not a ceiling.	13.0	111.0
201607	2389	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If we really mean that, then we should be as concerned about inflation under target as we are over target.	13.0	111.0
201607	2390	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So that’s what’s governing my thinking as I think through these various options.	13.0	111.0
201607	2391	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201607	2392	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2393	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201607	2394	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201607	2395	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The data since our June meeting confirmed that the economic expansion is on track.	13.0	102.0
201607	2396	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consumer spending has been notably strong, supported by a healthy labor market, improving household balance sheets, and still-low gas prices.	13.0	102.0
201607	2397	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	More broadly, my forecast is not much different than it was last month, or, for that matter, from last December when we lifted off.	13.0	102.0
201607	2398	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve seen an easing in domestic headwinds that have been weighing on the economy.	13.0	102.0
201607	2399	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Household deleveraging appears to have largely run its course, and fiscal policy has now turned to being modestly stimulative.	13.0	102.0
201607	2400	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I think I’d like to make a comment about the discussion concerning r* and the increase in the value of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201607	2401	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t disagree with any of the things that are said about whether a higher value of the US dollar versus other currencies is like an increase in the fed funds rate, but let’s be careful not to double-count.	13.0	102.0
201607	2402	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view that r*, for example, is very low is in part because of the increase of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201607	2403	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The higher dollar is one of the factors pushing r* down, at least in the short run, to the levels around zero that Thomas and I estimate.	13.0	102.0
201607	2404	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I just warn against using both the low-r* story and the story that attributes it to “the increase in the dollar,” as if we had already raised the funds rate 150 basis points.	13.0	102.0
201607	2405	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think I would just be cautious that we’re not double-counting.	13.0	102.0
201607	2406	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	At our June meeting, uncertainty from the looming Brexit vote was a significant factor arguing for keeping policy on hold.	13.0	102.0
201607	2407	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although the vote was a surprise, the lasting fallout for the US economy is likely to be minimal.	13.0	102.0
201607	2408	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, US financial conditions, as many have noted, are, on balance, more favorable than they were before our June meeting, when they were already notably more favorable than they were back in December.	13.0	102.0
201607	2409	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Short- and longer-term interest rates have moved lower since our June meeting.	13.0	102.0
201607	2410	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Mortgage lending standards are reported to have eased further for many borrowers, and equity prices have risen to all-time highs.	13.0	102.0
201607	2411	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the broad trade-weighted dollar is little changed.	13.0	102.0
201607	2412	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the Brexit risk, I’m going to respond a little bit to what President Kashkari said.	13.0	102.0
201607	2413	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I thought about the risk, I thought there was maybe a 50–50 chance of Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2414	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m sorry, I’m going to keep saying “Brexit” just to drive Steve crazy.	13.0	102.0
201607	2415	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201607	2416	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought that there was a risk of it happening, and then an uncertainty or huge distribution of what would happen after that.	13.0	102.0
201607	2417	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when I think of the overall risks, in my mind it was 50–50, and it went 52– 48, voting for “yes.”	13.0	102.0
201607	2418	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is important to say, “Well, what’s happened since then?”	13.0	102.0
201607	2419	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, personally, I have always viewed the biggest risk as being the political risks regarding Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2420	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There I view the immediate aftermath—when basically every leader in Britain stepped down, and there was talk in Europe about rapid activation of Article 50, and all that—as looking like a bad political risk.	13.0	102.0
201607	2421	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But since then, we’ve seen the British government actually quickly form again, and the leadership, I think, lay out a position of a slow walk in terms of Brexit.	13.0	102.0
201607	2422	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think calmer heads have prevailed on the continent politically regarding Brexit, specifically the chancellor in Germany, who’s made it clear that they want to see this process go more slowly.	13.0	102.0
201607	2423	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So although I’m not going to pretend that the risks aren’t still there, I do think that in a way—so far, as least—what we’ve seen has been in the less-bad set of possible outcomes.	13.0	102.0
201607	2424	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although my GDP growth forecast for this year remains close to 2 percent, I think what’s important, at least from my view, is how to think about what 2 percent means in terms of characterizing that both in our internal discussions and our external communications.	13.0	102.0
201607	2425	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, a lot of what I’m about to say is very close to what President Mester said about employment, but let me start with GDP.	13.0	102.0
201607	2426	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I mentioned last meeting, my own estimate of potential growth is 1.6 percent, which is basically what the Tealbook has currently, but that’s also my view on the basis of analysis by our staff of what the longer-run potential growth for the US economy is, in view of the demographic trends and the slow productivity trend that we seem to be on.	13.0	102.0
201607	2427	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I did test-run this idea that we’re on a slower path of economic growth with our business contacts, and, in fact, I got very little pushback to this notion.	13.0	102.0
201607	2428	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	By and large, our business contacts have seen relatively small productivity gains in recent years.	13.0	102.0
201607	2429	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	None of them were predicting a resurgence, and although they all highlight the use of new technologies and are looking for new ways to increase productivity, the examples they give and the way they talk about it is about incremental gains in productivity.	13.0	102.0
201607	2430	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, of course, they do argue that productivity gains are held back by barriers such as compliance, complexity, cybersecurity, and those kinds of issues.	13.0	102.0
201607	2431	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given this assessment of potential—1.6 percent potential growth—in my lexicon, “moderate growth” is the sustainable trend increase that we should look for, and it’s on the order of 1½ percent.	13.0	102.0
201607	2432	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, like the Tealbook, I expect 2 percent growth in the second half of this year, and that’s an above-trend pace that exceeds my estimate of long-run growth as well as the Tealbook’s.	13.0	102.0
201607	2433	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to my mind, 2 percent growth is a solid pace of economic growth, and the economy is on track to exceed potential by a significant amount over the next couple of years.	13.0	102.0
201607	2434	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Similarly, it’s important to recalibrate our thinking and our language regarding employment growth.	13.0	102.0
201607	2435	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know a number of people have mentioned this, but I just want to reiterate it.	13.0	102.0
201607	2436	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job gains have continued to be at a well above their steady-state trend.	13.0	102.0
201607	2437	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In 2014 and 2015, the economy added nearly 3 million jobs a year, and this year we are on track to add another 2 million, according to the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201607	2438	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the Tealbook’s estimates—there are a range of estimates out there, and we’ve already heard about a few of them—trend employment is only 85,000 jobs a month, and that’s about 1 million jobs a year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2439	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The excellent staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in their recent reexamination of this study, suggested that trend number may be as low as 50,000 jobs per month, or 600,000 per year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2440	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the first half of this year, we’ve seen monthly job gains of 172,000 per month, which is double—I’m going to do the doubling and tripling rule—what the Tealbook thinks of as trend and more than triple that of the Chicago Fed’s estimate.	13.0	102.0
201607	2441	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I view 170,000 job gains not as “moderate” but as “strong” or even “robust.”	13.0	102.0
201607	2442	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, in fact, it’s unsustainable, because, due to the limited remaining slack in labor markets, we should expect the pace of job gains to slow down.	13.0	102.0
201607	2443	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if we don’t see the pace of job gains slowing down, we will need to raise rates faster than the Committee currently anticipates.	13.0	102.0
201607	2444	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, there have been notable month-to-month fluctuations in job gains, with June bouncing back from a weak report in May, but this rebound was largely predictable.	13.0	102.0
201607	2445	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not only were the May gains out of line with the other indicators—and we talked about that at our previous meeting—but identifiable transitory factors held down the May number.	13.0	102.0
201607	2446	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those included the Verizon strike and weather.	13.0	102.0
201607	2447	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I reported last month, my staff looked at county- level data and found that weather affects employment patterns and had a significant effect, especially, on May.	13.0	102.0
201607	2448	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to their model, good weather earlier in the spring pulled forward job gains for May, and when you adjust it for the Verizon strike, job gains in May were about in the 150,000 range.	13.0	102.0
201607	2449	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So this same analysis finds that weather effects had very small effects on the June employment numbers.	13.0	102.0
201607	2450	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, in terms of inflation, we remain on course to return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	102.0
201607	2451	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Core inflation was only one- or two-tenths below our objective in the first half of this year, and I’m now going to respond to something that President Evans said.	13.0	102.0
201607	2452	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, in the first half of the year there were transitory factors pushing up core inflation.	13.0	102.0
201607	2453	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recognize that.	13.0	102.0
201607	2454	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it is interesting that we essentially had core inflation of 2 percent, but the anecdotal stories aren’t saying that inflation is high.	13.0	102.0
201607	2455	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m guessing that when we’re at 2 percent underlying inflation, maybe we would not be hearing about that anecdotally, but, again, I’m not taking a very strong signal in the first half.	13.0	102.0
201607	2456	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there are transitory factors.	13.0	102.0
201607	2457	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But my overall outlook continues to be one in which a strong labor market will increase inflationary pressures and bring inflation back to 2 percent.	13.0	102.0
201607	2458	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the things that I do regularly to gauge how much confidence I should have in different measures of inflation is to look at all of the different measures of inflation—we talk a lot about the trimmed mean and PCE; we talk about CPI.	13.0	102.0
201607	2459	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	For each of them, we do a process in which we basically try to adjust for the different means or trends in the series to make them comparable.	13.0	102.0
201607	2460	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you look through May at all the different inflation indicators that are published, adjusted to have the same mean as the core PCE price index, they’re all running about 1½ to 1.8 percent, with 1.6 and 1.7 being right there in the median.	13.0	102.0
201607	2461	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what I find interesting is that all the inflation measures are telling us the same thing.	13.0	102.0
201607	2462	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There doesn’t seem to be a lot of, shall we say, uncertainty associated with that, and they all have been showing an increase over the past year.	13.0	102.0
201607	2463	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last thing I’ll just mention on risks is that I view them as fundamentally balanced.	13.0	102.0
201607	2464	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do want to comment that, as I think has already been mentioned, perhaps by President Mester, there are always risks, and I think it’s very hard to find the upside risks in the news.	13.0	102.0
201607	2465	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	President Kashkari, the headlines don’t say there wasn’t a bad thing happening today.	13.0	102.0
201607	2466	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’re always going to say there’s a bad thing happening.	13.0	102.0
201607	2467	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I know we live in a world in which there’s a lot of tragedy and a lot of news on killings or the coup or things like that, but I don’t know whether that particularly tells us the risks are greater or less than normal.	13.0	102.0
201607	2468	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own assessment is, we’re basically at about the normal over the past 20 years, when there’s been a lot of events that happened during that time, too.	13.0	102.0
201607	2469	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201607	2470	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Maybe I’m spending too much time on Twitter.	13.0	111.0
201607	2471	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter.]	13.0	111.0
201607	2472	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201607	2473	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201607	2474	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I could make a comment.	13.0	96.0
201607	2475	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It wouldn’t be politic.	13.0	96.0
201607	2476	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201607	2477	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As has been the case for some time, my baseline forecast hasn’t changed much.	13.0	96.0
201607	2478	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think I’m pretty much along with everybody else, expecting the economy to grow at about a 2 percent pace over the next year or two and that this will lead to payroll employment gains sufficient to produce a gradual further tightening in the labor market.	13.0	96.0
201607	2479	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This, in turn, should eventually push inflation back up toward our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201607	2480	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the economic growth, I was cheered by the sharp step-up in payroll employment that we saw in June because it did remove a question mark that existed because of the weakness in May.	13.0	96.0
201607	2481	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think the pickup in consumer spending growth in the second quarter is welcome because it confirms our expectation that the high real income gains we saw in the first quarter were actually going to provide more support for consumer spending.	13.0	96.0
201607	2482	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It got spread out over a little bit longer period.	13.0	96.0
201607	2483	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I think it’s important not to get too excited about all of this.	13.0	96.0
201607	2484	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, employment growth and real income growth do appear to be slowing, so the supports that we have to consumer spending will likely be less positive.	13.0	96.0
201607	2485	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, second, when you look at the rest of the economy, all the other sectors still have issues.	13.0	96.0
201607	2486	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Investment spending has been very soft.	13.0	96.0
201607	2487	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Trade and inventories are likely to be drags on economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2488	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And we can debate about whether the recovery in housing is slowing down, but I think you can generally say it’s been disappointing—it’s been upward but slow and choppy.	13.0	96.0
201607	2489	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, I do think there’s some risk that election-year uncertainty could have some negative effects on economic activity this year.	13.0	96.0
201607	2490	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m of the view, more in the “Kashkari camp” than the “Williams camp,” that I think it’s unlikely that the economy will surprise us on the upside over the next several months, and I do see some downside risks to growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2491	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree that the initial negative reaction to the Brexit vote evident in the financial markets was very short lived, but there are still a number of channels by which Brexit could still hurt the US economy.	13.0	96.0
201607	2492	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We obviously know that UK growth will slow as a consequence, and I agree that the direct effect of slower UK growth on US trade will almost certainly be very small because total US exports to the United Kingdom are only about 0.7 percent of US GDP.	13.0	96.0
201607	2493	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me that there are a number of other channels that could amplify the effect of the Brexit decision on US economic activity, such as the effects on European economic activity and the perceived health of the global banking system and, potentially, on global financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201607	2494	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you remember, as we went through the financial crisis, we had good days, we had good weeks, and we had good months.	13.0	96.0
201607	2495	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And just because the reaction to the Brexit vote outcome has turned out a little bit more favorably recently, I would not conclude that the story is over yet, especially when we haven’t really gotten any good evidence about what’s actually happening to UK economic growth.	13.0	96.0
201607	2496	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One potentially detrimental dynamic I see is the effect of lower interest rates and flatter yield curves on bank profits and equity prices and how this could potentially feed into the availability of credit.	13.0	96.0
201607	2497	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Another is that if we do get more economic weakness than we expect, this could lead to a loss in business and consumer confidence, reflecting in part the perception that policymakers may have limited policy options to address that weakness.	13.0	96.0
201607	2498	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s just a vulnerability.	13.0	96.0
201607	2499	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Weakness could beget more weakness because of a view that authorities around the world don’t have much in the way of ability to respond.	13.0	96.0
201607	2500	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And, as many people mentioned, the Brexit vote could also increase political uncertainty not just in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201607	2501	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think some of the socioeconomic issues that led to the Brexit vote outcome, such as fears about immigration and job security, are also very relevant elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201607	2502	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in my view, it’s too soon to say whether any of these dynamics will materialize, or, if they do, how consequential that will be.	13.0	96.0
201607	2503	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly agree that the situation since the Brexit vote has evolved in a way better than feared, but at the same time, we can’t forget that the Brexit vote result nevertheless is a negative shock that I think most of us didn’t really expect to be realized.	13.0	96.0
201607	2504	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In the statement language, we sort of imply an answer to the question:  Are the near-term risks lower since the previous meeting?	13.0	96.0
201607	2505	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that really depends in part on how you weight the domestic economic news since the previous meeting versus the negative news associated with Brexit.	13.0	96.0
201607	2506	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the risks to the outlook have diminished somewhat since the Brexit vote—in other words, the Brexit effect has been less than anticipated—but I’m not sure the risks have really diminished meaningfully since the June FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201607	2507	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, I think the outlook hasn’t changed much either.	13.0	96.0
201607	2508	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Headline inflation, as anticipated, has climbed a bit this year as some of the earlier energy price declines have fallen out of the calculations.	13.0	96.0
201607	2509	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think core inflation has been broadly stable if we adjust for the seasonal adjustment problems in the core inflation statistics.	13.0	96.0
201607	2510	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I take some signal from the fact that core inflation has stayed broadly stable over the past year and a half, even as you had this downward pressure that you would have thought would be manifesting itself through the strength of the dollar and lower energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201607	2511	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So my view is, inflation will be fine in terms of moving back toward the 2 percent objective as long as the economic growth that we expect actually materializes.	13.0	96.0
201607	2512	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the inflation expectations issue that I’ve highlighted before in past comments, I think in general I’m a little bit less worried now than I was earlier.	13.0	96.0
201607	2513	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The University of Michigan measure has stabilized, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York three-year-ahead inflation measure has been gradually increasing since January and has actually reversed much of the decline that we saw in the second half of 2015.	13.0	96.0
201607	2514	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the market-based measures of inflation compensation, I continue to think it’s mostly about term premium and the relative liquidity characteristics of nominal versus inflation-protected Treasury securities, so I don’t really take much signal from that.	13.0	96.0
201607	2515	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What does this all mean for monetary policy?	13.0	96.0
201607	2516	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think it argues for a cautious approach at this meeting, and although I can support another increase or two in the federal funds rate this year, I also can imagine that economic growth might be sufficiently soft and the outlook could be sufficiently uncertain that it would make sense to hold off for a while longer.	13.0	96.0
201607	2517	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So while the economy is growing at only about a 2 percent annual rate, what that means is, we’re using up the excess slack in the US labor market only very slowly.	13.0	96.0
201607	2518	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this can be seen, for example, in the trajectory of the unemployment rate this year, which has essentially been sideways.	13.0	96.0
201607	2519	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With inflation below rather than above our target and monetary policy not far from a neutral setting, I don’t really see the need to rush.	13.0	96.0
201607	2520	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is also reinforced by what I see as asymmetric risk of raising interest rates too early versus too late.	13.0	96.0
201607	2521	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If the economy turns out to be stronger than expected, necessitating a tighter monetary policy, I don’t think it will be that difficult to catch up, but if the economy turns out to be weaker than expected, our toolkit just isn’t as robust.	13.0	96.0
201607	2522	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, the fact that that asymmetry is widely known means that economic weakness could have a more negative effect on household and business confidence than usual, potentially reinforcing the downward pressure on economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201607	2523	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, tomorrow—I’m going to foreshadow this—we are going to be essentially debating how much of a forward lean to put into the statement language about September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2524	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what tomorrow’s about, or what Thomas is going to get into in a few minutes.	13.0	96.0
201607	2525	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to be arguing for only a very slight lean, which I think is embodied in the alternative B language, for two reasons.	13.0	96.0
201607	2526	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, we said our monetary policy decisions are data dependent.	13.0	96.0
201607	2527	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think if we strongly foreshadow that we’re going to move in September, it contradicts that.	13.0	96.0
201607	2528	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s just too much time, too much data, and too much uncertainty about where we’ll be in September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2529	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think we are losing credibility by foreshadowing future tightening moves and then not following through on them.	13.0	96.0
201607	2530	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the mistake here is that we haven’t followed through.	13.0	96.0
201607	2531	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there have been good reasons for it.	13.0	96.0
201607	2532	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think, instead, the error has been that we’ve foreshadowed prematurely before we knew we were actually going to move.	13.0	96.0
201607	2533	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it turns out that we want to move in September, there’s plenty of time between now and then to alter monetary policy expectations.	13.0	96.0
201607	2534	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What I don’t want to do is alter those expectations prematurely before I or we have a firm grasp on whether we actually want to move in September.	13.0	96.0
201607	2535	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201607	2536	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everybody for an interesting discussion of the outlook and the risks associated with it.	13.0	65.0
201607	2537	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d just like to add a couple of brief comments of my own.	13.0	65.0
201607	2538	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you have already noted, we were confronted with two key uncertainties at the June meeting:  first, the outcome of the Brexit vote and its global consequences and, second, the implications of the remarkably weak May labor market report.	13.0	65.0
201607	2539	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In the case of Brexit, I admit that I really didn’t expect the “leave” side to prevail, but I was even more surprised by how quickly financial markets recovered from the initial shock.	13.0	65.0
201607	2540	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, it now seems likely that the decision to exit will have only a minor effect on the US economy in the near term.	13.0	65.0
201607	2541	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That said, the Brexit decision has highlighted and perhaps exacerbated the vulnerability of European banks.	13.0	65.0
201607	2542	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The longer-run political and economic consequences of the vote, as many of you have noted, remain murky for both the United Kingdom and Europe, and those may well pose problems for us down the road.	13.0	65.0
201607	2543	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The recent news on the labor front has been even more reassuring.	13.0	65.0
201607	2544	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of our June meeting, one couldn’t rule out the possibility that the May report signaled the start of a pronounced slowdown in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2545	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Since then, however, we’ve learned that payroll gains rebounded sharply in June to 287,000.	13.0	65.0
201607	2546	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, labor force participation rose; involuntary part-time employment more than reversed its May spike; and the broader U-6 measure of labor utilization continued to decline.	13.0	65.0
201607	2547	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, these and other indicators confirm that labor market conditions remain healthy and that slack has continued to diminish.	13.0	65.0
201607	2548	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, I anticipate that labor utilization is likely to tighten somewhat further in coming months, as overall economic activity appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, with solid growth in consumer outlays compensating for softness in most other categories of spending.	13.0	65.0
201607	2549	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	These developments might seem to suggest that economic conditions, despite some bumps along the way, have ended up about as we anticipated back in late May, when I and several of you said that another increase in the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate in coming months if the labor market continued to improve.	13.0	65.0
201607	2550	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I don’t think that’s quite right.	13.0	65.0
201607	2551	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Back in May, the latest three months of labor market data showed average payroll gains of 200,000 per month, which implied that employment was continuing to expand at a fairly rapid clip that would likely lead to appreciably tighter labor market conditions later in the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2552	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	However, average payroll gains on a three-month basis are now running at less than 150,000 per month, a more subdued, albeit still respectable, pace.	13.0	65.0
201607	2553	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other indicators also support the view that the pace of labor market improvement, while still proceeding, has slowed somewhat in recent quarters.	13.0	65.0
201607	2554	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is essentially unchanged since last fall, as is the share of workers involuntarily working part time.	13.0	65.0
201607	2555	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Initial claims and layoffs have flattened out this year, as have hires and quits in the JOLTS data Finally, business and household surveys of expected labor market conditions either show no improvement or have softened in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201607	2556	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	This slowing is not especially worrisome, as it may simply reflect the lackluster GDP growth seen around the turn of the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2557	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If so, then average payroll gains may move back up fairly soon in response to the pickup in economic growth that we’ve seen recently and the further strengthening that the staff projects.	13.0	65.0
201607	2558	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Under those conditions, increasing the federal funds rate in coming months would likely be appropriate to keep resource utilization from tightening too quickly.	13.0	65.0
201607	2559	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	After all, employment growth, as many of you have noted, eventually has to slow by enough to bring it in line with its sustainable longer- run trend.	13.0	65.0
201607	2560	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But the modest cooling of the labor market that we’ve seen recently could instead turn out to be persistent, perhaps because trend productivity growth has picked up some after several years of exceptional weakness.	13.0	65.0
201607	2561	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, of course, the pace of employment gains could slow further.	13.0	65.0
201607	2562	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If so, the case for raising the federal funds rate in the near term strikes me as less compelling.	13.0	65.0
201607	2563	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, suppose that, absent another rate hike, payrolls continue to expand at an average pace of 150,000 per month and the participation rate remains flat.	13.0	65.0
201607	2564	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate will likely edge down to only 4.8 percent.	13.0	65.0
201607	2565	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Such an outcome would hardly indicate that monetary policy had fallen “behind the curve” as long as inflation is still running well below 2 percent, as the staff projects.	13.0	65.0
201607	2566	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, average payroll gains of 200,000 per month over the second half of this year, especially if accompanied by falling labor force participation, would put the unemployment rate on a much steeper downward trajectory, thus necessitating a policy response.	13.0	65.0
201607	2567	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast to the labor market situation, the outlook for inflation seems to have changed very little since the spring, with the price data coming in about as expected in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201607	2568	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, the downward pressure from past dollar appreciation on the rate of change of import prices has largely dissipated since the turn of the year, thereby adding a couple of tenths to PCE inflation.	13.0	65.0
201607	2569	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the disinflationary effects of past declines in oil prices have decreased substantially, although they’re unlikely to disappear completely until early 2017.	13.0	65.0
201607	2570	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, it still looks like headline and core inflation will remain close to 1 percent and 1½ percent, respectively, on a 12-month basis through the end of the year.	13.0	65.0
201607	2571	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thereafter, I continue to expect that inflation will move gradually back to 2 percent in the context of a moderately tight labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2572	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In anticipation of tomorrow morning’s policy round, what does all of this imply for our decision at this meeting?	13.0	65.0
201607	2573	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Once again, I think it’s appropriate for us to take a wait-and-see approach with regard to adjusting the funds rate.	13.0	65.0
201607	2574	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the erratic swings in the recent labor market indicators, I believe that we should collect more data in order to get a better sense of the underlying momentum in the labor market.	13.0	65.0
201607	2575	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If the next couple of labor market reports show reasonably strong average payroll gains and the overall outlook remains favorable, then raising the target range would likely be appropriate.	13.0	65.0
201607	2576	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But if the evidence suggests that the labor market really has cooled, then I would be inclined to wait, particularly if the price data continue to come in as expected.	13.0	65.0
201607	2577	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201607	2578	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have dinner tonight, and it’s still early relative to that, so I think we’ve got time for Thomas to give us his monetary policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201607	2579	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201607	2580	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2581	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As noted in your earlier briefings, US financial conditions appear to have become, on balance, more accommodative during the intermeeting period.	21.0	999.0
201607	2582	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The top-left panel summarizes two mechanisms that could explain some of the recent movement in asset prices.	21.0	999.0
201607	2583	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first works through market participants’ expectations for US monetary policy—that is, the easing in US financial conditions since the June meeting could reflect market participants’ expectations of a more accommodative path of US monetary policy than previously thought.	21.0	999.0
201607	2584	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In the wake of the Brexit vote, greater US monetary policy accommodation would provide a more substantial cushion against downside risks coming from abroad and, as a result, boost asset prices in the United States.	21.0	999.0
201607	2585	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The second mechanism focuses on the prospect of greater-than-previously- anticipated monetary policy accommodation abroad.	21.0	999.0
201607	2586	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That additional accommodation may have had an effect on US financial markets that went well beyond that associated with exchange rates.	21.0	999.0
201607	2587	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, global investors may have responded to lower yields in Europe by rebalancing their portfolios toward equities and other higher-yielding assets, including dollar-denominated assets.	21.0	999.0
201607	2588	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, the two mechanisms highlighted here are not mutually exclusive.	21.0	999.0
201607	2589	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, both may have contributed to the easing of US financial conditions since the June meeting.	21.0	999.0
201607	2590	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, their relative importance may matter a great deal for your assessment of the appropriate stance of US monetary policy and, therefore, for your deliberations on the policy statement.	21.0	999.0
201607	2591	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, to the extent that changes in asset prices since the June meeting primarily reflect expectations of greater monetary policy accommodation in the United States than previously anticipated—the first mechanism—financial conditions could be especially sensitive to your communications.	21.0	999.0
201607	2592	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is, the improvement could prove quite ephemeral if your words or actions were to go significantly counter to market expectations, leading asset prices to make an abrupt U-turn.	21.0	999.0
201607	2593	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, you might be reluctant to adopt either the first version of paragraph 3 in alternative C—which would greatly surprise the market by announcing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate—or the second version of that paragraph— which states that the Committee “sees the case for an increase in the federal funds rate as having strengthened since its June meeting.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2594	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Instead, you might decide to maintain a wait-and-see approach that likely would leave market expectations for the policy rate path little changed, as in alternative B, or even adopt the language in alternative A, which notes that “the Committee sees the risks to the US economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2595	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the second possible mechanism, the intermeeting changes in asset prices may primarily reflect portfolio rebalancing and search-for-yield behavior on the part of global investors.	21.0	999.0
201607	2596	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	If so, we may now be importing monetary accommodation.	21.0	999.0
201607	2597	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For instance, expectations of a longer period of ultralow interest rates and additional QE in Europe post-Brexit may have kept sovereign yields and term premiums low and boosted the prices of stocks and corporate bonds not just in Europe, but also elsewhere, including in the United States.	21.0	999.0
201607	2598	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As a result, movements in US asset prices since the June meeting may well reflect an easing of financial conditions that is not directly associated with anticipated changes in US monetary policy.	21.0	999.0
201607	2599	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, this raises the question of how the Committee might want to respond.	21.0	999.0
201607	2600	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	At this juncture, the staff and most outside forecasters do not appear to anticipate that the change in US financial conditions to date has been sufficient to significantly alter the outlook for domestic economic activity and inflation.	21.0	999.0
201607	2601	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, the Committee might see the easing in financial conditions as a welcome development that—together with the employment report for June—increased its confidence that the economy is likely to remain on track with the Committee’s modal outlook.	21.0	999.0
201607	2602	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, the Committee might choose to indicate, as in alternative B, that “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished” but leave its policy message otherwise unchanged.	21.0	999.0
201607	2603	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, if the Committee viewed the recent easing in financial conditions as adding more stimulus than warranted by the current state of the US economy, the Committee might decide to offset that additional stimulus by adopting or signaling a less accommodative stance of monetary policy, as in alternative C.	21.0	999.0
201607	2604	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	What does the incoming information since the June meeting tell us about the relative importance of the two mechanisms discussed thus far?	21.0	999.0
201607	2605	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The evidence pointing to changes in US monetary policy expectations as the primary mechanism underlying the recent easing of US financial conditions is not all that compelling.	21.0	999.0
201607	2606	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Although respondents to the latest Desk surveys generally have marked down their funds rate expectations for longer projection horizons—a revision that may well have been influenced by the results of the June SEP—the expected federal funds rate path implied by overnight index swap quotes—the solid lines in the upper-right panel—is virtually unchanged, on net, since the June FOMC meeting.	21.0	999.0
201607	2607	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Similarly, the two-year Treasury yield (not shown), which tends to be very sensitive to market views on the funds rate outlook, is little changed.	21.0	999.0
201607	2608	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And, as shown in the middle-left panel, quotes from federal funds futures options imply that the probability distribution is now more concentrated around “one or none” for the rest of the year, but its center has shifted only slightly to the left.	21.0	999.0
201607	2609	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The remaining charts in my handout summarize information that you may find useful in assessing the relative importance of the second mechanism, the notion that portfolio rebalancing and “reach-for-yield” behavior on the part of global investors may underlie the recent easing of domestic financial conditions  The chart in the lower-left panel shows that downward moves in longer-dated Treasury yields in the roughly two-week period that followed the Brexit vote were largely concentrated at the beginning of the London and Tokyo trading sessions.	21.0	999.0
201607	2610	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This pattern would seem to suggest that global investors indeed may have been engaging in efforts to rebalance their portfolios toward longer-term US Treasury securities and possibly toward other dollar-denominated assets such as corporate bonds.	21.0	999.0
201607	2611	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Consistent with this view of the relative importance of global factors in explaining recent changes in US Treasury yields, the middle-right panel shows the ratio of two measures of volatility in the Treasury securities market:  volatility of the 10-year Treasury yield during the overnight trading session—which is dominated by trading in Tokyo and London—and volatility during the New York City daytime trading session (which is 8:00 am to 5:00 pm local time).	21.0	999.0
201607	2612	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It is quite evident that, relative to the daytime session, Treasury market volatility in the overnight session has risen appreciably post-Brexit.	21.0	999.0
201607	2613	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Lastly, as Lorie discussed in her briefing and as shown in the bottom-right panel, respondents to the latest Open Market Desk survey have overwhelmingly pointed to spillovers from low or declining yields abroad as a main factor explaining the recent decline in the five-year, five-year-forward nominal Treasury yield.	21.0	999.0
201607	2614	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus far, I have focused on the potential implications of recent financial developments for your deliberations on the draft statements included in your handout.	21.0	999.0
201607	2615	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More broadly, the draft statements differ importantly in their assessments of other information received over the intermeeting period.	21.0	999.0
201607	2616	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Specifically, alternative B would acknowledge the strong June labor market report and the further increase in labor utilization while leaving the Committee’s modal outlook essentially unchanged.	21.0	999.0
201607	2617	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Compared with the June statement, the key innovation in alternative B is the assessment that near-term risks to the outlook have diminished.	21.0	999.0
201607	2618	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C offers a more sanguine view of inflation developments than alternative B and notes that the Committee now “sees the near-term risks to the US economic outlook as nearly balanced.”	21.0	999.0
201607	2619	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, alternative A projects greater pessimism regarding the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201607	2620	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It would state that the risks to the US economic outlook are “tilted somewhat to the downside” and would signal that a near-term increase in the target range for the federal funds rate is unlikely.	21.0	999.0
201607	2621	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201607	2622	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201607	2623	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21.0	65.0
201607	2624	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201607	2625	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I have a question for Thomas.	22.0	96.0
201607	2626	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	22.0	65.0
201607	2627	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Couldn’t you interpret the ratio of overnight to trading- hour volatility differently as just an indication of where the information arises in the world that affects people’s outlook of global economic growth and the  market for US Treasury securities?	22.0	96.0
201607	2628	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, couldn’t you get this spike because the Brexit moves occurred over there?	22.0	96.0
201607	2629	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Normally, the volatility is below 1 because most of the news relevant to Treasury securities happens here in US time.	22.0	96.0
201607	2630	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it might not be anything having to do with global portfolio rebalancing.	22.0	96.0
201607	2631	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It might just be due to where the distribution of the important news falls.	22.0	96.0
201607	2632	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If our news is boring and their news is really interesting, then I would expect that the volatility during overnight sessions would go up relative to the volatility in US sessions.	22.0	96.0
201607	2633	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s right.	22.0	999.0
201607	2634	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	One concern here could well be that because the big event was Brexit and it clearly showed up during overnight hours, that’s what’s driving the result.	22.0	999.0
201607	2635	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, because it is a one-month rolling volatility, the Brexit event is a tremendous pull.	22.0	96.0
201607	2636	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, that’s right.	22.0	999.0
201607	2637	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, that said, the lower-left panel actually excludes the Brexit date itself.	22.0	999.0
201607	2638	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Those data start only on June 26, so you do see that even after the Brexit event had passed you still have this development.	22.0	999.0
201607	2639	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I find the lower-left one more compelling.	22.0	96.0
201607	2640	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess we agree.	22.0	96.0
201607	2641	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	22.0	96.0
201607	2642	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201607	2643	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201607	2644	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201607	2645	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we adjourn for now?	52.0	65.0
201607	2646	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have a reception and dinner, as usual, across the street, and we will reconvene at 9:00 am tomorrow.	52.0	65.0
201607	2648	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	July 27 Session .	52.0	65.0
201607	2649	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201607	2650	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201607	2651	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	11.0	65.0
201607	2652	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We have a data release this morning.	11.0	65.0
201607	2653	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me ask David Wilcox if he’d like to comment on that.	11.0	65.0
201607	2654	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t have a detailed readout.	11.0	999.0
201607	2655	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	I did just speak with our sector specialists, and they’re still processing the data.	11.0	999.0
201607	2656	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s clear that the release is weaker than we had anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201607	2657	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This is the advance report on orders and shipments of durable goods, which feeds into the BEA’s estimate of equipment and intangibles investment.	11.0	999.0
201607	2658	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This release, probably more than any other, is very opaque to read.	11.0	999.0
201607	2659	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	Translating the orders and shipments data into estimates of equipment investment is not straightforward.	11.0	999.0
201607	2660	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s clear, though, that this will take our estimate down into negative territory.	11.0	999.0
201607	2661	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	We’d had real equipment and intangible investment about flat in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201607	2662	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	This will take it down by about 1 percentage point.	11.0	999.0
201607	2663	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s probably worth about one-tenth on the growth of GDP in the second quarter—we were at 1.8 in the Tealbook, and we’re probably down at about 1.7 now—and another one-tenth out of the third quarter, give or take.	11.0	999.0
201607	2664	2016-07-27	meeting	WILCOX	So that would put us at about 1.8 in the third quarter.	11.0	999.0
201607	2665	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201607	2666	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201607	2667	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201607	2668	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess we’re ready to begin our policy round.	23.0	65.0
201607	2669	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We already do have one suggestion on the table for an edit to the statement pertaining to residential investment.	23.0	65.0
201607	2670	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me tee that up, and I will ask you as we go around if you would like to comment on your views about this change.	23.0	65.0
201607	2671	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams—and I did hear some support from others—suggests that in alternative B, we simply delete any reference to residential investment rather than saying that it, along with business fixed investment, has been soft.	23.0	65.0
201607	2672	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So the sentence would read “Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft,” and that would be an alternative to the wording that’s currently in alternative B.	23.0	65.0
201607	2673	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	As we go around, I would appreciate it if you would comment briefly on that change.	23.0	65.0
201607	2674	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201607	2675	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin our go-round with Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201607	2676	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201607	2677	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, even though I find some of the language of alternative A to be more compatible with my views.	23.0	97.0
201607	2678	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The additional sentence in paragraph 2 of alternative B on the diminution of near-term risks is in itself correct, though by not mentioning the admittedly hard-to-quantify medium-term risks to the global economy associated with the Brexit vote result and its aftermath, the sentence perhaps leaves a marginally more upbeat message than might be strictly accurate, at least with respect to international risks.	23.0	97.0
201607	2679	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I’m willing to accept the sentence as it is.	23.0	97.0
201607	2680	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	The inclusion of this sentence obviously reflects at least some shift in the Committee’s risk assessment and thus some reorientation of its monetary policy stance, but the statement wisely omits any language suggesting some lean of the Committee toward raising rates at an upcoming meeting.	23.0	97.0
201607	2681	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, conditional on my current assessment of economic conditions, I would oppose any such language on substantive grounds, but I think that, no matter what one’s policy view, institutional considerations—namely, the Committee’s credibility—argue against inclusion of any such language.	23.0	97.0
201607	2682	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t want another instance in which language that raises the prospect of a rate increase in an upcoming meeting is interpreted by markets as perhaps less conditional than it was actually intended by the Committee or its participants.	23.0	97.0
201607	2683	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Market expectations of the path of the federal funds rate and of the likelihood of an increase at specific upcoming meetings have indeed adjusted in response to the ups and downs of recent economic data and developments.	23.0	97.0
201607	2684	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Because a good bit can happen between now and the remainder of this year’s meetings, and on account of the propensity of markets to overread any suggestion by the Committee of an increase at a particular meeting or in a particular time frame, we should let the economic data do more of the talking for us.	23.0	97.0
201607	2685	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Should market expectations vary too substantially in either direction, the Chair, at her discretion and depending on her assessment of where the Committee stands, could use her public speaking opportunities, including but not limited to her Jackson Hole speech, to affect these expectations.	23.0	97.0
201607	2686	2016-07-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201607	2687	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2688	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201607	2689	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201607	2690	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative C.	23.0	102.0
201607	2691	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The uncertainties that argued for a delay at our June meeting have largely been resolved, with a favorable baseline economic outlook intact.	23.0	102.0
201607	2692	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	A broad range of labor market indicators continue to point to conditions consistent with full employment, while inflation remains on a gradual upward trend toward 2 percent.	23.0	102.0
201607	2693	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Continued delay in raising the funds rate risks putting us “behind the curve” and creates the risk of greater fallout if we have to hike rates quickly to get back on track.	23.0	102.0
201607	2694	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I know it’s popular to describe the glacial pace of policy adjustment as cautious, but, to my eye, this approach is becoming increasingly risky in terms of raising future potential risks to financial stability and the economy.	23.0	102.0
201607	2695	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This echoes remarks that Presidents Rosengren and Mester made yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201607	2696	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In principle, I would support a rate increase today, but that would be highly confusing and disruptive against the background of our prior communications.	23.0	102.0
201607	2697	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I strongly prefer alternative C with paragraph 3′, which indicates that the case for an increase in the funds rate has strengthened over the intermeeting period.	23.0	102.0
201607	2698	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Short of alternative C, we should at least explicitly acknowledge in alternative B that the case for raising rates has increased and certainly hasn’t diminished.	23.0	102.0
201607	2699	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This optionality allows for data-dependent adjustments as we go forward, but with the modal federal funds rate path of the June SEP still on the table.	23.0	102.0
201607	2700	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, alternative B as written will likely be understood as indicating that a September increase is unlikely, thus precluding the possibility of two rate hikes this year.	23.0	102.0
201607	2701	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This would be viewed as a downward revision to the near-term funds rate path relative to our median and modal June SEP numbers.	23.0	102.0
201607	2702	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As conditions since June have stayed on track or even improved relative to expectations in some respects, such a shift to lower rates and greater monetary accommodation seems out of tune with our strategy and with our communications up to this point.	23.0	102.0
201607	2703	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of comments on the statement language, which I found problematic in a number of respects.	23.0	102.0
201607	2704	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, in all three alternatives, paragraph 1 refers to the swing in job gains in May and June.	23.0	102.0
201607	2705	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This specificity about the monthly data releases may strengthen market perceptions that our actions are—in the apt phrasing of Governor Brainard—data point dependent.	23.0	102.0
201607	2706	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our communications should not foster a fixation on the monthly ups and downs of the data.	23.0	102.0
201607	2707	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I would simply delete the sentence in alternatives B and C that says “job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.”	23.0	102.0
201607	2708	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, as I’ve already talked about and as the Chair mentioned, I would strike the phrase “and residential investment” in paragraph 1.	23.0	102.0
201607	2709	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just want to remind us that real residential investment jumped at an annual pace of 15 percent in the first quarter.	23.0	102.0
201607	2710	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although recent indicators suggest some slowing of residential investment, this is only a partial payback for the torrid pace of growth early in the year.	23.0	102.0
201607	2711	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think it would misrepresent the situation to characterize homebuilding as soft and would be especially misleading to lump residential investment together with business investment, as the latter has been on a notable downtrend for quite some time.	23.0	102.0
201607	2712	2016-07-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201607	2713	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201607	2714	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d just ask a question—perhaps of Thomas—because we hadn’t had any discussion about omitting the phrase about residential investment.	23.0	91.0
201607	2715	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Last time, it was referred to.	23.0	91.0
201607	2716	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If you take it out, is there any mention of residential investment?	23.0	91.0
201607	2717	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	How do market watchers generally respond to some complete omission?	23.0	91.0
201607	2718	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Is it going to get more prominence or less prominence?	23.0	91.0
201607	2719	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re also taking out the reference to trade.	23.0	96.0
201607	2720	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, the reference to net exports is going, too.	23.0	65.0
201607	2721	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2722	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Could I just ask the staff their opinion on this?	23.0	91.0
201607	2723	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2724	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	To be upfront, I have a very hard time making good guesses about how market watchers might respond to changes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2725	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I understand that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2726	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2727	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But, that said, one interpretation is that there’s no news.	23.0	999.0
201607	2728	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is certainly what we intended with the striking of the reference to net exports, because there was really nothing new to report.	23.0	999.0
201607	2729	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, I have to confess that I don’t know exactly when the reference to residential investment was added to the statement.	23.0	999.0
201607	2730	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I would have to look that up.	23.0	999.0
201607	2731	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s certainly been in there for a number of rounds, but it hasn’t always been there.	23.0	999.0
201607	2732	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I would think that it will be noticed as a downgrade, because if you no longer say that it’s improving, it seems to imply it’s doing less, and that would be consistent with the recent data flow.	23.0	999.0
201607	2733	2016-07-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So my guess would be that it would be interpreted as a soft downgrading.	23.0	999.0
201607	2734	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	23.0	91.0
201607	2735	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201607	2736	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201607	2737	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201607	2738	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	In my mind, the most useful benchmarks for evaluating the stance of monetary policy are the policy rules that seem to capture the way we’ve behaved in past periods during which we were relatively successful.	23.0	81.0
201607	2739	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One can argue about the details of particular rules, but just about every one that makes it to our desk has the policy rate deviating from normal in response to an inflation gap and some measure of a real-activity gap.	23.0	81.0
201607	2740	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Because these gaps are small now, we should be returning our policy rate to more normal settings, with an adjustment for the possibility, of course, of a lower natural real rate.	23.0	81.0
201607	2741	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Tealbook B puts the prescribed policy rate for either Taylor rule at about 2.4 percent, and that’s 200 basis points away from our current policy setting.	23.0	81.0
201607	2742	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	A departure from our benchmark of that magnitude is fairly large.	23.0	81.0
201607	2743	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	One might argue that the natural real rate is lower than the 1 percent value assumed by the Tealbook staff.	23.0	81.0
201607	2744	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, the current estimate using the Laubach-Williams procedure is around zero, and the Lubik-Matthes estimates are very similar.	23.0	81.0
201607	2745	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Even in this case, though, the prescribed policy rate would be 1½ percent, more than 100 basis points higher than the current rate, and I think that’s still a large gap by historical standards.	23.0	81.0
201607	2746	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve occasionally been 100 basis points away from the Taylor rule in the past, but never for a sustained stretch.	23.0	81.0
201607	2747	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	On top of that, it’s worth pointing out something about the Laubach-Williams procedure.	23.0	81.0
201607	2748	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Their procedure produces a joint estimate of the natural real rate and the output gap, the two latent variables in their set-up.	23.0	81.0
201607	2749	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Their current estimate of the output gap is large and positive, about 140 basis points.	23.0	81.0
201607	2750	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	The natural, internally consistent way is to apply both their natural real rate and their output gap estimates at the same time, and the net effect of doing that results in a Taylor rule policy prescription of 2¼ or 3 percent, depending on whether you use Taylor (1993) or Taylor (1999).	23.0	81.0
201607	2751	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This again implies that the funds rate is now very far below where it should be by those prescriptions.	23.0	81.0
201607	2752	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Some would say that the real-activity gap might still be negative, as opposed to the staff’s calculation of an essentially zero output gap.	23.0	81.0
201607	2753	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	This would imply a lower Taylor rule prescription.	23.0	81.0
201607	2754	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	For example, a natural unemployment rate of 4 percent or lower would justify the current policy rate.	23.0	81.0
201607	2755	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, 4 percent is well below all of our estimates of the natural rate, but those estimates, of course, are notoriously imprecise.	23.0	81.0
201607	2756	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I can understand the motivation for delaying an increase in rates.	23.0	81.0
201607	2757	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’d all like to see more employment opportunities for as many Americans as possible.	23.0	81.0
201607	2758	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But theory and experience tell us that there are risks on both sides.	23.0	81.0
201607	2759	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	Waiting too long to raise rates can leave us with a higher unemployment rate later on as we fight against an increase in inflation.	23.0	81.0
201607	2760	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	There’s an argument that we’re perfectly capable of responding effectively if inflation should surge, but our ability to do so depends on inflation expectations remaining anchored or, if they start to drift, on our ability to manage and contain them.	23.0	81.0
201607	2761	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	At present, our understanding of the formation and evolution of expectations is fairly limited.	23.0	81.0
201607	2762	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	They may seem anchored now, but they’ve been quite variable at times in the past, and I don’t think we have much of an analytical basis for predicting how or when they might become unanchored.	23.0	81.0
201607	2763	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	But I think we do know that unstable expectations in the past have been associated with departures from good benchmark policy rules.	23.0	81.0
201607	2764	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	If expectations become unanchored, then it would surely reflect beliefs that we are departing from those past patterns of behavior.	23.0	81.0
201607	2765	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	And, surely, if expectations are anchored, it reflects a sense that we’re going to continue in a way that’s relatively consistent with those past patterns of behavior.	23.0	81.0
201607	2766	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think it should be evident that the further we deviate from those benchmarks, the greater the risk that inflation and inflation expectations break away.	23.0	81.0
201607	2767	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think that there are serious risks associated with probing, as the phrase is, to see if the natural rate of unemployment might be below where we are right now.	23.0	81.0
201607	2768	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve delayed raising rates this year in part because of events that have caused uncertainty arise.	23.0	81.0
201607	2769	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	When uncertainty subsides, as it clearly has now, we should seize the moment and get on with it rather than continue to fall further behind our benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201607	2770	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	I think now is one of those times, a time for opportunistic normalization.	23.0	81.0
201607	2771	2016-07-27	meeting	LACKER	So I support alternative C and paragraph 3.	23.0	81.0
201607	2772	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2773	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201607	2774	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201607	2775	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B for this meeting, although I could have also been supportive of some of the stronger language in alternative C.	23.0	90.0
201607	2776	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My preference for this meeting is for a statement tilting more strongly toward indicating an increase in the federal funds rate at the next meeting.	23.0	90.0
201607	2777	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I view the statement as leaving open the possibility of an increase in September, but I think it is unlikely to raise the market probability of a September increase as much as I view is warranted.	23.0	90.0
201607	2778	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am not arguing for calendar-dependent promises in the statement.	23.0	90.0
201607	2779	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The volatility in payroll employment over the past two months, as well as the surprise Brexit vote, highlights risks in such a strategy.	23.0	90.0
201607	2780	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the relatively modest changes in the statement outside of the first paragraph are likely to leave many outside of this room expecting no change in September.	23.0	90.0
201607	2781	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If incoming data are consistent with my forecast, which I see as requiring a rate increase in September, we may need to use speeches and other opportunities to communicate to the public the increased probability of a September move.	23.0	90.0
201607	2782	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Stepping aside from the near-term tactical decisions, I think it’s important to reframe how we have been thinking about policy normalization.	23.0	90.0
201607	2783	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we have been extremely and justifiably patient to date in ensuring the economy gets very near our dual-mandate goals before raising the funds rate, we should not view our decisions as balancing on a knife’s edge between action and inaction.	23.0	90.0
201607	2784	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	At this point, I believe that we should change from a default of no action unless everything is perfect in the next six-week period to a default of a plan to take action unless circumstances significantly alter our outlook.	23.0	90.0
201607	2785	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is, my preference would be that unless incoming data and events suggest a material change to the forecast, we should tighten in September.	23.0	90.0
201607	2786	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of the natural rate is 4.7 percent.	23.0	90.0
201607	2787	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I believe that a baseline forecast that results in a 4.3 percent unemployment rate implies that we will need to tighten more rapidly.	23.0	90.0
201607	2788	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we receive evidence that suggests that the natural rate is in the low 4s, we can slow down the rate of increase in the funds rate increase later on in the normalization process.	23.0	90.0
201607	2789	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Further, there remain some upside risks relative to our baseline outlook, and were those risks to materialize, we would, of course, need to tighten even more quickly.	23.0	90.0
201607	2790	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But such rapid rate adjustments run an even greater risk of jeopardizing the attainment of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201607	2791	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, uncertainty regarding the estimate of the equilibrium interest rate further bolsters the argument for gradual tightening, as a gradual increase affords us the time to gauge whether we have gone too far or not far enough.	23.0	90.0
201607	2792	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For all of these reasons, I am concerned that we may be waiting too long to remove accommodation, with a consequence of having to raise rates more rapidly later in the normalization process, placing the attainment of full employment and price stability at greater risk than is warranted.	23.0	90.0
201607	2793	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I would remove the reference to residential investment.	23.0	90.0
201607	2794	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2795	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201607	2796	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201607	2797	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In making my decision as to which of the three alternatives to support, I found the material on pages 30 to 35 of Tealbook B very useful.	23.0	108.0
201607	2798	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the material that makes the case for supporting each of the potential decisions.	23.0	108.0
201607	2799	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	On the basis of the arguments set out in those pages and other evidence and considerations—including the comments I made at our previous meeting, which was only six weeks ago—I support alternative B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2800	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Alternative B makes a case for leaving the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting and avoiding “signaling the timing of the next policy move.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2801	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I would, nonetheless, like to comment on some of the statements made in “The Case for Alternative B” on pages 30 and 31 of Tealbook B and to say that there’s a difference between signaling the precise timing and signaling an approximate timing or signaling that the next policy move has come closer.	23.0	108.0
201607	2802	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	All right.	23.0	108.0
201607	2803	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Here are my comments on the arguments in Tealbook B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2804	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are two statements in the Economic Outlook section on page 30 of Tealbook B.	23.0	108.0
201607	2805	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	One says “Policymakers may view the information they have received about the labor market and real activity as consistent, on balance, with their modal forecasts at the time of the June FOMC meeting.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2806	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the second says “Policymakers may judge that near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2807	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I disagree with the first statement.	23.0	108.0
201607	2808	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I believe the data we received on June payrolls and the effects of Brexit are better than my forecasts in June would have been had I made one.	23.0	108.0
201607	2809	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I do believe that near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.	23.0	108.0
201607	2810	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to longer- term risks, I believe that the Brexit decision will result in more uncertainty about political and economic developments in the United Kingdom—or at least in what is now the United Kingdom—and the European Union, but that this will have relatively little effect on the United States unless it leads to major changes in the structure of the EU.	23.0	108.0
201607	2811	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The analysis of the labor market in this section of Tealbook B says that “a range of labor market indicators points to increasing utilization; however, the unemployment rate, at 4.9 percent in June, is unchanged, on net, since the beginning of the year.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2812	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	When the unemployment rate was well above 5 percent, we began to say that to raise the interest rate, we’d need to see continuing improvements in the labor market and an increase in inflation.	23.0	108.0
201607	2813	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we’ve seen improvements in the labor market in recent months, particularly including in increases in the participation rate.	23.0	108.0
201607	2814	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But, at some point, we’ll have to say that maintenance of strong conditions in the labor market is the situation we want to sustain.	23.0	108.0
201607	2815	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I believe that an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is near enough to most people’s measure of full employment to say that we’re close to having a strong conditions in the labor market, although no doubt we would all be happy to discover that a lower unemployment rate, somewhere around 4.5 percent, is consistent with maximum employment, stable prices, and the maintenance of strong conditions in the labor market.	23.0	108.0
201607	2816	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	My next comment is that we need at some point to take a closer look at what behavior we demand of the inflation rate.	23.0	108.0
201607	2817	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Over the past year, we have allowed ourselves to imply that inflation is too low if it is less than 2 percent, without recognizing that there’s a difference between an inflation rate of 1.6 percent and one of 1.2 percent.	23.0	108.0
201607	2818	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We have accepted that we’ll treat divergences from the inflation target symmetrically.	23.0	108.0
201607	2819	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Is there anyone here who will fight to reduce the inflation rate from 2.2 percent to 2 percent when we reach 2.2 percent?	23.0	108.0
201607	2820	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Next, the Policy Strategy section states that “the rebound in job gains represents only one month of data.	23.0	108.0
201607	2821	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	By the time of the September FOMC meeting, policymakers will have seen two more employment reports and may have a better sense of the underlying trend in employment growth.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2822	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I agree with that.	23.0	108.0
201607	2823	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	But I believe that September should not be ruled out as being too soon to raise the rate if the incoming data are very positive, and I do not think we’re far from making such a decision.	23.0	108.0
201607	2824	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The final argument in “The Case for Alternative B” in Tealbook B is that “a decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate would be in line with the expectations of financial market participants.”	23.0	108.0
201607	2825	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	In our discussions, we should recognize that what financial market participants believe is heavily influenced by what we say, and that nothing we have said of late would cause them to think that the decision will be anything other than to keep the interest rate unchanged.	23.0	108.0
201607	2826	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we know that if we were to send a different signal about future interest rates than that implied by alternative B, financial market participants would have different expectations.	23.0	108.0
201607	2827	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I find some conflict, to some extent, between what is said at the beginning in this discussion about how we think that the data we’ve received is better and the fact that we take comfort that the markets agree with us.	23.0	108.0
201607	2828	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The markets should have raised their expectations a little bit, and they haven’t because we’re sending a very clear message, one that I think is too strong.	23.0	108.0
201607	2829	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Let me conclude.	23.0	108.0
201607	2830	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re close to our full employment objective.	23.0	108.0
201607	2831	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	The underlying pace of inflation is not far from 2 percent, and our best guess at the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate is near but above zero, and we’re below it.	23.0	108.0
201607	2832	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, depending on the data, it could be appropriate to take another cautious policy step in September.	23.0	108.0
201607	2833	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Aside from the last word of the statement, which in June was “July” and has now become “September,” this is what I said and believed six weeks ago.	23.0	108.0
201607	2834	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I hope that one of these months, one of these six-week periods, what I hope and believe will happen in the next meeting will happen.	23.0	108.0
201607	2835	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	23.0	108.0
201607	2836	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2837	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201607	2838	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201607	2839	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think the normalization process is going well.	23.0	94.0
201607	2840	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We ended QE in the fall of 2014.	23.0	94.0
201607	2841	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We said we would begin normalizing rates in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201607	2842	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We made only one move that year, at the last meeting of the year.	23.0	94.0
201607	2843	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	We have made no further moves during 2016.	23.0	94.0
201607	2844	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is against a backdrop of an economy that has not behaved very differently from forecasts of a few years ago, especially on inflation and unemployment.	23.0	94.0
201607	2845	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment has tended to surprise to the downside for us, and inflation has actually been very consistent with the forecast that it would remain below 2 percent.	23.0	94.0
201607	2846	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is in contrast to our narrative for normalization embodied in the Tealbook and in the Summary of Economic Projections.	23.0	94.0
201607	2847	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	As I discussed yesterday, the Tealbook narrative suggests that we are on the precipice of a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201607	2848	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a little less than once per quarter.	23.0	94.0
201607	2849	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This comes from using the updated Taylor (1999) rule, which also informs many others and has historically informed many judgments among the Committee about the pace of rate increases.	23.0	94.0
201607	2850	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	According to the Tealbook, these increases are going to take place against a backdrop of relatively weak economic growth in the near term, an unemployment rate that is just three-tenths lower at the end of 2017 than it is today, and an inflation rate that remains below target.	23.0	94.0
201607	2851	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that this is a realistic narrative.	23.0	94.0
201607	2852	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it forces us to draw on increasingly tenuous excuses as to why we are not following through on our announced plans.	23.0	94.0
201607	2853	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is hurting our credibility.	23.0	94.0
201607	2854	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets discounted this narrative long ago, and our actions this year are ratifying their expectations.	23.0	94.0
201607	2855	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Fed’s new narrative improves on this situation.	23.0	94.0
201607	2856	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests a relatively flat policy rate path with some upside risk, depending on how the data evolve.	23.0	94.0
201607	2857	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It does not leave a 200-plus basis point policy move lingering over the market.	23.0	94.0
201607	2858	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests that r† is minus 140 basis points, which is the ex post real return on one-year Treasury securities over the past three years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2859	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real returns on short-term government debt are unlikely to switch to higher values any time soon, nor is mean reversion a good prediction.	23.0	94.0
201607	2860	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The best guess is that this situation will simply persist, at least over a period of two to two-and-a-half years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2861	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Federal Reserve narrative realistically suggests that the current slow-growth environment is likely to continue.	23.0	94.0
201607	2862	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It suggests that the labor market is essentially at full employment and perhaps will not improve further, in a situation of relatively slow growth.	23.0	94.0
201607	2863	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	It also suggests that inflation does not look set to increase very far above our 2 percent target.	23.0	94.0
201607	2864	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The conclusion is that a relatively low policy rate is consistent with achieving our inflation target and full employment over the next two and a half years.	23.0	94.0
201607	2865	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Adoption of the St Louis approach would, in my view, improve the alignment of market expectations with the likely future path of policy.	23.0	94.0
201607	2866	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	For today, I support alternative B.	23.0	94.0
201607	2867	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Federal Reserve Bank of St.	23.0	94.0
201607	2868	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Louis approach does call for one more rate increase, and I would be happy to make this move at the September meeting, provided the data cooperate.	23.0	94.0
201607	2869	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do prefer to move on good news about the economy.	23.0	94.0
201607	2870	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I would also support President Williams’s suggestion on residential investment.	23.0	94.0
201607	2871	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201607	2872	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2873	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201607	2874	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair. in light of my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy and the slow but persistent march of inflation to target, the language in alternative B seems a bit too equivocal even after the most recent changes.	23.0	999.0
201607	2875	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	The two matters we talked about yesterday, the two most pressing concerns at our June meeting, have dissolved.	23.0	999.0
201607	2876	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	In June, 287,000 net new jobs were added, and financial markets were generally unfazed by the Brexit vote after the initial shock wore off.	23.0	999.0
201607	2877	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I welcome the recent change to paragraph 2 stating that the “near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.”	23.0	999.0
201607	2878	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That said, the message in alternative B is only modestly changed from June, and I fear that the reaction will be similar, taking the next meeting off the table.	23.0	999.0
201607	2879	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	It could also very well indicate that our policy is insufficiently sensitive to events on the upside.	23.0	999.0
201607	2880	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	That insensitivity may, in turn, serve to confuse markets on exactly what types of data will be sufficient for normalization to proceed.	23.0	999.0
201607	2881	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	If we are delaying normalization because we need much greater evidence that inflation is indeed trending upward, then perhaps we should make that point more explicitly.	23.0	999.0
201607	2882	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Or if uncertainty over the level of the natural real rate leads to the belief that policy is not overly accommodative, that point should be articulated.	23.0	999.0
201607	2883	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	But whatever is driving the unresponsiveness of policy needs to be stated clearly.	23.0	999.0
201607	2884	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Communicating a very similar message either in the statement or in public comments under what I perceive to be clearly improved economic circumstances does not seem to represent a strategy that will allow a September rate increase to be a realistic option.	23.0	999.0
201607	2885	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So what can we do?	23.0	999.0
201607	2886	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	While I can live with alternative B as is today, one possible improvement is to add language, like that in alternative C, stating that the near-term risks to the economy are nearly balanced or have become more balanced, instead of saying that they have diminished.	23.0	999.0
201607	2887	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	This more positive tone in the language would send a clearer signal that September is a possibility without overpromising that a move would indeed occur.	23.0	999.0
201607	2888	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	And on residential investment, I also support President Williams’s view.	23.0	999.0
201607	2889	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	2890	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2891	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201607	2892	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201607	2893	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B with both proposed amendments by President Williams.	23.0	110.0
201607	2894	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That includes the one on job gains in June versus May for the reasons he articulated.	23.0	110.0
201607	2895	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I support both of those edits.	23.0	110.0
201607	2896	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think the case for removing some amount of accommodation has strengthened since June.	23.0	110.0
201607	2897	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	First, on the pro side, I believe we are making progress in achieving our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	110.0
201607	2898	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean as well as other, similar measures of core inflation are gradually moving in a direction that suggests we will reach our inflation target in the medium term.	23.0	110.0
201607	2899	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think labor market slack is declining and we are moving toward full employment, and I hope that upcoming data will give us an opportunity to confirm this.	23.0	110.0
201607	2900	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Second, I believe excesses are building, although not to the point at which I’m alarmed.	23.0	110.0
201607	2901	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As has been discussed, I am concerned about commercial real estate.	23.0	110.0
201607	2902	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also—I must say, maybe colored by my background—concerned about what I see in stock market valuation.	23.0	110.0
201607	2903	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	By my measure—and I’m using a per-share number of $115— market P/E is getting close to 19 times earnings in a period when corporate earnings are actually declining.	23.0	110.0
201607	2904	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m concerned about where the markets are going to go from here.	23.0	110.0
201607	2905	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My experience is, when stock market valuations become excessive, there may be imbalances building up outside the banking system, particularly in the nonbank financial markets, some of which we, at the Federal Reserve, are not able to see.	23.0	110.0
201607	2906	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m slightly concerned about the buildup in nonbank financial debt—that is, on the corporate side—although I think that’s still manageable.	23.0	110.0
201607	2907	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do worry about distortions in asset allocation—disincentives for savers as the population ages and people tend to live off their incomes—and I’m worried overall about a rise in risk-taking, particularly as we move from here.	23.0	110.0
201607	2908	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In terms of the cons, I do believe the market is certainly unprepared today for us to raise rates, as we know, and they seem to be not quite prepared for September, either.	23.0	110.0
201607	2909	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think the uncertainties of Brexit as well as China—which, to me, is a significant risk—are unlikely to be resolved any time soon.	23.0	110.0
201607	2910	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Between now and September, though, we’ll get a little bit better clarity on the Italian bank situation, which I do think is worth watching.	23.0	110.0
201607	2911	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, obviously, we’ll get two additional job reports, which will help in confirming the trend on the labor markets.	23.0	110.0
201607	2912	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’ll also get a chance to more clearly see if the recent strength in new home sales translates into a pickup in permits for single-family homes.	23.0	110.0
201607	2913	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also persuaded by our work and the comments made here regarding the neutral rate that it is lower than widely recognized.	23.0	110.0
201607	2914	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with President Harker that we have not clearly communicated this.	23.0	110.0
201607	2915	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think that we are not as accommodative as is widely believed, and, on the margin, that reduces the urgency for us to move or, to say it another way, allows us to be patient.	23.0	110.0
201607	2916	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But in light of all of this, as I said, I favor alternative B as amended, although I am forward leaning in us gradually and patiently moving toward removal of accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201607	2917	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we approach our September meeting, I would hope that if incoming data warrant, FOMC communication, potentially from the Chair at Jackson Hole or some other venues, will, as has been suggested, begin to signal to the market that we believe removal of some accommodation is warranted in the near future.	23.0	110.0
201607	2918	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201607	2919	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2920	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201607	2921	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201607	2922	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I have no objection to the change in language with regard to housing.	23.0	91.0
201607	2923	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I would think it would be better to come up with a characterization of what it is rather than just deleting it entirely.	23.0	91.0
201607	2924	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think what happens in this case is that people probably think, “Oh, they mentioned housing last time.	23.0	91.0
201607	2925	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Let me go see what the latest data were.	23.0	91.0
201607	2926	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I can’t remember.”	23.0	91.0
201607	2927	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	And if they see that the data were kind of soft, they’re going to have to come up with their own interpretation.	23.0	91.0
201607	2928	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	But I don’t have any objection to omitting it.	23.0	91.0
201607	2929	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	On the basis of my outlook and my expectations for continued data confirmations, I support alternative B as written.	23.0	91.0
201607	2930	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned yesterday, my economic growth outlook has not changed materially since June, though I do think the downside risks have diminished some.	23.0	91.0
201607	2931	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve also made no changes to my inflation outlook or my readings of the downside risks to it.	23.0	91.0
201607	2932	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think alternative B captures these sentiments for me.	23.0	91.0
201607	2933	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Clearly, more of the focus today is on what we’re going to be doing in September and beyond.	23.0	91.0
201607	2934	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If there were no material changes to my baseline forecast or risk assessments, then I could see the case for a rate increase in September.	23.0	91.0
201607	2935	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s not my preferred course, and it would be a close call.	23.0	91.0
201607	2936	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	However, I would not support a September move if our communications led markets to think that a second increase in December was highly likely in the absence of very strong data.	23.0	91.0
201607	2937	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s important that we allow adequate time to assess the economic reactions to our next policy move before taking the next step after that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2938	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe conditions would improve enough to justify another move in December, but my base case is, they will not.	23.0	91.0
201607	2939	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Either way, in my opinion, there’s just too much uncertainty to precondition markets to expect an end-of-year funds rate target in the range of 75 to 100 basis points.	23.0	91.0
201607	2940	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	As I mentioned last round, I continue to be attracted to the forward-guidance language in alternative A.	23.0	91.0
201607	2941	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	It says “The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”	23.0	91.0
201607	2942	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Frankly, I would wait until core PCE is 2 percent and projected to be at least 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	23.0	91.0
201607	2943	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a strong commitment to our symmetric 2 percent inflation target, one that would likely provide much needed support to private inflation expectations.	23.0	91.0
201607	2944	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Our inflation projections would benefit more from an increase in inflation expectations than from a lower unemployment rate.	23.0	91.0
201607	2945	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I disagree with President Lacker on this issue, because I think the evidence favors viewing inflation expectations as moving lower than our inflation objective and not the case that he was worried about in terms of them being unstable on the upside.	23.0	91.0
201607	2946	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding Governor Fischer’s question as to whether Committee members would fight inflation of 2.2 percent if it was above 2 percent, I actually have no evidence on that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2947	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	After seven years, I have no data points to answer that, because we haven’t had inflation above 2 percent.	23.0	91.0
201607	2948	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In the spirit of something a bit more like alternative A, I would feel much more comfortable increasing rates in September if by then core inflation appeared clearly positioned to come in higher than my 2016 forecast, which, like the Tealbook’s, is 1.6 percent.	23.0	91.0
201607	2949	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	President Williams suggested yesterday that recent core inflation has been 2 percent, and others have made sympathetic comments about that as well.	23.0	91.0
201607	2950	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	I hope that continues in the coming months and years even if the most recent monthly averages are like that.	23.0	91.0
201607	2951	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, policy asymmetries continue to argue for our communication that a very shallow expected path for normalization is appropriate, as our SEP submissions display.	23.0	91.0
201607	2952	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	We’re still only a modest negative shock away from returning to the effective lower bound, while, on the other side, if an inflation shock occurs, the inflation process is inertial enough that we most likely can avoid any meaningful overshooting of 2 percent with modest increases in rates and the low r* we expect into the indefinite future, at least according to the most recent Laubach-Williams update that I saw.	23.0	91.0
201607	2953	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, as I discussed yesterday following the QS report, I see the apparent changes in long-duration investor attitudes as diminishing potential financial instability concerns that might be associated with a modestly steeper tightening than our recent SEP displays.	23.0	91.0
201607	2954	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	If real-money investors have come to believe that low equilibrium interest rates are a fixture of this economy, then we face a lower chance of experiencing a taper tantrum–like fillip in financial conditions if we have to pull policy normalization forward in time.	23.0	91.0
201607	2955	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	In sum, I remain on the fence about a move in September, but whatever we do then, I think we should continue to communicate our basic policy strategy for slow, gradual rate increases dependent on the Committee’s confidence in achieving its dual-mandate goals in as timely a fashion as possible.	23.0	91.0
201607	2956	2016-07-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201607	2957	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2958	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201607	2959	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201607	2960	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As a Committee, we continue to debate whether we are approaching a point when further rate increases are appropriate.	23.0	111.0
201607	2961	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Because we can’t perfectly foresee the future path of the economy, as many others have said, I’m in favor of taking a risk-management approach and avoiding policy choices that could lead to especially poor outcomes.	23.0	111.0
201607	2962	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In my view, the costs associated with a monetary policy stance that, after the fact, turns out to be too tight are likely much larger than the costs of a stance that, after the fact, turns out to have been too loose.	23.0	111.0
201607	2963	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Many others have made these comments as well.	23.0	111.0
201607	2964	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Regarding the alternatives presented, I support alternative B, but I don’t have a strong view on President Williams’s changes.	23.0	111.0
201607	2965	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m okay with those changes either way, but I personally am not in favor of the language that was added to paragraph 2.	23.0	111.0
201607	2966	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I understand the distinction between near-term risks and medium-term risks, but I think it’s a little bit too subtle.	23.0	111.0
201607	2967	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	It isn’t clear to me that the risks to the economic outlook have diminished.	23.0	111.0
201607	2968	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, maybe more important, I don’t think the phrase is actually necessary to preserving optionality for September.	23.0	111.0
201607	2969	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the statement as written preserves that optionality.	23.0	111.0
201607	2970	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We always say that every meeting is a live meeting.	23.0	111.0
201607	2971	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So why do we therefore have to signal that we really mean the next meeting is “live,” if we always say that every meeting is a “live” meeting?	23.0	111.0
201607	2972	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In filling out the June SEP, I indicated one increase in the federal funds rate for 2016 because I expected that, and I hope now that tightening labor markets will continue to push inflation toward our 2 percent target.	23.0	111.0
201607	2973	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I haven’t seen the evidence of that yet.	23.0	111.0
201607	2974	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I know that in recent months, there’s been a little bit of an uptick, but on a year-over-year basis, there’s not any real evidence of it.	23.0	111.0
201607	2975	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So, for me, I need to see real evidence that we’re moving toward 2 percent before I can support a rate increase.	23.0	111.0
201607	2976	2016-07-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201607	2977	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201607	2978	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201607	2979	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201607	2980	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I came to the meeting comfortable with the statement as written, but I have no objection to removing the reference to residential investment.	23.0	88.0
201607	2981	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think it will generate excessive attention even if it is, as Thomas said, a soft downgrade.	23.0	88.0
201607	2982	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	For this meeting, I believe it’s prudent to exercise patience and let the post-Brexit economic picture, as well as the array of risks and uncertainties regarding the outlook, congeal.	23.0	88.0
201607	2983	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think the Committee risks getting “behind the curve” by exercising patience at this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2984	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it’s appropriate to keep all options open for the September meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2985	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I can foresee conditions that would be a reasonable basis for a discussion of a rate move at that meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2986	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In broad strokes, here is a configuration of the incoming data that would make me pretty comfortable that the economy is on a track justifying serious consideration of a rate move.	23.0	88.0
201607	2987	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	First, second-quarter growth above 2 percent confirmed in official releases.	23.0	88.0
201607	2988	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll get the first estimate Friday and the second estimate on August 26.	23.0	88.0
201607	2989	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll also have most of the data releases having direct implications for revision in the third GDP estimate before the September meeting.	23.0	88.0
201607	2990	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Second, apparent third-quarter growth consistent with that of the second quarter.	23.0	88.0
201607	2991	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ll have almost all third-quarter GDP source data for July before the September meeting, but not much source data for August.	23.0	88.0
201607	2992	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But we will have auto sales for August and, most important, retail sales for August.	23.0	88.0
201607	2993	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Third, two more positive employment reports centered on payroll jobs gains comfortably above the breakeven number needed to cover labor force growth.	23.0	88.0
201607	2994	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As a marker, I’m thinking of 150,000 per month as being comfortably above that breakeven point.	23.0	88.0
201607	2995	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, continuing indications that inflation is firming and moving in the right direction.	23.0	88.0
201607	2996	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If a scenario consistent with these conditions plays out through mid-September, as I said, I think the Committee should give a rate increase serious consideration.	23.0	88.0
201607	2997	2016-07-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201607	2998	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	2999	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201607	3000	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201607	3001	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think Governor Tarullo’s comments yesterday about challenging our views and assumptions and being open to changing one’s mind is an important aspect of the job we do here.	23.0	103.0
201607	3002	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, because I have found my own views outside the consensus of the Committee from time to time, that kind of self-examination may come more naturally for me.	23.0	103.0
201607	3003	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	But I agree with him that it is an essential aspect of arriving at sound policy prescriptions.	23.0	103.0
201607	3004	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, I think it’s an obligation to the effective decisionmaking function of this Committee, to the economic well-being of the public we serve, and with the assurance that history will judge best whether our calibrations indeed achieve their aim.	23.0	103.0
201607	3005	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	So, with that in mind, I take a good dose of humility before these meetings, and, in that spirit, I’ll turn to my view on today’s policy choices.	23.0	103.0
201607	3006	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201607	3007	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Since our June meeting, job growth has been solid, GDP growth looks to be back near trend, markets have calmed after a surprise Brexit vote, and inflation outcomes are aligning with our statutory objectives.	23.0	103.0
201607	3008	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, I see a 25 basis point increase today as an appropriate adjustment to realized economic conditions, not necessarily a commitment to a preset path to normal rates.	23.0	103.0
201607	3009	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting longer to make adjustments is not a benign choice, in my view.	23.0	103.0
201607	3010	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	It challenges the clarity and the discipline of our monetary policy strategy, and it leans in the direction of accepting risk.	23.0	103.0
201607	3011	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	As deviations from policy rules become larger, explaining the rationale for not adjusting rates becomes both more difficult and more important.	23.0	103.0
201607	3012	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continuing to appeal to headwinds—including events abroad, a subdued pace of household formation, and low productivity growth—argues for further clarification.	23.0	103.0
201607	3013	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Household formation and productivity growth are more supply-side factors, or at least structural factors, that monetary policy is ill equipped to influence.	23.0	103.0
201607	3014	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Instead, insofar as these factors at least partially explain declines in estimates for the longer-run terminal rate, it is the case that adjustments to the rate need to occur sooner.	23.0	103.0
201607	3015	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I am mindful of the fact that financial stability is an essential condition for achieving our objectives for the economy.	23.0	103.0
201607	3016	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I’m concerned that this extended period of negative real rates can create incentives to “reach for yield” and can facilitate the misallocation of capital and the mispricing of risk.	23.0	103.0
201607	3017	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	But I do not believe raising rates should be a response to those realities.	23.0	103.0
201607	3018	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	It is too blunt a response, and the ability to both accurately identify these imbalances and time a proper response has historically, both here and abroad, proved challenging.	23.0	103.0
201607	3019	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I do worry about expectations of low rates for even longer becoming ingrained.	23.0	103.0
201607	3020	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I recently heard anecdotes from bankers in our District that they have been anticipating higher rates going back to 2011, when the Committee issued its first communication regarding normalization principles, and have managed their balance sheets accordingly.	23.0	103.0
201607	3021	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Now they are beginning to adjust those expectations, offering more longer-term fixed-rate loans with assumptions that the unusually low rate environment will persist even longer.	23.0	103.0
201607	3022	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	This seems likely to be happening in other sectors even if our measures of financial stability aren’t yet registering concern.	23.0	103.0
201607	3023	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I do not view gradual adjustments to our policy stance as a function of judging whether we are “behind the curve.”	23.0	103.0
201607	3024	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I’d prefer not to wait for that kind of evidence.	23.0	103.0
201607	3025	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Continuing to wait to see more data could send a message that our attempts to achieve some degree of normalization are failing or have become unnecessary.	23.0	103.0
201607	3026	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	At our June meeting, there were questions about whether we need to talk about normalization, and some expressed concern that the goal seemed to be that normalizing the federal funds rate as a default view was risky.	23.0	103.0
201607	3027	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think the Committee should, in fact, take stock of our communications and its strategy in this regard.	23.0	103.0
201607	3028	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Because the Committee outlined on several occasions since 2011 its intended path to policy normalization and then raised the federal funds rate last December, the Committee’s credibility will hinge on our ability to clarify that strategy.	23.0	103.0
201607	3029	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	Although we’ve not talked about revisiting those principles, I continue to think the reinvestment policy could offer an alternative or a complement to how we think about future rate increases, especially in a world that continues to demand safe assets.	23.0	103.0
201607	3030	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	And, finally, Madam Chair, on the language change, I can support dropping the reference to residential investment.	23.0	103.0
201607	3031	2016-07-27	meeting	GEORGE	I think that, either way, some in the markets will note whether it’s there or not there.	23.0	103.0
201607	3032	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3033	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201607	3034	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201607	3035	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	With my baseline assumptions, I see the appropriate path forward as one of gradual increases in the federal funds rate.	23.0	104.0
201607	3036	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	For me, the necessary conditions for further increases are, unsurprisingly, continued GDP growth at or above potential, continued progress in the labor market, and inflation moving back to 2 percent over time.	23.0	104.0
201607	3037	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I would like to see unemployment decline well below 5 percent, the current Tealbook estimate of the natural rate, and I’d like to see, in that context, what happens to wages and to labor force participation.	23.0	104.0
201607	3038	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	My baseline expectation is that those conditions will be fulfilled in the course of 2016.	23.0	104.0
201607	3039	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If they are, I will support further rate increases, and I can see one or two this year—again, if those conditions are fulfilled.	23.0	104.0
201607	3040	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	But if one or more of the conditions are not fulfilled or if obvious global risks emerge, in my view, it may be appropriate to pause.	23.0	104.0
201607	3041	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see the Committee as needing to be in a hurry to raise rates.	23.0	104.0
201607	3042	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We have below-target inflation and an apparent weakening in both demand and job creation.	23.0	104.0
201607	3043	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I do not feel a pressing need to take steps to slow the economy further.	23.0	104.0
201607	3044	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	It is plausible to me that those conditions will be fulfilled at the time of the September meeting.	23.0	104.0
201607	3045	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Two strong payroll reports, combined with decent demand, could well suffice.	23.0	104.0
201607	3046	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The market is currently pricing in a modest probability of an increase by the September meeting, and, in fact, the market has been moving that probability up materially in response to incoming data.	23.0	104.0
201607	3047	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the two payroll reports are strong, then the market will likely move substantially in the direction of an increase, and the rest of that gap could be closed through communication.	23.0	104.0
201607	3048	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	The question for today is whether to send a strong signal through the statement that an increase is likely in September.	23.0	104.0
201607	3049	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I would not do that, because I actually don’t know whether a rate increase in September is likely to be a good idea.	23.0	104.0
201607	3050	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	We gave a strong signal earlier in the year but were whipsawed by incoming data, and I’m reluctant to send a strong signal, as is contained in alternative C, paragraph 3′.	23.0	104.0
201607	3051	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	If the data do support a September increase, it will be straightforward to bring markets into better alignment with that event.	23.0	104.0
201607	3052	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	And if we send a strong signal now but the data don’t cooperate, then I think we are in a position of climbing down again, at real risk to the Committee’s credibility.	23.0	104.0
201607	3053	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think we should continue to say clearly that the path of tightening is likely to be gradual and dependent on the momentum of the economy, and we should let the data do the talking.	23.0	104.0
201607	3054	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B as written and am happy to accept the amendment on residential investment.	23.0	104.0
201607	3055	2016-07-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201607	3056	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3057	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201607	3058	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	3059	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In view of my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates remains appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3060	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ve made progress on both of our monetary policy goals, and various forecasts and optimal control exercises indicate that, to continue to make progress on our goals, it’s appropriate that we gradually increase the funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3061	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, we have met our maximum-employment goal.	23.0	999.0
201607	3062	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Employment growth is projected to be sufficient to lead to further reductions in the unemployment rate and other measures of underutilization of labor.	23.0	999.0
201607	3063	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Both anecdotal reports and data suggest wages are beginning to accelerate, although the pace of acceleration is likely to be relatively slow as long as productivity growth remains low.	23.0	999.0
201607	3064	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t want to underestimate the problems many people continue to have in the labor market.	23.0	999.0
201607	3065	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Technological advances and globalization are changing the nature of available jobs and the skill sets needed to perform those jobs.	23.0	999.0
201607	3066	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I do believe that government policies and programs and private–public partnerships should be brought to bear to help workers develop skills to reenter and stay in the workforce.	23.0	999.0
201607	3067	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I just don’t see how monetary policy is a means to do that, and it seems like a disservice to the very people it’s intended to help to suggest otherwise.	23.0	999.0
201607	3068	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Although inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, we’ve made progress.	23.0	999.0
201607	3069	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I expect inflation to move back gradually to our goal, consistent with my outlook that economic growth will continue to be at or slightly above trend, that the unemployment rate will fall below estimates of its longer-run trend, and that inflation expectations have been and will continue to be reasonably stable.	23.0	999.0
201607	3070	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, there will be some ups and downs along that path, depending on the trajectory of oil prices and the dollar.	23.0	999.0
201607	3071	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	But I think continued gradual progress is a reasonable forecast.	23.0	999.0
201607	3072	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I believe risks associated with the outlook have decreased since our June meeting in terms of both those attending the labor market and the reaction to the UK referendum, which have subsided.	23.0	999.0
201607	3073	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If financial stresses in the European banking system build up significantly in the future, then we can address the implications for the US economy at that time.	23.0	999.0
201607	3074	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think holding policy rates low in the United States can mitigate that sort of risk or reduce the probability that this type of event will occur.	23.0	999.0
201607	3075	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, by keeping rates lower for longer than appropriate, we could be exacerbating problems in the banking system by encouraging even greater search-for-yield behavior in light of lower net interest income.	23.0	999.0
201607	3076	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Putting all of this together, I believe there’s a strong case for raising the funds rate.	23.0	999.0
201607	3077	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	We are not “behind the curve” yet, but if we continue to wait for every piece of data to line up before we act, we will surely be “behind the curve.”	23.0	999.0
201607	3078	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And if we refrain from acting even though we are making progress toward both of our policy goals, we’re going to confuse the public and reduce our own credibility.	23.0	999.0
201607	3079	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I think we have the luxury of taking the next step and then taking time to assess conditions before moving again.	23.0	999.0
201607	3080	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with our anticipated gradual path.	23.0	999.0
201607	3081	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	It’s also consistent with our being data dependent in the right way.	23.0	999.0
201607	3082	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	By that, I mean it allows us to accumulate enough data so that we can better assess whether the medium-run outlook has changed, rather than being “jerked around” by every monthly data release.	23.0	999.0
201607	3083	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Assuming there’s no material change in the medium-run outlook between now and September, whether we raise rates today or do it in September is immaterial from an economic standpoint.	23.0	999.0
201607	3084	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In September we will have a new set of SEP numbers, the first estimate of second-quarter GDP, two more job reports, and opportunities for further communication so that an action isn’t as much of a surprise as one would be today.	23.0	999.0
201607	3085	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding today’s statement, in paragraph 1, I think the characterization of inflation should acknowledge that inflation has risen this year, and that we’ve made progress on our inflation goal.	23.0	999.0
201607	3086	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I prefer the inflation language in alternative C to that in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201607	3087	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I prefer the alternative language regarding residential investment that President Williams put on the table today.	23.0	999.0
201607	3088	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think there’s been a material change in our housing outlook since June.	23.0	999.0
201607	3089	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	If you wanted to leave in a reference to residential investment, I suggest using language closer to what we used in June and just simply say “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved.”	23.0	999.0
201607	3090	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 2, I believe it is very important that we indicate that near-term risks have diminished, as now proposed in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201607	3091	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	I read the rest of the statement as not giving any indication of what we will do in September.	23.0	999.0
201607	3092	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Regardless of market expectations, which may remain low because of our own communications, if the outlook for the economy is largely unchanged from what we see today, with employment growth continuing to be at or above the estimates needed to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate and the forecast that inflation returns to our goal over time still intact, I will expect us to increase the funds rate in September.	23.0	999.0
201607	3093	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201607	3094	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3095	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201607	3096	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201607	3097	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would want to get additional readings on the underlying momentum of the economy before making a call on whether it’s appropriate to adjust policy.	23.0	107.0
201607	3098	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In considering whether it will be appropriate to adjust policy in coming meetings, it will be important to assess the distance to our policy goals, the speed at which we’re approaching them, the balance of risks, and our ability to adjust course if the economy evolves differently than we anticipate.	23.0	107.0
201607	3099	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent pace of progress toward full employment appears to have downshifted materially, and there are few, if any, signs of strong wage pressures.	23.0	107.0
201607	3100	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As payroll gains have moderated, the unemployment rate has essentially moved sideways.	23.0	107.0
201607	3101	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there are some indications that the economy is approaching full employment, estimates of full employment are highly imprecise, and this has been exacerbated by the deep damage wrought by the Great Recession.	23.0	107.0
201607	3102	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, some indicators, such as the prime-age employment-to-population ratio and the number working part time for economic reasons, suggest there is still room to go.	23.0	107.0
201607	3103	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Importantly, both headline and core inflation remain notably below 2 percent, and core inflation has been below our target for 88 out of the past 92 months.	23.0	107.0
201607	3104	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	To the extent that inflation expectations show signs of becoming less well anchored, survey- and market-based measures suggest we should be concerned about unanchoring not to the upside but to the downside.	23.0	107.0
201607	3105	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we were to suggest through our policy actions that we are content that the current level of resource utilization is consistent with attainment of our dual mandate, our commitment to a symmetric inflation target around 2 percent could be called into doubt, and inflation expectations could suffer.	23.0	107.0
201607	3106	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While it seems likely that further improvement in economic momentum and resource utilization will likely be necessary in order to reach our policy goals, more data will help us assess just how much.	23.0	107.0
201607	3107	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In light of the recent slowing in economic momentum, with the economy likely still somewhat short of reaching our goals, the downward tilt of risks to real activity and inflation from abroad counsels a prudent approach.	23.0	107.0
201607	3108	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We should carefully weigh the risks of moving to tighten policy prematurely against the risks of moving too slowly.	23.0	107.0
201607	3109	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we take a patient approach and policy does not adjust as rapidly as it should and inflationary pressures build more quickly than we anticipate, we still have well- understood conventional tools and plenty of space to address this contingency.	23.0	107.0
201607	3110	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, upwardly anchored expectations and weakness in external demand, along with what I believe is a persistently lower neutral rate, will likely limit the steepness of that required policy response.	23.0	107.0
201607	3111	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, if we adjust policy in the hope that favorable data will subsequently materialize and they do not, the economy will become more vulnerable to adverse shocks, even fairly moderate ones.	23.0	107.0
201607	3112	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The space we have to address such a contingency using conventional tools is extremely limited, and the policy options using nonconventional tools are not without complications.	23.0	107.0
201607	3113	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, we could risk a prolonged period in which  inflation and, potentially, employment fall short of our goals.	23.0	107.0
201607	3114	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, I would need to see some combination of greater momentum in economic activity and progress on inflation before feeling confident that the economy would both warrant a tightening in policy and remain resilient to possible negative shocks from abroad that we discussed yesterday.	23.0	107.0
201607	3115	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For those reasons, it’s important that the statement does not provide a soft commitment to a policy adjustment in the near term, both to avoid muddying the waters on data dependence and to avoid any risk to our credibility if we seem to change course subsequently.	23.0	107.0
201607	3116	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll be receiving important data before our next meeting:  two employment reports, two reports on PCE inflation, the first report on Q2 GDP, revisions to price, compensation, and spending data in previous quarters, and important data on recent changes in labor compensation.	23.0	107.0
201607	3117	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll also get a better sense of the resilience of euro-area banks and insights about the shape of any possible response by Italy.	23.0	107.0
201607	3118	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These will provide valuable insights about how much momentum has slowed, whether it’s slowed, how quickly resource constraints are tightening, and how key risks are evolving.	23.0	107.0
201607	3119	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting data may indeed be consistent with a need for another step-up in the federal funds rate in coming months, or, of course, they may not.	23.0	107.0
201607	3120	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the uncertainty, there’s a reasonable probability that the incoming data would not be consistent with a policy adjustment in September.	23.0	107.0
201607	3121	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A soft lean in today’s statement would then be quite problematic insofar as it might constrain our decisions in September.	23.0	107.0
201607	3122	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It would be better to leave decisionmaking in September unconstrained.	23.0	107.0
201607	3123	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As Governor Powell suggested, if we see the data coming in stronger, the market itself is likely to begin to adjust its expectations, and there’ll be ample opportunity to communicate how the Committee is likely to react to those developments through the minutes and the Chair’s communications.	23.0	107.0
201607	3124	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, I do have a suggestion in response to President Williams’s suggestion.	23.0	107.0
201607	3125	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we do decide to follow his recommendation to delete the reference to residential investment being soft, it allows us to downgrade, I think, our description of business investment, which I would prefer to see described as weak, reflecting that it has indeed been one of the troubling spots in the economy for past quarters.	23.0	107.0
201607	3126	2016-07-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201607	3127	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3128	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201607	3129	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201607	3130	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201607	3131	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, when I think about paragraph 1, I think it is about us talking not about all of the things that are happening in the US economy, but talking about the things that are happening in the US economy that we think are important and that weigh on the outlook and then, subsequently, weigh on our actions.	23.0	96.0
201607	3132	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you use those criteria, it seems to me that the reference to residential investment doesn’t really fit.	23.0	96.0
201607	3133	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not really evaluating there was a lot of signal in the recent softness in residential investment because we think it’s erratic and because it’s following very strong residential investment in the first quarter.	23.0	96.0
201607	3134	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I very much support deleting that reference.	23.0	96.0
201607	3135	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But with respect to the sentence “Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May,”	23.0	96.0
201607	3136	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think those are important things that we want to stress, because we had quite a bit of anxiety about the weakness in employment in May and we took quite a bit of solace from the rebound in June.	23.0	96.0
201607	3137	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, by that metric, I think we should be highlighting that.	23.0	96.0
201607	3138	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with President Williams that we don’t want to highlight monthly data a lot in paragraph 1, but when it’s particularly important and when it really weighs on our evaluation of the economic data, I think it’s appropriate.	23.0	96.0
201607	3139	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There are two things I want to talk about more broadly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3140	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, why are expectations about US short-term rates so far below what we actually expect to do over the next year to 18 months?	23.0	96.0
201607	3141	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, is that a problem, and, if so, what should we do about it?	23.0	96.0
201607	3142	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the rate expectations out through 2018, I’m amazed at how flat the interest rate curve is.	23.0	96.0
201607	3143	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are a number of reasons to explain the shift, and that should affect our view of how we think about this.	23.0	96.0
201607	3144	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, people’s assessments of the neutral real short- term rate have declined because economic growth has persistently fallen short of expectations.	23.0	96.0
201607	3145	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the US economy, it’s averaged only a 2.1 percent annual growth rate over the past seven years, and, over the past year, it’s actually grown even weaker than that.	23.0	96.0
201607	3146	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think it’s been much harder to sustain the view that the neutral real short-term rate is close to or will soon be close to its historical level of around 2 percent.	23.0	96.0
201607	3147	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I’ve said for a long time, I think we need to reevaluate the efficacy of the Taylor-rule types of formulations.	23.0	96.0
201607	3148	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The estimates of the current neutral real short-term rate obtained from many of the DSGE models within the Federal Reserve System are quite interesting.	23.0	96.0
201607	3149	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Most of those estimates are clustered close to zero, and that seems to me a much more reasonable estimate of what the neutral short-term rate likely is at this time.	23.0	96.0
201607	3150	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If that’s right, it implies there’s only a small gap between the actual real short-term rate of about minus 1 percent and the neutral real short-term rate.	23.0	96.0
201607	3151	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So it implies that, while US monetary policy is accommodative, it’s only mildly so.	23.0	96.0
201607	3152	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that also has implications for how fast we actually have to move in terms of raising short- term interest rates.	23.0	96.0
201607	3153	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, as I discussed at the June meeting, I think many have come to the view that this idea that the headwinds from the crisis that are depressing the neutral short-term rate are going to dissipate in the near future may be becoming a less compelling story for the simple reason that if the headwinds haven’t dissipated to a meaningful degree after seven years, what’s going to happen in the next year or two that is going to, all of a sudden, necessarily cause them to diminish?	23.0	96.0
201607	3154	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that some of the headwinds, at least, are going to prove to be much more persistent.	23.0	96.0
201607	3155	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The one that I think is most noteworthy is the reduced availability of mortgage financing for those with lower credit scores.	23.0	96.0
201607	3156	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That seems to me likely to linger for a long time, because I think lenders now appreciate that home prices can decline significantly, and, thus, that they can’t rely on the value of the housing collateral to secure their mortgage loans to the extent they thought they could.	23.0	96.0
201607	3157	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So now the credit quality of the borrower really matters in terms of that mortgage lending decision.	23.0	96.0
201607	3158	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is something that’s just going to be with us for a very long time.	23.0	96.0
201607	3159	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	A second reason for the downward adjustment in US interest rate expectations is that US financial market conditions depend in part on the stance of our monetary policy relative to monetary policies abroad.	23.0	96.0
201607	3160	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So if the economic outlook abroad deteriorates, that causes foreign countries to pursue a more accommodative set of monetary policies, and that means we may also have to adjust our own monetary policy path.	23.0	96.0
201607	3161	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we don’t adjust our path, then the dollar would likely appreciate because of higher relative US interest rates, and this could result in an undesired tightening in US financial conditions.	23.0	96.0
201607	3162	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What we’ve seen is that the economic outlook abroad has been disappointing, so the forward rate paths in Europe and Japan have fallen considerably this year.	23.0	96.0
201607	3163	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we had actually stayed on our December 2015 SEP path, then the US dollar would have likely appreciated much more significantly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3164	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think some of what we’re seeing is, the US rate path is coming down in tandem with the foreign interest rate path, and, as a consequence of that, the dollar has appreciated only modestly.	23.0	96.0
201607	3165	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second question I wanted to talk about is whether this is a problem and, if so, what we should do about it.	23.0	96.0
201607	3166	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the answer depends in large part on whether one judges that the current set of financial conditions is too accommodative relative to what we need to achieve our objectives.	23.0	96.0
201607	3167	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we look at the various financial conditions indicators, financial conditions now appear to be a bit easier than they were before our December decision to increase our federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201607	3168	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the dollar is slightly stronger, this has been more than offset by lower long-term yields and higher equity prices.	23.0	96.0
201607	3169	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this easing in financial conditions would seem to argue for a rate hike, but, against this, the global outlook has deteriorated, and we haven’t really upgraded our own forecast of economic growth or inflation.	23.0	96.0
201607	3170	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in other words, one could also argue that it seems that we need a more accommodative set of financial conditions in order to best achieve our objectives.	23.0	96.0
201607	3171	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s really what the argument is about.	23.0	96.0
201607	3172	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it’s true that we need an easier set of financial market conditions, then we probably should be patient.	23.0	96.0
201607	3173	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s really the tension here.	23.0	96.0
201607	3174	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m really not sure which view is the right one.	23.0	96.0
201607	3175	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because I don’t know which view is the right one, I don’t want to foreshadow what we’re going to do in September until I can actually be a little bit more certain about that outcome.	23.0	96.0
201607	3176	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we do get closer to the September meeting and we think we do want to move but market expectations are not there, I do think there are plenty of opportunities to communicate in order to alter those expectations prior to that meeting.	23.0	96.0
201607	3177	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see the need to do more at this meeting than what alternative B does.	23.0	96.0
201607	3178	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The near-term risks to the outlook have diminished.	23.0	96.0
201607	3179	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it actually will push expectations about September upward.	23.0	96.0
201607	3180	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have no idea by how much.	23.0	96.0
201607	3181	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I would judge it’s probably a little rather than a lot, and one could argue that somewhat different language could have a bigger effect.	23.0	96.0
201607	3182	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think that, directionally, I’d be very surprised if expectations for September don’t move up a little bit with that language, because people are going to look at it and say, “Despite the Brexit vote, which is a negative, the Federal Reserve has decided that the near-term risks have diminished.”	23.0	96.0
201607	3183	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think they’re going to take it to some extent as saying that the employment news and the favorable market reaction following the Brexit vote trump the Brexit vote itself.	23.0	96.0
201607	3184	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, in terms of the language, as I said, I would favor deleting the “residential investment” language and making no other changes to the statement.	23.0	96.0
201607	3185	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201607	3186	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201607	3187	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201607	3188	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the smaller issues before commenting on the larger ones.	24.0	65.0
201607	3189	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we start with residential investment?	24.0	65.0
201607	3190	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard considerable support for changing the language there, and one possibility is simply to delete the language about residential investment and to say nothing.	24.0	65.0
201607	3191	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear President Mester suggest that another possibility would simply be to say “Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3192	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, frankly, I’m open to either possibility.	24.0	65.0
201607	3193	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose the simpler thing is just to delete all reference to it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3194	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would most of you be comfortable doing that—just deleting all reference to it?	24.0	65.0
201607	3195	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there was a pretty strong consensus on that side.	24.0	96.0
201607	3196	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	To just delete it completely?	24.0	65.0
201607	3197	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Among the people who spoke, yes.	24.0	96.0
201607	3198	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3199	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I suggest we delete it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3200	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The sentence would read “Household spending has been growing strongly, but business fixed investment has been soft.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3201	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	The second suggestion of President Williams concerned the sentence “Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3202	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear a little bit of support for President Williams’s proposal to delete that as well as some counterarguments.	24.0	65.0
201607	3203	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll say that, for my own part, normally I don’t like to focus on a lot of up-and-down in the data and prefer instead to focus on longer-term trends, which are highlighted in the sentence that follows that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3204	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I agree with the Vice Chairman that, on this particular occasion, we strongly emphasized our concern about the May reading.	24.0	65.0
201607	3205	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And to say that weak reading was completely reversed, essentially, in June is giving a clear sense that we’re now discounting that and taking a stronger view.	24.0	65.0
201607	3206	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	On this occasion, I think it’s important, but if I hear a groundswell of sentiment for getting rid of it, I’m open to it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3207	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	24.0	65.0
201607	3208	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The reason I agreed is, my fear is that we know that each of these monthly data series is subject to revision, and sometimes it’s a large revision.	24.0	110.0
201607	3209	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we go forward, as we have volatility in monthly numbers, I don’t want the public to think our reaction function is to overreact or underreact to any month.	24.0	110.0
201607	3210	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do think the sentence that follows does the trick by focusing more on smoothing.	24.0	110.0
201607	3211	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m more worried about the public understanding our reaction function, and, to me, citing individual months gives them a somewhat misleading picture of our reaction function.	24.0	110.0
201607	3212	2016-07-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s the reason I was in favor of deleting it.	24.0	110.0
201607	3213	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess, in general, I agree with that, and typically we do not cite “This thing went up last month, and it fell.”	24.0	65.0
201607	3214	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	When such things happen—and I guess residential investment is arguably a case in point—we don’t talk about it, or we talk about longer-term trends.	24.0	65.0
201607	3215	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I think this is an unusual situation, but, to my mind, it’s one in which we focused so much attention on our concern about the May employment report that it is a slightly different situation.	24.0	65.0
201607	3216	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	24.0	65.0
201607	3217	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	94.0
201607	3218	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think President Kaplan brings up a good point about revisions.	24.0	94.0
201607	3219	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	This could be changed in the future.	24.0	94.0
201607	3220	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	And I also think it’s unnecessary.	24.0	94.0
201607	3221	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	The next sentence says “On balance, payrolls ...	24.0	94.0
201607	3222	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think it helps us, I don’t think it does anything for us, and the “On balance” sentence takes care of it.	24.0	94.0
201607	3223	2016-07-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I would agree with President Williams on this.	24.0	94.0
201607	3224	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	24.0	65.0
201607	3225	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	You know I’ve argued that we should take a longer-term view.	24.0	999.0
201607	3226	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	My fear is that if we don’t put this in, we’re not taking a stand that 287,000 jobs per month is strong job growth.	24.0	999.0
201607	3227	2016-07-27	meeting	MESTER	And I worry that if we take that out, people are going to think that an increase of 287,000 in jobs is kind of what we’re expecting each time.	24.0	999.0
201607	3228	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would make the statement softer—	24.0	96.0
201607	3229	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	To take it out.	24.0	90.0
201607	3230	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	—to take it out, frankly.	24.0	96.0
201607	3231	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because by highlighting the job gains, what you’re doing is saying that you’re taking quite a bit of signal from it, which I think we are.	24.0	96.0
201607	3232	2016-07-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I agree with that.	24.0	90.0
201607	3233	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Absolutely.	24.0	65.0
201607	3234	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree.	24.0	65.0
201607	3235	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	24.0	65.0
201607	3236	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	One possibility, without naming months, is just to delete that sentence, get rid of “On balance,” and say “Job gains, payrolls, and other labor market indicators,” et cetera.	24.0	999.0
201607	3237	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	So it’s recognizing the job gains without actually explicitly naming the month.	24.0	999.0
201607	3238	2016-07-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re already saying that by the word “payrolls,” though, aren’t we, President Harker?	24.0	96.0
201607	3239	2016-07-27	meeting	HARKER	I worry about naming the months, especially when you consider revisions.	24.0	999.0
201607	3240	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we should worry about naming this month.	24.0	108.0
201607	3241	2016-07-27	meeting	FISCHER	We had a deviation of about three standard deviations from what was expected, and everybody noticed it, and we used it as a reason why we weren’t raising rates—I don’t know quite how we phrased it—so I think we should at least mention it.	24.0	108.0
201607	3242	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	It was an important factor in our changing view, and this is communicating that we’re now discounting what we said about our concerns at the June meeting.	24.0	65.0
201607	3243	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3244	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I realize there are people on both sides of this.	24.0	65.0
201607	3245	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	My suggestion is that we leave that as is, and let me turn to the larger issue of September.	24.0	65.0
201607	3246	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly heard many of you around the table express the view that there is a strong case, in view of how the economy has behaved, for moving rates gradually up over time; that September certainly should be on the table as an option; and that you would want to see nothing in the statement or in our communications over the next couple of months that would in any way tie our hands in September if we interpret that the data are appropriate to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3247	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Even among those of you who are more reluctant and skeptical that a move in September will be appropriate and that the data will support it, I’ve also heard an openness on your part to looking at the incoming data and evaluating whether a move in September is appropriate, and I completely share that view.	24.0	65.0
201607	3248	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I can easily imagine a data flow—President Lockhart set out some examples—that would leave me feeling that we should move in September.	24.0	65.0
201607	3249	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I absolutely agree that it should be an open option.	24.0	65.0
201607	3250	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We should do nothing to take September off the table.	24.0	65.0
201607	3251	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And as time passes and the data flow comes in, if our sense is that September is appropriate, then our communication should help markets to understand our evolving views.	24.0	65.0
201607	3252	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, frankly, my interpretation of what’s in alternative B—I think both the changes in paragraph 1 and the new red sentence in paragraph 2 do indicate that September is on the table, and that it will be interpreted that way.	24.0	65.0
201607	3253	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not perfect, either, at predicting market reaction to our statements, but it is my sense that, for example, no changes at all are really expected in paragraph 2 by most observers.	24.0	65.0
201607	3254	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And for us to say that near-term risks have diminished, I think, will be noticed and taken as a signal not of any commitment to move, but as a sense that we’re more comfortable with the data flow.	24.0	65.0
201607	3255	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you mentioned my speech at the Jackson Hole symposium.	24.0	65.0
201607	3256	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I have a good opportunity there to comment on the incoming data flow.	24.0	65.0
201607	3257	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	If we’re feeling that September looks like the time we should move, first of all, I think the data flow will move markets.	24.0	65.0
201607	3258	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve seen that in the past.	24.0	65.0
201607	3259	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have commented on it.	24.0	65.0
201607	3260	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would expect that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3261	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I promise that at Jackson Hole, if that looks appropriate, I will say something that will confirm that sentiment or move it along.	24.0	65.0
201607	3262	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I am very worried—a number of you have commented on this—that we have in the past signaled we’re just on the verge of moving, and then something happens and we don’t move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3263	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do not regret our decisions in various meetings not to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3264	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there were good reasons not to move.	24.0	65.0
201607	3265	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But constantly suggesting we’re on the verge of moving and then not doing so is harming our credibility.	24.0	65.0
201607	3266	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would prefer to be more in a wait-and-see posture, in which every meeting, particularly September, is “live,” and we will make our decision on the basis of the data flow and not go too far.	24.0	65.0
201607	3267	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the language that’s in alternative C, I think, is true.	24.0	65.0
201607	3268	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	You know, the case in favor of raising the funds rate I believe has increased.	24.0	65.0
201607	3269	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I wouldn’t take any issue with the truthfulness of that statement, but it would be taken as an extremely strong signal, and, to my mind, it’s not appropriate at this point.	24.0	65.0
201607	3270	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve heard a lot of sentiment in the direction of alternative C, but I also have heard a large number of people who feel pretty strongly that alternative B is far enough for today, so I would propose that we stick with the language in alternative B.	24.0	65.0
201607	3271	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say just one other thing before we call for a vote, and that is that both today and at our June meeting I heard a number of you say that our statement and communications aren’t as effective as they ought to be.	24.0	65.0
201607	3272	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, over the past year, the pace of tightening has been noticeably slower than we anticipated in December when we first raised rates.	24.0	65.0
201607	3273	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s led to the cynical conclusion in some quarters that we’re always looking for an excuse, and we’ll always find an excuse, not to raise rates.	24.0	65.0
201607	3274	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m wondering, in light of that, whether it’s helpful to keep emphasizing in our statement that the funds rate is likely to rise gradually over the next two or three years.	24.0	65.0
201607	3275	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I think we do need to think hard about our forward guidance and whether we could change the language so that it provides a somewhat better sense of what our actual reaction function is and what it means when we say that our actions are data dependent.	24.0	65.0
201607	3276	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think that in coming meetings, this is something that we need to consider and discuss, and I will try to structure some conversation on that.	24.0	65.0
201607	3277	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	But for today, I would like to propose that we vote on alternative B as written, with the one change pertaining to residential investment that we discussed.	24.0	65.0
201607	3278	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201607	3279	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the statement associated with alternative B, as on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, with the change to the fourth sentence that the Chair indicated.	24.0	999.0
201607	3280	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will also cover the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on page 10 of Thomas’s package.	24.0	999.0
201607	3281	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Bullard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President George   No President Mester   Yes Governor Powell   Yes President Rosengren  Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes .	24.0	999.0
201607	3282	2016-07-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201607	3283	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201607	3284	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody, for a good meeting.	53.0	65.0
201607	3285	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, September 20 and 21.	53.0	65.0
201607	3286	2016-07-27	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who will be around, there will be a buffet lunch starting at 11:00.	53.0	65.0
