201503	0	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	5	5
201503	1	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, we had a farewell luncheon for President Plosser at the January meeting.	5	5
201503	2	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And in a couple of hours, we will also have a chance to say farewell to President Fisher at a luncheon.	5	5
201503	3	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In light of those departures, I would like to welcome Helen Holcomb back to the table.	5	5
201503	4	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	She represented the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas here before President Fisher took office and will be representing the Dallas Bank again today.	5	5
201503	5	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I would also like to welcome Blake Prichard to the table, representing the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.	5	5
201503	6	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	He is serving as acting president of the Philadelphia Bank until Patrick Harker takes office on July 1.	5	5
201503	7	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Before we begin today’s agenda, I want to briefly update you about developments that relate to press briefings.	5	5
201503	8	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	At recent meetings, we have discussed the fact that it is important for the Committee not to feel constrained from taking action whenever we deem appropriate, at any meeting, regardless of whether there is a postmeeting press conference scheduled.	97	9
201503	9	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And a number of you have suggested to me that I schedule press conferences after every meeting.	97	9
201503	10	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Now, a decision to have press conferences at every meeting is likely to be irreversible.	97	9
201503	11	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	It is something I have, therefore, carefully considered.	97	9
201503	12	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	For now, at least, I think my decision is that it would be best not to schedule press conferences after every meeting.	97	9
201503	13	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say that, by way of explanation, the time that is required for me and all of our senior staff to prepare for these press conferences is truly nontrivial.	97	9
201503	14	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In part, that is because preparations involve being up-to-date not only on matters pertaining to monetary policy and the economy, but also on all matters pertaining to Federal Reserve-related issues.	97	9
201503	15	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And all of that preparation occurs at exactly the same time when all of us are preparing for these meetings.	97	9
201503	16	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As I reflect on it—and, again, this is just a decision for now, so I am not saying this can’t be revisited—it seems to me that when we are in a more normal mode for conducting monetary policy, and I hope that time is not too far off, and the economic environment is more normal, every-meeting press conferences, especially after meetings for which there are no forecast updates, are really not likely to have much focus on monetary policy decisions and the economy.	97	9
201503	17	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	What I believe will happen is they will become opportunities for the media to explore a host of nonmonetary policy issues, which ultimately could be a distraction rather than a help to us.	97	9
201503	18	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That would all occur on meeting days.	97	9
201503	19	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But, at the same time, though I am not inclined now to go to press conferences every meeting, I do think it is important for us to feel—and also to convince the public and market participants—that we are not constrained from taking decisions at meetings for which there is not a subsequent press conference, so that market expectations of our future actions can be appropriately responsive to incoming data.	97	9
201503	20	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As I have mentioned in the past, we have long had the capability to conduct press briefings by telephone on very short notice.	97	9
201503	21	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Chairman Bernanke did so a number of times during the financial crisis.	97	9
201503	22	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So the plan I would like to propose is that we remind the public, the markets, and the press that we have that capability and would indeed use it when necessary.	97	9
201503	23	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And, to firm up that expectation, late on the second day of our meeting in April, the Board’s Public Affairs office plans to conduct a test of our system for media conference calls.	97	9
201503	24	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We will permit news organizations to report afterward that we conducted this test, and we will state that the reason for the test is to refresh news organizations’ familiarity with how the system works, so that we can use it, if necessary, on meeting days when no press conference is scheduled.	97	9
201503	25	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That is currently the plan, and I welcome any input that any of you would like to offer on it.	97	9
201503	26	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But that is what we thought, for the moment.	97	9
201503	27	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s now turn to the agenda.	2	2
201503	28	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The first two items will be considered in a joint meeting with the Board of Governors, so we need a Board vote to close that meeting.	2	2
201503	29	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	2	2
201503	30	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	So moved, Madam Chair.	2	2
201503	31	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	2	2
201503	32	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	2	2
201503	33	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I am going to call on Simon Potter to begin the Desk report.	61	6
201503	34	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201503	35	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We will be splitting the Desk briefing in two parts.	61	6
201503	36	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I will talk about financial market developments, then Lorie will talk about Desk operations.	61	6
201503	37	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the backdrop of monetary policy easing overseas, relative stability in oil prices, and some positive global economic data reportedly contributed to a reduction in perceived downside global growth risks.	61	6
201503	38	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated forward interest rates among major developed economies diverged over the period, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61	6
201503	39	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The trend of declining longer-run nominal interest rates since the start of 2014 partially retraced itself in the United States and United Kingdom, as some incoming economic data, most notably employment reports, reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve and Bank of England will begin normalizing policy within the next year.	61	6
201503	40	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows a summation of daily changes in US yields over the period, bucketed into a few categories based on market commentary.	61	6
201503	41	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Increases in both short- and longer-dated yields occurred on days with stronger-than-expected US employment reports and higher-than-expected inflation data, among other factors.	61	6
201503	42	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	These influences in combination more than offset the declines in rates that followed the start of ECB purchases and Federal Reserve communications including the January statement, minutes, and the Chair’s testimony before the Congress.	61	6
201503	43	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	These Federal Reserve communications were generally interpreted as slightly more accommodative than expected due to discussion of the balance of risks around the start of normalization and the outlook for persistently low inflation.	61	6
201503	44	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	However, not all market participants interpreted Federal Reserve commentary as more accommodative than expected.	61	6
201503	45	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants expect policy normalization to begin in the second or third quarter of 2015.	61	6
201503	46	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This is shown in the middle-left panel, which indicates that the average probability assigned to liftoff occurring in June or September increased modestly from the January surveys.	61	6
201503	47	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This panel also shows that the distribution of individual beliefs about liftoff timing is dispersed, consistent with some of the differing interpretations of Federal Reserve communications over the intermeeting period to which I just alluded.	61	6
201503	48	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Desk and private surveys also indicate that the vast majority of respondents anticipate the Committee will drop the “patient” language from the statement at this meeting, and the Desk surveys suggest this would result in only a small increase in the average probability assigned to a June liftoff.	61	6
201503	49	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Desk survey respondents expect liftoff to occur against a backdrop of very subdued realized inflation.	61	6
201503	50	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The median response for the mostly likely level of 12-month headline PCE inflation at liftoff declined to 0.4 percent in the March survey, as shown in the first column of the middle-right panel.	61	6
201503	51	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	For 12-month core PCE inflation at liftoff, the median response was 1.4 percent, with an interquartile range of 1.3 to 1.5 percent.	61	6
201503	52	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Although the median point forecast for PCE inflation 1 to 2 years after liftoff remains 2 percent, shown in the second column, the odds that both dealers and buy-side respondents assign to inflation over that horizon remaining below 1.75 percent has increased substantially over recent months.	61	6
201503	53	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This is shown in the final two columns.	61	6
201503	54	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The Board’s measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation moved up slightly, on net, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201503	55	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	However, this measure remains far below its average level since 2003.	61	6
201503	56	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Currently, US forward inflation compensation appears to be surprisingly linked to changes in the price of oil, as can be seen by comparing the trajectories in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201503	57	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The US dollar continued to broadly appreciate against both major and emerging market currencies over the intermeeting period, with the DXY dollar index higher by 6.5 percent and at its strongest level since 2002.	61	6
201503	58	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Contributing to this move was a 7.5 percent weakening of the euro versus the US dollar, shown in the bottom-right panel, which came alongside a 27 basis point widening of the US–German 2-year yield spread over the period.	61	6
201503	59	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Since the announcement of the public sector asset purchase program at the January ECB meeting, European equities have increased by about 12 percent, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61	6
201503	60	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, the S&P 500 is little changed, on net, over the same period.	61	6
201503	61	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Euro-area corporate credit spreads have also tightened since January, and there has been a substantial narrowing of peripheral sovereign spreads to Germany.	61	6
201503	62	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The announcement of ECB sovereign debt purchases reportedly contributed to stable peripheral sovereign spreads amid Greek financial assistance negotiations.	61	6
201503	63	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Steve Kamin will discuss the Greek situation in his briefing.	61	6
201503	64	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The ECB announced at its recent meeting that purchases would be restricted to bonds with yields above the deposit facility rate, which currently stands at negative 20 basis points.	61	6
201503	65	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This constraint currently renders 2- and 3-year bunds ineligible and will force the Bundesbank to extend the duration of its purchases unless rates on these securities increase above the deposit facility rate.	61	6
201503	66	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Following the commencement of purchases last Monday, the German yield curve flattened substantially, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201503	67	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	German yields are now negative out to 7 years, the 10-year German-US interest rate differential is at its widest level in at least 25 years, and the German 30-year yield trades at similar levels to that of a US 2-year note.	61	6
201503	68	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The negative interest rate environment in Europe has become more pervasive and pronounced, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201503	69	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the Danish National Bank cut its deposit rate to negative 75 basis points to defend its euro currency peg, while the Riksbank moved its main policy rate to negative 10 basis points and initiated a small asset purchase program.	61	6
201503	70	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	There has been some pass-through by banks of negative rates to large corporate depositors but less pass- through to retail-level customers.	61	6
201503	71	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Contacts have not reported major shifts in market structure, investor behavior, or market functioning due to negative rates.	61	6
201503	72	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	It is possible that more sovereign assets in the euro area will trade at negative yields as the ECB asset purchase program continues.	61	6
201503	73	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The ECB’s constraint that purchases must be of assets with yields above negative 20 basis points might interact with additional constraints related to the capital key, issue, and issuer share to skew purchases further out on the yield curve, placing additional substantial downward pressure on yields.	61	6
201503	74	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This feedback loop might be amplified if, as many market participants believe, holders of longer-dated debt are somewhat price-insensitive because of investment mandates or regulations.	61	6
201503	75	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Thus, some have noted concerns about the potential for a notable deterioration in euro-area sovereign market functioning.	61	6
201503	76	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Large-scale asset purchases are having a pronounced effect on the JGB market.	61	6
201503	77	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, yields and measures of implied volatility rose sharply in mid-January.	61	6
201503	78	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The catalyst for this is unclear, although the moves disturbed fragile Japanese rates market dynamics that are dominated by BOJ purchase operations, leading to some paring back of dealer marketmaking activity and several poorly received JGB auctions.	61	6
201503	79	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Despite their adverse effect on JGB market functioning, large-scale asset purchases in Japan still appear to be having substantial effects on risk assets and the exchange rate as portfolio rebalancing continues.	61	6
201503	80	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Volatility and market functioning have also been in focus in FX markets, particularly amid rapid dollar appreciation.	61	6
201503	81	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Some are concerned that the next sharp currency move may be in China.	61	6
201503	82	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The official dollar-RMB central parity rate has slowly moved higher over recent months, and the onshore dollar-RMB rate has traded toward the top of its trading band, shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201503	83	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, implied volatility in a number of markets has increased, and there have been some pronounced spikes in volatility.	61	6
201503	84	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	As was detailed in the October 15 memo recently sent to the Committee, the nature of Treasury market liquidity has changed over recent years, reflecting an increased role of algorithmic and high-frequency trading activity and decreased shock-absorbing capacity of dealers.	61	6
201503	85	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants have noted that recent spikes in volatility, particularly the intensity of intraday moves, will produce changes in risk management that could further limit capital deployed to marketmaking in volatile markets.	61	6
201503	86	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	These changes in structure are common across a range of markets and might lead to more frequent sharp price moves.	61	6
201503	87	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	While market participants often point out these risks, they also acknowledge that US financial firms are stronger and the financial system is better positioned to handle such bursts of volatility than prior to the financial crisis, consistent with the conclusions from recent QS reports.	61	6
201503	88	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	That completes my report.	61	6
201503	89	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61	6
201503	90	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	62	6
201503	91	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201503	92	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	62	6
201503	93	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, it is more of a comment than a question.	62	6
201503	94	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On figure 5, it is true that the inflation compensation and oil prices have moved surprisingly together.	62	6
201503	95	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think it is also worth noting that, at least to my eyes, the timing of the turndown in inflation compensation is not aligned precisely, as far as I can tell.	62	6
201503	96	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	In the past week, that is true.	62	6
201503	97	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The TIPS breakeven inflation went down the first two days of the week.	62	6
201503	98	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Most of the action in oil prices was toward the end of the week, when there was an announcement of record production in the United States in February.	62	6
201503	99	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201503	100	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201503	101	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In table 4, exhibit 1, you have expectations for inflation at liftoff, and it looks like more people in the markets are thinking that we will lift off when the two-year-ahead inflation outlook is under 1¾ percent.	62	6
201503	102	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	It is a little out of order, but I was looking at the SEP tables, and I noticed that there is an appendix to table 2 that shows our responses on the timing of our liftoff and the economic conditions in the quarter that we do that.	62	6
201503	103	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	And I was a little surprised by the very low core PCE inflation numbers that everybody has in there.	62	6
201503	104	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I see 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 percent.	62	6
201503	105	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Simon, do you think that the market participants would find this piece of information to be particularly noteworthy when contrasted with what they have priced in, or how they are thinking about it?	62	6
201503	106	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee released details on what individual participants thought economic conditions will be at liftoff, it would be noteworthy for a number of reasons.	62	6
201503	107	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	62	6
201503	108	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In terms of the informational content.	62	6
201503	109	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I do think that the core inflation numbers you quoted to me sounded like they were a little bit below the lower quartile of 1.3 percent that we got from our responses.	62	6
201503	110	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	So I would imagine that, as the inflation data came along, the information would have some effect on expectations of the timing of liftoff.	62	6
201503	111	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	If you did not see firmer core inflation data but saw data that is about the same as what we are currently receiving, people might view that as suggesting that liftoff would still be quite likely.	62	6
201503	112	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Another question I had in looking at your table is whether there is any way for you to get additional information on what the survey respondents are probably thinking about our attitudes toward hitting our inflation objective of 2 percent?	62	6
201503	113	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Market participants freely give you a lot of viewpoints on how the Federal Reserve is doing.	62	6
201503	114	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	And some of them do express some skepticism about the 2 percent inflation goal, if that answers your question.	62	6
201503	115	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Well, I guess I am wondering about the combination of these two pieces of information.	62	6
201503	116	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	When we just ask them for the point estimate, for most of the responses, the median response is 2 percent.	62	6
201503	117	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	You see a difference between the sell side, the dealers, who are firmer in that belief than the buy side.	62	6
201503	118	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	A lot of what you have seen over the past few months is people on the buy side who are skeptical about how the 2 percent inflation goal might affect liftoff.	62	6
201503	119	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	And you saw that reflected last time in the responses from the buy side to the distribution question.	62	6
201503	120	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The dealers did catch up with it this time.	62	6
201503	121	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I was actually surprised with the data, as I thought those probabilities were most likely to have gone down, in response to the inflation data we saw over the intermeeting period.	62	6
201503	122	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201503	123	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Simon?	62	6
201503	124	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201503	125	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201503	126	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to turn to Lorie to continue the briefing.	61	6
201503	127	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll discuss testing of tools for normalizing policy and some longer-term changes in money markets and conclude with options for a resolution for quarter-end term RRP testing.	61	6
201503	128	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Before turning to testing, I want to note our current projections for MBS reinvestments, shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit.	61	6
201503	129	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	We estimate that MBS reinvestments in 2015 will total about $330 billion, roughly $70 billion lower than our estimate at the January meeting due to the increase in Treasury yields but still notably higher than anticipated in December.	61	6
201503	130	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Reinvestment purchase operations continue to go smoothly, and MBS liquidity remains stable.	61	6
201503	131	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Over the period, the Federal Reserve executed three overlapping 21-day TDF operations at 28 basis points with same-day settlement and a $20 billion counterparty cap at each operation.	61	6
201503	132	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the total amount of term deposits reached $404 billion, roughly the same size as the largest operation in the prior testing series, conducted at a slightly higher rate of 30 basis points.	61	6
201503	133	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The two largest participants accounted for $170 billion.	61	6
201503	134	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	One of these firms, which participated under two separate legal entities and placed a total of $110 billion, indicated that it would have committed roughly $40 billion more if participation was not capped.	61	6
201503	135	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The other firm suggested it did not have additional demand for TDFs.	61	6
201503	136	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As expected, the operations did not appear to put upward pressure on short-term rates, and counterparties suggested that, in the current environment, reserve draining from term tools would need to be much larger to directly affect market rates.	61	6
201503	137	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As outlined in communications in advance of the meeting, the staff has been making progress on a revision to the methodology for the payment of interest on reserves that should help tighten the linkage between the level of the IOER rate on any given day and the level of the effective federal funds rate on that day.	61	6
201503	138	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Programming efforts are proceeding, and the staff expects to publish a Federal Register notice describing the proposed changes soon after this meeting.	61	6
201503	139	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The staff also continues to conduct RRP test operations.	61	6
201503	140	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Average total daily take- up in Federal Reserve RRP operations over the intermeeting period, shown in the middle-left panel, was about $125 billion, similar to recent months.	61	6
201503	141	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	With the exception of some small-value test trades, the ON RRP operations during the period did not include the most recent wave of expanded RRP counterparties, which began trading yesterday.	61	6
201503	142	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	In that operation, the new counterparties represented less than $4 billion of the $112 billion allotted.	61	6
201503	143	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle-right panel, the Desk conducted four one-week term operations from mid-February through early March.	61	6
201503	144	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The amount of bids submitted in each operation was relatively stable, ranging between about $70 billion and $90 billion, and each operation stopped out at 6 basis points.	61	6
201503	145	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The staff estimates that the majority of demand for term RRPs represented either substitution from the ON RRP—the light blue bars in the bottom-left panel—or rollover of funds allocated to previous term RRP operations, the dark blue bars.	61	6
201503	146	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Only about 15 percent of take-up appears to be new funds.	61	6
201503	147	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Given that the stop-out rate for the term operations was just 1 basis point higher than the ON RRP rate, it appears that the additional return required to move $50 billion from overnight into term RRPs for one week was relatively small.	61	6
201503	148	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Consistent with the idea that take-up at term operations primarily represented substitution from ON RRP operations, market participants did not attribute movements in market rates to these term test operations.	61	6
201503	149	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Overall, however, the ON RRP continued to provide a soft floor on money market rates.	61	6
201503	150	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the light blue line in the bottom-right panel, with the exception of some increased volatility around month-end dates, the effective federal funds rate remained near the levels observed since mid-December, when the Desk concluded the testing series that involved changes in the ON RRP rate.	61	6
201503	151	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	However, secured rates were somewhat soft over parts of the intermeeting period, with some segments of the repo market at times trading below the ON RRP rate.	61	6
201503	152	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	For example, as shown in the dark blue line in the bottom-right panel, after removing GCF repo transactions—which are a subset of triparty repo that primarily serve as an interdealer market—the volume-weighted average rate of remaining triparty trades briefly dipped below the ON RRP rate.	61	6
201503	153	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants attributed the broader dynamics in secured rates, in part, to shifts in GSE cash management needs and decreases in Treasury bill supply associated with the Treasury’s shift in short-term financing needs around the April tax date, as well as month-end pressures.	61	6
201503	154	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to your final exhibit, I wanted to highlight some longer-term developments in money markets.	61	6
201503	155	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	These developments, which market participants indicate partly reflect dealers’ more conservative risk management practices since the crisis as well as ongoing regulatory changes, may affect the constellation of money market rates and the tools for monetary policy implementation.	61	6
201503	156	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	For example, some dealers with large, stable repo funding bases have demanded increased compensation to intermediate between money funds or other lenders in the triparty repo market and the smaller or less creditworthy dealers that seek to borrow funds in the GCF market.	61	6
201503	157	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	This can be seen in the widening spread between the volume-weighted average rates in the GCF market and the broader triparty market, excluding GCF, shown in the top-left panel.	61	6
201503	158	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	There is also some indication that dealers are somewhat less willing to employ their balance sheets for other types of relatively low-margin intermediation activities.	61	6
201503	159	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, dealers have decreased the total size of their overnight repo books.	61	6
201503	160	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Meanwhile, the stock of Treasury bills, a close substitute to repos, shown in the light blue line, has also declined because of a combination of an improved fiscal outlook and an effort to increase the weighted-average maturity of Treasury debt outstanding.	61	6
201503	161	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Combined, these shifts have decreased opportunities for money market funds to invest cash in high-quality instruments.	61	6
201503	162	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	At the same time, regulatory changes are increasing the demand for high-quality money market instruments.	61	6
201503	163	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, Fidelity announced that it would convert three of its prime money market funds, including one of the largest prime retail funds in assets under management, into government funds in response to the 2014 SEC reforms.	61	6
201503	164	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Combined, these three funds have about $130 billion in assets under management.	61	6
201503	165	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, J.P.	61	6
201503	166	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Morgan announced its intention to reduce certain non-operating wholesale deposits by up to $100 billion, either by introducing fees on certain institutional clients’ deposits or by asking clients to move deposits into other products, such as money funds.	61	6
201503	167	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants anticipate that other firms are likely to take similar actions as J.P.	61	6
201503	168	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Morgan and Fidelity, further increasing demand for high-quality money market instruments.	61	6
201503	169	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	These changes reflect, at least in part, actions that firms are taking to align their business models with upcoming regulatory changes intended to increase the safety of money market funds and decrease banks’ and broker-dealers’ reliance on short-term funding.	61	6
201503	170	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	These are, of course, important steps to improve the resiliency of the financial system.	61	6
201503	171	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	They may, however, increase segmentation in money markets and, given the high level of reserves in the system, put some downward pressure on some money market rates.	61	6
201503	172	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	This could in turn increase demand for Fed RRPs or similar instruments during policy normalization.	61	6
201503	173	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	For example, many of the non-operating deposits that J.P.	61	6
201503	174	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Morgan announced it will try to reduce are likely held by foreign official accounts.	61	6
201503	175	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet increased, we have seen and allowed foreign central banks to place additional funds in the foreign RP pool, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201503	176	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As you may recall, this is a service offered to foreign central banks and international organizations in which funds in their accounts at the end of the day are used for a repo transaction, with SOMA securities as collateral.	61	6
201503	177	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Recently we have experienced increased demand for storing liquidity by investing cash in the foreign RP pool.	61	6
201503	178	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	One large customer indicated a desire to increase their dollar reserves liquidity to prepare for possible instability as the FOMC raises rates.	61	6
201503	179	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the announcements emphasizing a shifting landscape in money markets and the discussion of the possibility of an elevated ON RRP cap at liftoff in the January minutes, market participants have not materially increased their expectations for the size of the ON RRP facility during or after liftoff.	61	6
201503	180	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the middle- right panel, the median respondent to the most recent Desk surveys expects that usage of ON RRP at liftoff will be $300 billion and will decline to $250 billion three years after liftoff, broadly similar to expectations in recent surveys.	61	6
201503	181	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The range between the 10th percentile and 90th percentile of respondents’ views, shown in the red bars in the bottom-left panel, is also largely unchanged from the January survey.	61	6
201503	182	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The distribution of views remains skewed toward higher usage.	61	6
201503	183	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to expectations for total RRP usage over the March quarter-end, market participants broadly expect that the combined capacity of $500 billion—inclusive of both term and overnight operations—will be sufficient to support a soft floor on money market rates above the ON RRP rate leading into and on March 31.	61	6
201503	184	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The first of two planned term RRP operations covering the March quarter-end will be held Thursday.	61	6
201503	185	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Lastly, the Committee may wish to consider authorizing term tests over future quarter-ends.	61	6
201503	186	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee envisions using term RRPs as part of a strategy to limit the size of the ON RRP facility at liftoff or potentially at some other point during normalization, continued testing may be useful, particularly for operational readiness.	61	6
201503	187	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Even if the Committee plans to provide elevated capacity in the ON RRP facility—one that allows sufficient headroom, even at quarter-end—putting the term RRP test operations in place may also be helpful, particularly if liftoff occurs around a quarter-end date.	61	6
201503	188	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	This is because, in the absence of public information about the Committee’s intentions and implementation, there is potential for money market rates to trade soft to the federal funds target range leading up to the quarter-end.	61	6
201503	189	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	For these reasons, the staff has outlined two options for authorizing such testing if the Committee chooses to do so.	61	6
201503	190	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed in a memo distributed prior to the meeting and outlined in the bottom-right panel, the first option is for the FOMC to approve a resolution that authorizes term RRP test operations for the June, September, and December 2015 quarter-ends.	61	6
201503	191	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	This option is substantially similar to the resolution adopted for the 2014 year-end term RRP tests and authorizes, but does not obligate, the Federal Reserve to conduct those operations.	61	6
201503	192	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	A resolution of this kind would more closely align the authorization for term RRP testing with that governing testing of ON RRP operations and might reduce the probability that market participants mistakenly interpret future decisions about testing term RRPs over quarter-end as containing information about the likelihood of liftoff.	61	6
201503	193	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Alternatively, the Committee could continue its current practice of authorizing term RRP test operations each quarter, each time using a resolution approved at an FOMC meeting well ahead of quarter-end.	61	6
201503	194	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Draft resolutions regarding both approaches are provided in a separate handout in the event that the Committee decides to proceed with authorizing further quarter-end term tests.	61	6
201503	195	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201503	196	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201503	197	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201503	198	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	62	6
201503	199	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201503	200	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I just have a comment.	62	6
201503	201	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I have argued against testing term RRPs.	62	6
201503	202	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I was outvoted at the previous meeting, and we are testing at the end of March.	62	6
201503	203	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It is not the end of March.	62	6
201503	204	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We haven’t done those tests.	62	6
201503	205	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, tests are designed to provide information to be useful in future decisions.	62	6
201503	206	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I am wondering why we are deciding this now rather than waiting until after the March meeting.	62	6
201503	207	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We would have as much lead time until the June quarter-end as we provided when we decided in January to test at the end of March.	62	6
201503	208	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Doing it now in advance versus April, which would be more in line with the approach we have been using, allows it to be viewed as a technical adjustment and removes it from market discussions about the timing of liftoff.	62	6
201503	209	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	It has some technical benefits.	62	6
201503	210	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	It lines up with the overnight RRP authorization that we already have and still provides us flexibility to decide whether we are going to use it or not.	62	6
201503	211	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	I think those are the benefits of doing it now.	62	6
201503	212	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So you are appealing to some technical considerations?	62	6
201503	213	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	For it to be perceived as a technical adjustment.	62	6
201503	214	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	No one thinks we are going to raise rates in April.	62	6
201503	215	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So, doing it in April with the same language we used in January wouldn’t be some tipping of our hands.	62	6
201503	216	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We didn’t tip our hands in January.	62	6
201503	217	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, we went with $200 billion in January.	62	6
201503	218	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	This one has $300 billion, so that would be a small change.	62	6
201503	219	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I agree with you completely.	62	6
201503	220	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We have been running testing operations for a long time now, and no one has taken any signal from those.	62	6
201503	221	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	You could argue the reason they haven’t taken a signal is because forward guidance has been in place.	62	6
201503	222	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We are now going to enter a period, it appears, in which we won’t have such forward guidance in place.	62	6
201503	223	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	So, just from the “do no harm” viewpoint, if you view this as technical, we thought it would be nice to get it out of the way now.	62	6
201503	224	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I do notice that I think there is a slight difference between what’s in the exhibit and the ordering of the options that you have in front of you.	62	6
201503	225	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	If you just flip them in your head—option 1 is option 2, and option 2 is option 1—that will simplify life for you.	62	6
201503	226	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m having trouble keeping up with your technical factors here.	62	6
201503	227	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201503	228	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am going to change the topic, if that is okay.	62	6
201503	229	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	First I have a comment, then a question.	62	6
201503	230	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The comment is that it’s a little ironic that the gates and fees on money market funds had the probably unintended consequence, from the SEC’s perspective, of encouraging some of the fund families to eliminate the prime money market fund relative to the Treasuries, a development that actually should help financial stability.	62	6
201503	231	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it is somewhat ironic that that is the way some of the funds are actually reading that proposal.	62	6
201503	232	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The question is, to the extent that the Treasury-only money market funds are becoming more important—and that is going to be phased in over this period, so it is not an immediate change, for example, at Fidelity—what do we think the money market fund behavior will be if they think that we might raise rates in June?	62	6
201503	233	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	What does that imply for money market funds using overnight RRPs rather than holding longer-term Treasury securities?	62	6
201503	234	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we move into periods in which we don’t know whether we will be raising rates—say, in June and September—would we expect the money market funds to substantially increase their use of overnight RRPs just because they don’t want to be caught with a potential capital loss if they were holding longer term?	62	6
201503	235	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	What does that mean for use of the overnight RRP facility?	62	6
201503	236	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are we surveying the Treasury-only money market funds on a regular basis to get a sense of the behavioral changes that might be expected?	62	6
201503	237	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, to the extent that management has changed for some of these, it becomes probably more important to sample a little more deeply than we might have in the past.	62	6
201503	238	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The staff is talking with the money funds on a regular basis, almost daily, related to what they are doing in the operations that day or what they are planning to do over the next several weeks.	62	6
201503	239	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	We haven’t heard from the money funds any discussion that the anticipation of raising rates is moving their expectations for usage of the overnight RRP.	62	6
201503	240	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Most of the commentary we hear from the money funds is that they are trying to maintain their relationships with private counterparties, given the constraints that they are seeing from some of those private counterparties, and that they are only coming to the overnight RRP when they are losing that balance sheet.	62	6
201503	241	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	And they are even willing to give up a couple of basis points to maintain those counterparty relationships.	62	6
201503	242	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	So we haven’t heard that as being front and center in the discussions.	62	6
201503	243	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	You saw a quite large move in short rates over the intermeeting period, and we didn’t see any change in behavior of the overnight RRP.	62	6
201503	244	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	As long as those private-sector rates are still available for them and are above the overnight RRP or close to it—even slightly below—I think they would stay with the private-sector counterparties.	62	6
201503	245	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just a quick follow-up.	62	6
201503	246	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We’re not into the three-month window yet for the end of June, but I would think the behavior might change as we get closer to a date at which, potentially, you’re going to be trading off the uncertainty regardng what we’re going to be doing with whether you should shorten up the maturity that could possibly result in a big increase at the end of June with whatever the reverse repo rate would be.	62	6
201503	247	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments or questions?	62	6
201503	248	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201503	249	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I think I would favor authorizing quarter-end use of repos now for the whole year, but I guess the question is, if later on we decide to lift the overnight repo cap at quarter-end or for a period after liftoff, then that would play into the decision—do you see what I mean?	62	6
201503	250	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We won’t need both if we lift the cap because, in all likelihood, we’re going to be lifting off right before quarter-end.	62	6
201503	251	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	I tried to outline that authorizing doesn’t obligate you to actually conduct the operations.	62	6
201503	252	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Right.	62	6
201503	253	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	And I think you would, after you lift off, see what the conditions are to determine whether to actually conduct the term, and what the size should be, based on what you’re seeing in market rates and behavior.	62	6
201503	254	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201503	255	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201503	256	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll follow up on Governor Powell’s comment.	62	6
201503	257	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At least for my own thinking about this, it might be useful to defer this decision until after we’ve had the discussion on normalization tools and getting a perspective on what we want to do with the cap.	62	6
201503	258	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201503	259	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it is actually even a little bit more complex than that because you could have no cap for a short period and then go to a cap, and you’d still want term RRP to be supplementary to that cap.	62	6
201503	260	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s fairly nuanced.	62	6
201503	261	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	62	6
201503	262	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I do think these two conversations are completely interrelated, and it seems a little strange to be considering the term RRPs absent the broader views about the overnight RRP.	62	6
201503	263	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201503	264	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	There’s no reason we can’t come back to this at the end of that discussion.	62	6
201503	265	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I guess there’s no explicit question that’s been posed about that, but maybe some of you will refer to it in your own discussions.	62	6
201503	266	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And we can certainly come back and vote on this at the end of that discussion.	62	6
201503	267	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	62	6
201503	268	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201503	269	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201503	270	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I do need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63	6
201503	271	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Is there a motion?	63	6
201503	272	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63	6
201503	273	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201503	274	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	63	6
201503	275	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to move along now to our discussion of normalization tools, and Jane Ihrig is going to start us off.	96	9
201503	276	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	277	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Let me start by noting that at your previous meeting, most participants agreed that it would be useful at coming meetings to discuss and communicate additional information about some operational details of your policy implementation plans.	96	9
201503	278	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	With this in mind, the staff memo titled “More Steps toward Finalizing the FOMC’s Operational Preparations for Liftoff” provided some possible language in bullet point form to include in the March minutes; these bullets were revised in light of your earlier comments.	96	9
201503	279	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	At the end of the go-round that will follow our briefing, the Chair will ask whether you agree to augment the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing these additional operational details in the minutes for this meeting; for reference, the bullet points are attached at the end of this handout.	96	9
201503	280	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Two other issues that were covered in the memos related to the capacity of the ON RRP facility.	96	9
201503	281	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I will spend some time discussing options for setting the initial aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility, and then Antoine will review options for reducing capacity during the normalization process.	96	9
201503	282	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Let me say up front that the appropriate amount of capacity needed at liftoff is uncertain for a couple of reasons.	96	9
201503	283	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	First, your calculation of initial capacity needs to account for expected take-up around liftoff and also allow for additional headroom, both of which are hard to gauge.	96	9
201503	284	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	In addition, although we have some sense of these amounts from the test operations that we have been conducting for some time, there is no guarantee that our testing experience provides an accurate reading on potential ON RRP usage once you move the policy rate above the zero lower bound.	96	9
201503	285	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Having said this, the top-left panel of your exhibit presents the two options from the staff memo for setting the initial aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility for your consideration.	96	9
201503	286	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	The first option is to set a temporarily elevated initial cap.	96	9
201503	287	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Your preferred setting of this cap might depend on your willingness to use term RRPs at quarter-ends.	96	9
201503	288	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	The staff suggested, for illustrative purposes, an ON RRP cap of $800 billion.	96	9
201503	289	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	This would be equivalent to double the take-up of both term and ON RRPs that we saw at year-end 2014.	96	9
201503	290	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	It would also be more than 3½ times the largest non-quarter-end take-up that we’ve had to date.	96	9
201503	291	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	By picking this much larger cap than we’ve had in testing and making clear that this initial setting is intended to be temporary, you would send a message that you are committed to a successful liftoff, and, at the same time, by limiting the facility’s size, you would say you’re also sensitive to the financial stability and footprint concerns that you have noted in previous discussions.	96	9
201503	292	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Of course, there is always a chance that $800 billion, or another nominal amount chosen, could turn out to be insufficient for interest rate control.	96	9
201503	293	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Indeed, although as Lorie mentioned, the majority of respondents to the Desk’s surveys expect moderate ON RRP take-up immediately after liftoff, a few market participants surveyed did anticipate that demand will be greater than $800 billion.	96	9
201503	294	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	If that were the case and federal funds traded at rates persistently below the target range, or other money market rates did not firm as much as the Committee desired at liftoff because the cap was regularly being hit or market participants perceived insufficient headroom at the facility, you could subsequently increase the cap size.	96	9
201503	295	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	For policymakers that are concerned about liftoff proceeding smoothly, however, right from the start, this scenario might be unsettling, and they might prefer option 2.	96	9
201503	296	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Under this option, the FOMC would suspend the aggregate cap for a short period but announce that it would establish a cap at the end of that initial brief period; the cap would be one that reflected the observed effects and take-up of ON RRPs after liftoff.	96	9
201503	297	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Assuming you would retain a per-counterparty bid limit, a temporary suspension of the aggregate cap would not amount to offering ON RRPs at full allotment, but would nonetheless provide substantial ON RRP capacity to start.	96	9
201503	298	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	As noted to the right, you have many choices for how to move forward with communicating about your initial setting of capacity.	96	9
201503	299	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	The bullets for inclusion in the minutes of this meeting start this process by reporting that ON RRP capacity at liftoff will be “temporarily elevated.”	96	9
201503	300	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Over time, you could decide on and announce the actual amount of initial capacity you intend to provide, either ahead of liftoff or at liftoff.	96	9
201503	301	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Early communication could provide market participants with further clarity about your liftoff strategy, mitigating any remaining uncertainty about how much RRP capacity will exist around the time of liftoff.	96	9
201503	302	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	However, deferring a decision until liftoff would enable you to continue to evaluate financial market developments as they evolve in the meantime.	96	9
201503	303	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Antoine will now continue our presentation.	96	9
201503	304	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Thanks, Jane.	96	9
201503	305	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	In my remarks, I will discuss options available to policymakers to lower the ON RRP cap, as presented in the memo titled “Lowering the ON RRP Facility Cap after Liftoff.”	96	9
201503	306	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	At this January’s FOMC meeting, most participants indicated that a temporarily elevated ON RRP cap would be appropriate to support monetary policy implementation at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201503	307	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	At the same time, a number of participants emphasized that the Committee should develop plans to ensure that the ON RRP facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	96	9
201503	308	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Notably, some policymakers may be uncomfortable with a large Federal Reserve footprint in money markets and may also be concerned that an ON RRP facility with high excess capacity could increase financial-stability risks arising from disruptive surges.	96	9
201503	309	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	In the long run, as the size of the balance sheet normalizes and the level of reserve balances falls, the use of the ON RRP facility could be expected to wane.	96	9
201503	310	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	This process would take several years, as shown by the black line in the lower-left panel, which corresponds to the January Tealbook, Book B baseline scenario.	96	9
201503	311	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Specifically, once the aggregate level of reserve balances is reduced to its scarcity level, perhaps at about $500 billion, banks’ demand for reserves would likely lead them to bid regularly for federal funds.	96	9
201503	312	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	An ON RRP offering rate at the bottom of the federal funds target range would become relatively unattractive and use of the ON RRP facility would be expected to diminish.	96	9
201503	313	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	This process would make elimination of ON RRPs straightforward.	96	9
201503	314	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Soon after liftoff, perhaps the most likely outcome is that ON RRP usage will remain well below the elevated cap.	96	9
201503	315	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Indeed, as Lorie noted, the median respondent to the most recent Desk surveys expects that usage of ON RRP at liftoff will be $300 billion and will decline to $250 billion three years after liftoff, broadly similar with recent surveys.	96	9
201503	316	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	If usage remains well below the elevated cap, that cap could be reduced with likely little effect on money market rates, so long as the facility’s headroom remains sufficient.	96	9
201503	317	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Such a buffer might be on the order of $100 billion to $200 billion and could potentially change over time to accommodate seasonal or other variation in take-up.	96	9
201503	318	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	One potential complication with reducing the cap relatively quickly after liftoff is that underlying demand for ON RRPs might subsequently increase.	96	9
201503	319	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	For example, some regulatory reforms may lead to greater use of ON RRPs over time.	96	9
201503	320	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The potential for rising demand could be accommodated in several ways to maintain adequate interest rate control.	96	9
201503	321	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	For example, policymakers could wait longer after liftoff to reduce the cap, could lower the cap but be prepared to raise it if increased demand materializes, or could institute a cap that is responsive to demand.	96	9
201503	322	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	In another scenario, rates remain well controlled and demand for ON RRPs could remain persistently high.	96	9
201503	323	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	This is the more interesting scenario.	96	9
201503	324	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	If usage is high, the ON RRP facility would likely be playing an important role in supporting rates, so the efficacy for interest rate control of elevated ON RRP usage would need to be weighed carefully against its costs.	96	9
201503	325	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	In particular, substantial use of other supplementary tools may be needed to provide sufficient rate support while lowering the ON RRP cap.	96	9
201503	326	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The potential costs of these tools would likely rise if they are heavily relied upon.	96	9
201503	327	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The Committee has several options at its disposal to encourage shifts in the composition of the Federal Reserve’s liabilities away from ON RRPs.	96	9
201503	328	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	An advantage of these options is that they could be implemented fairly rapidly and influence money market rates quickly.	96	9
201503	329	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The simplest option to reduce ON RRP usage is to set a wider spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates by raising the IOER rate.	96	9
201503	330	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	However, the strength of the upward pull due to the IOER rate is unclear, so there is uncertainty about how much this rate would have to be raised; the increase might have to be substantial.	96	9
201503	331	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Another option would be to substitute term RRPs for ON RRPs.	96	9
201503	332	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	While term RRPs could help reduce the Federal Reserve’s footprint in overnight markets, a shift from ON RRPs to term RRPs likely would not reduce the overall footprint in short-term funding markets, and may even expand it if term operations were sufficiently attractive.	96	9
201503	333	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Finally, the Committee could use both term RRPs and the TDF to broaden the arbitrage opportunities that are created by IOER and ON RRPs and to attempt to drain enough reserves to create scarcity.	96	9
201503	334	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Although term tools are unlikely to contribute much to reserve scarcity unless they are used in very substantial sizes, these tools could hasten the reduction in reserve balances to allow the ON RRP facility to be wound down.	96	9
201503	335	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	For example, the blue dashed line illustrates the effect of $1.5 trillion in draining tools on the baseline scenario mentioned above.	96	9
201503	336	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	With this strategy, reserve balances drop to $500 billion around mid-2017, nearly three years earlier than in the baseline scenario.	96	9
201503	337	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	However, substantial use of term tools could increase the Federal Reserve’s involvement in a range of term markets and would likely raise the pecuniary costs of monetary policy implementation.	96	9
201503	338	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Should circumstances after liftoff change the Committee’s views regarding the costs and benefits of asset sales, it could also consider using such sales to reduce the size of the balance sheet directly.	96	9
201503	339	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Asset sales may also be effective in reducing ON RRP usage.	96	9
201503	340	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	One approach to asset sales could focus on sales of shorter-dated Treasury securities.	96	9
201503	341	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	At mid-2015, the SOMA Treasury portfolio is projected to hold around $800 billion of Treasury securities with less than three years remaining to maturity.	96	9
201503	342	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The red dotted line illustrates the projected effect on reserve balances of adding sales to the baseline scenario so that the SOMA portfolio is reduced by roughly $50 billion per month once reinvestment is halted in late 2015.	96	9
201503	343	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Reserve balances would fall to $2.2 trillion within one year of liftoff (that is, $200 billion lower than the baseline path), and to $700 billion in 2018 (about $700 billion less than the baseline path).	96	9
201503	344	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Announcing the sales of shorter-dated Treasury securities might also send a signal that boosts short-term rates.	96	9
201503	345	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	However, the effects of such a signal are uncertain, and it could affect rates beyond short-term yields.	96	9
201503	346	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	If longer-term rates rise quickly, financial conditions could tighten more than intended.	96	9
201503	347	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Combining the liability-side and asset-side tools would likely make them more effective at reducing ON RRP usage quickly.	96	9
201503	348	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The green dot-dashed line illustrates that the combination of term tools and asset sales described above would reduce reserve balances to about $500 billion by late 2016.	96	9
201503	349	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	To sum up, the Committee has tools at its disposal that can be used to reduce take-up at the ON RRP facility and hence lower an initially high cap while maintaining appropriate interest rate control.	96	9
201503	350	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The use of these additional tools would have costs, as does ON RRP usage, and the Committee will need to weigh tradeoffs between efficacy and costs for all of the tools.	96	9
201503	351	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The staff will continue to evaluate the Committee’s policy tools, particularly the ON RRP facility.	96	9
201503	352	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	Finally, clear public communication about the intention to keep the ON RRP capacity only as high as necessary would avoid sending the unintended signal that a large ON RRP facility would be maintained for a period longer than the Committee deems appropriate.	96	9
201503	353	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	While reiterating the importance of a successful liftoff, the Committee could reaffirm its intent to use an ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary and to phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	96	9
201503	354	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	The next page of our handout lists the normalization questions previously distributed to you for the go-round.	96	9
201503	355	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Jane or Antoine before we begin the go- round?	96	9
201503	356	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201503	357	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	For Antoine.	96	9
201503	358	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We talk about $50 billion a month in Treasury sales.	96	9
201503	359	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Can you talk about the derivation of that?	96	9
201503	360	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Really, if the concern is that is as much capacity as the market has to accept supply, I guess the point would be that rates would be going up, which is our intention.	96	9
201503	361	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	How do you think about why that is a hard limit, or could it be substantially higher?	96	9
201503	362	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I guess I could say one thing.	96	9
201503	363	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	If you look at the amount of securities we have on our portfolio that’s three years or less, as Antoine said, it’s about $800 billion.	96	9
201503	364	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	And if you’re trying to sell it over the time frame that’s in this projection, the projection represents some smoothing of how much you could do per month.	96	9
201503	365	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	In some sense you are limited by what is in your portfolio at the time.	96	9
201503	366	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	With the maturity extension program, you sold a lot of your short- dated securities, and then purchases in the last LSAP were on the long end.	96	9
201503	367	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	You don’t actually have a lot of short-dated securities.	96	9
201503	368	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Of course, the later you wait to sell, maturities of securities are getting shorter, and shorter-dated securities come into the window.	96	9
201503	369	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	As you can see, that’s in part why there’s a kink here in this projection, because you kind of start running out of securities to sell.	96	9
201503	370	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	But that’s just in terms of what we have.	96	9
201503	371	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I guess Lorie can talk about the market conditions.	96	9
201503	372	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	What I’m saying is, if the exercise is to have rate control and put a floor under rates, we’ll always be making more short-term securities as time passes.	96	9
201503	373	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	I think it’s undoubtedly right that selling these short-term assets will help lift rates.	96	9
201503	374	2015-03-18	meeting	MARTIN	I think the concern, if you start selling higher amounts, is the risk of a misperception of the Committee’s intention and the possibility that the sales could raise more than short-term rates.	96	9
201503	375	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t think, operationally, we would have any limitation to sell more— we sold about $40 billion during the MEP, and that did put some upward pressure on rates.	96	9
201503	376	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	And in this context, there is a demand for those securities.	96	9
201503	377	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	That’s why we have high overnight RRP usage.	96	9
201503	378	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	So, you would think there would be demand to sell them.	96	9
201503	379	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	But all we are doing is just speeding up the redemptions.	96	9
201503	380	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The securities are going to redeem very shortly, and we’re just speeding that up by selling them.	96	9
201503	381	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	I think the other consequence you have to think about is for the Treasury.	96	9
201503	382	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	It will be refinancing as we let these securities run off, and so we’d be putting more pressure on them to account not only for the securities that are rolling off, but also for the securities that we’re selling.	96	9
201503	383	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	The Treasury would then have to raise those funds, and that may not be as smooth a process as it would prefer.	96	9
201503	384	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	That would be just one other factor that you have to consider when you think about the pace of sales.	96	9
201503	385	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Okay.	96	9
201503	386	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201503	387	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I believe it’s the case that it’s a theoretical possibility, in the uncapped scenario, if every counterparty bid their limit, the bids would aggregate to more than reserve account balances right now.	96	9
201503	388	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I believe you alluded to that fact, Jane.	96	9
201503	389	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So, what would we do?	96	9
201503	390	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	First, let me say that it’s true that if you took $30 billion per counterparty times 164 counterparties, you would get more than what’s in the SOMA, but I think that’s not a very realistic number.	96	9
201503	391	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	In part, if you look at the 164 counterparties, I think 24 are banks who get IOER.	96	9
201503	392	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I couldn’t imagine that the banks would be coming in when they could get IOER.	96	9
201503	393	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	If you look at the GSEs, they’ve been coming in quite small.	96	9
201503	394	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Many tend to just be investing cash that they have for any cash needs of the institutions that are members.	96	9
201503	395	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Freddie and Fannie come in, and they do come in around the cap when it’s P&I day, but those are kind of special one-off situations that we know about.	96	9
201503	396	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	The primary dealers are very sensitive to interest rates right now.	96	9
201503	397	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	They are not coming into the facility because they are finding market rates are higher, and as long as market rates are higher, we wouldn’t expect them to come in as well.	96	9
201503	398	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	So it’s really the money funds, and you’d want to look at how much of their portfolio you think they might want to shift into the facility.	96	9
201503	399	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Right now, they have about $700 billion of short-term Treasuries or repos on their books.	96	9
201503	400	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I would say that might be an upper bound, but again, they have only been coming in a little over $100 billion over the past couple of months on average.	96	9
201503	401	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d agree.	96	9
201503	402	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I’d find it persuasive that it’s really unlikely, but you’re not arguing the probability is zero, are you?	96	9
201503	403	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We have taken a fairly risk-averse approach as a Committee, and it seems to me we ought to have a plan.	96	9
201503	404	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	What’s our plan?	96	9
201503	405	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	President Lacker, can you outline exactly what event you are thinking about?	96	9
201503	406	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Wouldn’t we have to cap it and stop it out at less than full allotment?	96	9
201503	407	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you’re doing a partial equilibrium analysis.	96	9
201503	408	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In general equilibrium, the flowing of all these funds into the overnight RRP is going to have an effect on money market rates, and that is going to prevent the funds from flowing into the overnight RRP.	96	9
201503	409	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It can’t be that you can just drain $4 trillion of reserves from the system and not expect money market rates to rise, something that would prevent this outcome.	96	9
201503	410	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I really think it’s impossible.	96	9
201503	411	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	You’re making a forecast.	96	9
201503	412	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	You’re not saying the probability is zero, is it?	96	9
201503	413	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I am saying the probability is zero because it doesn’t make any sense.	96	9
201503	414	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Why would all of this money flow into the overnight RRP facility if doing so would put significant upward pressure on other money market rates?	96	9
201503	415	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It has to.	96	9
201503	416	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	How?	96	9
201503	417	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It would have to because the people that they were funding now would not be being funded, right?	96	9
201503	418	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I think we’ve discussed scenarios in which they want the safest counterparty there is for a dollar liability.	96	9
201503	419	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s very difficult to believe that something of the size that you’re talking about could happen overnight or within a week.	96	9
201503	420	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	If we saw a set of events that were leading to that kind of pattern, I think you’d all be meeting and trying to understand exactly what was happening.	96	9
201503	421	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	And I don’t know how you’d feel about the various tools that the Federal Reserve has in that situation.	96	9
201503	422	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s not a probability-zero event.	96	9
201503	423	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Obviously, we have a large balance sheet, but you’d all be looking at the events that would be leading up to it and deciding what the appropriate action was.	96	9
201503	424	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	But it wouldn’t be the case that if you said tomorrow that we were running without a cap, there would be any issue of the increase in the facility being $2 trillion or $3 trillion.	96	9
201503	425	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Money markets don’t work that quickly.	96	9
201503	426	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Look, I’m not arguing that this is highly likely.	96	9
201503	427	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It’s just that there are people out there in the market who are smart enough to do this math.	96	9
201503	428	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We call this “uncapped,” but we’d have to have some sort of cap.	96	9
201503	429	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	There would have to be some backstop, upper limit, or cap.	96	9
201503	430	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And I think it’s fair and more transparent and better communication for us to describe this as not a suspension of the cap, but a dramatic increase in the cap to something—I don’t know— on the order of $2 trillion.	96	9
201503	431	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The only point I’d make about this is that calling this a suspension of the cap is really a bit misleading, and the money market letters are going to smoke this out.	96	9
201503	432	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I think one way to say it is we could take the size of the Treasury portfolio and say that it is the amount of collateral, taking off something for securities lending and the foreign pool, that we would be prepared to transfer over to the triparty agent.	96	9
201503	433	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Just set an amount that’s much larger.	96	9
201503	434	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	But that would be an operational detail that the type of people in money markets that you’re talking about would be interested in, but most people wouldn’t.	96	9
201503	435	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I mean, that seems like a cleaner way to communicate than to call it a suspension of the cap and have everyone doing a lot of math.	96	9
201503	436	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Did you have a two-hander?	96	9
201503	437	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201503	438	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have a less extreme tail event than President Lacker.	96	9
201503	439	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Let’s suppose at the time of liftoff that the cap is binding, so the federal funds rate is trading substantially below the target that we publicly announced.	96	9
201503	440	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have two options.	96	9
201503	441	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We can either change the IOER rate, which would be a Board of Governors decision, or we can raise or eliminate the cap on ON RRP.	96	9
201503	442	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So either we have to have an emergency meeting of the FOMC that night, or the Board of Governors has to have a formal meeting to decide if the IOER rate goes up.	96	9
201503	443	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Let’s say that we decide to do the IOER, but we don’t really understand what the spread is between IOER and ON RRP.	96	9
201503	444	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	After the Board has raised the IOER, we find out that’s not sufficient either.	96	9
201503	445	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	So then, following that, we have to eliminate or raise the cap on RRP.	96	9
201503	446	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	What do we think the market’s reaction to the degree of uncertainty that the Federal Reserve has around this action would be?	96	9
201503	447	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We seem to be viewing this as an innocuous event.	96	9
201503	448	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I guess thinking about the decision trees—whether we do ON RRP or whether we do IOER and how the market reacts in that context—it seems, from a risk-management standpoint, it’s highly risky to have a cap and have no certainty whether it’s binding or not versus no cap, at least at initiation.	96	9
201503	449	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Could you tell me a little bit more about the costs and benefits as you think about the benefits of that cap and think about what happens if there actually is much more demand?	96	9
201503	450	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I don’t think it’s going to exceed the amount of reserves, but I think it could exceed $800 billion.	96	9
201503	451	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think the likely behavioral actions around this time are highly uncertain.	96	9
201503	452	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I hope it’s much less than $800 billion, but I have no certainty about any of our estimates of that.	96	9
201503	453	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it’s not binding, both no cap and the cap have the same result, but if it is binding, there’s a very different sequence of events, and it’s unclear how our plan is to react to that.	96	9
201503	454	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Can you talk a little bit more about that cost-benefit calculation?	96	9
201503	455	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	When I think about what I would do if I were a policymaker, I think about two key considerations, which are, how certain are you about setting the cap, and how much do you really want monetary control on day one?	96	9
201503	456	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Depending on your views regarding those two concerns, I think it can lean you toward setting a cap of a certain size, and you’re very comfortable and you think that’s more than plenty and you think that you won’t even need intermeeting adjustments—or maybe you think you do, and that’s just part of doing monetary policy and it’s not a big deal.	96	9
201503	457	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	Or you’re at the other extreme, where you’re really worried that if we set a cap too low we’d be nervous, and it might hurt our credibility right at liftoff, which is a really critical time.	96	9
201503	458	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I personally don’t have an answer that would state specifically what to do.	96	9
201503	459	2015-03-18	meeting	IHRIG	I think that these are two key concerns, which are, how comfortable are you at a certain cap size, and how much do you really care about monetary control right around the time of liftoff so that you don’t have to come back and make adjustments?	96	9
201503	460	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	96	9
201503	461	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201503	462	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	463	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a quick question for Simon, which I should know the answer to.	96	9
201503	464	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you were going to put the cap based on the size of the Treasuries we have in our portfolio, what would that cap number be?	96	9
201503	465	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	It would be somewhere between $2 trillion and $2.5 trillion.	96	9
201503	466	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	96	9
201503	467	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	468	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no more questions, why don’t we begin our go-round, starting with President Mester.	96	9
201503	469	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	470	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	In considering the design and combination of tools that were used during normalization, my primary consideration is control of short-term interest rates.	96	9
201503	471	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	We need to demonstrate at liftoff that we can move the federal funds rate into our target range.	96	9
201503	472	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Another important consideration for me is consistency with the normalization principles we’ve communicated to the public.	96	9
201503	473	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Further communication should add clarity rather than confusion.	96	9
201503	474	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Both of these considerations speak to the Committee’s credibility, which is always important, but it’s arguably even more important as we begin to implement normalization.	96	9
201503	475	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	We’ve communicated our intention that the overnight reverse repo facility will be a temporary one.	96	9
201503	476	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	As the staff memo lays out, various combinations of tools could be used to achieve control of short-term interest rates and allow for the eventual phaseout of the overnight repurchase facility.	96	9
201503	477	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the initial setting of the aggregate cap on reverse repos, I’d rather not put us in a position of having to raise the cap after liftoff.	96	9
201503	478	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I think we would send a confusing message, and it could undermine our credibility.	96	9
201503	479	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	It could signal we don’t have adequate interest rate control or that we’re reconsidering whether or not the facility will be temporary.	96	9
201503	480	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	That leaves me with the choice of setting a high cap at the start and then lowering it over time as we gain experience, versus setting no cap at liftoff and then imposing one later.	96	9
201503	481	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I don’t have strong preferences for one over the other.	96	9
201503	482	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Either one seems consistent with the normalization plans that we’ve laid out, provided it’s accompanied by appropriate communications.	96	9
201503	483	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	We are going to need to explain the purpose of whatever design choice we make, especially as it is going to differ, I think, from our test design.	96	9
201503	484	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Then we need to reiterate that we will use the facility only to the extent necessary; that we plan to phase it out; and that phaseout might be accomplished by imposing caps on the facility’s size, which we could reduce over time; and that we’ll periodically reconsider various design features of this and our other tools.	96	9
201503	485	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Then, once we have a clearer sense of how our tools are working together to control short-term rates, we can communicate a plan for phasing out the facility.	96	9
201503	486	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	To reduce its size while maintaining adequate control of short-term interest rates, we may indeed need to rely on several of our tools, including asset sales.	96	9
201503	487	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	At this point I wouldn’t want to rule them out, but I do think we need further study of how these tools would likely interact with one another.	96	9
201503	488	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	One final thought:  I would be cautious in committing, at this point, to any particular timetable for a reduction in the size of the reverse repo facility cap, or imposition of a cap if we start without one.	96	9
201503	489	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	As I read the staff memo, that seems to be the intention in option 2, and perhaps in option 1 as well.	96	9
201503	490	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	This gives me pause.	96	9
201503	491	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Even if today we think it likely we could reduce the cap size fairly soon after liftoff, we may run into some surprises.	96	9
201503	492	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Aren’t the uncertainties surrounding interest rate control the crux of today’s discussion?	96	9
201503	493	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I wouldn’t want to hurt our credibility by having to go back on an earlier communication.	96	9
201503	494	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	That’s similar to my distaste for putting ourselves in the situation of having to raise the cap at a later date.	96	9
201503	495	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Rather than commit now to a timetable, I’d prefer more general communication, as I just outlined.	96	9
201503	496	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	497	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	498	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201503	499	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	500	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As I said just a few moments ago, I think the question is, what size of an initial cap we are going to adopt?	96	9
201503	501	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	To me, $800 billion seems like a fine number.	96	9
201503	502	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I could support $1 trillion.	96	9
201503	503	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I could go up to the size of our Treasuries portfolio, $2 trillion to $2½ trillion, whatever that calculation is that Simon alluded to.	96	9
201503	504	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Regarding how to scale back usage after liftoff, the case in which usage falls fairly rapidly of its own accord is straightforward.	96	9
201503	505	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The harder case is one in which usage remains elevated and high.	96	9
201503	506	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As I reviewed the staff memo, my attention was immediately attracted to the phrase “asset-side tools,” and I began fantasizing about auctioning off our holdings of MBS and long- term Treasuries at a fairly rapid clip.	96	9
201503	507	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	However, I suspect that option may fail to garner a majority of support from the Committee.	96	9
201503	508	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In that case, I would favor selling short-term assets, although it seems unlikely that we could sell a quantity sufficient to make reserves scarce enough any time soon.	96	9
201503	509	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As a third choice, I would favor raising IOER above the top of the federal funds target range, starting with 5 basis points and seeing what happens, moving to 10 or 15 basis points if that is not enough.	96	9
201503	510	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As to the other options, using term RRPs seems inferior.	96	9
201503	511	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It is going to leave the RRP program, in general, with the same footprint and would take an unrealistically large set of operations to reach the point at which reserve balances are scarce enough to make a difference.	96	9
201503	512	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I have always raised questions about whether term tools really make reserves scarce, because they are just term monetary assets.	96	9
201503	513	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	They are not nonmonetary assets and are unlikely to be marginally constraining for the participating institutions.	96	9
201503	514	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	515	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a clarifying question?	96	9
201503	516	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201503	517	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s imagine that the overnight RRP facility wasn’t very big; let’s just say its usage is $200 billion or $300 billion.	96	9
201503	518	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Would you still sell assets?	96	9
201503	519	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	No, I wouldn’t see a need to.	96	9
201503	520	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	96	9
201503	521	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201503	522	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	523	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	President Lacker’s fantasy is my nightmare.	96	9
201503	524	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	96	9
201503	525	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	When we announce that we are raising the range for the federal funds rate, it is critically important that we are successful in quickly moving the federal funds rate within the range and then keeping it there.	96	9
201503	526	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	With our credibility at stake, and with a high degree of uncertainty about the market response when short-term rates are initially raised above current levels, I would argue against any cap on the ON RRP facility at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201503	527	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the ON RRP take-up remains very large for some period after liftoff—and we should discuss how long a period we would be comfortable with—we should raise the IOER high enough that the federal funds rate rises to be within the federal funds target range without excessive take-up of the ON RRP facility.	96	9
201503	528	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Again, we should discuss the Committee’s definition of “excessive.”	96	9
201503	529	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, in order to reduce the risk of extensive use of the ON RRP facility, we might raise the IOER rate to 60 basis points to maintain the federal funds rate within the 25 to 50 basis point range.	96	9
201503	530	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The IOER rate can then be adjusted subsequently to fine-tune the placement of the federal funds rate as we better understand the relationship that the federal funds rate has with the spread between IOER and ON RRP rates.	96	9
201503	531	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This raises the question of whether we have communicated sufficiently that, while the target range for the federal funds rate will be 25 basis points, the spread between the IOER and the ON RRP rates may need to be greater than 25 basis points.	96	9
201503	532	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Particularly in our explanation of liftoff, it should be clear that the IOER rate will be adjusted to ensure that the federal funds rate stays within the target range.	96	9
201503	533	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a sidenote, the dependence on the IOER rate to generate the desired range for the federal funds rate does create a governance problem.	96	9
201503	534	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Ideally, the FOMC would be setting the IOER rate.	96	9
201503	535	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, if reform legislation were to move through the Congress, I would prefer the IOER rate be a vote of the FOMC, as it is the key variable in setting monetary policy under our current exit guidelines.	96	9
201503	536	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The main strategy for reducing the ON RRP take-up after liftoff should be setting the IOER rate high enough that the federal funds rate is trading within the desired range without excessive reliance on the ON RRP.	96	9
201503	537	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Some of the suggested remedies in the memo might be tantamount to changing monetary policy to minimize reliance on the ON RRP.	96	9
201503	538	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The tool should be set to generate the desired policy.	96	9
201503	539	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Policy should not be adjusted to minimize the use of the tool.	96	9
201503	540	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, I am strongly opposed to asset sales.	96	9
201503	541	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, this would reverse our often- repeated promise not to engage in significant sales, possibly reducing the credibility of our exit strategy.	96	9
201503	542	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, even if the sales were limited to very short-term securities, I am worried that investors might become concerned that longer-maturity securities would be sold next.	96	9
201503	543	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This concern would be exacerbated by the relatively small stock of short-term securities currently in our portfolio.	96	9
201503	544	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	If monetary control is at stake and we choose to sell very short-term securities, these could be exhausted before control is regained, implying that longer-term securities will soon be on the auction block.	96	9
201503	545	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This could potentially cause a Treasuries sales “tantrum” as investors in longer-term securities doubt the credibility of our promise on holding securities to maturity.	96	9
201503	546	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The costs could be large if our initial announcement of short-term sales results in significantly raising medium- and longer-term rates.	96	9
201503	547	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The potential benefit would be avoiding elevated use of the ON RRP until our balance sheet is reduced, but that benefit does not seem worth the undermining of our announced exit principles.	96	9
201503	548	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are seriously considering asset sales or other means to minimize the use of the ON RRP, I would want to stop reinvesting sooner, although this would also be changing policy to minimize use of a tool.	96	9
201503	549	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The key in my mind is that while the costs of a larger overnight RRP facility that lasts for longer are somewhat ill defined, the costs of tightening policy are reasonably clear.	96	9
201503	550	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a consequence, we need to have a better discussion of why short-term use of the ON RRP is such a problem that it causes us to tighten by stopping reinvesting or signaling in any way that we would engage in asset sales.	96	9
201503	551	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	552	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	553	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	96	9
201503	554	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	555	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On the first question regarding my views on the two aggregate cap options, I have come around to the view that the Committee appropriately should take minimal monetary-control risks in the first phase of liftoff.	96	9
201503	556	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I prefer suspending the aggregate cap—that is, option 2.	96	9
201503	557	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we can operate the overnight reverse repo facility without a cap for a brief period without serious consequence.	96	9
201503	558	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	As a practical matter, if an episode of severe financial instability or risk of instability were to materialize in the early weeks post-liftoff, we could react with limits on take-up appropriate to the circumstances at hand.	96	9
201503	559	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I see little need to impose a limit at the outset as long as we clearly intend to assess take- up, assess rate control effectiveness and the risks post-liftoff, and then, on that basis, impose a cap.	96	9
201503	560	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	On the second question, strategies to later reduce the overnight reverse repo take-up, the staff memo lays out two discrete methods:  widening the spread to IOER and draining reserves.	96	9
201503	561	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Early on, I think we must rely on widening the spread.	96	9
201503	562	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Execution of a draining strategy that includes asset sales would take a while.	96	9
201503	563	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	For planning purposes, I anticipate a shorter time horizon for reducing and phasing out the overnight reverse repo program.	96	9
201503	564	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think there may be some scope for a combination of spread widening and draining, but I am hoping the need for the overnight reverse repo program will fall away long before we could get excess reserve balances of $500 billion.	96	9
201503	565	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So, I see draining operations, including asset sales, as a supplemental tool.	96	9
201503	566	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The questions posed for this round were very high level, asking for our general views.	96	9
201503	567	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it would be prudent to go a little further and try to agree, at least tentatively, on a baseline post-liftoff plan for implementing reductions in the overnight reverse repo facility, if things go well.	96	9
201503	568	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	To be sure, we will be learning by doing and we will make tactical adjustments as we go, but I think a discussion at this meeting or the April meeting of a plan with more specifics might highlight some issues important to consider.	96	9
201503	569	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	For discussion purposes, should participants care to react, here is how I am thinking about phaseout, if things go well.	96	9
201503	570	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	After a couple of moves of the federal funds rate target range, we assess whether and where federal funds are trading in range and where other short-term rates are trading.	96	9
201503	571	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If satisfactory, at that point we announce an overnight reverse repo cap.	96	9
201503	572	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If all goes well with respect to volatility and the rate continues to trade in range, at the next rate move we widen the spread by holding the overnight reverse repo rate where it is.	96	9
201503	573	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We continue to widen the spread with each rate move until take-up under the program fades away.	96	9
201503	574	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I am sure we can imagine other scenarios, and certainly the more adverse scenarios have been discussed earlier.	96	9
201503	575	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	For example, if federal funds trade at or very near the floor, and there is large take-up, that would be one scenario.	96	9
201503	576	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If such a situation persisted, it seems to me that we might have to resort earlier and longer to term tools and the decision to cease reinvestment, and maybe sales, as part of this process.	96	9
201503	577	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If, as we proceed post-liftoff, we are to optimize the tradeoff between monetary control and avoidance of the costs and undesirable potential consequences of a large and persistent long- term overnight reverse repo program, I favor some concrete advance planning as a frame of reference, at least, for future decisions.	96	9
201503	578	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	579	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	580	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201503	581	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	582	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I guess, in part, my remarks are taking up the issue that Eric raised.	96	9
201503	583	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think it’s quite hard to say how much of a risk to financial stability an ON RRP facility could pose if it continued long enough and on a sufficient scale as to be plausibly regarded as a safe haven to which money markets could run from privately created assets, such as commercial paper, during a period of stress.	96	9
201503	584	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But because I seem to have fallen into the role of Cassandra for this topic, let me play to type today, at least for the heuristic purpose of exploring some of the potential costs of the ON RRP, which the staff memo alluded to but didn’t actually discuss.	96	9
201503	585	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I want to do that by placing this discussion in a little bit of context, and the context is essentially the progressive growth of the ON RRP as the centerpiece, what we expect to be the most important tool for policy-normalization purposes.	96	9
201503	586	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The use of an ON RRP was explicitly proposed to the Committee less than two years ago.	96	9
201503	587	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In a July 23, 2013, memo to the Committee, it was characterized as a “useful addition” to the proposed set of normalizing tools that had been previously identified as consisting of IOER, TDF, and non-overnight RRPs.	96	9
201503	588	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In the intervening period, the staff and many Committee members have come to conclude that the ON RRP will actually be essential to making IOER an effective tool, and that the other tools, while perhaps playing a secondary or tertiary role, have significant limitations.	96	9
201503	589	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	This focus on ON RRP was evident in the memos that were circulated to the Committee prior to our discussion last year.	96	9
201503	590	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	As you may recall, at the time, the staff suggested a facility with a $500 billion to $600 billion cap.	96	9
201503	591	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And, in response to concerns expressed by a number of us, the testing has proceeded with a cap of $300 billion.	96	9
201503	592	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	This apparently had the intended effect of curbing market expectations regarding the eventual size of the facility.	96	9
201503	593	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, this is one means of trying to prevent the expectation that the Federal Reserve would be available as a borrower of last resort.	96	9
201503	594	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In truth, of course, even a cap might not do the trick in a stress period during which we might come under heavy, perhaps even self-generated, pressure to expand an ON RRP program in the interest of stabilizing money market funds in the wake of Dodd-Frank’s elimination of other sources of support for those funds.	96	9
201503	595	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But at least at the margin, and potentially more fundamentally, a moderate cap would work against the development of money market fund business models based on regular or contingent investment opportunities at the Federal Reserve.	96	9
201503	596	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I gather that the mention in the January minutes of a likely increase in the cap at the time of liftoff didn’t lead to a basic change in market perceptions, but I think Governor Powell mentioned—and I noticed the same thing—that there has been at least some change among some market participants in the expectation of a significantly larger program.	96	9
201503	597	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Now, in the memo distributed prior to this meeting, the choice presented to the Committee is no longer $500 billion or $600 billion, but $800 billion or no cap at all.	96	9
201503	598	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	This is not a particularly appealing choice for me because I think either one risks communicating a substantial program.	96	9
201503	599	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And it’s not hard to imagine a decision dynamic in the FOMC that gravitates, at each meeting, toward maximum assurance that our target range will be achieved with some precision, because financial-stability risks will probably always seem hypothetical and much less immediate than monetary policy targeting.	96	9
201503	600	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	This is the way financial-stability risks arise.	96	9
201503	601	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	At any one moment, near-term policy desiderata always trump the potential hypothetical growth of financial stability concerns, whether it’s commercial real estate lending or mortgage-backed securities or anything else.	96	9
201503	602	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	That’s not to say that’s what’s going to happen here, but that really is the dynamic of decisionmaking:  You have something hypothetical, and you’ve got a near-term policy aim of some sort—whether it’s economic growth or monetary policy control—that, among the decisionmakers, always seems to have a higher priority.	96	9
201503	603	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	By the time our balance sheet shrinks enough to make the ON RRP less relevant, it’s not hard to imagine a future FOMC being warned that reducing the cap or eliminating the ON RRP could itself produce significant disruptions in money markets.	96	9
201503	604	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	At that point, the tradeoff between avoiding near-term disruptions and a possible exacerbation of what are, again, hypothetical, longer-term financial-stability risks, could well be decided in favor of avoiding short-term problems.	96	9
201503	605	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So, at least at this time, I don’t have a favorite across those two alternatives, and picking up on one of President Lockart’s themes, I would like to hear at a future meeting a more elaborated proposal.	96	9
201503	606	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	My preference is not to decide this issue today but to try to build into the obvious imperative of achieving monetary policy control a more specific set of proposals for how to deal with the potential risks.	96	9
201503	607	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	As to the second question on strategies to reduce the ON RRP after liftoff, let me first say that I appreciate the language changes that were made in the bullet points on operational details proposed to be included in the minutes of this meeting.	96	9
201503	608	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think the specific invocation of other tools in the context of an anticipated early reduction in the size of the ON RRP is helpful in countering expectations of ongoing, larger scales for the facility.	96	9
201503	609	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think, though I’m honestly not entirely sure, that I would favor something like an explicit commitment to reduce the cap beginning within a few meetings following liftoff, because I believe that the imperative is to have a successful liftoff at the early stage of normalization, but that the possibility of a little softness in the funds rate six or eight months later would not be damaging to our credibility.	96	9
201503	610	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Also, a specific commitment of this sort would force us to make use of some of the other tools mentioned in the staff memo.	96	9
201503	611	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	However, based on Committee discussion to date and, indeed, the first group of speakers this morning, I’m not at all sure that I’d get much support for this approach—which, by the way, whether it’s reducing the cap or putting a cap in place following a no cap or $2.5 trillion cap at the outset is basically the same exercise.	96	9
201503	612	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In the absence of such a commitment, I’d probably go along with just about any configuration of other tools and reducing reliance on the ON RRP that could garner substantial support on the Committee.	96	9
201503	613	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	My own instinct is toward some combination of a higher IOER rate and greater use of term RRPs, and, depending on how large the ON RRP had become, perhaps even some sales of shorter-term Treasuries.	96	9
201503	614	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think Eric has already pointed out a certain clunkiness in trying to put these tools together, which, as a governance matter, is probably something that we need to address.	96	9
201503	615	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But more important to me than any of these particulars are, first, that we convince ourselves that we have alternatives to a large, ongoing ON RRP that we are willing to deploy with full recognition of their possible downsides; and, second, that we state this position publicly with as much detail as fairly reflects our actual eventual consensus.	96	9
201503	616	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In a similar vein, I would note in passing that I would favor continued testing of term RRPs at the end of quarters precisely because it will signal that we’re taking this tool seriously, though I also will note that I would understand the reluctance of members who might favor a liftoff during the next several meetings to authorize testing for the rest of the year because, as Simon says, once “patient” is off, that may send some signal on liftoff timing.	96	9
201503	617	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, Madam Chair, let me close with the hope that initial takeoff turns out to be about what we’ve been anticipating lately so that we’re spared having to make what I think is an increasingly difficult tradeoff that we’re contemplating in this discussion.	96	9
201503	618	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	96	9
201503	619	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	620	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Acting President Prichard.	96	9
201503	621	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	622	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The FOMC must appear confident during the early stages of liftoff by exercising fairly tight control over the funds rate.	96	9
201503	623	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Doing so would establish our ability to conduct monetary policy under these unprecedented conditions and provide the necessary confidence to markets and the general public that the Committee can maintain sufficient control over monetary policy until such time as our balance sheet is fully normalized.	96	9
201503	624	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	In this regard, I believe that we should operate for a brief period without a cap and, then, as quickly as is prudent, impose a cap based on our initial experience.	96	9
201503	625	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	We would initially refrain from imposing a cap because of the uncertainty of what that initial take-up would be.	96	9
201503	626	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	By setting a specific cap, we could err on the low side by ending up with a cap that initially binds, resulting in a funds rate that would trade below the targeted range, or we could set a cap that’s too high, which might be misinterpreted as a Committee desiring an unnecessarily large ON RRP facility.	96	9
201503	627	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	By not specifying a number, we would avoid communicating any particular position as to the size of the facility.	96	9
201503	628	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	However, it would also be important to communicate that it is the combination of this uncertainty regarding the initial take-up and our desire that the funds rate trade within its target range that leads us to begin without an aggregate quantity restriction.	96	9
201503	629	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	After obtaining information about the necessary size of the facility, a cap would be established.	96	9
201503	630	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Further, we would emphasize that the ON RRP facility is intended to be temporary, and that we will reduce its size as circumstances allow.	96	9
201503	631	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	We may also wish to authorize the term RRP facility to initially operate only around quarter-end in order to counter the volatility associated with those periods.	96	9
201503	632	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	However, once we have established our ability to move the funds rate in a regular and fairly precise fashion, I would prefer to ignore the quarter-end effects, as they will have little influence on the effectiveness of overall monetary policy.	96	9
201503	633	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	It is not unlikely we will find the initial size of the ON RRP facility to be uncomfortably large and, over time, wish to reduce its footprint on financial markets.	96	9
201503	634	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Reducing the size of our balance sheet will no doubt help, but that process will be quite long and drawn out, and, therefore, we will require other options.	96	9
201503	635	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The outcome I find most appealing is to widen the spread between the IOER rate and the rate paid on the ON RRP facility.	96	9
201503	636	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The alternative of introducing a permanent term RRP facility does not seem like an alternative at all because it merely introduces a close substitute, and by not reducing the sum of the two instruments, has little effect on the imprint we will have on financial markets.	96	9
201503	637	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The only meaningful way to reduce the size of the facility is to make reserves scarcer or to increase the spread between IOER and the ON RRP rate.	96	9
201503	638	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	639	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	640	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	96	9
201503	641	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	642	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I am hesitant to comment on the issues related to tools, knowing that this discussion builds on many previous discussions in which I did not participate.	96	9
201503	643	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, I have closely read the transcript from the previous meeting and found very insightful comments there, and I would like to thank the authors of the background memo, which was very helpful in helping me to understand these issues.	96	9
201503	644	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I gained some perspective on the concept of liftoff as a result of a recent discussion with our director, who heads the Johnson Space Center, where liftoffs [laughter] are a regular occurrence.	96	9
201503	645	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I know that you all are well aware that in Texas, we like to speak using analogies, so if the Committee will indulge me, a couple of comparisons seem relevant.	96	9
201503	646	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	A NASA liftoff shares many characteristics with the liftoff that we are contemplating, including the possibility of last-minute circumstances and issues that change the plan or abort a launch, as well as the need for multiple gauges and alternatives that support in-flight corrections.	96	9
201503	647	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our director noted that a successful liftoff is an important step to overall mission success, but what happens after the liftoff in the next 73 seconds, days, weeks, and—in the case of the mission they are launching this month—the next year are more important than the liftoff itself.	96	9
201503	648	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	So, in turning to the question regarding the initial cap, I understand that, like a space launch, our liftoff must go smoothly in order to ensure the successful completion of the mission.	96	9
201503	649	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Therefore, it will be important that the initial combined cap on RRP take-up be set high enough to ensure that the funds rate stays within the designated target range at liftoff.	96	9
201503	650	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Therefore, I support operating without a cap initially.	96	9
201503	651	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	To preserve the credibility of our pledge to minimize use of the ON RRP facility, it will be important to either quickly reimpose the cap, if we begin without one, or to reduce our initial cap over time, even if the overnight bank funding rate falls below the lower limit of the Committee’s target range from time to time as a result.	96	9
201503	652	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	You asked that we include our comments on the options for the term RRP quarter-end testing as we go around.	96	9
201503	653	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	On that front, I would say that obviously good quarter-end control of the funds rate will be important, at least through the early phases of the policy normalization process.	96	9
201503	654	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas research staff has advised that the best way to achieve this control will be with a term RRP facility, as the end-of-quarter term RRPs are relatively illiquid and not continuously on offer, and thus are less likely to facilitate bank runs than our overnight RRPs.	96	9
201503	655	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	So, I would oppose discontinuing quarter-end RRP operations, as noted in our option 3, which I don’t think is really on the table.	96	9
201503	656	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Recognizing that through this period of transition, the Committee will be watching market developments very closely in order to make in-flight corrections, either of the other proposed options—reauthorizing term RRP operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis or through the end of the year—is a good alternative.	96	9
201503	657	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	We lean toward option 2, knowing that there is still the opportunity to make decisions as to whether or not to actually conduct the operations, as was pointed out.	96	9
201503	658	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	After liftoff, we’ve looked at the remaining tools under consideration and have a few comments.	96	9
201503	659	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As previously indicated, we favor continuing end-of-quarter term RRP operations through at least early phases of normalization.	96	9
201503	660	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	These operations help achieve good monetary policy control at quarter-ends, and the financial-stability risks associated with term RRPs seem likely to be lower than those associated with overnight RRPs.	96	9
201503	661	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	If overnight RRP take-up away from the quarter-ends is so high as to raise unacceptable financial-stability concerns, we see additional term RRPs, not quarter-end RRPs, as the first line of defense.	96	9
201503	662	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Interest costs from the term RRPs are relatively low, and term RRPs are likely to be nearly as effective as overnight RRPs in supporting short-term interest rates.	96	9
201503	663	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Yet financial-stability risks are lower.	96	9
201503	664	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	We agree that substituting term RRPs for overnight RRPs will not reduce the Federal Reserve’s footprint in financial markets.	96	9
201503	665	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The best way to reduce that footprint is to phase out reinvestment of principal relatively quickly so that the balance sheet shrinks and both overnight and term RRPs are no longer necessary.	96	9
201503	666	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	We are less confident that term deposits will play a useful role in normalization.	96	9
201503	667	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	They bear relatively high interest costs.	96	9
201503	668	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	They would have to be adopted on a large scale in order to drain reserves to the point at which overnight RRP demand dries up, and it is uncertain that they will induce banks to pursue arbitrage opportunities more aggressively, even with an early withdrawal option.	96	9
201503	669	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	This is something that we would like to learn more about as we go forward.	96	9
201503	670	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	And then, finally, because President Fisher will be president for four more days, I feel compelled to support President Lockhart’s call for advance planning that would lay out options under various possible scenarios and essentially create a decision tree.	96	9
201503	671	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	96	9
201503	672	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	673	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201503	674	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	675	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Helen’s very nice comments about space analogies remind me that I had the very high honor yesterday of meeting former astronaut James Lovell, of Apollo 13 fame.	96	9
201503	676	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I had the feeling that we are going to find a way to bring everything together here, right?	96	9
201503	677	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Here we go.	96	9
201503	678	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	You know, to ensure monetary control, at any rate.	96	9
201503	679	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	We hope not like that.	96	9
201503	680	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	96	9
201503	681	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	My views on the steps we need to take to ensure monetary control have not changed since the previous meeting.	96	9
201503	682	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	When the time comes to raise rates, it is important that we maintain monetary control in line with achieving our policy goals.	96	9
201503	683	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I do not have strong preferences regarding whether that control should be achieved with an elevated cap or a suspension of the cap.	96	9
201503	684	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think at this point we have sufficient knowledge to judge the relative risk of an $800 billion aggregate cap versus a temporary suspension of the cap on financial stability or our footprint in markets.	96	9
201503	685	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Therefore, to ensure we will have the control we seek, I would be willing to suspend the cap, if the Committee forms such a consensus.	96	9
201503	686	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	As long as we effectively communicate to market participants that the elevated capacity is temporary and we follow through by reducing the capacity as needed, potential financial stability risks and footprint issues should be minimal.	96	9
201503	687	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, we should make sure all other tools are ready, if needed, to reduce the overnight RRP cap.	96	9
201503	688	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	So, I would continue with the testing of the term RRP facility.	96	9
201503	689	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	And, by authorizing quarter-end tests for the remainder of the year, we reduce our administrative costs and avoid potentially confusing signals regarding the timing of liftoff.	96	9
201503	690	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	So, I support this proposal.	96	9
201503	691	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	More generally, I would prefer to rely on our liability-side tools to reduce ON RRP take- up after liftoff.	96	9
201503	692	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I would not alter our previously agreed-upon exit strategy on asset sales.	96	9
201503	693	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	First, I expect our liability-side tools to work as intended, so I don’t think we will need asset sales to maintain monetary control.	96	9
201503	694	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	More importantly, in the absence of material changes in market conditions, altering the exit strategy we already communicated might confuse market participants.	96	9
201503	695	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Of course, if circumstances did change enough to call into question our control, I would not be opposed to asset sales.	96	9
201503	696	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But based on our tests to date, I don’t anticipate we will need to resort to sales prior to our established plan.	96	9
201503	697	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	698	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	699	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201503	700	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	701	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And thanks again to the staff for the helpful background memos.	96	9
201503	702	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This discussion has already been very illuminating.	96	9
201503	703	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I didn’t actually realize that my colleagues’ both fantasies and nightmares centered on policy normalization.	96	9
201503	704	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think when the transcripts come out, the psychologists will have a field day with this discussion.	96	9
201503	705	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	To me, the key overarching priority is for us to maintain monetary control at and after liftoff.	96	9
201503	706	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Embarking on the normalization process with an overnight repo facility with an $800 billion limit would most likely suffice.	96	9
201503	707	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, to avoid any chance of losing monetary control at this critical juncture, I am comfortable with operating the facility without an aggregate cap during the initial normalization phase.	96	9
201503	708	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, a potential downside—which has already been raised by a number of people—to having a very large or unlimited initial cap is that it could be misinterpreted as signaling the intention to maintain a large presence in the market in the future.	96	9
201503	709	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have already indicated that this is a temporary measure, and it will be ended when it is no longer needed, and we should continue to reiterate that message.	96	9
201503	710	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But like President Mester, I would like to say that we shouldn’t get locked into a particular timing of the reduction of capacity.	96	9
201503	711	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	For instance, the proposed language from the minutes states that we plan to reduce the facility’s capacity “fairly soon” after liftoff, which some might interpret as within a couple weeks or a couple months.	96	9
201503	712	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	If this phrase appears in the FOMC minutes, I am fairly confident that we will be asked what “fairly soon” means, as it is apparently a new phrase for the FOMC.	96	9
201503	713	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would prefer to leave our options open as to the timing of the adjustment of the cap, so that we maintain flexibility to best balance our goals of monetary control and financial stability.	96	9
201503	714	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I suggest deleting that sentence.	96	9
201503	715	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the strategies to limit very high overnight reverse repo facility usage after liftoff, the best course of action is difficult to determine in advance.	96	9
201503	716	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And although, like President Lockhart, I think it makes a lot of sense to war-game different strategies or to have decision trees in connection with that, I do think the appropriate strategy will depend on the reasons underlying the high take-up rate as well as on the economic landscape.	96	9
201503	717	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	If a high take-up rate materializes, we will have to examine its causes and weigh the costs and benefits of alternative approaches in this light.	96	9
201503	718	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Having said that, we were asked our views on this.	96	9
201503	719	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In general, I see term RRPs as the preferred tool for curbing demand for overnight reverse repos while still facilitating monetary control.	96	9
201503	720	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, this is in the context of the very high sustained usage of the overnight reverse repo facility.	96	9
201503	721	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, the term RRP tool provides some flexibility, because we can determine the time and size of offerings.	96	9
201503	722	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as the background memo highlights, we could also discourage the use of overnight reverse repos by raising the IOER rate.	96	9
201503	723	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I find that option less attractive, as we would be widening the target range for reasons other than monetary control, which might muddle our communications.	96	9
201503	724	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am also concerned about the negative public perceptions that higher interest payments going to banks at a cost to the taxpayer might create in that case.	96	9
201503	725	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, on the other side of the ledger, sales of short-term Treasuries would likewise provide a sensible approach from a monetary policy perspective.	96	9
201503	726	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just think about the economics of it.	96	9
201503	727	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would put upward pressure on short-term rates while having little, if any, effect on longer-term rates.	96	9
201503	728	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, as has been mentioned by President Rosengren and others, asset sales during the early stages of normalization could be misconstrued as signaling a tighter overall policy stance.	96	9
201503	729	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some might think it hints that asset sales of longer-term securities may be in the offing.	96	9
201503	730	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking further down the road, once we have moved sufficiently away from the zero lower bound and have ceased reinvestments, asset sales, specifically of shorter-term Treasuries, could be a useful approach.	96	9
201503	731	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Under those conditions, they could be accurately described as a tactical means to reduce the balance sheet with no greater implication for future monetary policy.	96	9
201503	732	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the term RRP testing, I am supportive of reauthorizing through the end of the year.	96	9
201503	733	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	96	9
201503	734	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	735	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201503	736	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	737	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	As the staff memo notes, the ability to clearly demonstrate that we can steer short-term rates is paramount.	96	9
201503	738	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	With that in mind, I support including operational details about the Committee’s plan for liftoff in the minutes of this meeting to remind market participants of the expected contour of the ON RRP’s purpose and its capacity.	96	9
201503	739	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I can support operating for a brief period after liftoff without a cap on the size of this facility—of course, subject to the size of the portfolio, as others have noted.	96	9
201503	740	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of strategies the Committee could follow to reduce ON RRP take-up after liftoff, it seems reasonable to adjust the cap at some point, as the staff memo suggests, with sufficient headroom to ensure control of short-term rates, but not too large to make the facility susceptible to large, rapid inflows.	96	9
201503	741	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	A more challenging scenario, of course, arises in the case of a persistently high level of take-up.	96	9
201503	742	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	To prepare for such circumstances, I think all tools, including term RRPs and the Term Deposit Facility, should be considered to the extent they are needed to drain reserves.	96	9
201503	743	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I also would support sales of shorter-term Treasury securities, as needed.	96	9
201503	744	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	In general, I would argue to keep all of these tools on the table as we approach liftoff.	96	9
201503	745	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	This includes the option of ceasing reinvestments.	96	9
201503	746	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting until after liftoff to start this process I view as something of a missed opportunity, so I would support keeping such an option available to use sooner rather than later to effect the level of reserve balances.	96	9
201503	747	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	How the Committee determines ex ante the sequence, the priority, and the circumstances for using these different options, of course, is more challenging.	96	9
201503	748	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I would agree with others that it may be worthwhile to engage in some sort of scenario analysis under various states of the world where the ON RRP facility is larger than we deem appropriate in order to give the Committee a better sense of which tools are first deployed, when, and under what circumstances.	96	9
201503	749	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201503	750	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	751	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201503	752	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	753	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listened to President Lacker and President Rosengren, I was reminded of a line from the great Ninth District poet, Robert Zimmerman, a.k.a.	96	9
201503	754	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Bob Dylan, who said, “You can be in my dream if I can be in yours.”	96	9
201503	755	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That was scary.	96	9
201503	756	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	No, thanks.	96	9
201503	757	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	96	9
201503	758	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I will indicate tomorrow, especially, I continue to think it is too early for us to be having this conversation.	96	9
201503	759	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The appropriate time for policy firming is, in my view, well off.	96	9
201503	760	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But with that noted, I will offer some views on what would be an appropriate way to be thinking about the use of our tools at a time around liftoff and then afterward.	96	9
201503	761	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the Committee clearly has a very high desire for monetary policy control at the time of liftoff—and I am quite sympathetic to that, myself—I think that it is going to be important for us to demonstrate that we are able to lift off.	96	9
201503	762	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think Helen’s analogy is quite useful to keep in mind.	96	9
201503	763	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think having a large cap at liftoff is desirable.	96	9
201503	764	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a slight preference, but I could be talked out of this, for a temporary suspension as opposed to going to an explicit high numerical cap.	96	9
201503	765	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it is just an issue of communications.	96	9
201503	766	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it sounds a little better to say it is a temporary suspension because that would just make it sound like it has more conditionality built into it, but that is just, as I say, a slight preference.	96	9
201503	767	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listened to people’s comments around the table, I was struck by President Lockhart’s call for planning—it was echoed by others—and President Mester’s call for communication.	96	9
201503	768	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would like to see us do more planning about what we are going to do after liftoff.	96	9
201503	769	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we go with the route of a temporary suspension of the cap, what does “temporary” mean?	96	9
201503	770	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is there a time element to it, or is it based on conditions?	96	9
201503	771	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What are we looking for?	96	9
201503	772	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At least having an internal understanding of these points would be useful.	96	9
201503	773	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, personally, I think communicating as effectively as we can about that would be helpful.	96	9
201503	774	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will offer what is, I think, more of a minority perspective on the desire and the need for monetary policy control after liftoff.	96	9
201503	775	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am sympathetic, as I said, to the perspective that we really need tight monetary policy control at the time of liftoff or immediately thereafter—in the next two to three weeks thereafter.	96	9
201503	776	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest that we should be deemphasizing the role of monetary policy control going forward.	96	9
201503	777	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the focus on it in our communication risks building a misunderstanding of what the purpose of the Federal Reserve is.	96	9
201503	778	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you look at a proposal like the Federal Reserve Accountability and Transparency Act, I think it builds in a misunderstanding that the FOMC’s purpose is to control interest rates, whereas in fact our purpose is to deliver good macroeconomic outcomes through using our tools.	96	9
201503	779	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, I think being more relaxed about monetary policy control would be one way to help further people’s understanding that really what we are trying to get to is better macroeconomic outcomes.	96	9
201503	780	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Hitting the target range for the federal funds rate on a daily basis is not essential to that purpose.	96	9
201503	781	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that said, I understand that we might well face tradeoffs between the size of the ON RRP facility and the degree of control that we are interested in achieving.	96	9
201503	782	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I remain open to a further discussion of the wide range of ways we can try to resolve that tradeoff.	96	9
201503	783	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To me, right now, it seems like the interest rate on excess reserves seems like the best way to resolve that tension.	96	9
201503	784	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, as I said, I remain open.	96	9
201503	785	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One point that I want to make is that I think having an occasionally binding constraint is a positive thing for us, not a negative.	96	9
201503	786	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It gives us experience with having a binding constraint.	96	9
201503	787	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we evolved to a point at which we have, say—I will just name a number—a $300 billion cap that binds at quarter-end, and that induces us to have a very low federal funds rate at that time, I don’t see that as a negative at all.	96	9
201503	788	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that will be good in terms of both markets and our own experience with a binding constraint.	96	9
201503	789	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To wrap up with some final comments, I favor testing through year-end, if we do indeed drop the word “patient” tomorrow.	96	9
201503	790	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee is going to drop the word “patient” tomorrow.	96	9
201503	791	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We haven’t had that discussion yet, but I do anticipate that happening.	96	9
201503	792	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because I anticipate that happening, I favor testing through year-end.	96	9
201503	793	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, I have a couple of comments on the wording.	96	9
201503	794	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am comfortable with having the update to our principles in the March minutes as proposed on page 3 of the staff handout, with three emendations.	96	9
201503	795	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the first sentence, there is a reference to “the FOMC will use, when it becomes appropriate.”	96	9
201503	796	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest, Madam Chair, changing “will” to “intends to.”	96	9
201503	797	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think “will” sounds overly definitive and determinative.	96	9
201503	798	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Similarly, in the next sentence, “[w]hen economic conditions warrant the commencement of policy firming, the Federal Reserve will,”	96	9
201503	799	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest replacing “will” with “intends to.”	96	9
201503	800	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Finally, President Williams raised, I think, a very good point that we don’t necessarily want to get into the new game of defining what “fairly soon” means.	96	9
201503	801	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am a little less comfortable with just dropping that sentence.	96	9
201503	802	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest replacing “fairly soon” with “at an appropriate time.”	96	9
201503	803	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	804	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	805	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we break now.	96	9
201503	806	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We have a scheduled lunch in honor of President Fisher at 12:30 across the street.	96	9
201503	807	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The plan is to come back at 2:00, and we will continue the go-round at that point.	96	9
201503	808	2015-03-18	meeting		[Lunch recess]	96	9
201503	809	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we continue the go-round with President Bullard.	96	9
201503	810	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	811	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I have just a few comments on the two questions that were asked.	96	9
201503	812	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The first question is, should there be an aggregate cap on the overnight RRP program at liftoff?	96	9
201503	813	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	My counsel is that we not have a cap at liftoff and then set a reasonable cap during the aftermath.	96	9
201503	814	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	On the second question—general views on limiting the overnight RRP program take-up after liftoff—in what the memo calls the “complex case” in which demand for overnight RRP is significant during the period after liftoff, I generally think that interest rate control trumps the issues associated with potential financial instability.	96	9
201503	815	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I would not wish to put an artificial limit on overnight RRP if it would damage the Committee’s interest rate control credibility.	96	9
201503	816	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The options in a large post-liftoff take-up scenario, as I understand them, include, one, raise the IOER rate to increase the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates; two, use term repo; three, use the Term Deposit Facility; and, four, use some type of controlled asset sales program.	96	9
201503	817	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I find myself in general agreement with the analysis in the memo evaluating these options.	96	9
201503	818	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Asset sales, in particular, would presumably be a slow approach to reducing dependency on a high-demand overnight RRP facility.	96	9
201503	819	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Even though I’ve advocated asset sales in the past, I don’t think they’d be useful for this particular purpose, and I agree with President Rosengren in that assessment.	96	9
201503	820	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The fastest and most direct response, in my opinion, would be to raise the IOER rate in order to increase the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates.	96	9
201503	821	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	That seems like the tool the Committee will need to rely upon in real time.	96	9
201503	822	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not opposed to experimenting further with term repo, the TDF, or both, to reduce reliance on a high-demand overnight RRP program.	96	9
201503	823	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	824	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	825	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chair.	96	9
201503	826	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	827	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	On the first question, I favor operating for a short time without a cap and then imposing a cap based on expected usage.	96	9
201503	828	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would actually keep the “no cap” in place for maybe the six weeks between FOMC meetings so you’d come back to the next FOMC meeting without any drama.	96	9
201503	829	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Then you would just put the cap in place, so you wouldn’t have to have a video conference.	96	9
201503	830	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	You wouldn’t have to have all of the question marks concerning when are they going to put the cap in place.	96	9
201503	831	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In my opinion, that would just be a very low-key way of doing—it would avoid a lot of drama.	96	9
201503	832	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d set a cap after that six-week period with sufficient headroom so that the market could reasonably expect that it would bind rarely, if ever.	96	9
201503	833	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would supplement that cap with term RRP around quarter-end.	96	9
201503	834	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason is that we see usage increases around the quarter-end.	96	9
201503	835	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So why not just have the term RRP take up that slack?	96	9
201503	836	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That would allow you to operate safely with a lower overnight RRP cap.	96	9
201503	837	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	To put that all in place, I would authorize the series of term RRP tests that we’re talking about over the next three quarter-ends—June, September, December.	96	9
201503	838	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Because you have the tests in place, there would be no errors of signaling to the market that liftoff was going to occur soon.	96	9
201503	839	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That way, you could go “live” if you actually decide to lift off in June, September, or December.	96	9
201503	840	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, having no cap is slightly more prudent than having a high cap because, obviously, there’s a little bit of tail risk that the high cap might not be high enough.	96	9
201503	841	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it’s superior because, by having no cap, you’re not sending any message about how big you think the usage is going to be, how much headroom you think you need so that it’s not binding.	96	9
201503	842	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It is actually very content-free in terms of how much you expect the overnight RRP to be used over the medium term.	96	9
201503	843	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the second question, I thought the memo made it very clear that we have two broad sets of options in terms of managing the demand for overnight RRPs.	96	9
201503	844	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We can change the relative interest rates, or we can drain the amount of excess reserves in the system.	96	9
201503	845	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But my own view is a little different, maybe, from others’.	96	9
201503	846	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s premature to make a precise decision about what we should do.	96	9
201503	847	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think all we really need to know at this point is that we have sufficient tools available to make overnight RRP usage go down faster than would occur just from balance sheet runoff and growth of currency outstanding, if we thought that a steeper decline in overnight RRP usage were desirable.	96	9
201503	848	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that we should see what happens after liftoff in terms of demand.	96	9
201503	849	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We may not have any problem at all that we need to address.	96	9
201503	850	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The take-up of the overnight RRP could be low.	96	9
201503	851	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think making too big a fuss about this now sends a mixed message to market participants about how committed we are to monetary policy control over the medium term.	96	9
201503	852	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of ordering them, I would think that raising the IOER relative to the overnight RRP would be your first port of call.	96	9
201503	853	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Then the reserve draining tools, like the Term Deposit Facility and term RRPs, would be a second port of call.	96	9
201503	854	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m sort of where President Rosengren is.	96	9
201503	855	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m pretty averse to going to the asset sales just because I think it would be very hard to be confident that that wouldn’t leak out into a bigger market reaction in terms of financial conditions.	96	9
201503	856	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would very much support, though, all the other people that have called for more work on a decision tree to understand, if this happens, what would we do?	96	9
201503	857	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are a lot of branches, and I think we should spend more time working out how we would proceed down these different branches.	96	9
201503	858	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	One final thing:  I thought the language in the minutes was fine.	96	9
201503	859	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	There was some discussion about the issue of “fairly soon.”	96	9
201503	860	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we want to tell people that it’s going to come down after some period of time.	96	9
201503	861	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So, my own view is that taking out that sentence may be “a bridge too far.”	96	9
201503	862	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I know “fairly soon” is imprecise.	96	9
201503	863	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d love to come up with better language, but I don’t have anything that’s more precise at this point.	96	9
201503	864	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	865	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	866	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201503	867	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	868	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m grateful to the staff for writing the memos on these topics.	96	9
201503	869	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	They lay out the issues in a clear and straightforward way.	96	9
201503	870	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’d also like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff who have carried out the experiments that have gone a long way to persuading us that it will be possible to use the ON RRP tool to help achieve the target federal funds rates we set at and after liftoff.	96	9
201503	871	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	As everyone agrees, our primary aim with regard to the use of our new method of setting the federal funds rate by using both the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate must be to make sure that we’re able to insert and maintain the federal funds rate in the ranges that we decide and announce.	96	9
201503	872	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve been saying for years that we have the tools we need, and we’ve been experimenting for some while, and the credibility of the Federal Reserve would be severely set back if we pushed the button and failed to lift off as announced.	96	9
201503	873	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That means we have to set a very high initial aggregate cap to make sure we have the capacity we need.	96	9
201503	874	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I wish I had a probability figure to attach to the scenario in which, if we set it at $800 billion, we’ll hit $800 billion, because if that was an extremely low number, on the whole it’s probably better to have a smaller cap than a bigger one.	96	9
201503	875	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But the problem is that not only can’t I get anybody to give me a number—or at least nobody has given me a number they’ll commit to—it’s that we don’t actually have any idea about how to figure out that probability.	96	9
201503	876	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Consequently, I favor not having a cap temporarily and then coming back to one reasonably soon after we start operating the new system.	96	9
201503	877	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Once we’ve established the new system and learned more about the demand for it and the effectiveness of the facility, we can put a new cap in place.	96	9
201503	878	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Between President Lockhart’s “couple of meetings” over which I hope we’ll be doing a gradual increase in rates—and that could be a year if we’re doing two or three increases—and President Dudley’s “six weeks,”	96	9
201503	879	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t know where we’re going to end up on that.	96	9
201503	880	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously it will be better if it can be sooner, but I think that we just have to accept the fact that you can’t both pre-commit strongly and pay no attention to developments that happen afterward.	96	9
201503	881	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	So we’re going to have to be flexible on this, with enough people being around the table to persuade us that we’d better not be too flexible if we want to retain our credibility.	96	9
201503	882	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Regarding how long to avoid having a cap, clearly at every stage it would be more convenient to have the ON RRP facility—there’s always some utility to having an extra tool in hand.	96	9
201503	883	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But we’ll have to find a way of lowering the length of time we use it.	96	9
201503	884	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	There will be a benefit to actually getting rid of it.	96	9
201503	885	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think if we were going to do it one way we’d thought through, it would actually be related to the volume of reductions we plan to undertake in the size of our portfolio, because when the portfolio is so big, that’s the period when we need this.	96	9
201503	886	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I it would, I think, be related to the size of the portfolio and not to the passage of time.	96	9
201503	887	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I hope we do it much more rapidly than that.	96	9
201503	888	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve all discussed the fact that if it doesn’t work, there are other things we could do.	96	9
201503	889	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We could increase our use of term RRPs and term deposits and, if necessary, we could begin to sell short-term assets.	96	9
201503	890	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I would be very interested in getting some idea from the Desk, or anybody else who thinks they know, about how effective raising the IOER rate would be in enabling us to stay in the range.	96	9
201503	891	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	If we actually have a thought of doing that, we’ll have to change the statement, which says the target range is going to be 25 basis points.	96	9
201503	892	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to authorizing the end-of-quarter operations, I think we should just do it for the rest of the year and not have to have extra discussions on this issue.	96	9
201503	893	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I would support that.	96	9
201503	894	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	895	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	896	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201503	897	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	898	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I’ll start by saying that I’m of the view that it’s very important that we have good control of monetary policy at and immediately after liftoff.	96	9
201503	899	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	To achieve that, I may be in a minority, but I prefer the first option, which is to have an $800 billion cap.	96	9
201503	900	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	It seems very likely—and, I think, today got even likelier—that we’re going to be lifting off into a quarter-end.	96	9
201503	901	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I suspect the market will know at the time of liftoff that we already prepositioned $300 billion of additional capacity in term over the quarter-end, which really is $1.1 trillion over the quarter-end and then $800 billion in equilibrium.	96	9
201503	902	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	That’s almost four times the highest previous between-quarter-end take-up.	96	9
201503	903	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	That seems like plenty to me.	96	9
201503	904	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I can’t give any assurances about that, but it does seem like that’s enough.	96	9
201503	905	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Again, I may be in a minority.	96	9
201503	906	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	That would be my first choice, although we also have the flexibility to take the cap off after a week or so.	96	9
201503	907	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	If we’re going to go with taking the cap off, then I would say two things.	96	9
201503	908	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	One, I would not preannounce this.	96	9
201503	909	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t preannounce either of these.	96	9
201503	910	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I would announce these right at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201503	911	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s a bad idea to give too much information.	96	9
201503	912	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	For one thing, you want to overwhelm demand with supply here, and to the extent you send a long signal ahead of time, you give a chance for the demand for ON RRPs to go up.	96	9
201503	913	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	So I would wait.	96	9
201503	914	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In addition, I think there’s real risk in going without a cap for any long period of time.	96	9
201503	915	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	There are really two risks.	96	9
201503	916	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	One is that it’s subject to a lot of criticism from people about being insensitive to the size of our footprint in the markets.	96	9
201503	917	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And the second is, if you’re going to keep it on for two or three meetings, there really is a chance that some kind of an event would happen—and there are plenty of them that we have talked about—that could cause a real run to the balance sheet.	96	9
201503	918	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	So I would say, if we’re going to do it, I wouldn’t preannounce it, and I would do some sort of pre-commitment to imposing a cap.	96	9
201503	919	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Again, if you lift off on the 16th or 17th, which are the dates on which the next three press conference meetings end, then I would want to pre- commit to imposing a cap no later than Date X.	96	9
201503	920	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know what Date X is, but I would want to say that so people know.	96	9
201503	921	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	First of all, there’s no notice of it, and then, second, we impose a cap.	96	9
201503	922	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And I would impose a cap that’s $200 billion-ish over the non-quarter-end amount, and then I would continue doing $300 billion at quarter-end.	96	9
201503	923	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	That’s what I would recommend doing, and, of course, implicit in that is that I do support now authorizing, but not specifically deciding about, testing term RRPs at quarter-ends.	96	9
201503	924	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In terms of the tools, I guess my takeaway is similar to Bill’s, which is that we have a good set of tools available.	96	9
201503	925	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I like lifting the IOER rate 5 or 10 or 15 basis points.	96	9
201503	926	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	It is a perfectly useful tool to me.	96	9
201503	927	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In addition, TDF is a good tool.	96	9
201503	928	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We can do more term.	96	9
201503	929	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We can increase the size of the ON RRP.	96	9
201503	930	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I think any and all of those would work.	96	9
201503	931	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I do really like the idea of asset sales, but I think we’ve kind of promised not to do them for six months after liftoff, and I don’t really think we can revisit that.	96	9
201503	932	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	But let me just say that after that six-month period, I really like the idea of using asset sales to shrink the balance sheet faster than we promised to do.	96	9
201503	933	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	If it’s there to be done, I would take it.	96	9
201503	934	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Again, at that point when we’ve already six months earlier started shrinking the balance sheet, and things are moving along nicely, I think the risks that some have talked about are less.	96	9
201503	935	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I guess it goes without saying, then, that I like the proposed March minutes language, except I wouldn’t so much eliminate “fairly soon” from the last sentence as make it a lot stronger, particularly if we’re going to go with no cap.	96	9
201503	936	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I would want to make some kind of a time-specific commitment to create a cap, and I wouldn’t wait long.	96	9
201503	937	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	938	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	939	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201503	940	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	941	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Establishing monetary policy control should be our paramount objective at liftoff, and our deliberations suggest it is highly likely the decision to lift off will take place at a meeting with a press conference, and, thus, proximate to quarter-end.	96	9
201503	942	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	We have seen previously that demand for overnight RRP tends to rise at quarter-end, raising the risk, in the presence of a binding cap, of a downward drift in rates following the announcement of liftoff.	96	9
201503	943	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, our experience so far with demand for overnight RRPs has taken place with rates near zero, where the floor has likely received some support from the zero lower bound.	96	9
201503	944	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	So, we don’t really know the level of overnight RRPs that will be necessary to keep the federal funds rate in our target zone at liftoff.	96	9
201503	945	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	For all of these reasons, to minimize the risk that the federal funds rate falls below our target range immediately following liftoff, it would be prudent to operate initially without a cap.	96	9
201503	946	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Furthermore, I don’t see significant cost to the temporary suspension of a cap to balance against that achievement of monetary control.	96	9
201503	947	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, I do believe the establishment of a permanent overnight RRP facility would raise important risks of changing the structure of money markets.	96	9
201503	948	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But these risks will be addressed by being unambiguous from the outset, as we have been to date, that the overnight RRP facility will be available only to the extent, and for the duration, necessary to reestablish effective monetary control.	96	9
201503	949	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	For the same reason, I support planning for the phaseout of the facility.	96	9
201503	950	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But I would be wary of trying to specify a time frame at the outset, and I also am uneasy about using the language that is proposed for the minutes on reducing the capacity “fairly soon,” so as to avoid starting a debate on what, precisely, that means.	96	9
201503	951	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Once we have gained some knowledge about the demand for overnight RRPs away from near-zero levels of interest, we can more comfortably set a cap that is credible and that has the appropriate headroom.	96	9
201503	952	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	By that point, it will also be clear that we have established monetary control following liftoff, and our credibility in this area will be less subject to doubts so that our risk tolerance can be a little greater.	96	9
201503	953	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	If the demand for the overnight facility remains elevated for a protracted period, relative to the usage patterns that we have seen so far, I would support increasing the IOER rate and, thus, the gap between the IOER and the overnight RRP rates in order to reinforce the pull of the IOER rate.	96	9
201503	954	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we don’t know precisely how a higher IOER rate will affect the demand for the overnight facility, so we shouldn’t take other policy options off the table.	96	9
201503	955	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Should it prove necessary, I would be open to considering additional liability-side options, including term tools, in addition to raising the IOER rate, to limit the usage of the overnight facility over time.	96	9
201503	956	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Precisely what the mix will be will depend on the circumstances, which argues for addressing this issue only after we have some experience with the new policy framework.	96	9
201503	957	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, I do not believe that asset sales should be on the table for this purpose, nor do I expect it will be needed in light of the range of available liability-side tools at our disposal.	96	9
201503	958	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Putting asset sales into play could risk that being taken by markets as a signal regarding the overall stance of monetary policy.	96	9
201503	959	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Deliberations surrounding asset sales should be determined on the basis of our overall monetary policy goals and not as a mechanism to fine-tune usage of the overnight facility.	96	9
201503	960	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	96	9
201503	961	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	962	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair?	96	9
201503	963	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201503	964	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	965	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I meant to ask this to President Williams, but now I could maybe ask both Governor Brainard and him, and possibly President Kocherlakota, too.	96	9
201503	966	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the “fairly soon” language, I obviously strongly favor it no matter where we are going, because I do think it is so important, in the absence of a credible commitment to reduce, that we say as much as we can.	96	9
201503	967	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	All three of you, I think, at least at this point, are leaning toward suspension of any cap for the liftoff period—and the language of the revised bullets, I think, carefully refers to “capacity” rather than to “cap.”	96	9
201503	968	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I assume you are all thinking the way Vice Chairman Dudley was, that we begin with the suspension of any cap, and then at some point—	96	9
201503	969	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Vice Chairman Dudley said six weeks, Governor Fischer thought maybe a little bit longer—we would come in and put in a cap so that we would, in fact, reduce the available capacity of the facility fairly soon after it commences policy firming.	96	9
201503	970	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	If you are thinking in those terms, isn’t the way you have all described your preferences actually consistent with the language, if you are assuming that there is a suspension of the cap from the outset?	96	9
201503	971	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thanks.	96	9
201503	972	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I am interested in what your views are on that.	96	9
201503	973	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201503	974	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sure.	96	9
201503	975	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, can I, in answering your question—I feel as if I am a lawyer—go back to our Policy Normalization Principles and Plans from September 17, which states: “During normalization, the Federal Reserve intends to use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility and other supplementary tools as needed to help control the federal funds rate.	96	9
201503	976	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Committee will use an overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility only to the extent necessary and will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.”	96	9
201503	977	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we have already said those things very strongly and very clearly.	96	9
201503	978	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Then, in the new addition, it says that we will “[a]llow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated to support policy implementation.”	96	9
201503	979	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The issue associated with using “fairly soon” is that I think it is, first of all, unnecessary, in view of these very clear existing statements about our intentions and related things.	96	9
201503	980	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is really about this “fairly soon” being interpreted as being in terms of weeks or even a month or two, and having this time dimension when, really, I think our discussion is around the economics of this and what is actually happening with usage.	96	9
201503	981	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I think that there is a way to fix this.	96	9
201503	982	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned that he didn’t have a replacement.	96	9
201503	983	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It could be that we could just have in that first sentence something to the effect of “allow the aggregate capacity of the repo facility to be temporarily elevated as needed to support policy implementation,” or something that may be stronger than that.	96	9
201503	984	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s the “fairly soon” that I think could be misinterpreted, not only in the way you’re talking about, which is just logically lowering it from infinite to $1 trillion or something, but really more a misinterpretation that we are going to bring it back to a low level fairly soon.	96	9
201503	985	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is my concern.	96	9
201503	986	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Can I just say that this exact language of “fairly soon” comes directly from the previous minutes.	96	9
201503	987	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The public, or those interested in this topic, are already familiar with these words.	96	9
201503	988	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And, you know, if we include it, the minutes of this meeting would probably indicate that a number of you have commented on essentially what you mean by “fairly soon.”	96	9
201503	989	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	There would consequently be a little bit more detail in the minutes about what this means.	96	9
201503	990	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think there is a difference between when we actually, in a sense, quasi-vote on something like this and when the minutes just captures the conversation.	96	9
201503	991	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess I read these bullet points as something that we were all coming to an agreement on.	96	9
201503	992	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And maybe I am misinterpreting the discussion.	96	9
201503	993	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	No, I think that is what we wanted.	96	9
201503	994	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I read the minutes, I always just think, does that represent what was said?	96	9
201503	995	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Here you are really looking for us to sign on.	96	9
201503	996	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That is right.	96	9
201503	997	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	96	9
201503	998	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201503	999	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201503	1000	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	1001	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listened to the discussion around the table, I heard a wide range of what “fairly soon” meant being expressed.	96	9
201503	1002	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Dudley talked about six weeks.	96	9
201503	1003	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m happy with six weeks, but I also heard people talk about six months.	96	9
201503	1004	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are pretty big discrepancies in what “fairly soon” would mean.	96	9
201503	1005	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I will offer up again my preferred language, which is more bland than President Fisher would like, but here it is:  “The Committee expects to reduce the available capacity of the facility at an appropriate time after it commences policy firming.”	96	9
201503	1006	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it gets away from, if you are asked a question, what the time frame is.	96	9
201503	1007	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, it depends on the conditions.	96	9
201503	1008	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is what “appropriate” means.	96	9
201503	1009	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I will offer that as a suggestion.	96	9
201503	1010	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	If I could just say on that, I appreciate President Kocherlakota trying to help us get somewhere in the middle.	96	9
201503	1011	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I actually would find that alternative worse than just taking “fairly soon” out, because I am afraid it reverts to this notion we will keep using the ON RRP until we really don’t think we need it any more for any purpose.	96	9
201503	1012	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I like “fairly soon.”	96	9
201503	1013	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see.	96	9
201503	1014	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1015	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s go to the proposed March minutes language and see if we can reach agreement, and there are several issues outstanding.	96	9
201503	1016	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First of all, President Kocherlakota proposed a change in the opening paragraph, in which it says, “the operational approach the FOMC will use,” to “intends to use.”	96	9
201503	1017	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the subsequent sentence, you also proposed replacing “will” with “intends to.”	96	9
201503	1018	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Can I ask, is there anyone who would be unhappy if we change “will” to “intends to” in both places?	96	9
201503	1019	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201503	1020	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1021	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s make that change in both places, from “will” to “intends.”	96	9
201503	1022	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And now we have the final sentence of the third bullet point.	96	9
201503	1023	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On this, we have views on both sides.	96	9
201503	1024	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I guess our options are keep it as is and leave “fairly soon” in, or, I suppose the alternative you would see, Governor Tarullo, would be to remove the sentence entirely?	96	9
201503	1025	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think that is what President Williams proposed.	96	9
201503	1026	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I obviously prefer to keep “fairly soon” in, but I think I would prefer just deleting it to the substitution of “appropriate time.”	96	9
201503	1027	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Deleting the entire sentence.	96	9
201503	1028	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	96	9
201503	1029	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1030	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, let me ask for a show of hands.	96	9
201503	1031	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	How many people prefer leaving the sentence in and keeping it as is?	96	9
201503	1032	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	96	9
201503	1033	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And how many people prefer to get rid of the sentence?	96	9
201503	1034	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	96	9
201503	1035	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with what John said, that we have already said it.	96	9
201503	1036	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	And if we don’t like the “fairly soon,” why not just take the sentence out altogether?	96	9
201503	1037	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I have a two-hander.	96	9
201503	1038	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, go ahead.	96	9
201503	1039	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think, when we make a decision, everybody looks back to every previous decision we have made on it and says, “Aha, they committed to this thing some months ago, which they have somehow left out this time.”	96	9
201503	1040	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	And, the argument was made that we said it when we issued the normalization principles.	96	9
201503	1041	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, this is an augmentation of that policy.	96	9
201503	1042	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	It says explicitly it is something we are adding to those principles.	96	9
201503	1043	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But they do not see that, though, unless we publish the whole thing.	96	9
201503	1044	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That is correct.	96	9
201503	1045	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Why can’t we just reiterate something like, “The Committee expects to use the facility only to the extent and for the duration necessary to.”	96	9
201503	1046	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I mean, why can’t we just leave in that old language, which is, I think, a much more precise characterization of how I think we are deploying this facility.	96	9
201503	1047	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Well, if we are, then I am opposed to the facility, I think, because that suggests, again, that it is going to be used—it is the instrument—which is the direction in which we have been headed.	96	9
201503	1048	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And, I think the “appropriate time” language, or the “as to the extent necessary,” reinforces the sense that it is ON RRP that is going to get us monetary policy control.	96	9
201503	1049	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	That is why I am worried about the language.	96	9
201503	1050	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think that’s your intention, but I’m afraid that is the way it’s going to be read.	96	9
201503	1051	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	That is certainly not.	96	9
201503	1052	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Quite the reverse.	96	9
201503	1053	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	96	9
201503	1054	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	My understanding is the final bullet point is going to be added to what we have already done in the normalization principles.	96	9
201503	1055	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Is that right?	96	9
201503	1056	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I don’t think there is a plan to include the previous normalization principles in the minutes when this appears.	96	9
201503	1057	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So while it says explicitly that it is an augmentation, my guess would be it will appear on its own in the minutes.	96	9
201503	1058	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Well, okay, that is something that maybe we should think about.	96	9
201503	1059	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	But the first part of the last bullet point says will be “temporarily elevated.”	96	9
201503	1060	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Isn’t “temporarily” enough to assuage this?	96	9
201503	1061	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I mean, “temporarily” is telling you that the intention is for it to be elevated for a temporary period—unspecified, I grant you that.	96	9
201503	1062	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Maybe that is enough.	96	9
201503	1063	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	If you go back, President Mester, to the dynamic that I hypothesized, at each meeting it will always seem as though keeping it in place for another meeting is the best way to maintain precision in monetary policy terms, then it can just elongate.	96	9
201503	1064	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And because we can’t make a credible, firm commitment to remove it, for the reasons a lot of people have given, I think it is important to reinforce, in as many ways as we can, that it is going to be temporary.	96	9
201503	1065	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The best way to reinforce that is actually to reduce it, and that will take care of all of these problems.	96	9
201503	1066	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I will confess to concern about how quickly we will get to that point, if we are not being reminded that we have said that we are going to try to get rid of it fairly soon, and I actually regarded the ambiguity as a bit of an advantage here.	96	9
201503	1067	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas?	96	9
201503	1068	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Madam Chair, would it be helpful if perhaps some of the staff offered to think some more, between now and tomorrow morning, about whether there are ways of bridging this gap between the two views?	96	9
201503	1069	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	We may offer up some proposals that may be futile, but at least we will try.	96	9
201503	1070	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Simon, Do you want to give that a shot?	96	9
201503	1071	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	There was six weeks, eight months, and two rate increases.	96	9
201503	1072	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Two or three rate increases, right?	96	9
201503	1073	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Two or three rate increases could be a year.	96	9
201503	1074	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I would like some judgment to be used, which I think Governor Tarullo doesn’t want, but I don’t see how you can do it without asking, “How necessary is it?”	96	9
201503	1075	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It’s clear that we cannot say, “Well, it will help.”	96	9
201503	1076	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It will always help.	96	9
201503	1077	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It will never be totally useless.	96	9
201503	1078	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not good enough.	96	9
201503	1079	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	There’s got to be a positive value to getting rid of it.	96	9
201503	1080	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That leaves you as wanting to keep this?	96	9
201503	1081	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, keep this for some time.	96	9
201503	1082	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I can live with “fairly soon” and so forth.	96	9
201503	1083	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1084	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas, if you think there’s a chance you could come up with some language, why don’t we defer until tomorrow?	96	9
201503	1085	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	All right.	96	9
201503	1086	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Tomorrow, first thing.	96	9
201503	1087	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I would say that’s fine.	96	9
201503	1088	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The quality of what we come up with might be variable, though.	96	9
201503	1089	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1090	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	It was pretty evenly divided.	96	9
201503	1091	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I’d emphasize that it says “the Committee expects.”	96	9
201503	1092	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	It’s not “intends,” it’s “expects.”	96	9
201503	1093	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	What was the total number of votes?	96	9
201503	1094	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I had the sense that we had more than 10 voting on that one.	96	9
201503	1095	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think I counted, one more person in favor of keeping it than removing it.	96	9
201503	1096	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In this instance, remember that the minutes will note, just like with the normalization principles, that this is a straw poll among participants.	96	9
201503	1097	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	96	9
201503	1098	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Right, yes.	96	9
201503	1099	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	96	9
201503	1100	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, the second sentence in the third bullet doesn’t make sense to me.	96	9
201503	1101	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think it may be used to be a bullet and then got moved to become part of the sentence.	96	9
201503	1102	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	If we’re going to redo this, why don’t we also redo that?	96	9
201503	1103	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I didn’t know we were going to get so precise on the language of the minutes.	96	9
201503	1104	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	You mean actually worry about grammar?	96	9
201503	1105	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	What’s wrong with the second sentence?	96	9
201503	1106	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	“Adjust the IOER ..	96	9
201503	1107	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	It is not a sentence.	96	9
201503	1108	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	“Rate.”	96	9
201503	1109	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It is all written that way.	96	9
201503	1110	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	That would be fine if it was a bullet.	96	9
201503	1111	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	This is a continuation of “intends to adjust.”	96	9
201503	1112	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	“Intends to” is there.	96	9
201503	1113	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Fix the grammar, right.	96	9
201503	1114	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1115	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll come back to this tomorrow.	96	9
201503	1116	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see if we can resolve the final issue that we need to today, which concerns the resolutions on term RRP testing.	96	9
201503	1117	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	If you have the sheet with options 1 and 2 in front of you, option 2 at the bottom is the one that would authorize term RRP testing over quarter-ends for the remainder of the year.	96	9
201503	1118	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Not everyone weighed in on that, but I did hear during our go-round a considerable amount of support to approve authorizing testing through year-end.	96	9
201503	1119	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Would anyone like to comment on that?	96	9
201503	1120	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201503	1121	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I have a question, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	1122	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201503	1123	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t understand.	96	9
201503	1124	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Suppose we temporarily suspend the cap, and we decide to lift off at one of these quarter-ends.	96	9
201503	1125	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Is this an authorization to also do term RRP at that quarter-end, and would we make that decision intentionally at that point?	96	9
201503	1126	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Or is this testing that simply would take place whether or not we’ve got unlimited overnight RRPs?	96	9
201503	1127	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We would look at the circumstances.	96	9
201503	1128	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We would contact the Chair.	96	9
201503	1129	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	The Chair would decide on the terms, and we would be informing you.	96	9
201503	1130	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	You would have the chance, as always, to object to any operations that we do.	96	9
201503	1131	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We’re just putting the authorization in place, as Lorie tried to explain.	96	9
201503	1132	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Whether we would necessarily use that capacity would depend a lot on the situation we’re in.	96	9
201503	1133	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	We make the announcements that the term transactions are going to take place at the beginning of the month, which would be before the meeting, but if you lifted the cap, we could run very small operations on the dates we had already announced or have a very low cap to adjust for what you’ve decided.	96	9
201503	1134	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	But if you don’t end up lifting off at that meeting, we would conduct them as we have been.	96	9
201503	1135	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	We would continue to make the announcement at the beginning of the month that they would take place on certain dates, but we may adjust the sizes based on the decision you make at the meeting.	96	9
201503	1136	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I want to make sure I understand.	96	9
201503	1137	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We’re going to announce these at the beginning, but we don’t announce the amounts at the beginning of the month?	96	9
201503	1138	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We would have announced, and we would say “up to” and give them the provisional schedule.	96	9
201503	1139	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Right.	96	9
201503	1140	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We’re committing before the meeting.	96	9
201503	1141	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	The meeting doesn’t take place at the beginning of the month.	96	9
201503	1142	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	Right, but we would do the “up to,” and markets would be comfortable with us adjusting those once they have known the decision at the meeting.	96	9
201503	1143	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We could do zero.	96	9
201503	1144	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	We could, or for credibility purposes, we may want to run them in very small amounts just because we committed to running something on a date.	96	9
201503	1145	2015-03-18	meeting	LOGAN	You could cancel them, but I don’t see it would be a large cost for just holding a very small term operation.	96	9
201503	1146	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We could also run them at the same rate as the overnight RRP, and if people want to use it, they could at that point.	96	9
201503	1147	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	There’s a lot of flexibility.	96	9
201503	1148	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Actually, it would be at some point quite nice to say we said “up to,” but then have an operation that’s smaller than that and just indicate that it is flexible in that way.	96	9
201503	1149	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any further comments?	96	9
201503	1150	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	May I just add one thing?	96	9
201503	1151	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	If you preannounce that you’re going to waive the cap, which I don’t think we should do—	96	9
201503	1152	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I thought we weren’t going to do that.	96	9
201503	1153	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I thought the plan was that we would not preannounce waiving the cap.	96	9
201503	1154	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Judging what was said today, you would be announcing that at a meeting at which liftoff happens.	96	9
201503	1155	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We would announce it.	96	9
201503	1156	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	At the meeting.	96	9
201503	1157	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Okay.	96	9
201503	1158	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	All right.	96	9
201503	1159	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	One-day preannouncement.	96	9
201503	1160	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201503	1161	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As I noted earlier, I’m going to decline to support term testing.	96	9
201503	1162	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1163	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Then let me put forward option 2 testing of authorizing term RRPs at quarter-ends through the end of the year.	96	9
201503	1164	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Do we need to vote on this?	96	9
201503	1165	2015-03-18	meeting	LUECKE	It is a Committee vote.	96	9
201503	1166	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1167	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	This is a formal vote.	96	9
201503	1168	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor.	96	9
201503	1169	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	96	9
201503	1170	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	All opposed.	96	9
201503	1171	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	96	9
201503	1172	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	1173	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Option 2 carries, and we will return tomorrow morning to the bullets and see where we are on that.	96	9
201503	1174	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	1175	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201503	1176	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to offer a suggestion, which is costless for me, as you’ll hear, but right now it seems like the fact that the press conference meetings are taking place so close to quarter-end is a cost in terms of Committee decisionmaking.	96	9
201503	1177	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is a chance that liftoff will not take place until 2016.	96	9
201503	1178	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you and the staff think about scheduling meetings for 2016, I think this is a reason to potentially move meeting dates so that they’re not two weeks before quarter-end.	96	9
201503	1179	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really hard to do, given all the other things around the world that are set up.	96	9
201503	1180	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Incredibly difficult.	96	9
201503	1181	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m just offering it as an observation.	96	9
201503	1182	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In an ideal world you might be right, but I think it’s really hard to do.	96	9
201503	1183	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I mentioned along with the observation, it’s absolutely costless for me.	96	9
201503	1184	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	96	9
201503	1185	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We will keep that in mind.	96	9
201503	1186	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	No promises.	96	9
201503	1187	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201503	1188	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201503	1189	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The Board meeting has just ended.	2	2
201503	1190	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move to our next agenda item, and I am going to call on Steve Kamin to begin.	11	1
201503	1191	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	As we did in January, David and I will be switching positions in the order, in light of the prominent role of international developments in jerking around the US economy.	11	1
201503	1192	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the materials titled “The International Outlook.”	11	1
201503	1193	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 1 of that exhibit, our projection of total foreign GDP growth— the black solid line—is not much changed from the January Tealbook.	11	1
201503	1194	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, the outlook is a little weaker in the next few quarters.	11	1
201503	1195	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	The fall in oil prices looks to be taking a greater toll on Canada’s economy than we initially reckoned, and we now believe Brazil will sink a bit further into its morass before finally emerging.	11	1
201503	1196	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, data for China and Korea came in weaker than we’d expected.	11	1
201503	1197	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But we are still looking for total foreign economic growth to rise to 3 percent, roughly its trend pace, by the end of this year, supported by continued monetary accommodation abroad, still-low energy prices, and currency depreciations against the dollar.	11	1
201503	1198	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	The recovery of the euro area, shown in panel 2, is a big part of the firming in aggregate foreign growth.	11	1
201503	1199	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We’ve nudged up our euro-area forecast since January.	11	1
201503	1200	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Part of this reflects the ECB’s quantitative easing program, which was announced just after we put the January Tealbook to bed, and was more aggressive than we had anticipated at that time.	11	1
201503	1201	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, both fourth-quarter GDP growth of 1.3 percent and more recent readings on production, sentiment, and consumer spending have exceeded our expectations.	11	1
201503	1202	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, if nothing bad happens, the euro area may well be on track to reduce its resource slack and add to global demand over the next several years.	11	1
201503	1203	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Unfortunately, that is a pretty big “if.”	11	1
201503	1204	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Right now, the Greek government is running out of money and is in difficult talks with its European creditors on an infusion of new funds to avoid defaulting on debt payments coming due soon.	11	1
201503	1205	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Even if Greece secures this near-term financing, it still must negotiate a new multiyear assistance and reform package to keep it afloat over the longer term.	11	1
201503	1206	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Failure of these talks could lead to a default on the government’s debt, the loss of ECB support for the Greek banking system, and, potentially, Greece’s exit from the euro area.	11	1
201503	1207	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	With the stakes being so high, we assume the two sides will eventually reach agreement.	11	1
201503	1208	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	During the interim, however, brinkmanship amid very tough negotiations will likely cause periodic flare-ups in financial stress that will weigh on the euro-area economy.	11	1
201503	1209	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	So far, markets other than that of Greece have been remarkably complacent, perhaps because they assume that Europe’s strengthened firewalls, together with the ECB’s new government bond-buying program and European banks’ reduced exposure to Greece, will suppress any spillovers from a Greek exit.	11	1
201503	1210	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But we expect that complacency to erode as Greece steps closer to the cliff and investors give more thought to some of the catastrophic risks described in an alternative simulation in this month’s Tealbook.	11	1
201503	1211	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Beyond Greece and the outlook for foreign economic growth more generally, a number of global developments are exerting an unusually large influence on the US economy.	11	1
201503	1212	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Our near-term forecast for Brent oil prices, shown in panel 3, moved up about $10 per barrel since the time of the January Tealbook, as sharp declines in rig counts reinforced expectations that oil production would decelerate.	11	1
201503	1213	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Since we put the March Tealbook to bed, spot Brent oil prices have fallen back toward their January lows (not shown) as market participants focused on growing inventories.	11	1
201503	1214	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	All told, these prices remain very low, boosting prospects for economic growth here and abroad and, as shown in panel 4, depressing already low headline inflation rates.	11	1
201503	1215	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We have inflation moving back up as the pass-through of previous declines in oil prices wane.	11	1
201503	1216	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	In principle, central banks should see through such transitory dips in inflation.	11	1
201503	1217	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But concerns that falling inflation would destabilize inflation expectations have led several central bank to ease policy in recent months, including the Bank of Japan and the ECB.	11	1
201503	1218	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	The ECB’s decisions, in turn, have prompted a rush of rate cuts—including to below zero—in neighboring countries seeking to avoid appreciation of their currencies.	11	1
201503	1219	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Low prices for oil and other commodities have led the central banks of several commodity exporters, such as Canada and Australia, to provide greater monetary accommodation.	11	1
201503	1220	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, a number of emerging market countries, notably China, loosened policy in response to varying combinations of weak data and falling inflation.	11	1
201503	1221	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 5 provides a crude summary measure of foreign monetary policy actions in recent years.	11	1
201503	1222	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	For 37 countries, any monetary policy action—be it a rate change, change in reserve requirements, or asset purchases—is assigned a plus-one (+1) for a tightening and a minus-one (-1) for a loosening.	11	1
201503	1223	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	These are then aggregated across countries, and the cumulative policy changes are displayed over time.	11	1
201503	1224	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	By this admittedly crude measure, from late 2011 through 2013, foreign monetary conditions became steadily more accommodative, then they leveled off for a spell but, since last summer, have become still easier.	11	1
201503	1225	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Monetary easing abroad exerts a number of influences on the US economy.	11	1
201503	1226	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	First, and perhaps most prominently, it pushes up the dollar, which would tend to contract US exports and production.	11	1
201503	1227	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, the combination of continued relatively robust readings on the US economy, mounting anticipations of Fed liftoff, and actions by foreign central banks have pushed the broad real dollar exchange rate—the black line—up some 4 percent since the time of the January Tealbook.	11	1
201503	1228	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Going forward, we have come to believe that a continuing market focus on prospective divergences in the prospects for monetary policy here and abroad, combined with ongoing anxieties about foreign economies, will push the dollar up further over the rest of this year.	11	1
201503	1229	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Our hope is that by capitulating to the trend of recent months and actually predicting additional appreciation, we will cause the dollar to finally top out and start moving downward.	11	1
201503	1230	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But, assuming our forecast actually materializes, the broad real dollar, measured over the duration of the forecast period, will average 6¼ percent above its level in the January Tealbook.	11	1
201503	1231	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	This is a historically outsized revision to our projection.	11	1
201503	1232	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, I will agree in advance that, in view of current market dynamics, there is a plausible risk that the dollar may rise considerably higher than we are predicting.	11	1
201503	1233	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	While, as David will discuss, the higher dollar exerts appreciable drag on the US economic outlook, foreign monetary easing has positive spillovers to the United States through two other channels:  It raises demand abroad, thus boosting our exports, and it lowers US bond yields, thus boosting our domestic demand.	11	1
201503	1234	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	To focus a bit more on this latter channel, panel 7 shows that major economy yields have long been well correlated, and the rundown in these yields since the beginning of 2014 is no exception.	11	1
201503	1235	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	A note circulated to the Committee last week reviews some of the reasons for the simultaneous decline.	11	1
201503	1236	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	First, yields here and abroad may be responding to common factors, such as fears of secular stagnation or heightened demand for safe assets in response to recent regulatory initiatives.	11	1
201503	1237	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Second, investors may worry that weakness abroad may directly restrain the US economy, leading to lower growth, inflation, and thus bond yields.	11	1
201503	1238	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Third, anxiety about tail risks abroad—Greek exit or a hard landing in China, as well as anxieties about the global outlook more generally—may be fueling safe-haven demand for US Treasury securities and depressing our term premiums.	11	1
201503	1239	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, and looping back to the beginning of this discussion, lower interest rates abroad may be encouraging investors to switch to higher-yielding US assets, thus depressing our term premiums through portfolio-balance channels.	11	1
201503	1240	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	These explanations for the low level of US yields may all be valid to some extent, but they have different implications for the future path of yields, the dollar, and monetary policy.	11	1
201503	1241	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	If term premiums and yields are low because of portfolio- balance spillovers from accommodative foreign monetary policies, those effects are likely to depress US yields for several years; all else being equal, unless a further rise in the dollar fully offsets the stimulus from these lower yields, the Fed’s policy rate may have to rise faster to achieve the desired tightening of US financial conditions.	11	1
201503	1242	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Conversely, if low yields reflect worries about the foreign outlook and those worries turn out to be well founded, Federal Reserve policy may need to be looser in response.	11	1
201503	1243	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, a more complicated and ambiguous case is posed if our relatively benign baseline forecast for the global economy materializes and risk events pass quietly:  Longer-term yields in the United States and elsewhere may rise quickly as risk premiums unwind, which would call for easier Federal Reserve policy, but sentiment might improve and the dollar could fall, which would call for tighter policy.	11	1
201503	1244	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	In light of our uncertainties regarding the relative strength of the factors pushing down US yields at present, we will be watching global financial markets very carefully for clues about future developments.	11	1
201503	1245	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201503	1246	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the exhibit creatively titled “Material for the US Outlook.”	11	1
201503	1247	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	At long last, I’m finally going to take a leaf out of all of your books and declare that our forecast hasn’t changed all that much since either January or December.	11	1
201503	1248	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Part of the reason I’m going to say that is that, as I’ll show, it happens to be more or less partly true.	11	1
201503	1249	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The small revisions that we’ve made to the domestic outlook lately mostly reflect the surprising extent of the appreciation of the dollar and the plunge in oil prices.	11	1
201503	1250	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The stronger dollar causes us to trim a little out of our forecast for the growth of real GDP over the next few years, while the steeper net drop in oil prices than we’d expected as of the December meeting put a bigger dent in near-term topline PCE inflation; that said, core PCE inflation has been running below forecast, too.	11	1
201503	1251	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	While we haven’t yet seen fit to alter our baseline forecast for the longer-term trajectory of inflation, we are keeping a close eye on a few shreds of evidence suggesting that longer-term inflation expectations may have crept down some in recent years.	11	1
201503	1252	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Turning to the specifics:  The labor market seems to have been on a stronger course than we anticipated in January.	11	1
201503	1253	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Average monthly job gains as measured in the establishment survey have been running about 50,000 per month stronger than we had expected.	11	1
201503	1254	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Although the unemployment rate in February was one-tenth higher than we projected, the employment-to-population ratio—which we think is giving a better fix on labor market slack at present—came in a few basis points higher than we had forecast as a result of slightly better-than-expected labor force participation.	11	1
201503	1255	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, the news outside the labor market has not been as favorable.	11	1
201503	1256	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	For one, the recent indicators of GDP have been disappointing on the whole.	11	1
201503	1257	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	A good chunk of the shortfall relative to expectations has been in net exports.	11	1
201503	1258	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	But given the appreciation of the dollar, we are more cautious than we normally would be about writing that development off as transitory.	11	1
201503	1259	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The most recent news about consumer spending has been mixed, with the QSS pointing to another bump up in medical care spending in the fourth quarter.	11	1
201503	1260	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	But the weak path of retail sales now estimated for the past three months is a little puzzling, at best.	11	1
201503	1261	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, yesterday’s industrial production release was pretty drab, with manufacturing production estimated to have posted another small decline in February, and the figures for December and January were revised down.	11	1
201503	1262	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	All told, manufacturing IP now looks to be on track for zero growth in the first quarter.	11	1
201503	1263	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	This morning’s data on housing starts and permits were pretty bleak on their face, with single-family starts and permits both posting large declines in February—considerably underperforming relative to our expectations that they would roughly tread water in the near term.	11	1
201503	1264	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Adverse weather is the easy explanation, and, indeed, it probably helps to explain some of the recent weakness in a range of these indicators, but we had been watching our weather metrics carefully and had not anticipated very substantial effects.	11	1
201503	1265	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	As shown by the black dot in panel 2, we now estimate real GDP growth in the first quarter of 1¼ percent, and that was prior to the news on housing starts and permits.	11	1
201503	1266	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Folding in that news from the housing market, we’d take another tenth or so out of that estimate, and similarly for the second quarter.	11	1
201503	1267	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	To be sure, the confidence interval around our estimate, even for the quarter just concluding, is astonishingly wide, but I would hasten to point out that the risk is two-sided.	11	1
201503	1268	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Altogether, the labor market looks to have been at least as strong as we had anticipated, and perhaps a little stronger, while the near-term GDP picture has been disappointing.	11	1
201503	1269	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	In the Tealbook, we reconciled these two developments by marking down structural productivity in history by enough to leave our estimate of the output gap roughly unrevised in the current quarter.	11	1
201503	1270	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 3 gives you a broader perspective on the issue of slack by providing updated estimates of three different measures of resource utilization gaps that we follow.	11	1
201503	1271	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The dotted blue line shows the judgmental estimate that is reflected in the Tealbook baseline.	11	1
201503	1272	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The red line shows the production function version of the output gap as estimated in EDO, one of the DSGE models that we maintain at the Board.	11	1
201503	1273	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, the black line—labeled FRB/US—plots an estimate of slack that combines the information from a variety of production, income, labor market, and price indicators, while explicitly allowing for measurement error.	11	1
201503	1274	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The Tealbook and EDO models’ point estimates suggest that resource utilization has nearly recovered to its sustainable position, while the FRB/US measure suggests that it’s already there.	11	1
201503	1275	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Reverting to panel 1, you may be a little puzzled to see the unemployment rate revised up by such a slight amount, in view of our more-guarded outlook for the path of real output.	11	1
201503	1276	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The reason for the small revision to the unemployment rate is that we extrapolated forward the slower pace of structural productivity growth to the tune of 0.1 percentage point per year.	11	1
201503	1277	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	At the margin, this revised assumption will allow a given amount of real GDP growth to generate a slightly greater amount of labor market improvement and thus is designed to better center the baseline forecast in light of the persistent misses on the unemployment rate that we’ve had during the past couple of years.	11	1
201503	1278	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	If we had left our supply-side assumptions unchanged in this projection, the unemployment rate would have revised up another 0.2 percentage point or so over the medium term.	11	1
201503	1279	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	I should also briefly mention our deliberations over two other assumptions that we use to calibrate the longer-term forecast.	11	1
201503	1280	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	First, we revised down our estimate of the long-term equilibrium funds rate by ¼ percentage point.	11	1
201503	1281	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	As was reflected in the discussion we provided in the Tealbook, the confidence intervals surrounding this parameter are a mile wide, but we view the lower rate as better balancing the risks in light of our judgment that probably not all of the extraordinarily low level of long- term rates around the globe reflects low term premiums, and that lower equilibrium interest rates may have been playing a larger role in driving the downtrend in recent years than we previously thought.	11	1
201503	1282	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	We also debated whether to lower our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment from its current level of 5¼ percent, which is the same level that we think prevailed just prior to the Great Recession.	11	1
201503	1283	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	At least two factors militated toward making such a downward revision.	11	1
201503	1284	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	First, younger workers tend to have higher unemployment rates, and since the eve of the financial crisis and recession, the share of these workers in the labor force has declined.	11	1
201503	1285	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Second, workers at the margin of moving onto disability rolls also tend to have higher unemployment rates, and the number of individuals reporting themselves as out of the labor force because of a disability has increased significantly since 2007.	11	1
201503	1286	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	However, moving to assume that the natural rate is lower now than we think it was before the recession felt distinctly uncomfortable, especially in view of the historically large increase in permanent job losers, the fact that the long-term unemployed still make up an unusually large share of overall unemployment, and the suggestive evidence that matching in the labor market may still not be as efficient as it was before the crisis.	11	1
201503	1287	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Furthermore, in light of how flat we think the Phillips curve is, wage and price inflation are doomed not to be very informative in this regard.	11	1
201503	1288	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, we think we’ve probably had some tendency in the past to adjust our estimate of the natural rate to hew too closely to movements in the actual rate of unemployment.	11	1
201503	1289	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	In the end, after many hours of debate, we left our assumption unchanged at 5.2 percent, though with no pretense of having settled the issue.	11	1
201503	1290	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 4 and 5 summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201503	1291	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 4, the recent upturn in crude oil prices that Steve discussed led us to temper the decline in headline PCE inflation that we are projecting for the current quarter, relative to our January projection.	11	1
201503	1292	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	However, as you can see from panel 5, core PCE inflation has come in softer than we expected in January.	11	1
201503	1293	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Most of this miss was attributable to lower-than- expected medical services and core goods prices; because we don’t expect medical services prices to continue to surprise to the downside and we continue to expect that goods price inflation will pick up as import prices accelerate, we did not carry forward the downward surprise to core inflation beyond the near term.	11	1
201503	1294	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Over the remainder of the medium term, the inflation forecast is essentially the same as in recent Tealbooks, featuring a slow upward creep back toward your 2 percent objective.	11	1
201503	1295	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The staff’s medium-term inflation forecast is predicated on the assumption that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored—an assumption that we have maintained in the latest projection.	11	1
201503	1296	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Given the central role of inflation expectations in our analytical framework, we have been keeping our eyes peeled for evidence that those expectations might be starting to come unmoored, either on the upside or on the downside.	11	1
201503	1297	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 6 presents some data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters that we found a little disquieting in that regard.	11	1
201503	1298	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The black line shows the SPF’s median 10-year average expected inflation rate for headline PCE price inflation.	11	1
201503	1299	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	This measure, like the Michigan survey’s long-term expected inflation measure, has remained pretty flat in recent years.	11	1
201503	1300	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	However, as shown by the red line, the SPF long-term CPI projection has moved down more noticeably in recent years and most recently has dipped to 2.1 percent, its lowest level ever.	11	1
201503	1301	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, we are not inclined to view this development as persuasive evidence that longer-term inflation expectations are starting to deteriorate.	11	1
201503	1302	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	First, the most recent decline appears to reflect the change in the composition of the survey panel; holding the panel’s composition constant, the first-quarter median response for the CPI forecast would have remained at 2.2 percent.	11	1
201503	1303	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Second, a measure that focuses on CPI expectations 6 to 10 years ahead has declined less over the past few years; we would expect that respondents’ projections over this horizon would probably give us a better read on what they view as inflation’s longer-term anchor.	11	1
201503	1304	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Third, this discussion is putting a fine point on small changes in the expectations of professional forecasters, who are not, after all, the people setting wages and prices throughout the economy.	11	1
201503	1305	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	But, by the same token, we are wary of taking too much comfort from the stability in the PCE responses because it could be that the professional forecasters are reluctant to be seen as betting quite so overtly against your 2 percent objective.	11	1
201503	1306	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	All told, we will certainly be keeping a close eye on these and other measures of inflation expectations going forward.	11	1
201503	1307	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Don will continue.	11	1
201503	1308	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201503	1309	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 1 shows the broad trajectories of your forecasts under your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201503	1310	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The top panel shows that most of you project that real GDP will grow somewhat faster in 2015 and 2016 than over the longer run, and at or near its longer-run rate in 2017.	11	1
201503	1311	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Most of you project that the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, will continue to decline through 2016, and all of you project that, by the fourth quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate will be at or below your individual judgments of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	11	1
201503	1312	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As shown in the third panel, headline PCE inflation is projected to decline this year but rise notably next year; all but four of you project that headline inflation will be equal to or within 0.1 percentage point of its goal by the end of 2017, and only one participant projects that inflation will deviate by more than 0.2 percentage point.	11	1
201503	1313	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Much of the movement in headline inflation from 2014 to 2015 and from 2015 to 2016 reflects swings in food and energy prices, inasmuch as the final panel indicates only a slight decline in core PCE inflation this year and a gradual rise over the remainder of the forecast period.	11	1
201503	1314	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the December Summary of Economic Projections and the March Tealbook.	11	1
201503	1315	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As noted in the top panel, most of you marked down your forecasts of real GDP growth over the forecast period.	11	1
201503	1316	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Many of you cited the appreciation of the dollar and recent weakness in spending data as reasons for those revisions.	11	1
201503	1317	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Even so, as shown in the second panel, the central tendencies of your forecasts for the unemployment rate shifted down by roughly 0.1 percentage point throughout the forecast period, with many of you noting the greater-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate in recent months.	11	1
201503	1318	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	More than half of you also lowered your projections for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, with the central tendency about 0.2 percentage point lower at 5.0 to 5.2 percent.	11	1
201503	1319	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Consequently, only one of you now projects that the unemployment rate will go below its longer-run normal level by more than 0.2 percentage point, down from six in December.	11	1
201503	1320	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As the bottom panels indicate, all of you marked down your projections for headline and core PCE inflation this year, and about half of you revised down your projection of core PCE inflation in 2016 by 0.2 percentage point or more, citing soft inflation data in recent months and declines in commodity and import prices.	11	1
201503	1321	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The Tealbook forecasts for economic growth and inflation are near the bottom of your central tendencies over the projection period, while the staff’s projections for the unemployment rate are about at the upper end of your central tendencies over the projection period.	11	1
201503	1322	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the quarter in which you currently judge that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate and of the economic conditions you anticipate at that time.	11	1
201503	1323	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As shown in the top panel, a majority of you view the second or third quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of liftoff.	11	1
201503	1324	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	More than half of you have pushed back your likely time of liftoff by one quarter since December, with many citing the fact that inflation continues to run well below target.	11	1
201503	1325	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The bottom-left panel plots your views on the unemployment rate and core inflation at the time of liftoff.	11	1
201503	1326	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As shown in the plot, your projections for the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff range mostly between 5.2 and 5.4 percent, while your core inflation projections are mostly clustered between 1.1 and 1.4 percent.	11	1
201503	1327	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Compared with the December scatterplot shown to the right, you now expect liftoff to occur when core inflation is about 0.4 percentage point lower and when the unemployment rate is about 0.2 percentage point lower than you envisioned in December.	11	1
201503	1328	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	All but three of you project that the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff will still be above its longer-run normal level, and all but one of you project that core inflation at liftoff will be well below the Committee’s longer-run objective for headline inflation of 2 percent.	11	1
201503	1329	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	However, all of you project that the unemployment rate will move to or near its long-run level at the end of 2016, and all but one of you project that inflation will be much closer to 2 percent by the end of 2016 than at the time you project lifting off.	11	1
201503	1330	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Exhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201503	1331	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The median funds rate projection now stands at 0.63 percent at the end of 2015, 1.88 percent at the end of 2016, and 3.13 percent at the end of 2017.	11	1
201503	1332	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	A sizable majority of you revised down your view of the appropriate federal funds rate throughout the forecast period, though, in many cases, by modest amounts.	11	1
201503	1333	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The median projections declined by 50 basis points in 2015, 62 basis points in 2016, and 50 basis points in 2017.	11	1
201503	1334	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Several of you expressed a preference for a more gradual removal of policy accommodation after liftoff than you had projected in December, citing uncertainties regarding the inflation outlook and the longer-run values of the unemployment rate and the equilibrium real rate; still-present headwinds, including the weaker global economic outlook; and uncertainty about the economy’s response to policy normalization after a prolonged period with the policy rate at its effective lower bound.	11	1
201503	1335	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Seven of you also revised down your projection of the longer-run nominal federal funds rate, typically by 25 basis points.	11	1
201503	1336	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Though the median is unchanged, the central tendency narrowed from 3.5 to 4 percent in December to 3.5 to 3.75 percent now.	11	1
201503	1337	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	A large majority of you project that, at the end of the year in which you first see the unemployment rate at or close to your estimate of its longer- run normal level and inflation at or close to 2 percent, the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will remain below your individual judgment of its longer-run level.	11	1
201503	1338	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	This supports the last sentence in the draft FOMC statements, which says that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.	11	1
201503	1339	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As in December, all of you project levels of the federal funds rate over the next couple of years that are below the prescriptions of a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule given your projections for core inflation and other economic variables, indicating that you do not see the Taylor rule as likely to prescribe appropriate policy for the next few years.	11	1
201503	1340	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The medians of these prescriptions, plotted as red diamonds, and the central tendencies, plotted as whiskers, have shifted down since December.	11	1
201503	1341	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	For 2015, the gap between your projections and the rule’s prescriptions has narrowed slightly, on average, primarily reflecting the rule’s response to the downward revision in your core inflation projections; in 2016 and 2017, this gap is marginally wider, on average, than it was in December.	11	1
201503	1342	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	The final exhibit shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201503	1343	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As shown in the figures to the left, most of you continue to judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average level over the past 20 years.	11	1
201503	1344	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As shown in the panels to the right, most of you continue to see the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, though one more of you now views risks to growth as weighted to the downside.	11	1
201503	1345	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	As reported in the third and fourth panels on the right, eight of you now see risks to inflation as balanced, while another eight see those risks as weighted to the downside.	11	1
201503	1346	2015-03-18	meeting	KIM	Recent declines in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar were noted as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than currently embedded in your forecasts.	11	1
201503	1347	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	12	1
201503	1348	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201503	1349	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Steve, in your projections of the paths of real dollar indexes, what assumption have you made on Chinese foreign exchange policies?	12	1
201503	1350	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We’re assuming that China’s exchange rate is flat through the end of the year.	12	1
201503	1351	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Flat?	12	1
201503	1352	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Against the dollar?	12	1
201503	1353	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Flat against the dollar for the remainder of the year, and then, after that, they allow it to again start appreciating at a very slow, around 2 percent, pace.	12	1
201503	1354	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Relative to the dollar?	12	1
201503	1355	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Again, relative to the dollar.	12	1
201503	1356	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	As you’re thinking it through, the effect so far has been that even though they have actually allowed their renminbi to depreciate slightly against the dollar—very, very minimally, as Simon is using finger language to point out—over the past six months, because the dollar has been rising against most other currencies, the RMB also has been rising.	12	1
201503	1357	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Our view is that, at a minimum, they’ll continue to depreciate it very slightly further, but our working assumption in our projection is to keep it flat until the end of the year.	12	1
201503	1358	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But if one believed that they were likely to adjust their policy so as to continue to have renminbi appreciation on a global trade-weighted basis, but to depreciate somewhat against the dollar, would that change, in a nontrivial way, the projections of real dollar indexes?	12	1
201503	1359	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12	1
201503	1360	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Let’s put it this way.	12	1
201503	1361	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	They’ve already been doing appreciation, but if they basically wanted less broad, real trade-weighted appreciation than they have now been getting, then, if the dollar continued to rise at its previous pace, they would have to depreciate against the dollar more strongly in order to make that happen.	12	1
201503	1362	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Right now their trade-weighted RMB has appreciated very strongly because they’re following the dollar up.	12	1
201503	1363	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	They’ve moved up their fix, and the trading band has widened.	12	1
201503	1364	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	One choice would be to widen that trading band and just let the CNY trade at the top part of that.	12	1
201503	1365	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Remember, it’s not a convertible currency.	12	1
201503	1366	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Right, exactly.	12	1
201503	1367	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	If you were thinking that somehow they wanted to go back to a balancing trend, they’re actually already doing that in a big way, but just not deliberately.	12	1
201503	1368	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Lael, do you want to follow up?	12	1
201503	1369	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	To the extent that they widen the band because it’s already up at the top of the band and they slow, essentially, the rate of appreciation against the world, how much does that matter to us in terms of our trade, and how much does that affect our GDP forecast?	12	1
201503	1370	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	It could be material because China accounts for about 20 percent of our trade-weighted dollar, and so a reasonably large change in the pace at which the RMB moves against the dollar would, indeed, have important implications for the overall value of the dollar.	12	1
201503	1371	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Now, I will say that the very small depreciation of the RMB against the dollar that they’ve been doing lately, as well as the relatively small appreciation of the RMB against the dollar that had been taking place in previous periods, are all very much second order compared with the dollar’s movements against other currencies, like the euro and others.	12	1
201503	1372	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	For plausible changes in the rate in which they would change the RMB’s value against the dollar, it might not make much of a difference, but if they wanted to make some big changes, then it certainly could have material implications.	12	1
201503	1373	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201503	1374	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Just trying to understand, I am never quite sure which way is up with dollar indexes.	12	1
201503	1375	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	A 30 percent gap has opened up between the emerging market economies and the advanced foreign economies.	12	1
201503	1376	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	What does that mean?	12	1
201503	1377	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That the advanced foreign economies have depreciated by 30 percent against the emerging market economies?	12	1
201503	1378	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12	1
201503	1379	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Basically, the foreign industrial countries have depreciated against the dollar more than have the emerging market currencies.	12	1
201503	1380	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Therefore, the AFE currencies must have depreciated relative to the emerging market currencies.	12	1
201503	1381	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Japan and the euro area have depreciated a lot in the past year.	12	1
201503	1382	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The emerging market economies, relative to us, still look more or less where they’ve been for the past five, six years?	12	1
201503	1383	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Well, harkening back to our earlier discussion, first of all, one of the reasons why the aggregate of EME currencies has not changed so much is because China is in the aggregate.	12	1
201503	1384	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	China is about 20 percent of the trade-weighted dollar.	12	1
201503	1385	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	EMEs are around, if memory serves, 55 percent of the trade-weighted dollar.	12	1
201503	1386	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	China accounts for a big hunk of the EME aggregate, and, therefore, when you look at non-China EME currencies, they’ve moved much more.	12	1
201503	1387	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	They’ve depreciated much more against the dollar than you would see just from that picture.	12	1
201503	1388	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Right.	12	1
201503	1389	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Then the other question was for David.	12	1
201503	1390	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	David, I’m never quite sure when there’s a move in the mean of some expectation.	12	1
201503	1391	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	For example, for the average expected CPI inflation for the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was 3.3 percent in 1995, and it is now approaching 2 percent.	12	1
201503	1392	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	You look at the rate of change, and one could look at the level.	12	1
201503	1393	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not quite sure.	12	1
201503	1394	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	What makes you look at the rate of change?	12	1
201503	1395	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Part of why we’re looking at the profile of responses is because an important touchstone of our projection has been that inflation expectations are anchored.	12	1
201503	1396	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	That’s been our statement, full stop.	12	1
201503	1397	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve maintained that assumption in this current projection, and we feel obligated to be vigilant—to be on the lookout for evidence that could call that into question.	12	1
201503	1398	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The CPI responses haven’t yet caused us to throw in the towel on that touchstone we used to construct the expectation, but it’s not going to take a lot more downward movement there to relent on that story or begin to qualify it more seriously than we have.	12	1
201503	1399	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The level isn’t particularly worrisome at this point, though I think one could have a vigorous conversation about that—well, so let’s have that conversation for just a second.	12	1
201503	1400	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	For these professional forecasters, suppose it’s really the CPI forecast that matters for their clients’ interests.	12	1
201503	1401	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Historically, a more normal spread between the CPI and the PCE index has been something more in the neighborhood of 30 basis points than 10.	12	1
201503	1402	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	If you took that historical average spread from the 2.1 percent that they’re currently reporting, you’d have something that’s in the neighborhood of 1.8 percent for a longer-term PCE inflation expectation.	12	1
201503	1403	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	In level terms, to go to your question, that wouldn’t be particularly worrisome because that’s where we, at the moment, have pegged our longer-term inflation expectations.	12	1
201503	1404	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	But, as I suggested, any further downward movement from there would begin to give us some greater concern.	12	1
201503	1405	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201503	1406	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I suggest we follow this up when the meeting concludes because I have a feeling that we want to make progress.	12	1
201503	1407	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	Can I just say that in the survey that we do with dealers which asks explicitly for their assessment of the five-year, five-year-forward expectation—we’re not seeing that much of a change.	12	1
201503	1408	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	We’ve seen a little bit, and these are pretty similar people to those who submit to the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	12	1
201503	1409	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Indeed.	12	1
201503	1410	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	We, too, have backed out the longer-term, the 6-to-10-year expectations from the SPF regarding inflation in the consumer price index, and in the SPF database, they too show less downward movement.	12	1
201503	1411	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	There’s always a question.	12	1
201503	1412	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	What I don’t want us to fall subject to is the proverb about the frog who gets boiled by the water whose temperature progressively moves up.	12	1
201503	1413	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	It feels like the water temperature has just moved up from 72 degrees to a few degrees above that in terms of the evidence here around longer-term inflation expectations.	12	1
201503	1414	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	12	1
201503	1415	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, among the many things I’ve learned is, apparently frogs do jump out of the water as it’s heated.	12	1
201503	1416	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	12	1
201503	1417	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Then I’ll have to stop using that little aphorism.	12	1
201503	1418	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12	1
201503	1419	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201503	1420	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	A lot seems to hinge in your thinking on inflation expectations, and one of the charts indicates a pretty high correlation of long-term inflation compensation to oil prices.	12	1
201503	1421	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think we know that short-term surveys and consumer attitudes are affected by gasoline or, effectively, oil prices.	12	1
201503	1422	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I wanted to understand a little bit more what went into your forecast of oil prices and how much confidence you really have in it, because you’re showing oil prices rebounding.	12	1
201503	1423	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I looked at it a little bit over the weekend, and there’s some interplay in forward rates between the cost of storage and a prediction of future prices.	12	1
201503	1424	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	There can be forward rates that are simply the cost of storage with very little prediction of future prices.	12	1
201503	1425	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	There’s a lot of noise in the market today on both sides of this question of whether oil prices are rising or whether at least WTI, because of US inventories, is likely to fall.	12	1
201503	1426	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	This is, I know, a little bit of a roundabout question, but can you talk a bit about your confidence in your oil price forecast here and how deeply we went into it?	12	1
201503	1427	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Sure.	12	1
201503	1428	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Just to answer your question, we’re not very confident in our oil price projection, but let me explain how we constructed it.	12	1
201503	1429	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Actually, it is based on futures markets for oil.	12	1
201503	1430	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We basically take the futures curve for different categories of oil out several years, and that represents the basis for our forecast.	12	1
201503	1431	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Frankly, that’s the best basis we can come up with because that futures curve represents market participants’ best guess as to what will be those prevailing prices.	12	1
201503	1432	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	That was the approach that we basically used for decades.	12	1
201503	1433	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	And moving into 2008 when oil prices were experiencing tremendous fluctuations, there was a lot of concern on the part of the Committee that our forecasts weren’t very helpful in predicting the future.	12	1
201503	1434	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Our division did a full-court press to look at the forecast and ask how we could improve it.	12	1
201503	1435	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, we decided that we couldn’t improve it by very much.	12	1
201503	1436	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	One thing we could do was take a look at market participants’ outlook for the global economy, compare it with our own, and if there were any differences, we could adjust the futures curve for oil prices to take that into account.	12	1
201503	1437	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We regularly do that, but the effect on our forecast path is not great.	12	1
201503	1438	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Right now, we alter the path to raise it by 0.5 percent per year, which is very little if you take into account the fact that we may be predicting a little bit more exchange rate appreciation than the market, to take into account some differences between our appraisal of the global economic outlook and the markets’.	12	1
201503	1439	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Basically, we’re stuck with the futures curve, and the upward slope is predicated on a couple of very reasonable premises.	12	1
201503	1440	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	One of them is that, over time, the low oil prices will reduce the incentive for production and production should decelerate.	12	1
201503	1441	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	And we’re certainly already seeing evidence of that in declining rig counts and in declining investment in the energy sector.	12	1
201503	1442	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Directionally, that’s a very reasonable premise, and that should give you, eventually, some upward tilt to prices.	12	1
201503	1443	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Another premise that seems to underlie the upward curve is that, over time, the global economy should strengthen, and that, too, should lead to some increase in prices.	12	1
201503	1444	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Again, the direction seems reasonable.	12	1
201503	1445	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	What’s happened since January has been, first, the evidence of declining rig counts seemed so tangible that markets decided they were sure that, indeed, production was going to slow, and so oil prices rose and the whole futures curve rose.	12	1
201503	1446	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Then more recently, as markets took note of soaring inventory levels, and as concerns emerged that these inventories might actually exceed the storage capacity available to put aside this oil, thus basically leading in a figurative sense an overflow of oil onto the market, those oil prices have come back down.	12	1
201503	1447	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Those are reasonable explanations, and that leaves us, again, with our upward tilt for oil prices, but do we have a lot of conviction that for sure that’s going to transpire?	12	1
201503	1448	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	No.	12	1
201503	1449	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	There have been a lot of analyses of how low oil prices could go, analyses looking at different fields in terms of what are the operating costs for those fields.	12	1
201503	1450	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Those analyses suggest that oil prices could go down to $40 per barrel before you see shutdowns significant enough to bring oil prices back up.	12	1
201503	1451	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We do have a lot of uncertainty.	12	1
201503	1452	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	It seems perfectly reasonable that, over the longer term, the oil prices should start trending upward.	12	1
201503	1453	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	There is tremendous uncertainty.	12	1
201503	1454	2015-03-18	meeting	POTTER	I think that’s the crucial part.	12	1
201503	1455	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201503	1456	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201503	1457	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	David, I took note of your very careful discussion about a number of choices that you made in putting the projection together, and I want to take you back to a choice that you made some time ago having to do with the 2014 first- quarter GDP growth rate.	12	1
201503	1458	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The reason for this is, as I looked at the table from the SEPs that I mentioned this morning—and it’s also evident in your exhibit 3—that at liftoff pretty much everybody’s core inflation rate is 1.3, 1.2, or 1.1 percent.	12	1
201503	1459	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	There’s one that’s 1.4.	12	1
201503	1460	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Well, there are two, but those are participants who have liftoff in 2016.	12	1
201503	1461	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s somebody else, myself and somebody else.	12	1
201503	1462	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Voldemort.	12	1
201503	1463	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I don’t remember the rules here.	12	1
201503	1464	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But when I look at the likely rationale for this, it seems to be that everybody has low unemployment rates, there’s been strong employment growth, and the economy is going well.	12	1
201503	1465	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	And I look at this and see the Phillips curve is alive and well here.	12	1
201503	1466	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That is, the inflation forecasting power coming out of that relationship seems to be why people have so much confidence.	12	1
201503	1467	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The size of gap seems to be important in this regard, and you mention that in your figure 3 on output gap estimates.	12	1
201503	1468	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I want to go back to the GDP estimate for the first quarter of 2014 because you made the choice that the bad number was all potential.	12	1
201503	1469	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s a tough judgment, I understand that, and I was reminded of that when I looked at the staff’s decomposition of potential GDP:  You’ve got 1.6 percent for 2011 and 2013, half a point for 2014, and for 2015, it’s 1.6.	12	1
201503	1470	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I wonder if you were instead just treating 2014:Q1 as a missing observation—never even saw that number and used monthly data to forecast it—some Kalman filter might put something in between there.	12	1
201503	1471	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I think the implications of this choice are modestly important because those gaps would be more negative if we had that.	12	1
201503	1472	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Could you discuss again your thinking on that?	12	1
201503	1473	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Bill, does this fall into your supply-side portfolio?	12	1
201503	1474	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I tried to mention this at the outset of the question so that you could think about it while I was talking.	12	1
201503	1475	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter].	12	1
201503	1476	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I try to be helpful.	12	1
201503	1477	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	I think the basic answer is, we continue to consider 2014:Q1 GDP growth as anomalously weak, and we are treating it as measurement error.	12	1
201503	1478	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	Because we don’t want to let that measurement error affect our estimate of the gap, we also build that into potential output.	12	1
201503	1479	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	That may or may not be the right assumption.	12	1
201503	1480	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	It is very unusual to put a 100 percent weight on a hypothesis like that, though, isn’t it?	12	1
201503	1481	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	We put a lot of weight on that explanation.	12	1
201503	1482	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Now I heard the discussion about the choice you made about the natural rate, that after careful consideration it might be not the right time to move it down to 5 from 5¼ percent.	12	1
201503	1483	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But if you made the judgment in the first quarter of 2014 that there was more of an output gap than looking at unemployment, you might kind of go, “Well, a lower natural rate would be more in line with a larger gap, too.”	12	1
201503	1484	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I am just asking, upon further reflection, if you go back, do you still have the same confidence in that?	12	1
201503	1485	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	Well, I am not sure we ever had a lot of confidence in it, but we have maintained that assumption about the anomalous drop in GDP.	12	1
201503	1486	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But the output gap estimate in figure 3 looks a little more rosy in part because of that choice, right?	12	1
201503	1487	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	That judgment informs the contour of the Tealbook estimate of the gap, but it does not inform the contour of the FRB/US gap, nor of EDO.	12	1
201503	1488	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Those are purely mechanical, model-based efforts to distill the data.	12	1
201503	1489	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it doesn’t mean that they are not suffused with uncertainty.	12	1
201503	1490	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That is helpful.	12	1
201503	1491	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12	1
201503	1492	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	But they are not contaminated by our judgment about the best treatment of the anomalous behavior of GDP in the first quarter of 2014.	12	1
201503	1493	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Let me also reiterate the basis for that judgment, which was that GDP growth is currently estimated to have declined.	12	1
201503	1494	2015-03-18	meeting	WASCHER	Two percent.	12	1
201503	1495	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	Against that backdrop, what we saw was a still significantly improving labor market with payroll employment increasing by nearly 200,000 jobs per month, which is considerably faster than the demographic requirement to absorb the increase in the labor force.	12	1
201503	1496	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	The unemployment rate was coming down.	12	1
201503	1497	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	You may not feel our pain, but we did.	12	1
201503	1498	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	I didn’t know how to understand the world through that period if it were the case that we maintained an assumption that potential GDP growth was increasing at something like 1¾ percent, which by the way is where we think the “uncontaminated” estimate of potential GDP really is.	12	1
201503	1499	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	We put the measurement in there, as Bill described, but as a matter of pragmatism and convenience, not as a matter of conviction.	12	1
201503	1500	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12	1
201503	1501	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201503	1502	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that.	12	1
201503	1503	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201503	1504	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201503	1505	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for Steve.	12	1
201503	1506	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	How unusual is dollar appreciation of this magnitude over this period of time?	12	1
201503	1507	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	How concerned should we be about it in terms of the implications for the economic growth outlook, in your opinion?	12	1
201503	1508	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	In terms of the big picture, there have been two much larger long swings in the dollar since we floated in the 1970s—one of them in the early-to-mid 1980s, and then more recently in the late 1990s, peaking in 2002 and coming down.	12	1
201503	1509	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Both of those were in the neighborhood of the steepness of what we have seen recently, but obviously they went on much further.	12	1
201503	1510	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We did take note of the fact that our upward revision to the average level of the dollar going forward was very large—more than 6 percent on a real basis.	12	1
201503	1511	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We looked at our data going back to the global financial crisis, around early 2008, to see whether we had made other revisions that size.	12	1
201503	1512	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	This 6¼ percent that we just did was the largest.	12	1
201503	1513	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But there were a few in the 5 percent range, during the run-up of the dollar during the crisis, but basically we are in very unusual outlier territory here.	12	1
201503	1514	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It might be useful to do a little bit of a case study analysis, because the 1980s was a very different episode.	12	1
201503	1515	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That was when we had very expansive fiscal policy in the United States, which drove up US real rates really high, causing capital to flow here to push up the dollar.	12	1
201503	1516	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I view this as a very different episode, because US fiscal policy is pretty neutral, and we’re getting so much firming of the dollar.	12	1
201503	1517	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I am a concerned citizen.	12	1
201503	1518	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	I take your point, and my colleagues and I have certainly started to think a little bit more about what might be the case if we really are at the—not really the beginning now, but let’s say the earlier stages of another what I will call “dollar super cycle.”	12	1
201503	1519	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Now, what is true, of course, is that the most recent dollar super cycle in the late 1990s was actually very much a feature of our strength.	12	1
201503	1520	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But that may not be true this time, although to some extent it is.	12	1
201503	1521	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Anyway, we are going to continue that analysis, looking at those earlier episodes to see what clues they might have for the future.	12	1
201503	1522	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Although we are, at this point, by no means committed to the view that indeed the dollar is going to continue to go up, we are cognizant of the risks.	12	1
201503	1523	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201503	1524	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201503	1525	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our round, and start with President Williams.	13	1
201503	1526	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1527	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My business contacts remain very optimistic, with reports of underlying consumer strength and anticipated double-digit growth in retail sales.	13	1
201503	1528	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, the recent national spending data look lackluster relative to expectations.	13	1
201503	1529	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think much of this disappointment appears to reflect transitory factors, notably the harsh winter weather in the East, the Midwest, and the South.	13	1
201503	1530	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, we have been trying our best to offset this drag in the West with day after day of perfect weather.	13	1
201503	1531	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have traveled across the District and found only a few exceptions.	13	1
201503	1532	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Sierra ski resorts are short of snow, and Honolulu was a few degrees cooler than usual.	13	1
201503	1533	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201503	1534	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	13	1
201503	1535	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am going to pay for that.	13	1
201503	1536	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all right.	13	1
201503	1537	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, we will run out of water soon, but that is a discussion for another day.	13	1
201503	1538	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We did have our own transitory setback to business activity from labor disruptions at the ports along the West Coast.	13	1
201503	1539	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This resulted in losses for time-sensitive cargo, including perishable foods and seasonal retail goods.	13	1
201503	1540	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, with workers back on the docks, and a tentative labor agreement likely to be ratified, any hiccup in GDP growth should be modest.	13	1
201503	1541	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some of the disappointment in the recent spending data also seems to reflect that expectations were set somewhat too high, particularly for the economy’s sustainable benchmark for economic growth.	13	1
201503	1542	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is evident in the Tealbook, which has lowered the average growth rate of potential output in the second half of last year and the first half of this year, by almost half a percentage point since our previous meeting.	13	1
201503	1543	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, to a lesser extent, I have also revised down my expectation regarding the growth rate of potential output.	13	1
201503	1544	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Continued weak productivity growth and stagnant labor force participation, as we will discuss in a minute, remain hurdles for faster sustained potential growth.	13	1
201503	1545	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since December, with a slower underlying pace of potential, I have also revised down my forecast for average real GDP growth over this year and next year by a couple of tenths to 2½ percent.	13	1
201503	1546	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My modal medium-term projections for unemployment and inflation, however, are little revised, as is my assumption of a June funds rate liftoff.	13	1
201503	1547	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should note that I now project that the unemployment rate temporarily dips slightly below 5 percent as highly accommodative monetary policy seeks to overcome the inflationary headwinds from a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices and to accelerate the attainment of our 2 percent inflation goal.	13	1
201503	1548	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, I actually have overall PCE inflation a smidge above 2 percent in 2007, reflecting a rise in real oil prices in that year.	13	1
201503	1549	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My assessments of the appropriate time for liftoff in the path of the funds rate over this year and next year are quite close to the prescriptions in both the difference rule and optimal- control policy reported in Tealbook, Book B.	13	1
201503	1550	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Research by myself and others has highlighted the good performance of difference rules, like that reported in the Tealbook, in particular the robustness to uncertainty about the natural rates of unemployment and interest, a topic particularly relevant today.	13	1
201503	1551	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, given that my projection for the period ahead sees modestly higher inflation and a touch lower unemployment than the Tealbook baseline, my projected path is somewhat more accommodative than implied by these two benchmarks.	13	1
201503	1552	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My medium-term outlook is relatively little changed, despite a fairly dramatic shift in financial conditions over the past few months.	13	1
201503	1553	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Quantitative easing by the ECB has helped push up the dollar and lower longer-term interest rates here and abroad.	13	1
201503	1554	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	As described in the box in the Tealbook, depending on the relative size of these effects, the ECB’s QE program either calls for no change or even less accommodation in the optimal path for the federal funds rate.	13	1
201503	1555	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, if foreign economic growth does surprise to the downside, the US growth outlook will deteriorate.	13	1
201503	1556	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	While a negative shock from Europe remains an appreciable downside risk, despite the ECB’s actions, we face potential upside risks as well.	13	1
201503	1557	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Notably, household formation has recently jumped, which could portend that a long-awaited recovery in single-family housing construction may finally get going this year.	13	1
201503	1558	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overall, I view the risks to the outlook as broadly balanced.	13	1
201503	1559	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast with the recent spending news, the employment data have been amazingly good.	13	1
201503	1560	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Besides creating jobs hand over fist, the unemployment rate has fallen more than 1 percentage point over the past year, and I expect it to decline to under 5 percent by the end of this year, falling below my estimate of the natural rate of 5.2 percent.	13	1
201503	1561	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other measures of labor market underutilization have also made significant progress.	13	1
201503	1562	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Involuntary part-time employment has fallen, job vacancies are piling up, and households that believe jobs are hard to get are balanced by those believing jobs are plentiful.	13	1
201503	1563	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In view of the surprisingly broad base of sustained improvement in labor markets we have been seeing, there is a very good chance that my unemployment rate forecast will prove to be pessimistic.	13	1
201503	1564	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, let me do a little simple math here.	13	1
201503	1565	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The labor market improves over the next 12 months at the same pace that we have seen over the past few years.	13	1
201503	1566	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Just assuming the same average pace we saw the past 24 months continues for 12 more months, the resulting U-3 unemployment rate will fall below 4½ percent, and the U-6 measure of underemployment will be closer to historical normal levels by spring of next year.	13	1
201503	1567	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one labor statistic that hasn’t made obvious improvement is the labor force participation rate.	13	1
201503	1568	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like the Tealbook, I expect only very modest cyclical recovery in labor force participation going forward.	13	1
201503	1569	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I have argued before, much of the large drop in participation that has occurred since 2007 reflects trends that predate the Great Recession.	13	1
201503	1570	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And new research by Bob Hall and a member of my staff investigates this issue from the perspective of how an individual’s participation rate varies with income.	13	1
201503	1571	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The focus is on the so-called prime-age individuals who are 25 to 54 years old—a category I am getting a little bit tired of—and might be expected to show the greatest cyclical rebound in participation.	13	1
201503	1572	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me say it again.	13	1
201503	1573	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, we are focusing just on 25- to 54-year- olds and looking at what has happened to their participation over the past couple of decades.	13	1
201503	1574	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	What they find is that virtually all of the decline in prime-age participation since the start of the Great Recession can be attributed to the decline associated with individuals in households whose incomes are above the median.	13	1
201503	1575	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is the higher-income households that have had the drop in participation, not the lower income.	13	1
201503	1576	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This finding suggests that an improving labor market and greater job availability may not drive these higher-income individuals back into the labor force.	13	1
201503	1577	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other more secular factors appear to be at work, especially because these income-based trends appear to have begun actually back in around 2000 or 2001.	13	1
201503	1578	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Altogether, this analysis implies that only a very modest recovery in labor force participation can be expected as the economy improves.	13	1
201503	1579	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, turning to inflation, the recent stronger dollar and lower oil prices have pushed headline inflation down, and, to a lesser extent, have had the same effect on core inflation.	13	1
201503	1580	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Despite the recent soft readings, my core inflation projection is essentially unchanged for the second half of this year and through 2017.	13	1
201503	1581	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this projection, the disinflationary impulse arising from the energy price shock is confined to the first half of this year, and the effects of the continuing dollar appreciation are offset by a lower unemployment rate trajectory.	13	1
201503	1582	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I still expect that we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective by the end of next year.	13	1
201503	1583	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1584	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1585	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201503	1586	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1587	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In this cycle of contacts in my District, roles were reversed somewhat compared with earlier periods.	13	1
201503	1588	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In earlier periods, we noted improving data and presented an optimistic outlook, and our directors and contacts sometimes responded, “We’re not seeing it yet.”	13	1
201503	1589	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	This time around, in contrast, we presented a current picture of mixed and even conflicting data and an outlook that, while in no way pessimistic, had lots of elements of uncertainty.	13	1
201503	1590	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts, for the most part, remained upbeat.	13	1
201503	1591	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Our directors and contacts report that demand continues to improve at a steady pace.	13	1
201503	1592	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Importantly, many contacts seem disposed to back up that outlook with investment spending and higher labor compensation.	13	1
201503	1593	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	A not insignificant number of firms say they intend to ramp up capital spending, and a significant share characterize their investment growth as expansion oriented.	13	1
201503	1594	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s GDP-tracking estimate suggests a very soft first-quarter growth rate.	13	1
201503	1595	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Admittedly, a lot of first-quarter data are still to be published, but, at this point, what we call our “nowcast” model is showing real GDP growth significantly below 1 percent.	13	1
201503	1596	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Our directors expressed doubt about our muted-growth story.	13	1
201503	1597	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	One reason for the upbeat tone is improving margins.	13	1
201503	1598	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms indicate that they are treating the drop in commodity prices, including energy costs, as an opportunity to boost margins at least temporarily.	13	1
201503	1599	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Any pass-through to their customers is expected to occur only gradually over the year and in response to competitive pressures.	13	1
201503	1600	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We were somewhat surprised by comments of our directors and contacts running businesses of national scope regarding February weather.	13	1
201503	1601	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	A number of contacts said work disruptions this year have been as bad as or worse than last year.	13	1
201503	1602	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In these reports, the weather effects on economic activity were not limited to the Northeast.	13	1
201503	1603	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In the retail sector, while most firms have not yet seen the benefit of lower gasoline prices in consumer spending, one low-end retailer in the dollar segment did report a sales boost.	13	1
201503	1604	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Most others anticipate improved sales as a result of falling gasoline prices as the weather improves.	13	1
201503	1605	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The government sector in some areas is described as now feeling the effect of lower energy prices in falling revenues.	13	1
201503	1606	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In our interviews this cycle, we asked about wage pressure.	13	1
201503	1607	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more reports of growing wage pressure with some of that pressure in lower-skill job categories.	13	1
201503	1608	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The Wal-Mart announcement has a number of employers planning for increases in lower-wage employee categories.	13	1
201503	1609	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The often mentioned difficulty in finding qualified applicants is now extending beyond the usual list of hard-to-fill positions.	13	1
201503	1610	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Labor turnover was also reported to be on the rise.	13	1
201503	1611	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In our region, layoffs in the energy exploration sector have helped some businesses fill skilled- trade positions, particularly welders.	13	1
201503	1612	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Turning to the national economy and my take on the incoming data, I’ve marked down once again my near-term economic growth, unemployment, and inflation forecasts, based on the tone of the data, but I’ve left the basic narrative of my forecast unchanged.	13	1
201503	1613	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I have real GDP growth about a half of a percentage point above the Tealbook projection over the next three years.	13	1
201503	1614	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise my outlook looks much the same as that of the Tealbook.	13	1
201503	1615	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I have not yet fully bought into the downshift reflected in this meeting’s Tealbook outlook.	13	1
201503	1616	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In internal discussions in our Bank over the past two years, my staff and I have employed a simplifying device to describe the path of the economy.	13	1
201503	1617	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We have argued that the economy is in a 3 percent world, or a 2 percent world that prevailed from the start of the recovery to mid-2013.	13	1
201503	1618	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s been the basis of our economic narrative.	13	1
201503	1619	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The staff preparing the Tealbook seems to have concluded the economy is back in that 2 percent world for the forecast horizon.	13	1
201503	1620	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The Tealbook forecast is now underpinned by slightly lower longer-term growth potential that is, in turn, reflective of lower productivity growth.	13	1
201503	1621	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The staff seems to expect a fundamentally slower economy over the medium term.	13	1
201503	1622	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I’m not there yet.	13	1
201503	1623	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I have changed my assessment of the forecast risk and now have the risks to economic growth and inflation tilted to the downside.	13	1
201503	1624	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I find the disharmonious character of the current economic growth and inflation data versus the payroll employment trend to be concerning.	13	1
201503	1625	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m continuing to put a lot of faith in the transitory factors explanation for readings on economic growth and inflation.	13	1
201503	1626	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	With a potentially historic policy decision pending, this is a particularly tough time to read the underlying trends, and I’ll put this thought in more tactical terms in the policy round.	13	1
201503	1627	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1628	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1629	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201503	1630	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1631	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Discussions with business leaders in my District focused on two distinctive features of the economy this winter:  snow and the West Coast port strike.	13	1
201503	1632	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the amount of snow that closed the US government barely warrants a visit by the snow plow in Boston [laughter], the many feet of snow in successive storms accompanied by extremely cold weather have been quite disruptive.	13	1
201503	1633	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, commuter rail service into Boston is still badly disrupted after more than a month.	13	1
201503	1634	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Various Boston museums reported visits in February were down between 25 and 50 percent relative to last year.	13	1
201503	1635	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tourist sites, restaurants, and retailers all reported significant declines, with some making analogies to the drop that occurred after September 11, 2001.	13	1
201503	1636	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	On a more positive note, crime was down significantly in February because quick getaways are not possible when roads and sidewalks have three feet of snow on them.	13	1
201503	1637	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13	1
201503	1638	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many businesses that rely on complex supply chains, particularly light manufacturing and suppliers to aerospace, reported that the West Coast strikes had caused significant slowdowns as a result of shortages of parts, either at their company or from other parts suppliers.	13	1
201503	1639	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In sum, the effect on the first quarter from these factors may be somewhat higher than anticipated in the Tealbook.	13	1
201503	1640	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Looking beyond the first quarter, I had been expecting real GDP growth to be well above potential this year.	13	1
201503	1641	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the dollar continuing to appreciate and weigh on net exports, I am now anticipating growth only modestly above its potential rate, slowing the decline in the unemployment rate.	13	1
201503	1642	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect the slowdown to be reinforced by more workers returning to the labor force.	13	1
201503	1643	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Consequently, our forecast envisions a more gradual approach toward my current estimate of the natural rate of unemployment at 5 percent.	13	1
201503	1644	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the lack of wage pressure to date, I could easily believe that the natural rate of unemployment is below 5 percent, and I will revisit this estimate if we continue to see very modest wage and salary increases as labor markets, I hope, continue to improve.	13	1
201503	1645	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	On the inflation front, most private forecasters and many of our own SEP submissions have been anticipating a gradual return to 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201503	1646	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, forecasters have repeatedly assumed that we would be close to 2 percent PCE inflation within two years, an expectation that has consistently been foiled by the data.	13	1
201503	1647	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, undeterred, most forecasters have simply moved the assumption forward for another try with the next forecast round.	13	1
201503	1648	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This pattern of recurring forecast errors makes me less confident that models that rely on the strong assumption that well- anchored expectations will drive inflation to 2 percent are capturing current inflation dynamics.	13	1
201503	1649	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	These serially correlated errors should make us less confident of the models and cause us to place more weight on the incoming wage and price data and less weight on models, especially when the incoming data do not conform to the forecast generated by our models.	13	1
201503	1650	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As has been the case for some years, the most recent inflation data do not indicate that we are likely to quickly return to our inflation target.	13	1
201503	1651	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	At our December meeting, the range for core PCE inflation forecasts for the 2015 SEP submissions was 1½ to 2.2 percent.	13	1
201503	1652	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the incoming price data indicate that even the lowest forecast in the range for December will likely be too high.	13	1
201503	1653	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook has lowered its forecast for 2015 Q4-to-Q4 core PCE inflation from 1½ percent to 1.3 percent, and I have lowered mine to 1.2 percent.	13	1
201503	1654	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While some may dismiss recent low-inflation readings as largely reflecting the indirect effects of lower oil prices seeping into core inflation, my staff’s work on oil’s effect on core prices finds this effect to be, similar to the Tealbook, quite small.	13	1
201503	1655	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, my staff finds only a small effect for the indirect effect of non-oil import prices.	13	1
201503	1656	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, market indicators of expected inflation outcomes should make us less confident that we are returning to 2 percent inflation over the next two years.	13	1
201503	1657	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Breakeven inflation rates remain quite low, and inflation probabilities derived from inflation caps and floors have recently implied a substantial increase in the probability that inflation remains below 1½ percent over the next 10 years.	13	1
201503	1658	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do not expect that by June we will have enough data to make us reasonably confident that we are returning to our inflation target over the next two years.	13	1
201503	1659	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, the appropriate policy assumption in the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s SEP submission entails liftoff in September, and I remain uncertain about how much evidence of increasing inflation will be available even by then.	13	1
201503	1660	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, even with a liftoff delayed until September, I expect only a gradual increase in interest rates.	13	1
201503	1661	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In part, this reflects my expectation that progress on inflation will likely be slow.	13	1
201503	1662	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	It also reflects that I’ve reduced my estimate of the longer-run real federal funds rate to 1½ percent.	13	1
201503	1663	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	This, in turn, reflects the continued disappointing productivity numbers that, in part, account for the significant labor market tightening despite only lackluster real GDP growth by historical standards.	13	1
201503	1664	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, among the risks that concern me are the continued weakness in China and the possibility of more Greek tragedy that stresses the European economy, each of which could cause a negative surprise that policy at the zero lower bound is poorly situated to address.	13	1
201503	1665	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we get to the middle of the year, we may have a better sense of the likelihood that these risks materialize, and pose a greater potential drag on the US economy.	13	1
201503	1666	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1667	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1668	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201503	1669	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1670	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	On balance, our regional information continues to indicate broad improvement in overall economic activity.	13	1
201503	1671	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Anecdotal reports received from the service sector have been quite positive for a few months now.	13	1
201503	1672	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	An executive of a sizable retail chain has seen a distinct improvement in consumer spending behavior since last fall.	13	1
201503	1673	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Early registrations and orders for next month’s High Point furniture market are up notably from last year.	13	1
201503	1674	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And a pickle manufacturer in North Carolina reported a surprisingly busy winter and noted the construction was under way for a new production line.	13	1
201503	1675	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And, yes, this is the Mount Olive pickle company located at the corner of Cucumber and Vine in Mt.	13	1
201503	1676	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Olive, North Carolina, in case you were wondering.	13	1
201503	1677	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201503	1678	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The preliminary results of our monthly survey of service-producing firms leaves the diffusion index at 12, a level that continues to indicate expansion.	13	1
201503	1679	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The preliminary March reading on our manufacturing index, however, is negative 10, which indicates overall contraction.	13	1
201503	1680	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Written survey responses and other anecdotal reports suggest that some of the weakness can be attributed to weakening exports and some to snow and ice in February.	13	1
201503	1681	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Both our manufacturing and service-sector surveys are signaling a more widespread pickup in wages.	13	1
201503	1682	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I was pleased to note the appearance of the Fifth District service-sector wage index in the alternative scenario box in the Tealbook and that it has proven to be significantly correlated with compensation per hour, which the author argues should be our preferred measure of labor compensation.	13	1
201503	1683	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Our service-sector wage index has been quite elevated of late.	13	1
201503	1684	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It was plus 23 last month, and the preliminary number for March is plus 14.	13	1
201503	1685	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Those levels would signal broader wage increases than have been indicated by the average hourly earnings series, and that’s consistent with the increasingly frequent reports we hear lately from our contacts of wage pressures.	13	1
201503	1686	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	For example, according to a staffing firm in South Carolina, “Quality candidates have choices and are being made multiple offers.	13	1
201503	1687	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Our clients are beginning to understand this and are moving forward with generally higher wages.”	13	1
201503	1688	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	That comment is relatively typical.	13	1
201503	1689	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Turning to national conditions, I noted with great interest that the Tealbook’s GDP forecast has converged to mine.	13	1
201503	1690	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	For 2015, we’re both projecting 2.2 percent growth and we’re not far apart for 2016 either.	13	1
201503	1691	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	My own forecast for 2015 is little changed from the previous projection.	13	1
201503	1692	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In fact, it has been basically stuck at 2.2 percent for nearly two years, but there’s obviously a lot of data to come yet for 2015.	13	1
201503	1693	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The critical aspect of the outlook, I believe, is the fairly robust trend in consumer spending, recent retail sales readings notwithstanding.	13	1
201503	1694	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The consumer spending trend appears to be attributable to the strong labor market, improving income prospects, and rising real wealth, and should be sufficient to keep GDP growth above trend going forward.	13	1
201503	1695	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Other components of GDP are a mixed bag.	13	1
201503	1696	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	A sharp decline this year in oil and gas drilling and slow growth in other categories of construction will damp nonresidential construction spending.	13	1
201503	1697	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Net exports will also be a drag on top-line growth.	13	1
201503	1698	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	On the other hand, despite recent choppiness, solid business investment in equipment and intangibles will likely boost top-line growth.	13	1
201503	1699	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	For housing, I don’t expect it to affect overall growth one way or another.	13	1
201503	1700	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Productivity I view as unlikely to accelerate significantly relative to recent trends.	13	1
201503	1701	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I think the modest GDP growth in my and the Tealbook’s projection is still large enough to generate continued firming in labor market conditions.	13	1
201503	1702	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	On the inflation front, prices have been held down lately by two clearly temporary factors: low oil prices and the strengthening dollar.	13	1
201503	1703	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I don’t expect much, if any, further decline in crude oil prices, and I share the Tealbook’s assessment that the foreign exchange value of the dollar is likely to stabilize this year, although there’s some obvious risks around that forecast.	13	1
201503	1704	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Meanwhile, measures of inflation expectations remain well anchored, and so I am confident now that, barring further adverse shocks, both headline and core inflation will move to 2 percent once these two temporary influences are behind us.	13	1
201503	1705	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1706	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1707	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201503	1708	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break.	13	1
201503	1709	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Now, the only question is, how long a break?	13	1
201503	1710	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a rule that no coffee break should last less than 10 minutes.	13	1
201503	1711	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we say 10 minutes?	13	1
201503	1712	2015-03-18	meeting		[Coffee break]	13	1
201503	1713	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s continue with President Mester.	13	1
201503	1714	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1715	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace, and the diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions remained at 18 percent.	13	1
201503	1716	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Some sectors reporting worse conditions were likely affected by historic low temperatures.	13	1
201503	1717	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	In sharp contrast to the weather, which has been decidedly cold, developers tell us that the multifamily housing sector remains hot.	13	1
201503	1718	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Low oil and natural gas prices have challenged firms engaged in energy development or extraction, as well as their suppliers like steel producers.	13	1
201503	1719	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Our directors with ties to the energy sector tell us that some investment is likely being postponed until next year rather than eliminated.	13	1
201503	1720	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Beyond the energy sector, low energy prices may be starting to have a positive effect.	13	1
201503	1721	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Auto manufacturers and dealers continue to be very optimistic.	13	1
201503	1722	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Even though the number of autos sold has declined a bit in the past few months, contacts report that consumers are buying more expensive vehicles, so revenues are up.	13	1
201503	1723	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturers, especially those who have more domestic exposure, are upbeat.	13	1
201503	1724	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets are uniformly positive and continue to improve.	13	1
201503	1725	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate has fallen to nearly 5 percent.	13	1
201503	1726	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	In March, 45 percent of our survey respondents reported an increase in recent staffing levels, up from 30 percent in January and last October.	13	1
201503	1727	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The increases in staffing were broad based across sectors.	13	1
201503	1728	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	So far, wage pressure has been limited to occupations in which there have been labor shortages for some time.	13	1
201503	1729	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Prices for finished goods remains stable, even as input costs fall.	13	1
201503	1730	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Some firms appear to have pricing power.	13	1
201503	1731	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	A major manufacturer of construction materials reported that although material prices have declined and further reductions are anticipated, the firm has now lowered prices for its own customers.	13	1
201503	1732	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Fuel surcharges put on by freight carriers when energy prices rose have not been reset lower, although some contacts report they have made the request.	13	1
201503	1733	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, I believe underlying economic fundamentals remain sound.	13	1
201503	1734	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	While I have made a few changes to my near-term outlook based on recent data, my modal outlook for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation has changed little since our January meeting, or since our most recent round of economic projections in December.	13	1
201503	1735	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Some of the most recent spending data have been on the soft side, but that is likely due to temporary factors like the very cold winter.	13	1
201503	1736	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Analysis by my staff using heating degree days suggests that extreme weather is likely to shave about ¾ percentage point from first-quarter GDP growth.	13	1
201503	1737	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I think we should be cautious about reading too much into the most recent numbers, and I take less signal from them for the outlook than the Tealbook appears to.	13	1
201503	1738	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I continue to project GDP growth to be about 3 percent this year and next.	13	1
201503	1739	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Factors supporting above-trend growth include highly accommodative monetary policy, improving household and business balance sheets and confidence, labor market strength, and lower oil prices.	13	1
201503	1740	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	These factors will outweigh the effect of relatively weak global economic growth on US exports.	13	1
201503	1741	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	By a broad set of indicators, labor market conditions are strong and continue to improve.	13	1
201503	1742	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Monthly job gains have averaged more than 280,000 over the past three months.	13	1
201503	1743	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The unemployment rate and other measures of underemployment continue to fall, and the job openings rate is at a cyclical high.	13	1
201503	1744	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	We are nearing our goal of maximum employment.	13	1
201503	1745	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	With output growth above trend, I expect continued job gains and reductions in unemployment and underemployment.	13	1
201503	1746	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I project that by the end of this year the unemployment rate will fall to 5.2 percent, which is below my 5½ percent estimate of the longer-run rate.	13	1
201503	1747	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Like the Board staff, I considered lowering my estimate of the longer-run rate, but I also didn’t find the case for doing so compelling.	13	1
201503	1748	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	First, the estimate coming out of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff’s model of labor market flows points to a 5½ percent natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201503	1749	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Second, some indicators suggest we may be beginning to see some strengthening in wage growth.	13	1
201503	1750	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Third, the error band around any estimate of the natural rate is very large.	13	1
201503	1751	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Of course, I will revisit this issue.	13	1
201503	1752	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	If the unemployment rate falls more sharply than I currently anticipate and wage growth remains modest, I may need to adjust down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate.	13	1
201503	1753	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I do anticipate that continued economic growth and labor market improvement will be accompanied by a pickup in nominal wage growth.	13	1
201503	1754	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	But a failure of wages to accelerate could reflect structural factors, such as the aging of the population, which can’t be addressed by monetary policy.	13	1
201503	1755	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I also note that wage growth does not typically lead price inflation.	13	1
201503	1756	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	So with respect to either part of our mandate, I do not view faster wage growth as a precondition for liftoff.	13	1
201503	1757	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Headline inflation continues to come in below our 2 percent goal, reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices as well as declines in import prices.	13	1
201503	1758	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	So far, there hasn’t been much pass- through to core measures of inflation, which have been relatively stable.	13	1
201503	1759	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI measure, which helps predict headline inflation over the medium term, has remained near 2¼ percent since April of last year.	13	1
201503	1760	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	In my view, inflation expectations remain anchored.	13	1
201503	1761	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	There has been only a little change in the survey measures.	13	1
201503	1762	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Other measures, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s 10-year expected inflation rate, have moved down a bit, but they remain within recent ranges.	13	1
201503	1763	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	While little of the variation in longer-term inflation expectations can be explained by typical movements in energy prices, research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff indicates that the sharp drop in energy prices can account entirely for the recent decline in the Cleveland staff’s expected inflation measures.	13	1
201503	1764	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Even though the firming in inflation compensation measures could be viewed as a good sign, I continue to take less signal about expectations from these measures.	13	1
201503	1765	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Those recent changes may be reflecting changes in liquidity premiums.	13	1
201503	1766	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	As oil prices stabilize, with economic growth above trend and inflation expectations stable, I project that inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent goal by late 2016 or early 2017.	13	1
201503	1767	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The stability of the survey measures of longer-run inflation helps inform my projection.	13	1
201503	1768	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Research suggests that these measures are more useful for forecasting inflation than market- based measures.	13	1
201503	1769	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Within the Cleveland staff’s forecasting model, anchoring inflation around a survey forecast of longer-run inflation performs much better in terms of historical forecast accuracy than anchoring it around measures of expected inflation based, in part or in whole, on financial market measures, including the Cleveland staff’s 10-year expected inflation.	13	1
201503	1770	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I am reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to the FOMC’s goal by the end of 2016 or early 2017.	13	1
201503	1771	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Of course, it is good to remember that it is very difficult to forecast inflation with any precision.	13	1
201503	1772	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Reasonable confidence should not require high confidence.	13	1
201503	1773	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	As indicated in the table provided with the request for SEP submissions, historical average projection errors across a range of private-sector and government forecasts indicate that the 70 percent confidence interval around a forecast of CPI inflation two years out is about plus or minus 1 percentage point.	13	1
201503	1774	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland staff’s analysis of a range of forecasting models indicates that current uncertainty around headline inflation forecasts is somewhere between “normal” and “somewhat elevated” compared with the norms of the past 20 years.	13	1
201503	1775	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	There is no reason to think we will be more accurate in forecasting inflation this time, nor should we require that.	13	1
201503	1776	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	My projection is dependent on a policy rate path that has liftoff occurring in June with a gradual rise in rates thereafter, similar to a path suggested by a Taylor (1999) rule with inertia.	13	1
201503	1777	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Liftoff is one quarter later than in my December projection, reflecting the fact that inflation between one and two years ahead now reaches 2 percent one quarter later.	13	1
201503	1778	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I am hoping that we will change our policy statement tomorrow so that my projected liftoff date is not inconsistent with our forward guidance.	13	1
201503	1779	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1780	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1781	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201503	1782	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1783	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Eighth District developments since the previous meeting seem to be consistent with continued economic expansion.	13	1
201503	1784	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	According to the St Louis Fed’s quarterly survey of contacts, about two-thirds expect local economic conditions to be “better” or “somewhat better” in 2015 than in 2014.	13	1
201503	1785	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	This is a slight increase in optimism compared with our November survey.	13	1
201503	1786	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Preliminary employment data for the most recent reporting period indicate that employment in the District grew at a modest pace.	13	1
201503	1787	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The unemployment rate in the District has continued to decline and stands at 5.8 percent, somewhat above the national rate.	13	1
201503	1788	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Price pressures seemingly remain modest.	13	1
201503	1789	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, surveyed businesses stress slower growth in nonlabor costs.	13	1
201503	1790	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Wage pressures, on the other hand, have modestly strengthened.	13	1
201503	1791	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	More than half of our business contacts expect to increase wages during the second quarter of 2015.	13	1
201503	1792	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Similar to something President Lockhart mentioned, we think Wal-Mart may be acting like a Stackelberg leader in its recent decision to raise the entry-level wages of their workers.	13	1
201503	1793	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Some contacts, along with broader commentary, suggest that Wal-Mart’s move will be matched by other large, big-box retailers as well as smaller businesses competing in that particular labor market pool.	13	1
201503	1794	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Several contacts mentioned that poor weather and disruptions at West Coast ports had adversely affected their business or industry.	13	1
201503	1795	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In general, though, we see this year’s weather disruptions as less significant than last year’s.	13	1
201503	1796	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We see the weather stories consistent with the weaker-than-expected February US retail sales report.	13	1
201503	1797	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Contacts at large technology and logistics firms noted some softness in volumes in the first quarter, although they gave no indication that this is part of an evolving shift to a flatter growth path over the near term.	13	1
201503	1798	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, a logistics contact observed that activity in March was notably weaker than February because of weather, but that they remained comfortable with current volume trends.	13	1
201503	1799	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Large manufacturing firms that have an international presence were more pessimistic, noting a slowdown in activity.	13	1
201503	1800	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The drop in oil prices has clearly cut into oil and gas equipment business volumes, and the stronger dollar continues to affect sales to overseas buyers.	13	1
201503	1801	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, households may still be holding back because of uncertainty about the strength of the global economy.	13	1
201503	1802	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Foreign exchange hedging strategies seem to be mixed among large multinationals.	13	1
201503	1803	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	On the positive side, several contacts expect that positive effects of lower oil prices on the US economy will begin to show up later this year and into early 2016.	13	1
201503	1804	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Nationally, a disturbing disconnect has developed between labor markets and the real economy over the past six months.	13	1
201503	1805	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Job growth has been quite strong, but the growth of the real economy has slowed from roughly a 4¾ percent pace over the second and third quarters of 2014 to what we estimate to be a 2¼ percent pace over the past two quarters, including the current quarter.	13	1
201503	1806	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Except for labor markets, we think data flows have been weaker than expected, on net, this year.	13	1
201503	1807	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We believe that the slowdown is temporary, and that economic growth over the final three quarters of 2015 will average a bit more than 3 percent.	13	1
201503	1808	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Above-trend growth will keep job growth brisk and push the unemployment rate below 5 percent in the second half of 2015.	13	1
201503	1809	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Unlike the Board staff, I doubt whether the dollar’s strength will eviscerate real GDP growth over the near term.	13	1
201503	1810	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	One chart I have been staring at recently, provided by my staff, looks at the correlation between the four-quarter change in the real trade-weighted value of the dollar and the one-year-later four-quarter change in real GDP growth.	13	1
201503	1811	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The correlation is close to zero from 1983 to the present.	13	1
201503	1812	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Also, with regard to the dollar, we would note that the current value of the real broad trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar is about 4.5 percent below its long-run median value of 1983 to the present.	13	1
201503	1813	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	More generally, I don’t think there are good empirical or theoretical models of the response of real variables to exchange rate movements that are of sufficient quality to be a driving factor in US monetary policy.	13	1
201503	1814	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We also believe that the plunge in oil prices over the past nine months temporarily softened medium-term market-based measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201503	1815	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I see this as a bit of a temporary mispricing in TIPS markets.	13	1
201503	1816	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	If the US economy rebounds to faster economic growth over the remainder of this year, as I expect, and other major central banks are successful in boosting growth, then crude oil prices may remain at current levels or even begin trending upward.	13	1
201503	1817	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In this scenario, we think market-based measures of inflation expectations will firm, and that actual inflation will follow this upward trend.	13	1
201503	1818	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Labor market conditions remain a bright spot in the outlook as job growth exceeded expectations once again in February, and the unemployment rate fell more than we expected.	13	1
201503	1819	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We did not think it was credible to project the US unemployment rate remaining above 5 percent this year, given the current pace of improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201503	1820	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, as just mentioned, we have 4.8 percent by the end of this year.	13	1
201503	1821	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In the two most recent cyclical expansions, unemployment dropped to 3.8 percent in the late 1990s and 4.4 percent in the 2000s.	13	1
201503	1822	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We think something similar may occur during the current cycle.	13	1
201503	1823	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1824	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1825	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201503	1826	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1827	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In line with a lot of the recent spending data, many of my directors and other business contacts indicated some slowing in the growth of their businesses.	13	1
201503	1828	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	For instance, our director from Manpower said US demand for temporary workers has been soft so far this year.	13	1
201503	1829	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Our trucking director reported that business has slowed nationally, and the steelmakers we talked to have seen prices fall and inventories increase.	13	1
201503	1830	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	However, just about everybody remained upbeat about the outlook for economic growth going forward.	13	1
201503	1831	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	They attributed the recent softening to weather or just the usual variation we might expect to see in a healthy economy.	13	1
201503	1832	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	My conversation with Ford was pretty typical.	13	1
201503	1833	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The company suspected that weather was a big part of the decline in February sales.	13	1
201503	1834	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	It actually upgraded its 2015 forecast a touch and modestly increased production plans for the second quarter.	13	1
201503	1835	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Its biggest note of caution was over the weak yen, which was providing a bit of a pricing advantage to its Japanese competitors.	13	1
201503	1836	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That type of comment is not unusual.	13	1
201503	1837	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The lower dollar also appears to be helping in Europe, which that director from Manpower again said was an area in which demand was picking up, and in which business was doing quite well.	13	1
201503	1838	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	My own outlook for the real economy hasn’t changed a great deal since our previous meeting.	13	1
201503	1839	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Economic growth has obviously been a bit softer in the first quarter, but that softness seems likely to be transitory.	13	1
201503	1840	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I expect growth for this year and next to be around 2¾ percent.	13	1
201503	1841	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s actually a little slower than I was thinking at the previous meeting.	13	1
201503	1842	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In addition to the recent weaker data, the continued strengthening of the dollar has caused us to trim our outlook a wee bit.	13	1
201503	1843	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Still, economic growth should be strong enough to bring unemployment down to around 5 percent by the end of 2016, even with the participation rate moving closer to trend.	13	1
201503	1844	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I don’t see an unemployment rate of 5 percent as overshooting full employment.	13	1
201503	1845	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Five percent is what I had written down in my SEP for the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201503	1846	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In view of the changing composition of the labor force, that seems conservative.	13	1
201503	1847	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	It could be a touch lower.	13	1
201503	1848	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That would be consistent with the anemic wage growth and low inflationary pressures we’ve seen for several years.	13	1
201503	1849	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Wage growth is not impressive, even in parts of the economy like manufacturing, which seem to be doing very well, and the workweek is at a post–World War II high.	13	1
201503	1850	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In terms of the inflation outlook, I think it is still very hard to be confident that we’re headed back to our target in anything like an acceptable period of time.	13	1
201503	1851	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Like others, my SEP submission for core inflation is lower than last time not only in the near term, but also a touch lower further out in the forecast period.	13	1
201503	1852	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I see inflation only slowly crawling back up to 2 percent sometime in 2018 or later.	13	1
201503	1853	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Importantly, the data on core inflation have continued to be soft, and we probably haven’t yet seen the full effects of the stronger dollar.	13	1
201503	1854	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	We really ought to keep in mind that the dollar’s appreciation is already imparting some restrictiveness that is somewhat like a monetary policy tightening, and, as I already mentioned, wage growth is far below where it should be if we were hitting our inflation target.	13	1
201503	1855	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I certainly think that if the labor market continues to improve the way it has, we will eventually see higher inflation, but we need to be appropriately humble about our ability to forecast inflation.	13	1
201503	1856	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The degree of slack in the labor force is quite uncertain, and the response of inflation to slack is, to put it mildly, uncertain.	13	1
201503	1857	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in evaluating inflation forecasting methodologies, it’s not that easy to beat a random walk.	13	1
201503	1858	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The recent level of core inflation is usually a pretty good indicator of where inflation will be over the next one to two years.	13	1
201503	1859	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I think that means that to be confident inflation is headed back to target, we need to see some firming in the actual wage and inflation data, and we should also see some improvement in inflation breakevens.	13	1
201503	1860	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Their small retracement in recent weeks is welcome, but market measures of inflation compensation continue to be well below the level we would anticipate if inflation was expected to approach our target in the medium term.	13	1
201503	1861	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	To conclude, I think we are well on our way to achieving the employment part of our mandate in a reasonable amount of time, but my outlook for inflation is nowhere near satisfactory.	13	1
201503	1862	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	When thinking about policy liftoff and taking a risk-management view, I just can’t see the argument for hurrying.	13	1
201503	1863	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	We need to manage the downside risk to inflation expectations and the risk to our credibility if we prematurely exit.	13	1
201503	1864	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That means we really ought to have a reasonable degree of confidence that inflation is moving up to target before actively tightening financial conditions.	13	1
201503	1865	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	For me, I just can’t see how we can credibly say we have that degree of confidence in the current inflation environment.	13	1
201503	1866	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1867	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1868	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	13	1
201503	1869	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1870	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas researchers have uncovered a new economic phenomenon.	13	1
201503	1871	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	They call it the “Fisher effect.”	13	1
201503	1872	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	No, this is not the tendency for nominal interest rates to co-vary with inflation.	13	1
201503	1873	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	It is the evident tendency for the relative health of the 11th District economy to rise and fall depending on whether Richard Fisher is at the helm of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.	13	1
201503	1874	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	For those of you that have endured Richard’s upbeat economic reports over the past 10 years, this may be an opportunity for you to indulge in some schadenfreude.	13	1
201503	1875	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	[Laughter]	13	1
201503	1876	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Now, if you think that’s not a proper Texas term, I would point out that a large part of central Texas was settled by German immigrants.	13	1
201503	1877	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I do think that you will understand my conclusion that he has timed his departure so that he would not have to give this report today.	13	1
201503	1878	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	This year, for the very first time since Richard took office in Dallas back in 2005, we are expecting Texas job growth to lag behind national job growth.	13	1
201503	1879	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	We are still not expecting recession.	13	1
201503	1880	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	President Fisher explained at the previous meeting a number of factors that are significantly different than in the 1980s that lead us to think that the effect will be different than in the 1980s, so I’m not going to go through those.	13	1
201503	1881	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, our forecast for Texas job growth has been lowered by 0.5 percentage point since the Committee met in January, from 1.5 to 2.5 percent, down to 1 to 2 percent, based on the deterioration in our Texas leading index.	13	1
201503	1882	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	That’s a decline from the 3.4 percent growth we enjoyed during 2014 and will bring us below national job growth.	13	1
201503	1883	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I think you may have heard that everything is bigger in Texas, and recent trends in the 11th District economy are an exaggerated version of recent trends in the US economy as a whole.	13	1
201503	1884	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thus, we’ve seen a particularly sharp slowing of growth in our manufacturing sector, driven by downturns in exports and the energy sector.	13	1
201503	1885	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	But our service sector is holding up, and our unemployment rate has, so far, continued to fall.	13	1
201503	1886	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Specifically, our Texas manufacturing diffusion index was basically zero in both January and February, indicating that manufacturing activity was flat, whereas our service-sector index was in the low teens, indicating moderate growth.	13	1
201503	1887	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Texas exports fell in January and are now down 13 percent in real terms from their August 2014 peak.	13	1
201503	1888	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Still, the unemployment rate hit 4.4 percent in January, its lowest reading in seven years.	13	1
201503	1889	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As the energy sector has cooled, upward pressure on wages has eased somewhat.	13	1
201503	1890	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Housing and real estate activity more broadly have held steady.	13	1
201503	1891	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Auto dealers report strong sales.	13	1
201503	1892	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Looking ahead, worrisome signs include the further appreciation of the dollar, ongoing declines in well permits, an uptick in initial jobless claims, and anecdotal reports that Houston- area office growth is slowing at a time when Houston accounts for 16 percent of all office space under construction in the United States.	13	1
201503	1893	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Area bankers report few negative effects from lower energy prices so far.	13	1
201503	1894	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, their worry level will ratchet upward if prices don’t begin to recover within the next six to nine months.	13	1
201503	1895	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Energy industry contacts in the region are pessimistic.	13	1
201503	1896	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	They expect a roughly 30 percent decline in capital expenditures this year.	13	1
201503	1897	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The decline would have been sharper except for the fact that a growing number of companies are deferring the completion of horizontally drilled wells.	13	1
201503	1898	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	They are drilling the well, but postponing the fracking.	13	1
201503	1899	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As a result, there is the potential for production to increase quickly should oil prices rise.	13	1
201503	1900	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Despite the falling rig count and growing number of uncompleted wells, US crude production has continued to grow and has done so at a faster-than-expected rate.	13	1
201503	1901	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	This won’t last.	13	1
201503	1902	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Production from horizontally drilled wells falls off quickly by roughly 30 percent in the first year, and the falling rig count must eventually affect the number of wells in production.	13	1
201503	1903	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Department of Energy predicts that output in two major shale areas will decline in April, and that US production overall will decline by close to 2 percent in the third quarter.	13	1
201503	1904	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Industry contacts are nervous that oil storage capacity in Cushing, Oklahoma, will be exhausted before then, however, which would put downward pressure on West Texas Intermediate.	13	1
201503	1905	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	A key point here is that the Brent and WTI crude oil prices have notably diverged because of the US oil export ban.	13	1
201503	1906	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As of a couple of days ago, the Brent price is up 23 percent, to $57 a barrel, since the January Tealbook was released.	13	1
201503	1907	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The WTI price is essentially unchanged.	13	1
201503	1908	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	It’s the Brent price that determines the gasoline, heating oil, and other refined product prices paid by US households.	13	1
201503	1909	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	It’s the WTI price that determines the investment and hiring decisions of US energy producers.	13	1
201503	1910	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Because of Brent’s rise and WTI’s stagnation, the energy picture looks worse from the US energy consumer’s perspective without looking any better from the perspective of US energy producers.	13	1
201503	1911	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	At the national level, the real GDP growth projections I’ve submitted on behalf of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas have been revised downward slightly from December, reflecting a more realistic view of likely growth in the working-age population and the belief that most of the declines we’ve seen in labor force participation are unlikely to be reversed.	13	1
201503	1912	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our unemployment projections are unchanged from those we submitted in December.	13	1
201503	1913	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As compared with the Tealbook, we have slightly faster 2015 GDP growth, which leads to a slightly more rapid reduction in the unemployment rate, but we see the outlook for the real economy under appropriate policy as otherwise quite similar to the Tealbook baseline forecast.	13	1
201503	1914	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	The stronger dollar and lower price of oil had a larger effect on both headline and conventional core inflation than we had anticipated, so my near-term inflation projections are somewhat lower than those submitted by President Fisher for the previous quarter.	13	1
201503	1915	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	But we continue to believe that longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at a rate consistent with the Committee’s inflation objective.	13	1
201503	1916	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As you very likely know, we use trimmed mean PCE inflation as the centerpiece of our inflation-forecasting efforts.	13	1
201503	1917	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As a result, we see inflation rising further and faster than does the Tealbook.	13	1
201503	1918	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Finally, our staff remains convinced that increases in the unemployment rate are difficult to contain once they begin, so that the risks to mis-estimating slack are asymmetric.	13	1
201503	1919	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	It is more risky to overestimate slack than to underestimate it.	13	1
201503	1920	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	That asymmetry, in combination with our relatively optimistic view of medium-term inflation and near-term unemployment prospects, argues for a more rapid transition to a neutral policy stance than is assumed in the Tealbook baseline forecast.	13	1
201503	1921	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1922	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1923	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	13	1
201503	1924	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1925	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	As in the rest of the nation, economic activity in the Third District has moderated of late.	13	1
201503	1926	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	This is especially true in manufacturing and housing.	13	1
201503	1927	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	However, our service sector continues to exhibit considerable strength, and employment growth is solid overall.	13	1
201503	1928	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	For example, the current general activity index in our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey has dropped from its lofty late-fall levels to readings that are below its nonrecessionary average.	13	1
201503	1929	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Approximately as many respondents are now indicating a decline in activity as are indicating increasing activity.	13	1
201503	1930	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The indexes of current new orders and shipments have both dropped significantly since the end of last year.	13	1
201503	1931	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Unsurprisingly, with the decline in energy prices, both the indexes for prices paid and received are as low as they have been since April 2013.	13	1
201503	1932	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Future expectations have retrenched a bit as well and are now at the national level for an expansion.	13	1
201503	1933	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	A somewhat brighter note is seen in the index for future employment, which remains well above its nonrecessionary average, a range in which it has resided now for the past two years.	13	1
201503	1934	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	The other sector of weakness in our region is residential investment.	13	1
201503	1935	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Single-family permits have been roughly flat for the past two years and show little sign of any improvement.	13	1
201503	1936	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Multifamily contracts, which have been growing quite robustly over the past year through November, declined quite noticeably in December and January, although they remain at high levels.	13	1
201503	1937	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Further, house appreciation has been much tamer in the region than in the nation, with house prices declining in Delaware and barely growing in Pennsylvania.	13	1
201503	1938	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	On a brighter note, the value for contracts for commercial buildings have surged, with two new high-rise towers having broken ground in Philadelphia and a third about to start.	13	1
201503	1939	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Also, the service sector continues to expand, as indicated by a bounceback in our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey diffusion index from 8.8 in January to 51 in February.	13	1
201503	1940	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Strength was broad based in the survey, with strong performance in indexes for current sales, new orders, current employment, and future activity.	13	1
201503	1941	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Employment growth remains strong as well, and the unemployment rate for the District as a whole is slightly lower than that of the nation.	13	1
201503	1942	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thus, our District reflects fairly well what is transpiring nationally:  strong labor markets, relatively solid consumption growth, a falloff in manufacturing business activity, and a lack of any significant improvement in residential investment.	13	1
201503	1943	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	With that as background, my forecast of the economy is a bit stronger than the one in the Tealbook and pretty much in line with the SPF median forecast.	13	1
201503	1944	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	I foresee 2.6 percent real GDP growth in the first half of this year and strengthening to 3 percent overall in the second half, implying GDP growth of 2.8 percent for the year as a whole.	13	1
201503	1945	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Subsequently, GDP growth gradually returns to a trend rate of 2.4 percent in 2017.	13	1
201503	1946	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	That trajectory of real activity sees the unemployment rate declining to 5.2 percent by the end of the year, then to 5.1 percent by the end of 2016 and 5.0 in 2017.	13	1
201503	1947	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thus, I see the unemployment rate as falling significantly below my 5.2 percent estimate of its natural rate.	13	1
201503	1948	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Inflation slowly returns to the FOMC’s objective over my forecast, with the headline rate projected at 0.8 percent for the whole of this year after an energy- induced 0 percent in the first half.	13	1
201503	1949	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	In 2016, inflation accelerates to 1.8 percent and settles to 2.0 percent in 2017.	13	1
201503	1950	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	For core PCE inflation, for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, my corresponding numbers are 1.4, 1.7, and 1.9 percent.	13	1
201503	1951	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Appropriate monetary policy envisions a start to normalization in June of this year, with a gradual tightening of policy throughout the forecast horizon.	13	1
201503	1952	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	I anticipate a federal funds rate of 0.88 percent at the end of this year, 2.1 percent by the end of 2016, and 3.63 percent in 2017, which is close to my long-run value of the funds rate of 3.75 percent.	13	1
201503	1953	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1954	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1955	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201503	1956	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1957	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace with low unemployment, although the energy and agriculture sectors in the region have weakened.	13	1
201503	1958	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	District contacts report sharp declines in drilling activity and planned capital expenditures.	13	1
201503	1959	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	At the same time, drilling has increasingly focused on core areas, leading to greater production efficiencies and slight increases in overall production.	13	1
201503	1960	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Crude oil stocks continue to build, and, at the current rate Cushing, Oklahoma, could reach storage capacity in late April or May.	13	1
201503	1961	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	For District states, particularly Oklahoma, Wyoming, and New Mexico, slower energy activity is negatively affecting state revenues.	13	1
201503	1962	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	In the agriculture sector, farm income is expected to decline considerably in 2015, but farmland values have generally remained steady.	13	1
201503	1963	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Weaker profit margins and reduced cash flow have led to a significant rise in farmers’ short-term financing needs and related bank lending.	13	1
201503	1964	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, I continue to expect above-trend growth over the medium term, although I marked down my estimate for near-term GDP growth largely because of weaker recent indicators of business spending.	13	1
201503	1965	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I also revised down my near-term inflation forecast, although I continue to see the current weakness as reflecting the temporary effects of lower energy prices and the stronger dollar.	13	1
201503	1966	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Over the medium term, I expect the economy to grow at a moderate pace, supported mainly by consumer spending.	13	1
201503	1967	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Although many consumers stayed home during February’s unusually heavy snowstorms, I expect they will head back to the stores in the months ahead as more moderate weather returns, with spending supported by savings from lower gas prices and ongoing increases in employment income and wealth.	13	1
201503	1968	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	With payroll growth averaging 230,000 jobs per month over the past two years, I continue to expect stronger wage growth over the medium term.	13	1
201503	1969	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	My staff has noted that employment growth usually does not translate immediately into higher wage growth.	13	1
201503	1970	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	The contemporaneous correlation between growth in average hourly earnings and employment growth is almost zero, but the correlation between wage growth and employment growth from about two years prior is much higher, with a correlation coefficient of 0.7.	13	1
201503	1971	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Indeed, some evidence of rising nominal wage growth is already apparent in the data.	13	1
201503	1972	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Wage growth among job switchers and job stayers indicates that both groups saw wages accelerate in the fourth quarter.	13	1
201503	1973	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Looking ahead, a further rise in the quits rate should support stronger wage growth as job switchers command considerably higher wages than those who stay.	13	1
201503	1974	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	The Tealbook’s alternative view on wages is similar to work done by my staff, which suggests compositional changes in the workforce could be masking underlying wage pressures, particularly as measured by average hourly earnings.	13	1
201503	1975	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	As the labor market tightens, firms are likely hiring less-experienced workers, paying them relatively low wages, and, as a result, dragging down average wages.	13	1
201503	1976	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Looking at measures of compensation that account for such compositional changes points to greater wage pressure than averages suggest.	13	1
201503	1977	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the employment cost index shows a modest acceleration in compensation over the past year, and median expected income growth from the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey has moved up this year from low levels last year.	13	1
201503	1978	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to inflation, I expect low inflation to persist in the face of low energy prices and a strengthening dollar.	13	1
201503	1979	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	While longer-term market-based measures have recently dropped, they are above their lows from earlier in the year, and survey-based measures have remained anchored near our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201503	1980	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1981	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	1982	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201503	1983	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	1984	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the intermeeting period, we talked to a wide range of contacts in the Ninth District about compensation pressures.	13	1
201503	1985	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Overall, the unemployment rate in the District is now below 4 percent, markedly below where it was in late 2006.	13	1
201503	1986	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, in the twin cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, which has more than one-third of the economic activity in the District, the unemployment rate is close to 3 percent.	13	1
201503	1987	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Nonetheless, other than in a few specific occupations and locales, compensation pressures remain, at best, moderate in the District, with wage increases typically reported to be in the 2 to 3 percent range.	13	1
201503	1988	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why are wage pressures so constrained?	13	1
201503	1989	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Labor leaders we talked to attributed the relatively low compensation pressures to increased post-recession risk aversion on the part of workers.	13	1
201503	1990	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Consistent with the implications of bargaining theory, they report that this risk aversion reduces the bargaining power of workers relative to firms.	13	1
201503	1991	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For their part, business leaders reported being flush with liquidity, but they saw many other ways to use those resources, like capital expenditure, rather than paying workers.	13	1
201503	1992	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We saw these stories from both sides of the table as largely consistent with each other.	13	1
201503	1993	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Other than in a few specialties, businesses continue to be able to find the workers that they want without paying them a lot.	13	1
201503	1994	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to the national economy.	13	1
201503	1995	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of prices, as in December, my inflation outlook remains subdued.	13	1
201503	1996	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Under the monetary policy stance assumed in Tealbook, Book A, I don’t see inflation returning to 2 percent until late 2018.	13	1
201503	1997	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The behavior of market-based measures of inflation expectations continues to be a matter of significant concern.	13	1
201503	1998	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The five-year, five- year-forward measures remain near historical lows.	13	1
201503	1999	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We also closely track the two-year, three- year measures, and these, too, are near historical lows.	13	1
201503	2000	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, participants in these markets appear to be putting nontrivial weight on an event in which economic activity and prices are both unduly low because the central bank is unwilling or unable to provide appropriate accommodation.	13	1
201503	2001	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a signal that low inflation and the low-inflation outlook has reduced the credibility of the inflation target.	13	1
201503	2002	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Turning to the real side of the economy, my outlook for economic growth has weakened somewhat since December.	13	1
201503	2003	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I now expect that the economy will grow about 2.7 percent in 2015.	13	1
201503	2004	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This growth should be sufficiently fast to deliver a further modest decline in the unemployment rate by the end of the year.	13	1
201503	2005	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do expect this decline in the unemployment rate will be associated with an increase in labor input as measured by per capita employment and per capita hours.	13	1
201503	2006	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We may also start to see some upward pressure on labor compensation.	13	1
201503	2007	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But, as I just noted, nominal wage growth, and compensation growth more generally, remain very subdued, even in the relatively healthy labor market of the Ninth District.	13	1
201503	2008	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Overall, I expect the gratifying improvement in labor market outcomes that we saw in 2014 to continue.	13	1
201503	2009	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is important, though, to keep this improvement in perspective: 2014 was one good year, following four disappointing years in the labor market.	13	1
201503	2010	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the context of a very subdued inflation outlook, I believe that we should be doing what we can to deliver more years like 2014.	13	1
201503	2011	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should not be trying to use our tools to choke off the pace of the relatively nascent recovery of the labor market.	13	1
201503	2012	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Reflecting my outlook for prices and employment, my appropriate policy rate path involves deferring liftoff until late 2016.	13	1
201503	2013	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I will leave a full discussion of that until tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2014	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	2015	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201503	2016	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2017	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I have become a bit more worried about the outlook for economic growth, for several reasons.	13	1
201503	2018	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	First, as many have noted, a broad array of indicators have shown less forward momentum right now in terms of economic activity, with real GDP estimates for Q1 and Q2 coming down significantly.	13	1
201503	2019	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Some are taking comfort from the strong recent payroll employment growth trends, and that is a positive.	13	1
201503	2020	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think we actually have a significant conundrum right now.	13	1
201503	2021	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Payroll growth looks to be unsustainably strong in relation to the underlying trend of GDP growth.	13	1
201503	2022	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So the question I would ask is, why couldn’t payroll employment growth falter in response to weaker-than-expected demand rather than demand growth rise in line with recent payroll trends?	13	1
201503	2023	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I was a bit surprised that the Tealbook both revised down its Q2 real GDP growth estimates and revised up its expected payroll gains in Q2.	13	1
201503	2024	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I expect the conundrum to be resolved by some convergence between economic growth and payroll employment growth.	13	1
201503	2025	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t have much confidence about which side is going to bear the brunt of the adjustment.	13	1
201503	2026	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think there are some reasons to be more pessimistic about the outlook for economic growth over the medium term.	13	1
201503	2027	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	One issue we have already talked about is the consequence of the dollar’s persistent strength, which I believe is only just beginning to be felt.	13	1
201503	2028	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	At the previous meeting I said that the dollar’s strength was an important risk to the outlook, and the dollar has appreciated significantly further since that time.	13	1
201503	2029	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This issue seems to be shifting from a risk to a reality.	13	1
201503	2030	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I would encourage the staff to consider in the Tealbook a more extreme scenario with respect to the dollar.	13	1
201503	2031	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I note that right now a much stronger dollar is not one of the alternative scenarios in this meeting’s Tealbook—and that may be an important omission.	13	1
201503	2032	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As Steve Kamin mentioned, the dollar has already moved quite far.	13	1
201503	2033	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	On a broad trade-weighted basis, the US dollar is up about nearly 15 percent over its level last summer.	13	1
201503	2034	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We don’t really understand how negative interest rates and QE are interacting in Europe and what implications these have for capital flows and currency valuation.	13	1
201503	2035	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It may be that European QE shows up in much greater euro currency weakness.	13	1
201503	2036	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	During my trip to Basel 10 days ago, there was considerable discussion about the possibility that there is a strong nonlinearity in terms of investor behavior when the choice shifts from positive to negative interest rates.	13	1
201503	2037	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Apparently, investors will go quite far to avoid negative rates, extending duration or shifting to assets with positive yields in other currencies such as the dollar.	13	1
201503	2038	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, we have seen this aversion to negative yields in terms of our own behavior.	13	1
201503	2039	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The Desk has recommended extending the duration of our foreign exchange reserve investments to mitigate the effect of negative short-term interest rates.	13	1
201503	2040	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The other concern I have about the outlook for economic growth is the consequence of lower oil prices for US oil and gas investment.	13	1
201503	2041	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Here, I think there is a possibility of much more weakness to come.	13	1
201503	2042	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	For several reasons, my expectation is that oil and gas investment will fall much further.	13	1
201503	2043	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	First, US crude oil production and inventories continue to rise.	13	1
201503	2044	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As we have seen over the past few days, this is putting renewed downward pressure on oil prices, especially on West Texas Intermediate.	13	1
201503	2045	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It is true that the rig count has been cut, but the consequences have, so far, been very small, in part because the industry is continuing to become more efficient not only in the cost and speed of drilling each well, but also in how much oil they get from each well.	13	1
201503	2046	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Part of this efficiency is due to better technology and knowledge, and some of this is just greater concentration on the best prospects.	13	1
201503	2047	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The history of natural gas drill counts is informative, I think, because, if you remember, natural gas prices have come down much sooner.	13	1
201503	2048	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The natural gas drill count was 1,606 in September 2008.	13	1
201503	2049	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It is 268 currently.	13	1
201503	2050	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet natural gas production in the United States continues to increase, and prices, despite a very cold winter, remain very low.	13	1
201503	2051	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, as others have noted, there is some risk that if production continues to outstrip demand, the United States will run out of storage capacity, remembering the fact that the United States prohibits the export of crude oil.	13	1
201503	2052	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	If this was the case, we could expect the WTI–Brent spread, currently around $10 a barrel, to widen even further.	13	1
201503	2053	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Of course, if global storage capacity began to run out as well, we could see Brent oil prices falling further, too.	13	1
201503	2054	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	On inflation, I don’t see much that is surprising.	13	1
201503	2055	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Core services prices are rising about 2 percent, but core goods prices are falling.	13	1
201503	2056	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This should persist for some time, as the dollar strength continues to show through.	13	1
201503	2057	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation compensation measures have been bouncing around, seemingly tracking the movement in oil prices, and surveys of inflation expectations remain broadly stable.	13	1
201503	2058	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Nominal wage growth has, perhaps, moved up ever so slightly, but it is still pretty low relative to what one would expect to be consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.	13	1
201503	2059	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the Tealbook forecast is generally a reasonable one with respect to inflation.	13	1
201503	2060	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	The headline and core PCE indexes will fall a bit further over the next few months on a year- over-year basis before bottoming out, we hope, sometime later this year.	13	1
201503	2061	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to New York’s SEP submission, a couple of points are worth noting.	13	1
201503	2062	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	With economic growth slowing, future growth prospects uncertain, and inflation muted, we pushed back our point estimate for the timing of liftoff to September from June.	13	1
201503	2063	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	June is still possible, but I would have to see some evidence of a further tightening of labor markets and decent prospects for economic growth, assuming that inflation was still very muted.	13	1
201503	2064	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We slightly flattened the short-term rate trajectory in 2016 and 2017 to reflect the effect of the dollar’s strength on both economic growth and inflation.	13	1
201503	2065	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We pushed down our medium-term unemployment rate trajectory slightly so that the unemployment rate now dips slightly below our 5 percent estimate of the natural rate.	13	1
201503	2066	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	This would seem like a desirable outcome because it would help pull the long-term unemployed back into the labor market, which would raise the productive capacity of the United States, and it would also help push inflation back faster toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201503	2067	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I would like to raise an issue that I think warrants greater attention:  the very low level of bond term premiums.	13	1
201503	2068	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this topic is worth greater exploration because it represents an important source of uncertainty and risk with respect to the economic outlook, monetary policy, and financial stability.	13	1
201503	2069	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Consider two very different narratives.	13	1
201503	2070	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the first narrative, the bond term premiums stay very low as QE continues in Europe and Japan.	13	1
201503	2071	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, “all else being equal” would imply the need for a more rapid tightening of the US monetary policy.	13	1
201503	2072	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the second case, imagine that bond term premiums snap back to more normal levels.	13	1
201503	2073	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That would imply a less steep path for short-term rates here in the United States, but it would also raise financial-stability risks.	13	1
201503	2074	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In the “stay low” scenario, that has implications for pension funds and financial intermediaries like insurance companies that offer products with minimum guaranteed returns.	13	1
201503	2075	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It can also lead to a “search for yield” behavior to riskier assets and long durations.	13	1
201503	2076	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Conversely, in the “snapback” scenario, the financial-stability risk would arise if bond yields moved up abruptly.	13	1
201503	2077	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is a wild card in the economic outlook that we are going to have to think about as we go forward over the next few months.	13	1
201503	2078	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2079	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	2080	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201503	2081	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2082	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We face two significant puzzles in understanding the current macroeconomic situation.	13	1
201503	2083	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The first is that labor market conditions have been improving impressively.	13	1
201503	2084	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Hiring has been strong.	13	1
201503	2085	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The unemployment rate is getting close to SEP estimates of the natural rate, while both actual and expected GDP growth have been a good deal less impressive.	13	1
201503	2086	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The second is that despite the relatively low rate of unemployment, inflation, even core inflation, expected a year ahead shows few signs of raising its head.	13	1
201503	2087	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Now, by definition, the first puzzle—the difference between GDP growth and employment growth—can be explained by the behavior of productivity, but that just pushes the problem to another question, which is, can we explain the behavior of productivity?	13	1
201503	2088	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That’s difficult.	13	1
201503	2089	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It could be a GDP data problem, one that would lessen as successive GDP data estimates are presented, but I suspect that even the final data will continue to show that productivity growth has fallen dramatically.	13	1
201503	2090	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	This could reflect the mix of economic growth, with employment gains being more weighted than usual to low-tech and low-productivity service jobs.	13	1
201503	2091	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Whatever the source, we should bear in mind the Herbert Stein wisdom that the difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.	13	1
201503	2092	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	This means that the productivity slowdown is a major long-term problem for the United States, but in terms of our target variables, it’s not directly relevant to our immediate policy concerns, which relate to inflation and unemployment.	13	1
201503	2093	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	In the Tealbook, the staff has responded to the latest discrepancy between spending and labor market data by lowering their estimate of structural productivity growth.	13	1
201503	2094	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The staff’s view is that when there appears to be inconsistency between national income and labor market data, the labor market data are generally more reliable.	13	1
201503	2095	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	However, part of the problem may be, as has often been said around the table, that we need to look beyond U-3 to understand labor market developments, perhaps even more than the staff does in the Tealbook.	13	1
201503	2096	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	U-3 was almost certainly not a complete measure of slack in earlier stages of the recovery, but several anomalies are gradually being worked out, be it the long-term unemployment rate or the percentage of those working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201503	2097	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Further, the quits rate has jumped over the past six months.	13	1
201503	2098	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The currently low participation rate is the most important aspect of the employment picture that could give us an extra margin of employment as the economy moves ahead, but the bulk of the decline from a 67 percent to a 62 percent participation rate is explained by demographic factors.	13	1
201503	2099	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Another possibility is that the natural rate of unemployment has been declining to a number that begins with 4, so that the reduction in the unemployment rate has not been as great a reduction in slack as we’ve thought hitherto.	13	1
201503	2100	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	In this case, the unemployment rate will continue to decline if we continue to grow reasonably, but it’s unlikely that it will continue for long to decline at the rate it has over the past two years.	13	1
201503	2101	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That means that we’re getting closer to full resource utilization.	13	1
201503	2102	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	On the inflation front, we can be reasonably confident that we’ll see an increase in inflation before too long.	13	1
201503	2103	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, the headline inflation figures will be aided by a turnaround in oil prices, or at least by a decline in the rate at which oil prices might continue falling.	13	1
201503	2104	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The effect of the appreciation of the dollar on domestic prices will stop after the dollar stops appreciating, but that date is harder to forecast because of the well-known overshooting phenomenon.	13	1
201503	2105	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, the staff’s projection that core import prices will resume increasing late this year is plausible.	13	1
201503	2106	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The staff’s forecast that core inflation will reach 1.6 percent in 2016 means that we may be close to our target inflation rate by the end of next year.	13	1
201503	2107	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The fan charts on page 74 of Tealbook, Book A, suggest that the probability of core inflation being at 2 percent or more by the end of 2016 is somewhere around 35 to 40 percent.	13	1
201503	2108	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I have two more topics before concluding.	13	1
201503	2109	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	First, why are real wages not rising as we approach the natural rate of unemployment?	13	1
201503	2110	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Well, they might be, as the box on page 24 of Tealbook, Book A, and evidence from outside the Fed suggests.	13	1
201503	2111	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	And some of the reports we’ve heard today also suggest that.	13	1
201503	2112	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, real wages may be rising only slowly because productivity growth has been low, or, as mentioned a second ago, the natural rate might be lower than we recognize.	13	1
201503	2113	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Second, what about the headwinds?	13	1
201503	2114	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Some of the headwinds may be turning into tailwinds.	13	1
201503	2115	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Most important of those is that there is far less pessimism and even some optimism about European economic growth than there was only a few months ago, and similarly for Japanese growth.	13	1
201503	2116	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	There are also the promising fragments of information we’ve received during the briefings from the presidents of the Reserve Banks, including that on household formation, which is very interesting.	13	1
201503	2117	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But some headwinds remain.	13	1
201503	2118	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The most important among them is the appreciation of the dollar, the slowdown in Chinese economic growth, and the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro area.	13	1
201503	2119	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I am reasonably confident that inflation will continue moving back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term, and that the unemployment rate is getting closer to the natural rate, but more on that and the other factors relevant to our policy decisions tomorrow.	13	1
201503	2120	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2121	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	2122	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201503	2123	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2124	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Up until quite recently, I thought I was going to devote the bulk of my remarks today to various labor market issues—downward nominal wage rigidity, the shape of the Phillips curve, and the like.	13	1
201503	2125	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	There’ll probably be plenty of time to return to those issues in April.	13	1
201503	2126	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So instead I wanted to comment, like President Dudley, on some reasons, perhaps, for a bit of caution right now.	13	1
201503	2127	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Over the course of the past couple of weeks, I’ve been struck by two things:  one, the degree to which actual as well as likely international developments are increasing downside risks; and, two, the little burst of domestic data suggesting that there may be some pause in what heretofore has been a basically improving economic situation.	13	1
201503	2128	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Beginning with the external risks, which we have been discussing regularly in recent meetings, I believe we’ve seen basically unchanged risk associated with the extent of China’s growth slowdown and with geopolitical tensions on a number of Russia’s borders.	13	1
201503	2129	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think those have changed very much one way or the other in the intermeeting period.	13	1
201503	2130	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I do think—as several of you, most recently Stan, have noted—that chances of a Greek exit from the euro zone have been rising even since the four-month extension.	13	1
201503	2131	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The seeming inability of the Greek government to navigate between domestic and international expectations has brought discussions almost to a standstill.	13	1
201503	2132	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And there have been more than a few hints that at least some other euro- zone countries believe a Greek exit would actually be beneficial for the euro zone over the medium term by removing it as a distraction and allowing them to attend to ongoing structural issues and relationships.	13	1
201503	2133	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	As Steve Kamin noted in his briefing, there is still a fairly widespread view that a Greek exit would be manageable and would not have contagion consequences in peripheral, much less all of, Europe.	13	1
201503	2134	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But I think I’ll have to acknowledge that that may not be the case.	13	1
201503	2135	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In fact, if it turns out that there are consequences, the fact that everybody has been assuming there are no consequences might make the reaction even stronger because people have not been hedging against that eventuality.	13	1
201503	2136	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	An additional international issue—which is, I think, beginning to loom a bit larger—is the situation in Brazil.	13	1
201503	2137	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	To date, Brazil’s problems have been associated with commodity price declines, the rise in the dollar, and domestic political turmoil.	13	1
201503	2138	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	All of those carry at least some risk of spilling over into the international financial sector if, as appears at least possible, large Brazilian companies have difficulty servicing their external debts—in particular, obviously, dollar-denominated external debts.	13	1
201503	2139	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Brazil is not a small emerging market, so if tensions and problems do begin to rise there, we may see some spillover in other parts of Latin America.	13	1
201503	2140	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Speaking of a strong dollar, we now, as Vice Chairman Dudley has just noted, may be seeing its having shifted from a downside risk to a reality of a drag on economic growth.	13	1
201503	2141	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The disappointing numbers on industrial production and manufacturing probably reflect that most directly.	13	1
201503	2142	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think it’s important to note that the significance of the strengthening of the dollar does depend substantially on the reasons why that strengthening is taking place and the background economic context for the strengthening.	13	1
201503	2143	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	When in the 1990s the dollar was strengthening, it was against the backdrop of really quite strong US growth—including productivity growth, GDP growth, and employment growth—and it was almost as if dollar assets were sucking in investment funds from all over the world.	13	1
201503	2144	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	People wanted to be in the US stock market.	13	1
201503	2145	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	They wanted to be making foreign direct investments in the United States.	13	1
201503	2146	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Today the strength of the dollar is arising largely from, you might say, relative US strength, but it’s basically due to QE in Europe and in Japan and other manifestations of what is really weakness internationally.	13	1
201503	2147	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Under these circumstances, the implications of a stronger dollar are not so favorable at all.	13	1
201503	2148	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think that there are at least three reasons to expect that the dollar strengthening may continue, and that it may continue to a greater extent than is incorporated into the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201503	2149	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	First, it’s not uncommon for sharp changes in exchange rates to continue well beyond what even reassessed fundamentals would have suggested.	13	1
201503	2150	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	There are momentum trades in which people just get caught up in the direction of bets, and they sometimes overshoot.	13	1
201503	2151	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Second, as I was alluding to with Brazil, under conditions of the dollar strengthening, those abroad who hold dollar-denominated debts sometimes find it more difficult to roll those debts over.	13	1
201503	2152	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thus, they’re required to go out and get dollars by selling domestic resources, which, of course, strengthens the dollar.	13	1
201503	2153	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Third—and this goes back to China—as my little colloquy with Steve Kamin during the staff briefing suggested, I think it’s quite likely that China is going to change its exchange rate policies in reaction to a sustained dollar appreciation, and that they will change the band so the renminbi continues to appreciate on a global trade-weighted basis but will depreciate against the dollar.	13	1
201503	2154	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	That, I believe, is going to actually be a stronger response to the degree that the dollar itself continues to appreciate.	13	1
201503	2155	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	For all of those reasons, I think it’s more than a small possibility that dollar strengthening continues beyond what’s projected in the Tealbook.	13	1
201503	2156	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s the international side, and I count the dollar as mostly an externally driven phenomenon for these purposes.	13	1
201503	2157	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Unlike the past couple of months, when the dollar’s strength seemed to be the only significant warning sign for the domestic economy, a recent string of data at least gives some grounds for pause about how we’re doing domestically as well.	13	1
201503	2158	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	And I would say that, since that very strong jobs report earlier in the month, just about every number has been disappointing.	13	1
201503	2159	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	David Wilcox, I believe, mentioned the retail sales numbers, which probably ought to apply a discount factor based on weather, although, as President Bullard said, almost nobody thinks the weather nationally was quite as bad as it was last year.	13	1
201503	2160	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Regarding household spending expectations—now, this is survey based, to be sure, and so it’s probably deserving to be discounted—it’s worth noting that they have fallen to their lowest levels of the past couple of years.	13	1
201503	2161	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Housing starts and permits were disappointing, as reported this morning.	13	1
201503	2162	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Business fixed investment is still sluggish, although here it may be that the decline in energy-related investment may be masking some overall improvement.	13	1
201503	2163	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, I noted that the shipments diffusion index for nondefense capital goods is down close to its lowest level since the crisis.	13	1
201503	2164	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Now, this is a pretty volatile series, but it is an interesting window, again, into the expectations of business as to economic growth over the next couple of years.	13	1
201503	2165	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Taken alone and maybe even taken together, each of these pieces of data may turn out to be more noise than trend.	13	1
201503	2166	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But, against the backdrop of global disinflation and the various downside global risks, it’s at least possible that the decent, though still unspectacular, momentum of the past year may have slowed some.	13	1
201503	2167	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think that’s probably something that’s going to be of more consequence to us over the next couple of meetings if, as I assume, we’re going to remove “patient” from the statement beginning tomorrow.	13	1
201503	2168	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2169	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	2170	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201503	2171	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2172	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	As far as the overall development of the economy since the January meeting is concerned, we’ve had two stronger-than-expected employment reports balanced—and probably more than balanced—by a run of weaker data that suggests a modest weakening, let’s call it, including the February retail sales; the weak manufacturing reading; producer prices; and a weakening in consumer sentiment, as shown in the Michigan survey.	13	1
201503	2173	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	The dollar has increased well beyond expectations, with net exports now forecast to subtract 1 full percentage point from this year’s GDP, and there’s a risk that, as we move or seem to move toward liftoff, the dollar will continue to strengthen.	13	1
201503	2174	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, the picture in Europe seems to me at least a little bit brighter.	13	1
201503	2175	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Lower oil prices and the weaker euro are providing a lift to sentiment in Europe, and, to the extent that that narrative plays out, in time it should limit further upward moves of the dollar, at least relative to the euro.	13	1
201503	2176	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Oil prices rose after the January meeting but have now essentially returned to their lows, particularly for WTI.	13	1
201503	2177	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	There’s good reason to think that that will continue as we come close to running out of storage in the United States.	13	1
201503	2178	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Overall, I continue to see the picture as a positive one, although slightly weaker.	13	1
201503	2179	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Low oil prices will support consumer confidence and spending, and they’ll also hold down inflation, perhaps for a little while longer than we expect.	13	1
201503	2180	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I think we will see continued strong job growth, which is based on stronger business confidence, and that will also support consumer spending.	13	1
201503	2181	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I believe the dollar is going to be a significant headwind and threatens to be an even bigger one.	13	1
201503	2182	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, it has been interesting to watch the co-movement of rates, the dollar, breakevens, and the price of oil in the intermeeting period and before that.	13	1
201503	2183	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Of course, the spot price of oil tells us nothing about inflation 5 to 10 years ahead, which does tell me that the longer-term breakevens need to be taken with a grain of salt.	13	1
201503	2184	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	The pattern supports the view expressed in one of the memos that a lot of the movement of long-term rates—and breakevens, in particular—has been driven by global events and global flows, which probably don’t have important long-term implications for inflation expectations.	13	1
201503	2185	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	That’s not to express great confidence in the situation regarding inflation, but just to say I don’t think there’s a big signal in breakevens.	13	1
201503	2186	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And I admit that’s far from certain and will need careful monitoring.	13	1
201503	2187	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I have a couple of points on my SEP submissions.	13	1
201503	2188	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I did lower my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment to 5 percent.	13	1
201503	2189	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I did reduce my estimate of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate to 3½ percent.	13	1
201503	2190	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	My GDP forecast is very much in line with the Tealbook, but I think there’s a reasonable likelihood that unemployment will decline more than the Tealbook forecast, given the GDP and payroll forecasts.	13	1
201503	2191	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	So I have actually forecast that the headline unemployment rate will decline all the way to 4.9 percent this year, conditional on the GDP and payroll numbers.	13	1
201503	2192	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	It’s worth pointing out that payroll numbers in the second half of this year are about 210,000 per month, which is certainly lower than the level of recent history and—as President George, I think, pointed out—lower than the level of the past 24 months.	13	1
201503	2193	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	To conclude, as a modal case, I do see inflation returning to 2 percent as the unemployment rate declines to around 5 percent.	13	1
201503	2194	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I’m reasonably confident that we will see an increase in inflation later this year, but I would emphasize that it’s actually, to me, very notable how much uncertainty there is around the inflation creation process as well as the natural rate of unemployment, both of which are tremendously important in the short term.	13	1
201503	2195	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In fact, I would say that I found some real attraction in the alternative scenario that the staff offered at our Board meeting on Monday.	13	1
201503	2196	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In that scenario—this echoes what Governor Fischer was talking about— the natural rate declines further to 4¼ percent; productivity and economic growth are a little bit higher; and inflation is a little bit lower, thanks to the wider unemployment gap.	13	1
201503	2197	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Now, that’s not just a more pleasant way to align the output and unemployment gaps.	13	1
201503	2198	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	It is certainly that.	13	1
201503	2199	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	But it also strikes me as not at all wildly implausible.	13	1
201503	2200	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	So I think that, as we get closer to full employment, the level and character of these supply-side constraints become ever more important.	13	1
201503	2201	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, I see the main risk to the economy coming from events abroad, particularly strength in the dollar and an exit of Greece from the euro, which might be managed well enough to avoid a catastrophe—at least for the euro system, if not for Greece.	13	1
201503	2202	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	But, in the meantime, it would almost certainly be a material setback for the recovery in Europe and for our economy.	13	1
201503	2203	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	So I think those risks underscore the need to be sure that we aren’t normalizing into a weakening economy, and I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow.	13	1
201503	2204	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2205	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201503	2206	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201503	2207	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2208	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, we’ve seen further divergence in the two legs of our dual mandate.	13	1
201503	2209	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Employment has shown further strong gains, while inflation has softened further away from the 2 percent target.	13	1
201503	2210	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	My outlook for the economy has darkened somewhat, in light of the strong headwinds from the continued appreciation of the dollar and lackluster domestic spending.	13	1
201503	2211	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The news received from the labor market has been positive and continues to suggest that the economy is moving closer to our goal.	13	1
201503	2212	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Since we last met, the data for January and February and the revisions to previous months paint a noticeably stronger picture of employment growth.	13	1
201503	2213	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, payroll growth is now reported to have averaged 280,000 in the second half of last year and appears to have maintained that pace into the current quarter.	13	1
201503	2214	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Since December, measures of labor utilization have all improved:  The unemployment rate has edged lower, the participation rate has moved up, and the number of employed working part time for economic reasons has declined.	13	1
201503	2215	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, the news on inflation suggests that it remains stubbornly low relative to our 2 percent target.	13	1
201503	2216	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent declines in headline PCE inflation over the past several months are largely due to previous large declines in crude oil prices.	13	1
201503	2217	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Once those price movements bottom out, we might expect to see headline prices moving fairly close to the underlying rate of core inflation, but the underlying rate of core inflation is also quite low, according to the recent data.	13	1
201503	2218	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE prices in January was 1.3 percent, similar to the rate a year ago, and higher-frequency measures are even lower.	13	1
201503	2219	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In that regard, I note that even the three-month change in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean rate was only 0.7 percent.	13	1
201503	2220	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Obviously, one possible way to reconcile the disconnect between employment and wage and price developments is that the natural rate of unemployment may be lower than many observers have been assuming, and that the participation rate gap may be greater.	13	1
201503	2221	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, that inflation and wages have increased little or not at all over a time when resources, by many measures, have moved much closer to full utilization suggests we may be further away from full employment.	13	1
201503	2222	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Consistent with that hypothesis, a shift in the demographic profile of our workforce would be in keeping with a reduction in the natural rate, and there may be some structural aftereffects of the financial crisis that also support that story.	13	1
201503	2223	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In recent months, we’ve seen some crosscurrents among the components of aggregate demand domestically.	13	1
201503	2224	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	On the positive end of the spectrum, consumer spending appears to have increased robustly at the end of last year.	13	1
201503	2225	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Although auto and retail sales softened in February— perhaps in part because of adverse weather—strong job growth, the effect of lower oil prices on real incomes, and increased confidence all point in the direction of supporting consumer spending.	13	1
201503	2226	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But the other components of domestic aggregate demand appear quite tepid.	13	1
201503	2227	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Residential investment remains very weak, as shown by the most recent data on housing starts.	13	1
201503	2228	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, we all keep holding out hope that low levels of homeownership and some hopeful signs on household formation still point toward the possibility that pent-up demand will start to materialize.	13	1
201503	2229	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment looks to increase only modestly this year, particularly with lower oil prices pushing down drilling investment.	13	1
201503	2230	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	And, of course, government spending, while not subtracting from economic growth, is also not likely to add much.	13	1
201503	2231	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Against this, net exports are exerting a material drag on GDP growth.	13	1
201503	2232	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The broad nominal dollar has appreciated more than 15 percent since June of last year, and with that appreciation has come a sharp reduction in the contribution of net exports.	13	1
201503	2233	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, we haven’t seen as strong a negative effect from dollar appreciation and a decline in net exports for more than a decade.	13	1
201503	2234	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In the Tealbook projections, net exports take away 1 percentage point from real GDP growth this year and next.	13	1
201503	2235	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, the direction of aggregate spending over the next year may largely reflect the outcome of a “tug of war” between domestic consumer spending and net exports.	13	1
201503	2236	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The hopeful scenario is that faster consumer spending will outweigh the downward pull of an appreciating dollar and that resource utilization will continue to increase.	13	1
201503	2237	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But there are risks, I think, on both sides.	13	1
201503	2238	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	On the upside, the advent of quantitative easing in Europe may finally lead to a convincing recovery, a noticeable increase in inflation and inflation expectations, and a stabilization or even some reversal of recent gains in the dollar.	13	1
201503	2239	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, the effect of QE on asset prices in Europe is promising.	13	1
201503	2240	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	One could even imagine that, further out in the medium term, faster foreign economic growth leads to reversals in both energy prices and previous gains in the dollar.	13	1
201503	2241	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Such a confluence of events could push inflation higher, with the attendant implications for monetary policy.	13	1
201503	2242	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	On the downside, however, the effect of quantitative easing on European domestic demand may be somewhat attenuated due to the very bankcentric nature of the financial system in the euro area.	13	1
201503	2243	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Furthermore, many interest rates in the euro zone are now negative, and there’s considerable uncertainty about the effect of negative interest rates on activity, particularly as they fall further.	13	1
201503	2244	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	This greater uncertainty, together with the ongoing uncertainty about the outcome of difficult negotiations between Greece and its creditors, suggests sizable downside risks.	13	1
201503	2245	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	It is also striking that the dollar appreciated substantially further on the commencement of asset purchases in the euro area, even though the markets had already been largely exposed to all of the details surrounding the implementation of quantitative easing.	13	1
201503	2246	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	This, together with a continued large gap in longer-term interest rates between the United States and other advanced foreign economies—as well as the potential for China to adjust its currency—suggests that the upward movements in the dollar could well continue and be larger and more persistent, even, than in the Tealbook baseline.	13	1
201503	2247	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	This could act as a significant headwind for economic activity and put further downward pressure on inflation—both indirectly, through lower resource utilization, and directly, through its effects on core import prices.	13	1
201503	2248	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s judgmental estimate is that a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar reduces core import prices by 3 percentage points and PCE prices by 0.3 percentage point over the course of a year or so.	13	1
201503	2249	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But there’s considerable uncertainty regarding the magnitude of import price pass-through.	13	1
201503	2250	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	And plausible empirical estimates, as well as the staff’s SIGMA model, suggest that the effect could be much larger.	13	1
201503	2251	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	These risks make it considerably less likely we will see evidence by June that will enable us to feel reasonably confident inflation is moving back to its target, a theme I think we will return to tomorrow in our discussion of monetary policy.	13	1
201503	2252	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201503	2253	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much, and my thanks to everyone for another interesting round of observations on the economic outlook.	13	1
201503	2254	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, I will try to summarize briefly some of the main themes in the go-round, and then I’d like to add some remarks of my own.	13	1
201503	2255	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, I think everyone agrees that labor market conditions are continuing to improve.	13	1
201503	2256	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We see broad evidence of that in a range of indicators as well as in anecdotal reports.	13	1
201503	2257	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	It is, of course, a very welcome development.	13	1
201503	2258	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Most important, payroll gains have speeded up over the past three months in spite of harsh winter weather in much of the country.	13	1
201503	2259	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate has been moving down, and broader measures of labor underutilization, such as U-6, have declined by similar amounts.	13	1
201503	2260	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Labor force participation has moved sideways.	13	1
201503	2261	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But, as some of you noted, the fact that it’s held steady rather than declining further in line with demographic trends represents an improvement of sorts.	13	1
201503	2262	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And some of you mentioned that surveys of job market perceptions remain strong.	13	1
201503	2263	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In spite of the decline in the unemployment rate, all but two of you, based on your SEPs, continue to think that some slack remains in the labor market.	13	1
201503	2264	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Interestingly, quite a few of you revised down your estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate this round.	13	1
201503	2265	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Wage developments garnered a good deal of discussion.	13	1
201503	2266	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Measures such as average hourly earnings, hourly compensation, and the ECI all continue to show sluggish nominal gains of around 2 percent or so, well below levels that could ultimately be consistent with 2 percent inflation and trend productivity growth.	13	1
201503	2267	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But, as discussed in the Tealbook box—and a number of you mentioned this—business surveys are finding that wage increases among firms are becoming larger and more prevalent, and that result seems to be consistent with many reports that you’re hearing from your business contacts.	13	1
201503	2268	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That evidence suggests that a pickup in nominal wage growth may be under way, although there were also comments suggesting that the pickup in wage growth is still not broad based and is confined to some specific sectors.	13	1
201503	2269	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to developments in the broader economy, I heard general agreement that the current readings on overall activity have, on balance, moderated since the January meeting, and a number of indicators have come in quite a bit softer than expected.	13	1
201503	2270	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you noted that prospects for GDP growth over the rest of the year and beyond now look a little less favorable than in December partly because of dollar appreciation, but also some of you have lowered your estimates of trend growth.	13	1
201503	2271	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think most of you, though, continue to view the outlook as still sufficiently favorable to support continued improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201503	2272	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you cited consumer spending as a bright spot for the economy, reflecting low gas prices, rising employment and wealth, and other factors.	13	1
201503	2273	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But there is the caveat that we’ve had three disappointing retail sales reports.	13	1
201503	2274	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you mentioned harsh winter weather, and that could be a factor.	13	1
201503	2275	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In other areas, though, we are seeing weakness.	13	1
201503	2276	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The recovery in the housing market remains quite sluggish.	13	1
201503	2277	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you mentioned that nonresidential business investment seems as though it’s weakening further, in large part reflecting lower oil prices and reduced drilling activity, and some of you noted that this is something that could intensify over time.	13	1
201503	2278	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you commented on the likely influence of the marked dollar appreciation we’ve seen, the fact that it’s already affecting foreign trade, and the possibility that the dollar could continue to appreciate further from present levels.	13	1
201503	2279	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Export growth appears to have slowed markedly, and the appreciated dollar is likely to have a persistent effect.	13	1
201503	2280	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the other side, some of you mentioned slightly stronger economic growth in places like Europe, in part due to the ECB actions.	13	1
201503	2281	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, there was a lot of concern about downside risks from developments in the global economy, including ongoing risks related to China and Russia; renewed and perhaps intensified risks relating to Greece; and mention of Brazil and other countries for which a strong dollar could affect corporations that have borrowed in dollars, and from which we could see defaults and spillovers.	13	1
201503	2282	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, incoming data was roughly as the staff expected.	13	1
201503	2283	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think we all anticipate that inflation will run well below our 2 percent goal in the near term because of earlier declines in energy prices and decreases in core import prices.	13	1
201503	2284	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But most of you don’t see incoming data as materially affecting the longer-run outlook.	13	1
201503	2285	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Overall, I heard general agreement that inflation is likely to move back toward 2 percent over the next few years as the effects of low energy prices and dollar appreciation fade and as the labor market continues to improve.	13	1
201503	2286	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you expressed confidence in your outlook that inflation will return to 2 percent.	13	1
201503	2287	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	However, a number of you also expressed some doubt about that as well as a lack of confidence in this forecast.	13	1
201503	2288	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you, in expressing doubts, pointed to price and wage developments and the fact that core inflation is moving down.	13	1
201503	2289	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, a number of you commented on the fact that, even though survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations have largely remained stable, it is concerning, at least to some of you, that market- based measures of inflation compensation, after a short-lived rise, have declined more or less back to the level we saw at the previous meeting.	13	1
201503	2290	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly what’s going on there is hard to determine.	13	1
201503	2291	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	It’s a little bit perplexing that there seems to be such a strong correlation of this measure of inflation compensation with oil prices and the dollar.	13	1
201503	2292	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, for some of you, it is a significant concern and points toward a possible loss of credibility of the Committee in meeting its inflation commitments.	13	1
201503	2293	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201503	2294	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Would anyone like to comment on that summary?	13	1
201503	2295	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201503	2296	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Then, if I might, I’d like to add some comments of my own.	13	1
201503	2297	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Like everyone else, I see solid evidence that the labor market is improving, and that we’re drawing closer to normal conditions.	13	1
201503	2298	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But, like many of you, I, too, think we still have a ways to go.	13	1
201503	2299	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Like quite a few of you, I also estimate that the natural rate of unemployment is at 5 percent.	13	1
201503	2300	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I note that the Beveridge curve has yet to shift all of the way back to its pre-crisis position.	13	1
201503	2301	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Even so, I see that the evidence overall is relatively thin that the natural rate is higher now than it was prior to the financial crisis.	13	1
201503	2302	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	While I recognize that there are alternative explanations for continued subdued growth in wages, I take that as some evidence of a good bit of remaining slack.	13	1
201503	2303	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, labor market slack is showing up in forms that are not included in U-3, particularly involuntary part-time employment and depressed labor force participation.	13	1
201503	2304	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The spread between the broadest measure of labor market underutilization, the U-6 rate, and the conventional unemployment rate is currently 1¾ percentage points higher than the average spread in the years preceding the recession.	13	1
201503	2305	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So even when the unemployment rate reaches its normal longer-run level, the labor market will still be putting downward pressure on inflation until this spread is returned to normal.	13	1
201503	2306	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to the outlook for economic growth, I’m reasonably optimistic that real GDP will expand sufficiently fast this year to enable further progress toward our maximum employment goal, but not all of the indicators are favorable.	13	1
201503	2307	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	My optimism about the near-term outlook for real activity rests in large part on factors like rising employment, low gas prices, expanding household wealth, and a marked improvement in consumer confidence.	13	1
201503	2308	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m cautiously optimistic that these same factors, coupled with low mortgage rates and demographic pressures, will enable a somewhat faster pace of recovery in the housing market.	13	1
201503	2309	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But I am concerned that other factors, particularly the dollar appreciation and weak activity abroad, will constrain overall GDP growth and net exports.	13	1
201503	2310	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I, too, am concerned that the tone of recent spending and production indicators has been weaker than I expected, and I am worried about the disappointing string of retail sales reports.	13	1
201503	2311	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, I continue to expect inflation to move up gradually to 2 percent over the next few years as the labor market tightens.	13	1
201503	2312	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The core price data have come in roughly as I expected, at least after adjusting for the one-time effect of the surprise in ACA reimbursements.	13	1
201503	2313	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And survey-based measures of expected inflation have stayed stable, even though, as we discussed, market-based measures remain very low.	13	1
201503	2314	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As Simon Potter noted earlier, the correlation of recent movements in inflation compensation with recent shifts in oil prices suggests that the decline in inflation compensation may reflect some type of over- extrapolation by investors of what presumably are transitory effects of shifts in energy prices.	13	1
201503	2315	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	If we adopt alternative B, one criterion for an initial tightening is that we need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	13	1
201503	2316	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	For the remainder of this year, my guess is that it will be hard to point to data demonstrating that inflation is actually moving up toward our objective.	13	1
201503	2317	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Measured on a 12-month basis, both core and headline inflation will very likely be running below 1½ percent all year.	13	1
201503	2318	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That means that if we decide to start tightening later this year, a development that I think is likely, we will have to justify our inflation forecasts using indirect evidence, historical experience, and economic theory.	13	1
201503	2319	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The argument from history and economic theory seems straightforward.	13	1
201503	2320	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Experience here and abroad teaches us that, as resource utilization tightens, eventually inflation will begin to rise.	13	1
201503	2321	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	To me, this seems like a simple matter of demand and supply.	13	1
201503	2322	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So the more labor and product markets tighten, the more confident I’ll become in the inflation outlook.	13	1
201503	2323	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Because of the lags in monetary policy, the current high degree of monetary accommodation, and the speed at which the unemployment rate is coming down, it would, to my mind, be imprudent to wait until inflation is much closer to 2 percent to begin to normalize policy.	13	1
201503	2324	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I consider this a strong argument for an initial tightening with inflation still at low levels, and it’s one that I plan to make.	13	1
201503	2325	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But I also recognize and am concerned that, at least in recent years, the empirical relationship between slack and inflation has been quite weak.	13	1
201503	2326	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The argument from indirect evidence will be more complicated.	13	1
201503	2327	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	One important thing to point to, I hope, will be the continued stability of survey measures of expected inflation, and I would certainly welcome seeing a backup in market-based measures of inflation compensation that would improve my confidence.	13	1
201503	2328	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll also feel more confident in the inflation outlook if any downward movements we see in core inflation can be relatively easily attributed to movements in energy prices and the dollar, which I expect to be transitory.	13	1
201503	2329	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thus far, as the nicely done box in the Tealbook on the topic discussed, it looks as though the pass-through of energy prices to core inflation has been quite small.	13	1
201503	2330	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The appreciation of the dollar is holding down import prices, and that’s already showing up in goods prices such as those for apparel, which has a relatively high import content.	13	1
201503	2331	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	However, price increases for items with low import content, such as non- energy services, have been little changed over the past year.	13	1
201503	2332	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	This pattern has two implications for our communications.	13	1
201503	2333	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First, we can probably point to these data and stable inflation expectations as evidence that we don’t face a growing persistent deflation problem.	13	1
201503	2334	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Second, if the dollar doesn’t keep rising, then we should see inflation in these import-intensive categories moving back up over time.	13	1
201503	2335	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the behavior of wages, many observers are arguing that we should hold off tightening as long as nominal wage gains remain low, because that’s prima facie evidence that considerable slack remains in the economy.	13	1
201503	2336	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Some have gone further and urged that we hold off tightening until real wages are growing more in line with trend productivity, something many models view as a basic equilibrium condition.	13	1
201503	2337	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Although, in common with the Tealbook projection, I expect nominal wage growth to move up over time, I intend to resist establishing faster wage growth as a prerequisite for an initial tightening, for several reasons.	13	1
201503	2338	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First, we don’t know what trend productivity growth is or will be, so we cannot be sure what the equilibrium rate of real wage growth should be.	13	1
201503	2339	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Second, real wage gains have been falling short of estimates of trend productivity growth for at least the past 15 years for reasons that are not fully understood but are presumably exogenous with regard to monetary policy, and these may continue into the future.	13	1
201503	2340	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Third, downward nominal wage rigidity may have given rise to pent-up real wage cuts that could restrain wage growth for some time to come.	13	1
201503	2341	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, the evidence that nominal wages are a useful predictor for future price inflation simply isn’t very strong.	13	1
201503	2342	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	My final point is that, as we all know, liftoff is only the first step toward policy normalization, and I plan to emphasize in my own communications that even after liftoff, policy is likely to remain very accommodative for quite some time.	13	1
201503	2343	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and inquire about your preference:  We could ask Thomas to give his briefing for the monetary policy round, if you have patience for a bit longer, or we could defer until tomorrow morning.	13	1
201503	2344	2015-03-18	meeting	VARIOUS PARTICIPANTS	Defer.	2	2
201503	2345	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Defer?	2	2
201503	2346	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m glad to see the patience in the group.	2	2
201503	2347	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	2	2
201503	2348	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	How come we don’t have patience?	2	2
201503	2349	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201503	2350	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll defer, and we will also take up, first thing in the morning, the resolution on quarter-end term RRP testing.	2	2
201503	2351	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’re starting at 9:00 am tomorrow.	2	2
201503	2352	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The resolution has already been voted on.	2	2
201503	2353	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	We’ll take up the minutes part.	2	2
201503	2354	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	2	2
201503	2355	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That’s right.	2	2
201503	2356	2015-03-18	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201503	2357	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	March 18 Session .	2	2
201503	2358	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks, let’s get going.	2	2
201503	2359	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to start this morning by revisiting the proposed March minutes language on the additional points concerning normalization, and I’m going to turn this over to Thomas.	96	9
201503	2360	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201503	2361	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	You have in front of you a handout titled “Revised Proposed March Minutes Language,” which represents our best effort at threading the needle.	96	9
201503	2362	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	First, you see there two changes in red—namely, a change from “will” to “intends to,” which participants already agreed to yesterday.	96	9
201503	2363	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Then two changes are noted in the final bullet.	96	9
201503	2364	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That sentence is still in there.	96	9
201503	2365	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	It includes the “fairly soon” language, but it does add that “the Committee expects that it will be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility fairly soon,” which indicates that there would be an assessment on the part of the Committee.	96	9
201503	2366	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	We also propose to strike the word “available” since, actually, the term “available capacity” had not been used earlier in these bullets.	96	9
201503	2367	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The beginning of that final bullet speaks about aggregate capacity, and it seemed to be simpler to just talk about capacity here.	96	9
201503	2368	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201503	2369	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any comments?	96	9
201503	2370	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201503	2371	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	2372	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Then I’d like to ask for a show of hands among all participants.	96	9
201503	2373	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to take a straw poll here to find out who supports this language being added to our normalization principles.	96	9
201503	2374	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Can you raise your hand if you’re supportive?	96	9
201503	2375	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	96	9
201503	2376	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	2377	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And is there anyone who is not?	96	9
201503	2378	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201503	2379	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201503	2380	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, it looks as though we have unanimous support.	96	9
201503	2381	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all, for cooperating on this.	96	9
201503	2382	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s now move to our policy round, and Thomas will begin it with his briefing.	21	2
201503	2383	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201503	2384	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Before I launch into my briefing, I just wanted to point out that you also have in front of you a handout titled “Updated SEP Information.”	21	2
201503	2385	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	There were two changes to projections between Don’s presentation yesterday and this handout.	21	2
201503	2386	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	One participant lowered their federal funds rate at the end of 2015 by 25 basis points, so one of the dots at the end of 2015 shifted down by 25 basis points.	21	2
201503	2387	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	And one participant reduced the unemployment rate projection for the end of 2015 by 0.1 percentage point.	21	2
201503	2388	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That changes, actually, the range of the unemployment rate projections by the end of 2015.	21	2
201503	2389	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	What you have in front of you are the exhibits as they will be shown at the press conference and as they will be made available to the public at 2:00 pm  So the dot plot no longer shows the 7 The materials used by Mr Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 7). medians and central tendencies of the Taylor rule prescriptions that Don showed yesterday.	21	2
201503	2390	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That provides me also with a segue into my briefing, and I would like to direct you to the material that was distributed yesterday, “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201503	2391	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I should mention that the material that you find on exhibit 1 does not reflect these two changes that I just pointed out, but they would affect the results that I’m showing in this exhibit only by a very small amount.	21	2
201503	2392	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	As Don Kim noted in his briefing, many of you made downward revisions to your projected federal funds rate paths.	21	2
201503	2393	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The upper-left panel of your first exhibit presents, in somewhat different form, the same information that Don showed in the fourth exhibit of his briefing, the one that included the median dots and central tendencies of the Taylor rule prescriptions.	21	2
201503	2394	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, I first calculate for each of you the values for the federal funds rate at the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017 that a noninertial Taylor (1999) rule, shown to the right, would prescribe based on your individual estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate and your projections for core PCE inflation and the unemployment rate through 2017.	21	2
201503	2395	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So the symbols in the Taylor rule shown to the right—the symbol 𝜋𝜋 denotes four-quarter core PCE inflation, and the letter u stands for the unemployment rate.	21	2
201503	2396	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In these calculations, I use your estimates of the longer-run real federal funds rate as intercepts, the r*LR.	21	2
201503	2397	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I then subtract these prescriptions from your actual projections for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201503	2398	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The median difference between your projections and the rule’s prescriptions is close to minus 1½ percentage points in 2015 and 2016, as shown by the blue dots to the left; by 2017, it narrows to about minus ½ percentage point.	21	2
201503	2399	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The differences in 2015 are, on average, slightly smaller than they were in your December projections, and in 2016 and 2017, they are slightly larger.	21	2
201503	2400	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Given these sizable differences, it might appear that your policy projections imply a high degree of policy accommodation, perhaps reflecting considerations such as an assessment that risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain asymmetric as long as the federal funds rate is at the lower bound.	21	2
201503	2401	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	But are these shortfalls relative to the Taylor (1999) benchmark a good measure of the degree of monetary accommodation implied by your projections?	21	2
201503	2402	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	To answer this question, I use a version of a textbook, as it’s called, IS equation, shown in the middle panel, which relates the unemployment gap (u minus u*), as a measure of the cyclical position of the economy, to the real rate gap, defined as the deviation of the real federal funds rate (r) from a time-varying equilibrium level (r*).	21	2
201503	2403	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the equation, this equilibrium real rate has the property that, if the actual real rate was kept at its equilibrium level, over time the unemployment gap would close.	21	2
201503	2404	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, in this set-up, the equilibrium real rate is a medium-run concept that varies over time, capturing persistent shifts in the position of the IS curve.	21	2
201503	2405	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I estimate the coefficients on the lagged unemployment gap and the lagged real rate gap in this equation using historical data for the fourth quarter of each year so as to be consistent with the data that you provide in your SEPs.	21	2
201503	2406	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I use the staff’s historical estimates for u* and estimates for r* taken from the model that President Williams and I developed some years ago.	21	2
201503	2407	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	With these coefficients in hand, I then insert each participant’s projected values for the unemployment rate and the real federal funds rate, as well as his or her estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, and solve the equation for the implied value of the time-varying r* at the end of each year.	21	2
201503	2408	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	These implied values are shown in the lower-left panel.	21	2
201503	2409	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The median is close to zero in both 2015 and 2016 and rises to a little above ½ percent by 2017, still well below the longer-run median estimate of 1¾ percent.	21	2
201503	2410	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	These temporarily low levels of the implied equilibrium real rate reflect the fact that your projected paths for the real federal funds rate run well below your longer-run normal values.	21	2
201503	2411	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In such circumstances, the IS equation, shown in the middle panel, would predict substantially faster declines in the unemployment rate than shown in your projections if r* was at its longer-run value.	21	2
201503	2412	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	To reconcile your unemployment rate projections with your real rate projections, it must be the case that r* remains depressed for some time.	21	2
201503	2413	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Put differently, the fact that most of you expect the unemployment rate to remain close to your estimates of its longer-run normal value over coming years implies that the real rate gap cannot be particularly large.	21	2
201503	2414	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	This analysis suggests that the differences relative to the Taylor (1999) benchmark with the longer-run r* value as the intercept may be somewhat misleading as an indication of policy accommodation.	21	2
201503	2415	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In the lower-right panel, I repeat the Taylor rule calculation shown in the upper-left panel after replacing your longer-run normal value for the real federal funds rate with the time-varying r* values.	21	2
201503	2416	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The median difference between your projected federal funds rates and those prescribed by this version of the Taylor (1999) rule is close to zero at the end of both 2015 and 2016 and about ¼ percentage point in 2017, substantially narrower than the ones shown in the upper-left panel.	21	2
201503	2417	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The bullets in the upper panel of exhibit 2 mention a few caveats to this analysis.	21	2
201503	2418	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The results are conditional on the specification of the IS equation.	21	2
201503	2419	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	A different model of the transmission of real interest rates to real activity might produce different estimates of the equilibrium real interest rate.	21	2
201503	2420	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, this simple model does not provide insight into the structural factors that underlie the estimated changes in r*.	21	2
201503	2421	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That said, it seems plausible that, as several of you suggest in your SEP narratives, lingering effects of the financial crisis and considerable restraint from economic and financial developments abroad may play some role.	21	2
201503	2422	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Let me now turn to today’s policy decision and the draft alternative statements.	21	2
201503	2423	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	First, I want to thank everyone for responding to our earlier drafts with valuable feedback.	21	2
201503	2424	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Judging from those communications, the key judgment that you face today is how to replace the “patient” language with new forward guidance that maintains the option to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at any meeting, beginning in June, and describes broad conditions under which you will determine that liftoff is warranted.	21	2
201503	2425	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Rather than go through each alternative statement separately, I want to focus on how the alternatives address the issues that appear to be central to your decision today.	21	2
201503	2426	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	First, the revised statement will provide an update of your assessment of the current inflation situation and your confidence in the outlook for inflation.	21	2
201503	2427	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the middle panel, all three of the statements report that inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longer-run objective and is anticipated to “remain near its recent low level” in the near term.	21	2
201503	2428	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	However, the alternatives offer different options for characterizing recent movements in inflation compensation and express varying degrees of confidence in the outlook for inflation.	21	2
201503	2429	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B notes that market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low, but that survey-based measures remain stable.	21	2
201503	2430	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B also retains the earlier expectation that inflation will “rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.”	21	2
201503	2431	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C states that measures of inflation compensation have increased, and that inflation “will” reach the 2 percent objective.	21	2
201503	2432	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	It also notes that survey-based measures remain stable.	21	2
201503	2433	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, alternative A expresses clear concern that inflation will return only “very gradually” to the Committee’s 2 percent objective and could remain below it “for a protracted period.”	21	2
201503	2434	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, alternative A emphasizes that measures of inflation compensation “remain well below levels observed last summer.”	21	2
201503	2435	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I should also point out that, given the drop in crude oil prices in recent days, the alternative B in front of you deletes the reference to “earlier” in describing energy price declines in paragraph 1.	21	2
201503	2436	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Moving to the forward guidance, the issue before you is how to revise the guidance in order to both communicate more specifically the data dependence of a decision to increase the target range for the federal funds rate and shape expectations regarding the likely timing of liftoff.	21	2
201503	2437	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding labor market conditions, your SEP submissions indicate that most of you anticipate further improvement and expect that the unemployment rate will have declined another couple of tenths by the time that liftoff will be warranted.	21	2
201503	2438	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, your expectations for progress toward the maximum employment goal are broadly represented across the forward guidance in all three draft alternatives.	21	2
201503	2439	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The alternatives differ on the characterization of inflation prospects that would warrant a liftoff decision.	21	2
201503	2440	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B indicates that you would want to be more, or at least not less, confident that inflation will return to your 2 percent objective over the medium term.	21	2
201503	2441	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C suggests that you are already sufficiently confident to signal liftoff soon.	21	2
201503	2442	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	And alternative A states that you would need to see clear evidence that inflation was moving up to 2 percent.	21	2
201503	2443	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Looking at how the three alternatives may shape expectations for the timing of liftoff, alternative B states that, in addition to further improvement in the labor market, the Committee will need to be “reasonably confident” that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective “over the medium term,” and thus provides flexibility to make ongoing data-dependent assessments of economic conditions.	21	2
201503	2444	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The data dependence is reinforced with the addition of the sentence stating that the change does not indicate that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate has been decided.	21	2
201503	2445	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, in order to bridge the forward guidance from the presumed time dependence associated with the “patient” language, alternative B specifically says that an April liftoff is unlikely.	21	2
201503	2446	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	According to your SEP submissions, at present, about half of you see the appropriate timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate as early as June, while the other half expects that the decision will not be made until later this year.	21	2
201503	2447	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	As Simon noted in his briefing, market expectations are broadly similar.	21	2
201503	2448	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Some of you may be sufficiently confident about the outlook for both the labor market and inflation to want to boost the odds of liftoff in June by substituting “in a couple of meetings” for “patient,” as in alternative C.	21	2
201503	2449	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, others may want to express more firmly the Committee’s commitment to its inflation objective, as in alternative A, extending the decision to be patient “until inflation is clearly moving up toward 2 percent” and asserting that the Committee would “use its tools as necessary” to reach that objective in two or three years—signals that likely would push forward the expected timing of liftoff.	21	2
201503	2450	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201503	2451	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That concludes my prepared remarks, and I’ll be glad to take any questions.	21	2
201503	2452	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201503	2453	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions?	22	2
201503	2454	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201503	2455	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2456	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thomas, that was a very interesting analysis, which led me to think about a couple of things.	22	2
201503	2457	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	One, you mentioned the shortfalls in relation to the Taylor (1999) rule benchmark, asking whether they are a good measure of monetary policy accommodation.	22	2
201503	2458	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Is there any empirical work that you did with this that might indicate, when you see residuals of this magnitude, whether they are often followed by stronger inflation or stronger growth over the time series that you used?	22	2
201503	2459	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I’d find that interesting to know, in light of our increased inflation expectations, whether that’s in line with history.	22	2
201503	2460	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I haven’t specifically looked into that particular issue: “What if you had run the Taylor rule with a constant intercept?	22	2
201503	2461	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	At times that followed when you saw large deviations from that, would you have seen subsequently high inflation?”	22	2
201503	2462	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I haven’t looked into that.	22	2
201503	2463	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s an interesting idea.	22	2
201503	2464	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22	2
201503	2465	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Could I ask you a question about interpreting the lower-left chart on assessing individual members’ r*?	22	2
201503	2466	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Am I right that the takeaway here is, the dots that are higher could be thought of as participants who are more confident the Wicksellian rate of interest is higher, but the participants who have the negative ones have more concerns that that’s not the case?	22	2
201503	2467	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Is that the way to interpret that?	22	2
201503	2468	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the higher dots are primarily driven by a combination of higher paths for the federal funds rate and continued declines in the unemployment rate.	22	2
201503	2469	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	As you can tell from the equation in the middle, it is essentially that, from the change in the unemployment gap, you take signal about how accommodative policy was.	22	2
201503	2470	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So if a participant has a relatively high projection of the real federal funds rate and, on top of that, sees the unemployment rate declining further, that must be a participant who has a relatively high estimate of the equilibrium real rate.	22	2
201503	2471	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22	2
201503	2472	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Lastly, in the statement, in the first paragraph of alt-B, you talk about market-based measures of inflation compensation.	22	2
201503	2473	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	There’s been a lot of changes in the description here, and now it’s just “remain low.”	22	2
201503	2474	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Yesterday, in my own comments, I said that it was modestly comforting that those had risen.	22	2
201503	2475	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Is that still the case, or where does that stand relative to our January meeting?	22	2
201503	2476	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ve been looking at the five-year, five-year-ahead breakevens.	22	2
201503	2477	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	From the first day of the January meeting, they increased about 20 basis points and have since retraced 15 of those 20.	22	2
201503	2478	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So right now, they’re up, on net, 5 or 6 basis points.	22	2
201503	2479	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Not a complete round trip.	22	2
201503	2480	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22	2
201503	2481	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	22	2
201503	2482	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22	2
201503	2483	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, I also have a question on paragraph 1 in alternative B, and it’s about, again, the change in the language in the blue and red.	22	2
201503	2484	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the sentence that says “Household spending is rising moderately,” it refers to “earlier declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.”	22	2
201503	2485	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Later in the paragraph, it says “Inflation has declined further ...	22	2
201503	2486	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was wondering if there’s actually a reason to have “earlier” in one place and not the other.	22	2
201503	2487	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Is there something we’re trying to communicate with that?	22	2
201503	2488	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It just seemed funny there, or maybe I’m misreading it.	22	2
201503	2489	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	No, obviously not.	22	2
201503	2490	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the statement in the inflation sentence was more trying to indicate very recent movements in energy prices based on the idea that they feed into headline inflation relatively quickly.	22	2
201503	2491	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	It is our assessment that, actually, the boost to household spending is showing up only over time.	22	2
201503	2492	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, the sentence does refer to household purchasing power.	22	2
201503	2493	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m not quite sure how quickly that feeds through.	22	2
201503	2494	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	If I can break right now from the rules on making a comment on language, I think symmetry would suggest not having “earlier” in either case and just saying “declines”—unless we’re trying to say something.	22	2
201503	2495	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I think they relate to different things.	22	2
201503	2496	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	What could make them consistent is simply that households take a while to react.	22	2
201503	2497	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	This could also reflect the staff taking a while to react.	22	2
201503	2498	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	22	2
201503	2499	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	It might be about 48 hours out of date, before energy prices came back down.	22	2
201503	2500	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So would you prefer to go, actually, back to the old language and just say “recent,” or would you drop “earlier”?	22	2
201503	2501	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would just say “declines” in both cases because I think they’re factually true.	22	2
201503	2502	2015-03-18	meeting	WILCOX	I think the issue is less material now, with oil prices back down at their basement level.	22	2
201503	2503	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Now what is true is that, in some sense, oil prices were declining nearly monotonically through late January.	22	2
201503	2504	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Then they bounced.	22	2
201503	2505	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Then they went up and back down.	22	2
201503	2506	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	So they have, netting out over the intermeeting period, flattened out.	22	2
201503	2507	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	In that sense, the “earlier” could be correct, but it might be easier just to delete it.	22	2
201503	2508	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Cross it out.	22	2
201503	2509	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Both times.	22	2
201503	2510	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	22	2
201503	2511	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201503	2512	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2513	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would just point out to the Committee that “earlier” also appears in paragraph 2, in the penultimate sentence.	22	2
201503	2514	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I would take it out in both places.	22	2
201503	2515	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Wasn’t that your suggestion?	22	2
201503	2516	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	22	2
201503	2517	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, I think it would conform with President Williams’s suggestion to take it out there as well.	22	2
201503	2518	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201503	2519	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On this point, is there anyone who would object to crossing out “earlier” in both places?	22	2
201503	2520	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201503	2521	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201503	2522	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s do that.	22	2
201503	2523	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	22	2
201503	2524	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201503	2525	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2526	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up on the staff’s presentation yesterday about the recent correlation between oil price movements and five- year, five-year-forward breakevens.	22	2
201503	2527	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I looked at a longer stretch of data than the staff presented to us, and it didn’t seem as though that correlation was as strong in previous years.	22	2
201503	2528	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I was wondering what thoughts the staff had on the reason for the tight correlation over the past few months.	22	2
201503	2529	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a bit of a mystery, isn’t it?	22	2
201503	2530	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	We talked about this a little bit this week in our Board meeting, and we agreed that we didn’t have any great ideas or any conclusive evidence.	22	2
201503	2531	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	Because it’s clearly the case that near-term movements in oil prices should not have implications for inflation 5 to 10 years down the road, we did talk about the possibility that they must be proxying for something else, such as, perhaps, anxieties or uncertainties about the global outlook.	22	2
201503	2532	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	And you could imagine that the uncertainties about the global outlook are pushing down the inflation compensation.	22	2
201503	2533	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	You could also imagine investors looking at these declines and basically reading through to inflation compensation.	22	2
201503	2534	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	The fact that those correlations have become more evident over the past half year or so is suggestive of that hypothesis because it has been in the past half year that there has been mounting anxiety about the global outlook.	22	2
201503	2535	2015-03-18	meeting	KAMIN	But, beyond that, we don’t have a lot, and we’re going to continue to investigate.	22	2
201503	2536	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Two-hander?	22	2
201503	2537	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Question?	22	2
201503	2538	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	22	2
201503	2539	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Just to add to that, it also could be a bit of an anomaly of the market itself in the sense that, when oil prices drop, TIPS traders have negative carry.	22	2
201503	2540	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	You remember that the five-by-five is a construct; it’s constructed from the TIPS markets.	22	2
201503	2541	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So to the extent that the TIPS market reacts in any way in terms of the liquidity premium and other factors, this could show through and not have any signal whatsoever about true expectations of inflation on a five-by-five-year-forward basis.	22	2
201503	2542	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201503	2543	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2544	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To reflect on what Vice Chairman Dudley just said, there’s some element of that, I think, in the TIPS markets.	22	2
201503	2545	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I believe you’ll see less of that in the zero-coupon inflation swap market, and there you still see that over the past six months, these lower-frequency movements are still material.	22	2
201503	2546	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One idea that occurred to me is that the fall in oil prices means that headline inflation is going to be even lower below target for longer, and those lower realizations of headline inflation for longer periods of time could create more concerns about unanchoring.	22	2
201503	2547	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2548	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201503	2549	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I thought the carry effect affected the 5- and the 10-year TIPS the same, so it washes out.	22	2
201503	2550	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	But is there some asymmetry?	22	2
201503	2551	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It affects it all.	22	2
201503	2552	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	But remember, this is a market with traders who have positions, and they’re responding to the profitability of holding inventory or not holding inventory.	22	2
201503	2553	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Bond mutual fund flows are going to also drive the relative yields.	22	2
201503	2554	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So the market may not be perfectly efficient.	22	2
201503	2555	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all I’m saying.	22	2
201503	2556	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	We’ll debate efficiency some other time.	22	2
201503	2557	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we’ll be debating that forever, Jeff.	22	2
201503	2558	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Vice Chairman Dudley has just waved a red flag for President Lacker.	22	2
201503	2559	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	22	2
201503	2560	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22	2
201503	2561	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2562	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I want to go back to exhibit 1 and the analysis of the SEP.	22	2
201503	2563	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	As I understand the argument, if we just go by Taylor (1999), the Committee looks pretty dovish, according to the first figure.	22	2
201503	2564	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	And you might be able to rationalize that if you think r* is moving around.	22	2
201503	2565	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Now, one thing I would say about that is, Taylor (1999) was rationalized based on an application to past US data, and the argument was that it fit the data pretty well and we got pretty good outcomes.	22	2
201503	2566	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	There are even models that might rationalize Taylor (1999) as an optimal monetary policy rule.	22	2
201503	2567	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	If you say, “Okay, now we’re going to substitute in the time-varying r*,” we lose that rationalization, and we’re not sure if that’s really a good monetary policy rule or not.	22	2
201503	2568	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it might warrant further research.	22	2
201503	2569	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	If that’s what you think is happening around the Committee and around monetary policy generally, it might warrant further research to ask, “Would it have been a good idea historically to follow the variations in r* the way it’s being described here in the bottom panel?”	22	2
201503	2570	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I think I exercise truth in advertising by admitting that part of the sausage is the Laubach-Williams estimate of r*.	22	2
201503	2571	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That estimate just shows a very unusual movement in recent years.	22	2
201503	2572	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So maybe one way of reconciling these two things is that, actually, prior to the crisis, you would not have observed such large gaps, and because these gaps are really much more pronounced now, it looks as though this time-varying measure of r* has declined so sharply.	22	2
201503	2573	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Maybe that’s why, in studies that used earlier evidence indicating you didn’t have such sharp deviations of r* from a longer-run average, this effect wasn’t so pronounced.	22	2
201503	2574	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	22	2
201503	2575	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think one response to that is, you could look at cross-country evidence and start tracking instances in other countries in which r* did vary, and you could see whether this is a good idea or not.	22	2
201503	2576	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22	2
201503	2577	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201503	2578	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201503	2579	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	You’ve obviously done a fair amount of work for this.	22	2
201503	2580	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	When I was looking at this exhibit yesterday afternoon, I saw the first two panels and thought to myself, “Okay, you’re comparing what Taylor (1999) with our submissions the right-hand side would predict for interest rates with what we actually put in for the interest rate, and that Taylor (1999) is a fixed r*.”	22	2
201503	2581	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I’m thinking, “Okay, well, the difference must be that we have time-varying r*’s that are particular to each of us.	22	2
201503	2582	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And if you just put that in there, you can make all of these dots go right on that zero line.	22	2
201503	2583	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	You can take all of the discrepancy and put it into the time-varying r* for each one of us.”	22	2
201503	2584	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	But you did more work than that.	22	2
201503	2585	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	That seemed really simple compared with what you did with this equation and so on.	22	2
201503	2586	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So I’m wondering, what am I missing here?	22	2
201503	2587	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	What did all of this other analysis add to the picture?	22	2
201503	2588	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Apparently, I’m not learning all you’ve intended to teach us about this.	22	2
201503	2589	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I think one way to interpret the bottom two panels is that, actually, what I do in the left-hand panel takes no information from the Taylor rule at all.	22	2
201503	2590	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Look at the bottom left—your r* estimates.	22	2
201503	2591	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Those come out of the IS equation shown in the middle.	22	2
201503	2592	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	That doesn’t include anything from the Taylor rule.	22	2
201503	2593	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	This is our r*?	22	2
201503	2594	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22	2
201503	2595	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	This is your r* that I backed out from the equation shown in the middle.	22	2
201503	2596	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Sorry, I should be careful here.	22	2
201503	2597	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m using your projections, and I’m backing out something that I do not necessarily want to attribute to you.	22	2
201503	2598	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	You may not agree with it, but that’s the calculation.	22	2
201503	2599	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Well, it’s a mixture of me, you, and John.	22	2
201503	2600	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	22	2
201503	2601	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Okay, so then what’s there is from the IS curve.	22	2
201503	2602	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	The key thing is, I’m essentially arriving from two different points at a fairly similar conclusion.	22	2
201503	2603	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	One is, I could simply look at the upper-left panel and say, “Okay, let me just take these differences that are shown there relative to the rule’s prescription as the amount by which I need to reduce your longer-run r* to get your short-run r*.”	22	2
201503	2604	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	But that’s not what I’m doing.	22	2
201503	2605	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	What I’m doing is, I’m using this middle equation, which knows nothing about the Taylor rule, and I’m deriving from that, based on this IS equation relationship, what the implied r*’s are.	22	2
201503	2606	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Lo and behold, when you then move to the lower-right panel, that actually does line up relatively closely to what you had in mind to do.	22	2
201503	2607	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	So you are arriving at similar answers from two completely separate thought processes.	22	2
201503	2608	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And these Laubach-Williams estimates of r* don’t use the Taylor rule?	22	2
201503	2609	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	No.	22	2
201503	2610	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	What does this tell us about a policy?	22	2
201503	2611	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It seems r* is sort of small for all of us.	22	2
201503	2612	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22	2
201503	2613	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	It essentially means that, on balance, your projections seem to be consistent with a view that the IS curve still has some ways to move out to its longer-run normal position.	22	2
201503	2614	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22	2
201503	2615	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So we get the same answer two different ways.	22	2
201503	2616	2015-03-18	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22	2
201503	2617	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Great.	22	2
201503	2618	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	22	2
201503	2619	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	22	2
201503	2620	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	22	2
201503	2621	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	22	2
201503	2622	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m guessing that you want to start moving on to the statement, and that you’ve got a press conference coming up.	22	2
201503	2623	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Just one thing:  This is more something to be noted, because I think it’s factually accurate, than a suggestion to change the statement.	22	2
201503	2624	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But now that we are focused on current forces that are driving inflation, I would just say that core import prices are also relevant in that sentence.	22	2
201503	2625	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I understand that we’re not taking that on board this month, but, clearly, core is also low relative to where we would expect it to be, and core import prices are obviously a factor there.	22	2
201503	2626	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I’m sorry.	22	2
201503	2627	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Where are you proposing this?	22	2
201503	2628	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m not proposing it, because I don’t want to create a lot of additional wordsmithing.	22	2
201503	2629	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But in the sentence that says “Inflation has declined further ...	22	2
201503	2630	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But you’re not proposing to change it?	22	2
201503	2631	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t want to spend another half-hour, knowing that you’d like to continue moving along.	22	2
201503	2632	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201503	2633	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22	2
201503	2634	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	If I could just start our round off with a couple of comments.	23	2
201503	2635	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think the economy has made considerable progress toward our objective of maximum employment.	23	2
201503	2636	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And, because of the likely eventual implications of that progress for the inflation outlook, I believe it serves us well to remove “patient” from our policy statement at this time.	23	2
201503	2637	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Doing so will provide us with the flexibility to raise the federal funds rate at any meeting after April, with the actual timing dependent on how the economy evolves.	23	2
201503	2638	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t view the removal of “patient” as a signal that liftoff in June is particularly likely.	23	2
201503	2639	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In my press conference, I intend to make it clear that the modification of our forward guidance doesn’t mean that we’ve determined the timing of liftoff, and that such timing will depend on the Committee’s assessment of incoming information.	23	2
201503	2640	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, I plan to indicate that the Committee will not necessarily raise rates in June.	23	2
201503	2641	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I also want to be clear that a June liftoff cannot be ruled out.	23	2
201503	2642	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Between now and the June FOMC meeting, we will receive three more employment reports.	23	2
201503	2643	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Like most of you, I see room for further improvement in labor market conditions, and I expect the rate of decline in the unemployment rate to slow some in the months ahead.	23	2
201503	2644	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But it is possible we could see a continuing rapid decline in the unemployment rate, which could be approaching 5 percent by the time of the June meeting.	23	2
201503	2645	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, readings on inflation are likely to remain uncomfortably low.	23	2
201503	2646	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of the June meeting, the latest inflation readings will be for April.	23	2
201503	2647	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	The staff projects that the 12-month change in total PCE prices will be just 0.2 percent in April, and that for core PCE prices will be just 1.2 percent.	23	2
201503	2648	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And the trend may not be our friend, in that inflation may well soften further for a few more months, especially if the dollar continues to appreciate as we get closer to the beginning of the normalization process.	23	2
201503	2649	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As I noted in the economic go-round, I have tried to avoid establishing any simple criterion for achieving reasonable confidence that inflation will move up to 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2650	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I have thus far emphasized—and I intend to continue emphasizing—that we do not have to see an increase in core inflation or an increase in nominal wage growth that would achieve the confidence that’s needed for us to move, and that we intend to consider a broad range of data and evidence in arriving at that judgment.	23	2
201503	2651	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Further labor market improvement on its own will work to improve my confidence in the forecast that inflation will move back up to 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2652	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	But if core inflation, nominal wage growth, or measures of inflation expectations move the wrong way, I think we may find a decision to commence tightening quite challenging.	23	2
201503	2653	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	These uncertainties about the outlook for inflation and the labor market are precisely why moving to a meeting-by- meeting footing in our policy deliberations is appropriate.	23	2
201503	2654	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	As a final point, I intend to acknowledge and communicate that, if the economy evolves in line with our forecast, increases in the federal funds rate over time are likely to be gradual.	23	2
201503	2655	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, in line with Thomas’s analysis, if r* is gradually rising as the headwinds that have held back the recovery continue to abate, a gradual rise in the federal funds rate is likely to be appropriate.	23	2
201503	2656	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, it’s also true that a gradual rise is required just to keep the level of monetary accommodation constant.	23	2
201503	2657	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	We may not know if this is an accurate description of how the economy is operating until we see how it reacts to higher interest rates.	23	2
201503	2658	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So, as a result, I favor a cautious and deliberate approach to tightening policy.	23	2
201503	2659	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and begin our go-round with President Lacker.	23	2
201503	2660	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2661	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I can support alternative B.	23	2
201503	2662	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	It drops the word “patient” and thus keeps June on the table, which I think is essential, because if the data come in reasonably close to our forecast, I think we should raise rates in June.	23	2
201503	2663	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	While I support the new forward-guidance language, it’s important to be aware that it introduces some important internal tension into the statement.	23	2
201503	2664	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The new language states that the Committee anticipates raising rates “when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”	23	2
201503	2665	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	This seems to leave open the possibility that we are not now reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our objective.	23	2
201503	2666	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, the second paragraph states that we expect “inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.”	23	2
201503	2667	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In the broader context of that paragraph, I take this to mean that we are confident that our future policy actions will bring inflation back to 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2668	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So our new forward-guidance language appears to be in conflict with the second paragraph, because it seems to suggest we’re not confident about our future conduct of monetary policy.	23	2
201503	2669	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	This is an awkward and potentially confusing implication to convey.	23	2
201503	2670	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	One way to reconcile the two passages is to change the forward-guidance language to read “remains reasonably confident” instead of “is reasonably confident,” implying that we are now confident.	23	2
201503	2671	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Another approach would be to interpret the “reasonably confident” language as conditional on raising rates—in other words, to interpret the forward-guidance language as meaning to say that the Committee anticipates raising rates “when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that an increase in rates is consistent with inflation moving back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”	23	2
201503	2672	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Now, rewording the forward guidance this way would eliminate the apparent conflict with the second paragraph.	23	2
201503	2673	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	The language there is about our confidence that our policy will get inflation back to 2 percent, while the language in paragraph 3 says that, to raise rates, we want to be reasonably confident that raising rates won’t prevent us from getting back to 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2674	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	I understand that, given the weeks and months of deliberations that have gone into crafting this language, this would be a late-in-the-game suggestion to make, so I’m not going to insist on this change.	23	2
201503	2675	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	But I think that it’s worth being aware of this tension as we talk about policy in public going forward.	23	2
201503	2676	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In any event, this is something you might have to address in your press conference this afternoon, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2677	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	And it’s something that, as I said, I think we should be continually aware of.	23	2
201503	2678	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Looking ahead at how the data might come in between now and June, I believe it’s important to recognize that we could be reasonably confident about inflation then—as you said, Madam Chair—even if the monthly readings on core inflation continue to bounce around at a relatively low level.	23	2
201503	2679	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Certainly, we’d rather not see persistently soft core inflation, but our focus should be on the outlook for inflation, not on realized values.	23	2
201503	2680	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	In particular, I don’t think we should convey that a substantial rise in reported core inflation is in some way a precondition for lifting off in June.	23	2
201503	2681	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Setting a high bar by waiting to see a vigorous rise in actual inflation ignores the long and variable lags that we know are associated with monetary policy, and it risks a return to the “go-stop” regime that made monetary policy a driving force behind real fluctuations.	23	2
201503	2682	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	As I noted at the outset, if conditions evolve close to expectations over the next few months, then I’m likely to argue for a rate increase in June.	23	2
201503	2683	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	If so, I will do so based on the premise that we should set our monetary policy instrument so as to align the real short-term interest rate with the economy’s underlying real fundamentals.	23	2
201503	2684	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	What do we know about those fundamentals?	23	2
201503	2685	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Over the past three years, we’ve seen the following:  Consumption has grown at an average annual rate of 2.5 percent, a number we last saw in the fall of 2007; the unemployment rate has fallen almost 3 percentage points, from 8.3 percent to 5.5 percent; and employment has grown at a 1.9 percent annual rate, a number we last saw in the spring of 2001.	23	2
201503	2686	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Over the same time period, the short-term real interest rate has been below negative 1 percent.	23	2
201503	2687	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Our understanding of the relationship between the natural real rate, as it’s called, and observable variables is admittedly imprecise.	23	2
201503	2688	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	But I think both theory and experience tell us that a real interest rate of negative 1 percent is unlikely to be consistent with continuing low inflation in the face of the steady growth we’ve seen in the real economy.	23	2
201503	2689	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Granted, the natural real interest rate may have shifted down in recent years, but I’d note that attempts to quantify that decline, such as those based on the work of Laubach and Williams, did not generate anything like the current level of real rates.	23	2
201503	2690	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	So I think a strong case can be made that our policy rate should be higher right now, and June represents the first opportunity to raise rates without contradicting our past forward guidance.	23	2
201503	2691	2015-03-18	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2692	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2693	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201503	2694	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2695	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I support alternative A, with one change.	23	2
201503	2696	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the end of paragraph 3, alternative A says that the FOMC will “use its tools as necessary to return inflation to 2 percent in two to three years.”	23	2
201503	2697	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest rewording “two to three years” to be “one to two years.”	23	2
201503	2698	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is the definition of “medium term” that we used in past statements, and I don’t see a reason why we would change it now.	23	2
201503	2699	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I favor this modified version of alternative A because it promotes maximum employment and it promotes price stability.	23	2
201503	2700	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of promoting maximum employment, I agree with the assessment of the Tealbook, Book B, that alternative A would be seen as an unexpected increase in monetary accommodation.	23	2
201503	2701	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That additional stimulus would generate extra demand for goods and services.	23	2
201503	2702	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The extra demand for goods and services would lead employment to grow more rapidly, induce employers to convert part-time jobs to full-time ones, and further increase job- finding rates for the nonemployed.	23	2
201503	2703	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see all of these effects as being consistent with promoting maximum employment.	23	2
201503	2704	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Of course, I could always cite these beneficial employment effects as a justification for adding monetary stimulus.	23	2
201503	2705	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As policymakers, we always need to weigh these benefits against the all-too-familiar potential costs of stimulus—the risks of unduly high inflation and financial instability.	23	2
201503	2706	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These costs seem very small at the current time.	23	2
201503	2707	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of prices, the inflation outlook remains subdued.	23	2
201503	2708	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Like the Board’s staff, I don’t expect inflation to rise back to 2 percent for several years.	23	2
201503	2709	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of financial stability, I see no risks that are material for the macroeconomy.	23	2
201503	2710	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the Tealbook, Book B, observes, signs of excessive risk-taking are not widespread, and use of short-term financing instruments and indicators of leverage remain moderate.	23	2
201503	2711	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve described how the incremental risks to financial stability or inflation associated with further stimulus seem small to me.	23	2
201503	2712	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I should emphasize that, unlike the objective function posited in the Tealbook, Book B, my own objective function does not include losses associated with the unemployment rate falling below u*.	23	2
201503	2713	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As an economist, it’s unclear to me what kind of social waste would be generated by additional job creation, especially given current levels of employment and other labor market metrics.	23	2
201503	2714	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a policymaker, I do not see this formulation in the FOMC’s objective function as being consistent with our mandate to promote maximum employment.	23	2
201503	2715	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So alternative A promotes maximum employment.	23	2
201503	2716	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to how it promotes price stability.	23	2
201503	2717	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I interpret the heart of this mandate as keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2718	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are three relevant facts.	23	2
201503	2719	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The first fact is that PCE inflation has been below target for nearly three years.	23	2
201503	2720	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As well, with the exception of a brief period at the end of 2011, core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent for closer to seven years.	23	2
201503	2721	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A second fact is, my inflation outlook, like that of the Board’s staff, remains low.	23	2
201503	2722	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Under the monetary policy assumptions of the Tealbook, Book A, I do not foresee inflation returning to target in a sustainable way until 2018.	23	2
201503	2723	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My outlook, like that of the Board’s staff, incorporates estimates of the slope of the Phillips curve from the past 20 years, which is quite flat.	23	2
201503	2724	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Others around the table have more confidence that the Phillips curve will revert to the steeper slope that was seen prior to that time period, and I guess that’s obviously a difference in perspective that we might be able to receive more information about as we go forward.	23	2
201503	2725	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The third fact is that there’s been a market slide in market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation, and they remain near historical lows.	23	2
201503	2726	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On this third fact, I want to note that I believe we can think about two different kinds of signals out there in terms of how anchored inflation expectations are.	23	2
201503	2727	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One signal is coming from the surveys, and one signal is coming from market-based measures.	23	2
201503	2728	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These are both noisy signals.	23	2
201503	2729	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The usual approaches to decision theory would not say that we should simply ignore one of those signals and just rely on the one that’s remained constant to form our assessments.	23	2
201503	2730	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A more typical approach to decision theory would try to put weight on both signals and, with humility, conclude that there has been a change in the landscape over the past six months in terms of how anchored we should think inflation expectations are.	23	2
201503	2731	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Taken together, all three of these facts—that realized inflation has been as low as it has been for as long as it has been; that the outlook remains so low, unless we have a steeper Phillips curve than we’ve seen in the past 20 years; and that market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation have slid so low—suggest that the baseline monetary policy stance outlined in the Tealbook, Book A, is creating a significant risk of inflation expectations sliding permanently below 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2732	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this risk is especially troubling in light of how hard it’s been for other central banks to engineer increases in inflation expectations.	23	2
201503	2733	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, I view this unanchoring of inflation expectations as intrinsically problematic in terms of the price-stability mandate.	23	2
201503	2734	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should also keep in mind that a permanent slide of inflation expectations creates first-order losses in terms of the FOMC’s performance with respect to the employment mandate.	23	2
201503	2735	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In a low-inflation scenario, the zero lower bound would bind more frequently, and the ability of the FOMC to buffer the economy against recessionary shocks would be degraded.	23	2
201503	2736	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that binding constraint creates first-order losses, not second-order losses.	23	2
201503	2737	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This degradation would be especially severe if the long-run real natural rate of interest ends up being very low.	23	2
201503	2738	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To sum up, Madam Chair, I recommend that the FOMC adopt alternative A because it promotes both maximum employment and price stability.	23	2
201503	2739	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me say a couple of things about alternative B.	23	2
201503	2740	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In contrast, alternative B removes the word “patient” as a characterization of the FOMC’s policy stance.	23	2
201503	2741	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was very heartened to hear, Madam Chair, what you are planning to say in your press conference by way of modulating what might be conclusions reached by market participants and others about what we mean by removing the word “patient.”	23	2
201503	2742	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just based on the survey evidence that we saw from the New York Fed, keeping the word “patient” would reduce the perceived probability of a June liftoff, I think, to near zero.	23	2
201503	2743	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Removing the word “patient” pushes that perceived probability of a June liftoff upward to be closer to 40 percent.	23	2
201503	2744	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So just removing the word “patient,” in and of itself, is a tightening of monetary policy.	23	2
201503	2745	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m opposed to such a move at this time.	23	2
201503	2746	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This tightening of policy will reduce the projected rate of employment growth and the projected rate of increase in the inflation rate toward 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2747	2015-03-18	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2748	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2749	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201503	2750	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2751	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I can support alternative B today as written.	23	2
201503	2752	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I recognize that you and the Committee are at the point when we want to actively entertain the possibility of lifting off beginning in June, and every meeting thereafter is a possibility.	23	2
201503	2753	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	To achieve this flexibility for liftoff, it is important to dismantle all elements of our calendar-based guidance and rely simply on meeting-by-meeting conditional assessments.	23	2
201503	2754	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I can support removing “patient” today and replacing it with meaningful conditional guidance in the form of a statement that we won’t raise rates until we have reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent target over the medium term.	23	2
201503	2755	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	As long as “confidence” represents a meaningful economic threshold, I can support alternative B.	23	2
201503	2756	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But let me discuss how I think about some of the nuances around this conditionality.	23	2
201503	2757	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, you made a number of excellent points yesterday and again this morning with respect to the inflation outlook at liftoff.	23	2
201503	2758	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In particular, you indicated it could be appropriate to lift off while inflation was still quite low, as long as theory and historical experience gave us confidence that a near-term acceleration must be around the corner.	23	2
201503	2759	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I will likely find such an assessment challenging to support, but it’s not impossible.	23	2
201503	2760	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I’m not reasonably confident today.	23	2
201503	2761	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	What continues to worry me is that the Committee may not be seriously embracing the symmetry in our inflation objective.	23	2
201503	2762	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I made a special point of saying this at our January reaffirmation of our long-run strategy.	23	2
201503	2763	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In weighing the costs and benefits of further policy delay at each meeting, I think it is important that the Committee be willing to risk overshooting our 2 percent inflation objective.	23	2
201503	2764	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The increased risk of retreating back to the zero lower bound following a premature exit represents a significant cost to an early liftoff.	23	2
201503	2765	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Unless we accept a substantial chance of inflation overshooting our 2 percent target, we won’t be properly balancing the costs and benefits at liftoff in line with our long-run strategy.	23	2
201503	2766	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	If, while inflation is still too low, we lift off early just to ensure that we don’t cross our 2 percent inflation objective, that’s an enormous problem for me.	23	2
201503	2767	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I personally think it would be overly conservative, in the Rogoff “conservative central banker” mode, to try to thread the needle to get to 2 percent while only staying all the while below 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2768	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I can’t see how this would be consistent with a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.	23	2
201503	2769	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In such a situation, if theory and experience are going to be our guide while inflation is still too low, I strongly believe we shouldn’t lift off until theory and experience tell us that we risk having inflation accelerate to, say, 2½ percent or higher.	23	2
201503	2770	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Nothing in the Tealbook or our other forecasts suggests to me that this is close at hand.	23	2
201503	2771	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	For me, that would be a stronger and more useful statement about our confidence in theory and experience as being our guides.	23	2
201503	2772	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	My view of appropriate monetary policy continues to be that liftoff should be delayed until the first quarter of 2016.	23	2
201503	2773	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	This assessment recognizes the strength of the labor market and economic growth outlook, but it also recognizes that the inflation outlook is too low and highly uncertain.	23	2
201503	2774	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Moreover, I fear that an early liftoff could jeopardize the public’s assessment of our credibility regarding our 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.	23	2
201503	2775	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	We’ve spent six years below 2 percent, and we are projecting another two to four years to get back to 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2776	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	We are not the ECB or the Bundesbank.	23	2
201503	2777	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	We should not be trying our darndest to prevent any crossing of a 2 percent bright line.	23	2
201503	2778	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	The stakes for our 2 percent inflation credibility are very large.	23	2
201503	2779	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	If we don’t get back to 2 percent before this cycle ends, no one will ever think we are serious about our 2 percent goal, except that it’s a ceiling.	23	2
201503	2780	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That would be very costly for our future success.	23	2
201503	2781	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	On Friday, my colleagues Jonas Fisher, François Gourio, Spencer Krane, and I will be giving a Brookings paper that discusses the important asymmetry created by the zero lower bound when there’s uncertainty about the level of the Wicksellian natural rate of interest.	23	2
201503	2782	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thomas’s figure on the range of participants’ r* assessment is one measure of this range of uncertainty.	23	2
201503	2783	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	That’s my interpretation of it at least.	23	2
201503	2784	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	I don’t want to downplay the excellent theoretical work of my colleagues—Jonas, François, and Spence—in our upcoming Brookings paper, but it is not that hard to show that optimal monetary policy under discretion in the workhorse New Keynesian models or older-style Keynesian models implies a strong motive to delay policy liftoff whenever risk and uncertainty increase and a binding and costly zero lower bound looms large.	23	2
201503	2785	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	In this situation, there is a motive to build up a buffer stock of economic and inflation improvements in order to reduce the chance that negative shocks send policy back to the zero lower bound.	23	2
201503	2786	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Having said all of this, I can agree to remove the “patient” language today and move to a meeting-by-meeting assessment.	23	2
201503	2787	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	But we should avoid becoming unnecessarily impatient and recognize the major asymmetry and the losses we risk as a result of moving too early in June versus later, as in September or even December.	23	2
201503	2788	2015-03-18	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2789	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2790	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201503	2791	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2792	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I support alternative B today.	23	2
201503	2793	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Based on realized and projected progress toward our dual-mandate policy goals, I believe it’s appropriate to make June and meetings thereafter viable options for liftoff.	23	2
201503	2794	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	As Chair Yellen pointed out, we’re going to have three employment reports before our June meeting, and, in light of the strength we’ve been seeing, it would be inappropriate at this point to shut down the possibility of a June liftoff.	23	2
201503	2795	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The “patient” language has served the Committee well as a transition.	23	2
201503	2796	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	But I’ve become impatient with “patient,” and I think it’s time for our statement to lose its “patience,” too.	23	2
201503	2797	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the proposed forward guidance in alternative B, I can support it, but I’m not convinced it adds, much clarity.	23	2
201503	2798	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	It would seem to open up questions about what particular labor market indicators and inflation developments the Committee wants to see before liftoff.	23	2
201503	2799	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	So I was gratified to hear the Chair’s plan for the press conference.	23	2
201503	2800	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I think that’s well said.	23	2
201503	2801	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe we’ve come to that consensus.	23	2
201503	2802	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	So I’m gratified that Chair Yellen is recognizing that in what she’s planning to say at the press conference.	23	2
201503	2803	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	That said, I recognize that the proposed language is similar to language the Chair has used in her testimony.	23	2
201503	2804	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	I actually would have a slight preference for it more closely echoing the language that the Chair has used before, because any difference might be viewed by the public as meaning something different and perhaps raising the bar for liftoff, which I don’t think is the intention.	23	2
201503	2805	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	But I’m confident that Chair Yellen can handle these types of questions in her press conference.	23	2
201503	2806	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	It would seem that the next communications challenge we face is how to convey the idea that we are data dependent, meaning that the first rate increase doesn’t necessarily imply that we’re on a path of rate increases at each meeting, nor does a pause necessarily signify that liftoff was the wrong thing to do.	23	2
201503	2807	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	The Chair has mentioned this in her public statements, and I think it’s worth emphasizing it as liftoff gets closer.	23	2
201503	2808	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Managing expectations about the post-liftoff policy rate path would seem to be a key factor in ensuring that liftoff itself is not disruptive.	23	2
201503	2809	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	We’re also going to need to wean market participants away from detailed forward guidance and move toward language that explains our policy rationale, but not necessarily the timing of every expected action we plan to take.	23	2
201503	2810	2015-03-18	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2811	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2812	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201503	2813	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2814	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy decision in alternative B.	23	2
201503	2815	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the statement, I interpret the forward-guidance language with the removal of “patient” as conveying that liftoff is approaching.	23	2
201503	2816	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	April is highly unlikely, but the exact timing after April has not been determined.	23	2
201503	2817	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this is the appropriate message coming out of this meeting.	23	2
201503	2818	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	This statement, if adopted, puts the Committee in a new decisionmaking and messaging phase.	23	2
201503	2819	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d urge the Committee to confer early about how we’re going to manage through this phase.	23	2
201503	2820	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	In my opinion, it’s always advisable to think through our communications strategy one or two meetings ahead, under a couple of plausible scenarios.	23	2
201503	2821	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	That is especially the case because of the situation the Committee could face in the next few meetings.	23	2
201503	2822	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned about how to reconcile the tensions between or among preserving decision optionality right up to a possible liftoff meeting; preparing markets by signaling in advance; and remaining disciplined regarding data dependency, having laid down a decision criterion of being reasonably confident.	23	2
201503	2823	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Are we going to help prepare markets by signaling high probability of a liftoff decision at least one meeting in advance?	23	2
201503	2824	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Or are we going to make the decision at a meeting based on the latest data and present that to the markets and public with little or no signaling?	23	2
201503	2825	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	My preferred approach is to give advance signals at a frequency of one meeting.	23	2
201503	2826	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	If the Committee is inclined to follow the one-meeting-in-advance approach and it’s 50–50 at the April meeting—and I think this is a plausible scenario—we would face a challenging communication situation.	23	2
201503	2827	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems to me that we would have to either lay out the reasoning behind a portrayal of June as still in play—and this was President Kocherlakota’s point in his quite useful memo last week—or provide some information in April about what we would need to see that would tip the scales to liftoff in June.	23	2
201503	2828	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Assuming continuing strong labor market reports, the scales tipper would likely be price indications that make the Committee reasonably confident that the inflation outlook is satisfactory.	23	2
201503	2829	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it is highly unlikely that by April we will have price data in hand to support a verdict of reasonably confident.	23	2
201503	2830	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So, as I said, I think keeping June in play at the April meeting presents a communications challenge.	23	2
201503	2831	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The sooner we tackle the wording options for that scenario, the better, in my opinion.	23	2
201503	2832	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to comment on the prospect of a liftoff decision in June.	23	2
201503	2833	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I am skeptical—call it healthy skepticism—we will actually see a clear turn in the inflation trends in the data available for the June meeting.	23	2
201503	2834	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it will be difficult to claim reasonable confidence in June, even with strong payroll jobs numbers through the May report.	23	2
201503	2835	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	At the risk of being a little tedious, I’ll again mention the data calendar.	23	2
201503	2836	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	By the June meeting, we will have two further PCE reports, March and April, and one further CPI report, April.	23	2
201503	2837	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The CPI report for May comes out on June 18, the day after the meeting.	23	2
201503	2838	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	We won’t have any headline May price data at that meeting, although we will have the PPI and some other secondary indicators.	23	2
201503	2839	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m being a literalist here regarding “reasonably confident.”	23	2
201503	2840	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	And I certainly think it’s preferable to derive our reasonable confidence from key inflation data themselves.	23	2
201503	2841	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	The Chair outlined a framework for getting to reasonable confidence based on indirect evidence, historical experience, and theory.	23	2
201503	2842	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Reliance on these elements may require some verbal gymnastics in our communications if June is the meeting—just a cautionary statement.	23	2
201503	2843	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	At this point, September seems to me far more comfortable as an alternative.	23	2
201503	2844	2015-03-18	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2845	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2846	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201503	2847	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2848	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201503	2849	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do not expect to be reasonably confident that core PCE inflation is returning to our 2 percent inflation goal by June.	23	2
201503	2850	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nonetheless, I support dropping “patient” at this meeting, because I believe that we should no longer be giving time-based guidance.	23	2
201503	2851	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Now that we are preparing to lift off from the zero lower bound, we should be more data dependent, and data can surprise us in either direction.	23	2
201503	2852	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	There is great uncertainty around key variables, although that uncertainty seems somewhat asymmetric to me.	23	2
201503	2853	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, I have lowered my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to 5 percent, but it may be lower still.	23	2
201503	2854	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s hard to imagine that that is much higher.	23	2
201503	2855	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ve lowered my longer-run target for the federal funds rate, but it, too, may still be lower.	23	2
201503	2856	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I expect inflation to return to 2 percent, we must acknowledge that there is evidence that financial market participants are becoming less confident of this.	23	2
201503	2857	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Few are worried about high-inflation outcomes.	23	2
201503	2858	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of how far short we are falling on our inflation target, it is appropriate that we probe to see if our estimates of these key variables are too high.	23	2
201503	2859	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	We do not want to prevent returning to full employment by being too wedded to our uncertain estimates of variables and relationships that may have changed.	23	2
201503	2860	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	While it may take some time to be reasonably sure, the accumulating evidence is certainly pointing in that direction.	23	2
201503	2861	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Making policy based on natural rate, potential growth, and equilibrium rate assumptions that are too high could deprive workers who are out of the labor force or part time for economic reasons of being fully and gainfully employed.	23	2
201503	2862	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Finally, after missing our PCE inflation target on the low side for many years, we need to be sure to engineer liftoff only once we have truly attained reasonable confidence that we will hit the target within the forecast horizon.	23	2
201503	2863	2015-03-18	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2864	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2865	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	23	2
201503	2866	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2867	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	I view the transitioning of the statement to more data-dependent language as a very positive development.	23	2
201503	2868	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	I interpret the language in alternative B as leaving our options open for normalization to begin in June should the economy continue to improve and inflation evolve as some anticipate.	23	2
201503	2869	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	If the recent softening in some of the data should spill over and persist or if the decline in inflation should not prove to be as transitory, then subsequent meetings would continue to present new opportunities for liftoff.	23	2
201503	2870	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	But, in any event, alternative B allows for the very flexibility that is called for at this juncture.	23	2
201503	2871	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thus, I support the language in alternative B as amended this morning.	23	2
201503	2872	2015-03-18	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2873	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2874	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201503	2875	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2876	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I also support alternative B for today.	23	2
201503	2877	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think that the removal of “patient” creates optionality for the Committee going into the spring and summer.	23	2
201503	2878	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	This is an appropriate step to take at this juncture.	23	2
201503	2879	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	My preference is to create a situation during the remainder of this year and beyond in which the Committee is willing and able to move at any meeting at which we have reasonably good data to point to on the US economy.	23	2
201503	2880	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	My sense is that if we make moves in response to data that are supportive of a move, the normalization process will go relatively smoothly.	23	2
201503	2881	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Conversely, if we try to force moves toward normalization on days when the data are not that supportive, such action will call into question the policy reaction function of the Committee and possibly lead to complications.	23	2
201503	2882	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	My general view is that our current policy settings are increasingly out of step with the reality of the US economy.	23	2
201503	2883	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Our balance sheet remains at its peak level.	23	2
201503	2884	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Our policy rate remains at its lowest setting.	23	2
201503	2885	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	These are, in effect, emergency policy settings.	23	2
201503	2886	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Meanwhile, the economy continues to improve, with the unemployment rate likely moving below 5 percent in the third quarter of this year.	23	2
201503	2887	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	We can look at other measures of labor market performance, such as the labor market conditions index, but the correlation between those indexes and unemployment is around 0.95.	23	2
201503	2888	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The same is true for nonfarm payroll employment growth.	23	2
201503	2889	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	I think our workhorse indicators of unemployment and nonfarm payrolls are telling us what we need to know about labor market improvement.	23	2
201503	2890	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	The goal for 2015 should be to make modest moves in the policy settings to position US monetary policy more appropriately for the state of the economy in 2016 and beyond.	23	2
201503	2891	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Even when we come off the zero lower bound, policy will remain extremely accommodative.	23	2
201503	2892	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, there will still be upward pressure on inflation coming from monetary policy.	23	2
201503	2893	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	In fact, according to traditional analysis, there will be upward pressure on inflation coming from monetary policy at all times in the next several years as the normalization process proceeds.	23	2
201503	2894	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	That will help move inflation back toward the Committee’s 2 percent target.	23	2
201503	2895	2015-03-18	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2896	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2897	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201503	2898	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2899	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, support alternative B as amended.	23	2
201503	2900	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I fully support your description of the economic outlook that you gave yesterday and your plans in terms of the press conference and thinking about policy.	23	2
201503	2901	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	The first paragraph of alternative B properly characterizes the various crosscurrents in the data—some softening in spending numbers and positive surprises in the labor market—and my own expectation remains that the unemployment rate will fall below its natural rate around the middle of this year.	23	2
201503	2902	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I also continue to view the dip in core inflation as transitory, especially in view of tentative signs that reduced slack is starting to boost wage growth.	23	2
201503	2903	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I therefore continue to view the risks to the outlook as balanced and little changed from our previous meeting.	23	2
201503	2904	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	This outlook and risk assessment point toward making policy decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis going forward, based on the data as they come in.	23	2
201503	2905	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, alternative B appropriately notes that the change in forward guidance does not have explicit implications for the timing of future policy changes.	23	2
201503	2906	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do want to comment on President Lacker’s remark that there is some conflict in the language.	23	2
201503	2907	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there’s absolutely no conflict in the language at all.	23	2
201503	2908	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It does not imply at all that we don’t have confidence that inflation will return.	23	2
201503	2909	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It just says that, at the time of liftoff, what we’re looking for is improvement in the labor market, and that we will have confidence.	23	2
201503	2910	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t suggest that that’s a change or anything.	23	2
201503	2911	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It just says that those are the two conditions that we need to have in order to have liftoff.	23	2
201503	2912	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I don’t see a conflict or tension in the language.	23	2
201503	2913	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It appropriately captures our dual-mandate goals and the progress we’re making on those.	23	2
201503	2914	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, I agree with President Lockhart that we really should be thinking ahead to the future statement language.	23	2
201503	2915	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve thought some about that and have some comments.	23	2
201503	2916	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view is, we don’t want to be writing the statement in the meeting before, stating what we’re going to do in the next meeting.	23	2
201503	2917	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think that’s the right approach.	23	2
201503	2918	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	What we want is to have a statement that, through words, gives a probabilistic interpretation of how we see policy going forward.	23	2
201503	2919	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree that these decisions should be meeting by meeting, based on the data that we have at the time.	23	2
201503	2920	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In thinking about the future statements, I prefer a communications strategy that avoids specific commitments to future monetary policy actions.	23	2
201503	2921	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I looked ahead to alternative C for possible thinking—again, for the future—about an approach.	23	2
201503	2922	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In one sense, a hint that perhaps we’re getting closer to a rate increase would be provided by the language that says “In determining future adjustments of the target range for the federal funds rate,” as opposed to “In determining how long to maintain” the funds rate.	23	2
201503	2923	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s a way to lean a little bit toward the idea that an increase may be coming sooner.	23	2
201503	2924	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, paragraph 3 in alt-B, the one that I think we’ll be using today, is a really good and flexible structure for our future statements.	23	2
201503	2925	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll have to clear some scaffolding that we built around the sentences referring to the April meeting and the fact that we’re changing the forward guidance.	23	2
201503	2926	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I assume we’ll eliminate those after this meeting.	23	2
201503	2927	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	But once we clear that scaffolding around it, the language in alt-B, paragraph 3, gives that data dependence pretty clearly.	23	2
201503	2928	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	It implies that we will be making decisions based on the incoming data and our objectives.	23	2
201503	2929	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, I really do think that’s preferable to returning to a date-based guidance such as “in a couple of meetings.”	23	2
201503	2930	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	I believe that we want to avoid going back to date-based guidance in future statements, and that we really want this to be open-ended in the future.	23	2
201503	2931	2015-03-18	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2932	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2933	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201503	2934	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2935	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I can support alternative B and the removal of “patient” from our forward guidance.	23	2
201503	2936	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Given the current state of the economy and my own outlook, I expect that it will be appropriate to lift off in June.	23	2
201503	2937	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	I also expect that interpreting the new “reasonably confident” language will bring its own challenges to our policy decisions in meetings to come, as well as external communications.	23	2
201503	2938	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	In that regard, I appreciate the Chair’s proposed elaboration for today’s press conference.	23	2
201503	2939	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Beyond the language in this statement, though, I believe it’s becoming increasingly important to say something about the path of interest rates after liftoff, as others have noted.	23	2
201503	2940	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	The public’s fixation on the timing of liftoff often is accompanied by concern about a steady move to the neutral rate.	23	2
201503	2941	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Given uncertainty about how the economy might respond to the initial removal of accommodation, a more gradual path may be prudent as we evaluate the effect of liftoff after a prolonged period of near-zero rates.	23	2
201503	2942	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Communicating the possibility of a more gradual path also could help dispel expectations that policy is poised to move on a preset course.	23	2
201503	2943	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	So it may be appropriate to pause after liftoff, not only to see how the economy and financial markets respond, but also to reinforce that we are not marching steadily to the neutral rate at increments of 25 basis points at each meeting.	23	2
201503	2944	2015-03-18	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2945	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2946	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	23	2
201503	2947	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2948	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	First, I’d like to thank the Board’s staff for the effort that was taken in the Tealbook, Book B, to explore the policy implications of a nonlinear link between the unemployment rate and the rate of wage inflation.	23	2
201503	2949	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As you may know, the Dallas research staff has found evidence of such a link in both aggregate and regional data.	23	2
201503	2950	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As I understand it, the question today boils down to whether to take June off the table for liftoff from the zero bound, put it on the table, or go one step further and signal the intention to raise rates in June.	23	2
201503	2951	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I think that liftoff in June is quite likely to be appropriate, but I see no reason to tie our hands, so I favor alternative B.	23	2
201503	2952	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	I see a June liftoff as likely to be appropriate not because of an immediate inflation threat or because we see our 2 percent inflation target as a ceiling.	23	2
201503	2953	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	In looking to prolong this expansion, we think that the best approach is to ease off on policy accommodation relatively soon so that we don’t need to take stronger and more risky action later.	23	2
201503	2954	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	As President Fisher emphasized, the track record in withdrawing accommodation after we’ve already pushed past full employment is not good.	23	2
201503	2955	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Perhaps one reason that “later and steep” may not work in practice is that the promise of “steep” isn’t seen as credible.	23	2
201503	2956	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Because it isn’t regarded as credible, people make financial bets that pay off only if low rates continue.	23	2
201503	2957	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Whether that is the explanation or not, we note that, in each of the three longest economic expansions in post–World War II economic history, the Federal Reserve began raising short-term interest rates while unemployment was at or above the natural rate and above the jobless rate we see today.	23	2
201503	2958	2015-03-18	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2959	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2960	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201503	2961	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2962	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B.	23	2
201503	2963	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	At the previous meeting, I was uncertain that I’d be able to support the removal of the “patient” language at this meeting.	23	2
201503	2964	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	At the same time, at this meeting, I’ve actually moved back my projected liftoff date until December.	23	2
201503	2965	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	How do I reconcile those two positions—that I’m actually now quite strongly supportive of removing “patient”?	23	2
201503	2966	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Well, there are basically three reasons.	23	2
201503	2967	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	First, there’s the background reason, which almost all of us agree with, that it is actually good to get this phrase out of the regular FOMC statement because, number one, it was intended to be a transitional phrase and, number two, it’s another one of those phrases to which I think markets are attaching potentially excessive weight.	23	2
201503	2968	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So by removing it, we get rid of a lot of the speculation about it.	23	2
201503	2969	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The second reason is that I think the Chair has been very effective in her monetary policy testimony in shifting perceptions of what I have previously referred to as the “kitchen timer” phenomenon, which is to say that once “patient” is removed, the kitchen timer is flipped and we’re on course to a two-meetings-later federal funds rate liftoff.	23	2
201503	2970	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The additional language in the statement reinforces that.	23	2
201503	2971	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Third, and somewhat contrary to some of you who are looking forward to a potential June liftoff, I actually believe the recent softening of economic news makes it less likely the markets will think that there’s a kitchen timer phenomenon here—or, in Helen’s terms, that the countdown has begun.	23	2
201503	2972	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	There’s some risk that it’ll still be read that way, but that’s a risk worth taking in order to achieve the benefit that I noted earlier.	23	2
201503	2973	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t see the case, as I said a moment ago, for liftoff any time soon, but it’s healthy for us to be thinking actively about our monetary policy stance at each meeting.	23	2
201503	2974	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Now, on the substance, we may be moving into a normalized procedural and institutional environment, but the conditions out there remain very unusual, with the aftermath of the financial crisis and the Great Recession and a variety of ongoing secular changes.	23	2
201503	2975	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So in thinking about the theory and history that are relevant, I’m not entirely sure what history is most instructive, given the number of things that have changed from more recent episodes of recessions and recoveries.	23	2
201503	2976	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I do understand the abstract point that a return to full employment and continued recovery will, at some juncture, push inflation up, but I haven’t yet heard the reasons why, at some particular point, we’ll know that we have crossed that threshold and we should have reasonable confidence that that’s the path that we’re on.	23	2
201503	2977	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	It will presumably be based on something specific that isn’t present right now.	23	2
201503	2978	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	We’re all emphasizing our data dependence, and so I look forward in future meetings to hearing what specifics people have that make us think we should conclude that now we have that reasonable confidence.	23	2
201503	2979	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I presume that those of you who have been ready to move for some time don’t need any more data, but, for those of us who have not, I think it is important to have that conversation and, specifically, to say, again, what has changed so that now we can have that kind of confidence that we didn’t beforehand.	23	2
201503	2980	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I will say that there are a couple of other background reasons why my instincts are for later rather than sooner.	23	2
201503	2981	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	One is just a conversation to which I shouldn’t attach enormous significance, I guess, but it did have an effect on me.	23	2
201503	2982	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Some weeks ago, I asked an economist who watches financial markets pretty closely what his explanation for the low level of inflation compensation was.	23	2
201503	2983	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	He proceeded to give me several interesting technical explanations, and then he said, “I don’t actually think that your inflation target is 2 percent.	23	2
201503	2984	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I think it’s closer to 1.7 percent.	23	2
201503	2985	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	So the amount of inflation compensation required is actually less than you seem to have been assuming.”	23	2
201503	2986	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that’s one guy’s view.	23	2
201503	2987	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	But he’s a straightforward, smart person who was just purporting to interpret what he was seeing in markets, and that did concern me.	23	2
201503	2988	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	I’m also concerned with the issue that many in and out of this Committee have raised:  While we’ve got a lot of ways to tighten, we don’t really have that many ways to be accommodative, and so moving prematurely could risk putting ourselves into a circumstance in which we had a limited number of efficacious responses.	23	2
201503	2989	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	The final point I’d make, though, on the substance is that, although I pushed back liftoff, as I said, to December, in 2016 and 2017 I move back closer to the pack—that is, my rate of increase of the federal funds rate will be somewhat faster than the norm.	23	2
201503	2990	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	It doesn’t quite get me to the middle of the pack, but it gets me back into the pack.	23	2
201503	2991	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	That reflects a view that we really should be sure and have a high degree of confidence.	23	2
201503	2992	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe my implicit reaction function is a high rather than reasonable degree of confidence, but, once we get there, I think that it will probably be more appropriate to normalize more quickly.	23	2
201503	2993	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	In conclusion, I’d just say that I hope I am surprised in the coming months by the intensification of economic growth and maybe some wage growth and the diminution of downside risks.	23	2
201503	2994	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Short of that, I look forward to discussions in April and thereafter of the specifics that will help me, at least, come to the conclusion that the relevant corner has been turned, and that the level of confidence that we’re moving back toward a 2 percent inflation target, while giving more opportunity for employment to grow, has been reached.	23	2
201503	2995	2015-03-18	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2996	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	2997	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201503	2998	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	2999	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	As I said yesterday, I believe we’re closing in on full employment, and I’m reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term, not least because I’m confident that this Committee will keep monetary policy sufficiently expansionary until we get there.	23	2
201503	3000	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	So I support alternative B—that it’s time to take “patient” out of the statement and to signal that it is not unlikely that we’ll want to raise rates in June.	23	2
201503	3001	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	At the same time, I support the language that says we’ve not determined when we will lift off, as it’s easy to envisage circumstances that will make us prefer to wait until after June, because either the incoming data we’ve seen recently or unanticipated developments lead us to reconsider and wait to see how events unfold.	23	2
201503	3002	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	So I think that those who are supporting alternative B, which seems to be generally accepted, are correct, and that that’s the right way to proceed.	23	2
201503	3003	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But I’d like to discuss a few issues that are worth mentioning because they’re likely to be relevant to the debate we’re going to have about timing over the next several months.	23	2
201503	3004	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	First, there is the issue of the length of the lags with which monetary policy actions affect the real economy.	23	2
201503	3005	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Estimates of dynamic monetary policy multipliers imply that the decisions we make this year may not have their greatest effect until 2017.	23	2
201503	3006	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	While we cannot now place much faith in the 2017 forecasts for the state of the economy, it’s more likely than not that a smaller punch bowl will be wholly appropriate for the tight labor market and rising inflation that we may well face a year or two from now.	23	2
201503	3007	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we need a sense of proportion.	23	2
201503	3008	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Raising the federal funds rate ¼ percent is not akin to shifting monetary policy from accommodative to contractionary.	23	2
201503	3009	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, we’ll be moving from an ultraexpansionary monetary policy to an extremely expansionary monetary policy.	23	2
201503	3010	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll still have rates that are low enough to continue to support the recovery while beginning to normalize monetary policy, itself a relevant positive factor in making our decision.	23	2
201503	3011	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Moreover, if the economy turns out to have less momentum than we are—or at least I am— currently estimating or if we’re hit with more negative shocks, we can lower the rate again.	23	2
201503	3012	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Indeed, we should all be looking forward to a time when rates might more regularly be expected to move in either direction.	23	2
201503	3013	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Third, if I can just insert a brief comment relating to the discussion on forward guidance—namely, the interchange between Presidents Lockhart and Williams on forward guidance—I, too, believe we need to avoid date-based guidance.	23	2
201503	3014	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But, even more, I think we should avoid constraining ourselves going forward.	23	2
201503	3015	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We should do what we can to reveal to the markets the way we’re thinking, but without committing ourselves to tying our hands going ahead.	23	2
201503	3016	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We could give forecasts.	23	2
201503	3017	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That’s what’s being done in many other countries.	23	2
201503	3018	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it was particularly helpful to have those forecasts, but what they do do is to make it clear as you look at them ex post that our knowledge about what we’re going to do is quite limited.	23	2
201503	3019	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But we can find other ways of revealing that than publishing the forecasts.	23	2
201503	3020	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, the choice of interest rate path is sometimes described as a choice between an early and gradual path and a later and steeper path.	23	2
201503	3021	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The main argument given for starting later has been that, all else being equal, the existence of the lower bound should make us wait at least a bit longer to raise rates than we would have otherwise.	23	2
201503	3022	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But that argument is always true, and, at every moment, you can say that.	23	2
201503	3023	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That choice means, on average, staying at the lower bound longer, which, to my mind, also has costs.	23	2
201503	3024	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	What we have to do is to calibrate when the costs have exceeded the benefits.	23	2
201503	3025	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That’s very difficult, but I think we’re very close to that point or will be within, say, a couple of months or perhaps a bit more.	23	2
201503	3026	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, I do not believe, although I’ve heard it said repeatedly, that having to reverse course is the end of the world.	23	2
201503	3027	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Let me explain a factor that I think we overlook.	23	2
201503	3028	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	If the situation becomes dire enough, we could once again use QE.	23	2
201503	3029	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	But if the situation is sufficiently dire to move us from plus 25 basis points back to zero, it would have been very dire if we had stayed at zero, and we’re going to have to respond in that case as well.	23	2
201503	3030	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s not that we get away from having to confront situations in which it will be very uncomfortable with being at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201503	3031	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, I’d like to add a detail about when to lift off.	23	2
201503	3032	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We’re all familiar with the argument that we should lift off late because of the possibility that, by lifting off earlier, we’d face a higher probability of having to reverse course and return to the effective lower bound.	23	2
201503	3033	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The question is not whether we might have to reverse course.	23	2
201503	3034	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It is whether and when the expected gain from lifting off becomes positive.	23	2
201503	3035	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	That means we have to weigh the costs of having to reverse course by the probability of having to do so.	23	2
201503	3036	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I received but haven’t, unfortunately, had time to read the paper by President Evans and his colleagues, but I did look at it.	23	2
201503	3037	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll instead talk about results that are in the memo submitted in January by de Groot, Gagnon, and Tetlow, whose title is “Stochastic Implications of Alternative Strategies for the Beginning of Policy Normalization.”	23	2
201503	3038	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The memo has in it the following, among several other, conclusions: “The probability, under the [earlier and gradual] strategy, of returning to the [effective lower bound] within eight quarters is moderate, at 10 percent, and falls to only about 5 percent under the [later and steep] strategy; however, the chance of the prescribed federal funds rate climbing to at least 3 percent within a year of initial departure is negligible under the [earlier and gradual] strategy, and about 10 percent under the [later and steep] strategy.”	23	2
201503	3039	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve really got to look at the alternative paths and not at staying here or not.	23	2
201503	3040	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	There are consequences to delaying, and we need to take them into account as well.	23	2
201503	3041	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	I see considerable benefits to the gradual strategies because I think that will enable us to deal with later disturbances in a more moderate way if we have negative disturbances.	23	2
201503	3042	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The issue of timing—of when the expected return from raising the interest rate is greater than the costs of not doing so—is a critical element in the calculation of when to lift off.	23	2
201503	3043	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It’s a critical element, but it doesn’t tell us when to lift off.	23	2
201503	3044	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	The argument for not lifting off at any particular point remains the same.	23	2
201503	3045	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	It almost goes without saying that that calculation and that decision will be at the center of our discussions over the coming FOMC meetings.	23	2
201503	3046	2015-03-18	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3047	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	3048	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201503	3049	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3050	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B.	23	2
201503	3051	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	The revised statement puts the Committee in a position to react to incoming data and events without any specific time commitment about the liftoff or path of rates.	23	2
201503	3052	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Independent of one’s view of the appropriate date of liftoff, that is an important step on the path to normalization and one that I welcome.	23	2
201503	3053	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In this SEP, I moved my estimate of the most likely liftoff date from June to September in light of the run of weaker data, the strength of the dollar, and the likely continued weakness in inflation readings.	23	2
201503	3054	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	But, as several have noted, there will be three employment reports between now and the June meeting and a smaller number of inflation readings.	23	2
201503	3055	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	If we continue to get very strong payroll numbers, declining unemployment, and at least modest inflation readings, I could be prepared to support liftoff in June, but I think it’s more likely that the date will slip to September.	23	2
201503	3056	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I’ll say again that, to me, in the long run not much rides on whether the first rate increase happens in June or September.	23	2
201503	3057	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Far more important is that the Committee have a plan to deal with the range of possible data and events as well as a consistent and clear way of communicating that plan to the public.	23	2
201503	3058	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And the center of that plan as we go forward will be the test of continued improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to the 2 percent medium-term objective.	23	2
201503	3059	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	If the Committee does choose to lift off this year, which today seems to me both desirable and highly likely, there will be a need to explain how that decision is consistent with our 2 percent medium-term inflation objective.	23	2
201503	3060	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And that will not be easy—particularly if the dollar continues to strengthen and oil prices remain weak or even decline.	23	2
201503	3061	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I see this explanation as based on the thoughts that diminishing slack will eventually produce inflation, and that monetary policy works with long lags.	23	2
201503	3062	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	The Chair persuasively outlined these points last evening and then again this morning.	23	2
201503	3063	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	I think that case needs to be made consistently—and no doubt repeatedly—if we’re to be seen as defending the 2 percent objective.	23	2
201503	3064	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	There will also be a need to foreshadow liftoff at least one meeting ahead, perhaps by signaling that the Committee is gaining confidence that inflation will move back to the 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201503	3065	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	It’s become a near cliché to say that the path of rates is more important than the date of liftoff, a statement that is obviously true in the long run but not that helpful in the short term when what we’re trying to do is to choose the date of liftoff.	23	2
201503	3066	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	But it is appropriate that the Committee now turn to thinking about, and communicating more about, the path of rates after liftoff.	23	2
201503	3067	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	And I do think that, after liftoff, we can move rates up fairly gradually, particularly if inflation continues to be weak, as seems likely.	23	2
201503	3068	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	We don’t need to be in a hurry.	23	2
201503	3069	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	In my view, policy should remain highly accommodative for quite a while longer, and that is consistent with a gradual path of rate increases after liftoff.	23	2
201503	3070	2015-03-18	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3071	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	3072	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201503	3073	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3074	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23	2
201503	3075	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	It represents a carefully balanced approach that’s an appropriate response to the divergence we are seeing in the two legs of our dual mandate.	23	2
201503	3076	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	While it seems likely that we will see further movement in the direction of maximum employment over the next two meetings, it also seems highly likely we could see lingering softness in inflation and no observed progress toward our inflation target.	23	2
201503	3077	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	This is especially likely if the dollar continues to strengthen and core import prices soften further.	23	2
201503	3078	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent momentum in the labor market suggests that resource utilization has continued to increase and may continue to do so going forward.	23	2
201503	3079	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Just how much slack remains in the economy is difficult to say, but there appears to be some slack along several margins, including unemployment, participation, and people who are working part time for economic reasons.	23	2
201503	3080	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The outlook for inflation is more uncertain.	23	2
201503	3081	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	We should expect over time that temporary factors holding down inflation, such as energy price declines and dollar appreciation, will fade, and that continued increases in resource utilization will begin to put upward pressure on wage and price inflation.	23	2
201503	3082	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	But the fading of the so-called temporary factors may, in fact, take more time than we currently expect.	23	2
201503	3083	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the effects of the dollar may fade only slowly, and dollar appreciation may well have some distance to go, exerting a significant tightening effect.	23	2
201503	3084	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, we’ve seen little convincing evidence that tighter resource utilization is yet having a significant effect on prices and wages.	23	2
201503	3085	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	And we can’t dismiss the possibility that the lingering effects of the financial crisis may have some persistent effects on the relationship between resource utilization and inflation domestically.	23	2
201503	3086	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	While the partial retracement of market- based inflation compensation measures gives some support to our hope that inflation expectations will hold steady, it’s possible that they are softening in the face of stubbornly low inflation, which would be highly troubling.	23	2
201503	3087	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, I think the risks around the outlook for inflation are slightly tilted to the downside.	23	2
201503	3088	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I view it as highly significant that the removal of the word “patient” is accompanied by economic projections from the Committee that point to a later and more gradual path of policy firming.	23	2
201503	3089	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I hope this combination accurately conveys to the public the high degree of nuance in the discussion that we’ve had in this room.	23	2
201503	3090	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me be clear about how I interpret the removal of the word “patient.”	23	2
201503	3091	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	I view this statement as announcing the end of forward guidance—which is to say, the commitment to a stated policy rate path for some time into the future—and the return to data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting policy determination starting in June.	23	2
201503	3092	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s important that the public understand the end of forward guidance does not prejudge the outcome of any subsequent meeting.	23	2
201503	3093	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Rather, it creates optionality that the target rate could be moved without a commitment far in advance.	23	2
201503	3094	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s also very important that the public understand there is nothing inevitable about either the pace or even the direction of policy moves following liftoff.	23	2
201503	3095	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	In fact, the economic and price developments since we last met in January cause me to be more hesitant that we will see the appropriate conditions for liftoff in June.	23	2
201503	3096	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I support the removal of the “patient” language to communicate clearly that we will be very closely attuned to the incoming data and will have the option of altering the policy rate path to respond to those data starting in June.	23	2
201503	3097	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	The policy reaction function in alternative B places great weight on our being reasonably confident that economic conditions and a monetary policy based on contemporaneous liftoff would be consistent with inflation moving back toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term.	23	2
201503	3098	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Assuming that core inflation remains soft relative to our target, the set of factors that might give me reasonable confidence that inflation is likely to move back toward our target are that employment growth continues at or near current rates; resource utilization gaps continue to close at about the same pace as over the previous year; measures of inflation expectations continue to firm; and we observe an inflection point in the forces that we now believe to be transitory that are weighing on core inflation—in particular, oil prices and core import prices associated with dollar strengthening.	23	2
201503	3099	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the confluence of these events is possible by June, I find it more likely that many of these conditions will not be met in June.	23	2
201503	3100	2015-03-18	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3101	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201503	3102	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201503	3103	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201503	3104	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I want to thank Thomas.	23	2
201503	3105	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve had a headache about the Taylor rule for a long time, as you all know—in large part because of the slavish adherence to a constant real equilibrium rate of 2 percent, which I think has been contradicted by the actual performance of the economy over the past few years.	23	2
201503	3106	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	So thank you.	23	2
201503	3107	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Your analysis is a welcome dose of aspirin.	23	2
201503	3108	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I appreciate it.	23	2
201503	3109	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201503	3110	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Taking out the “patient” language makes sense, given that there are some scenarios, especially those in which the labor market tightens further and wage inflation climbs, in which we’d want to lift off in June.	23	2
201503	3111	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, the statement language, the Chair’s earlier testimony, and, I expect, the statement at the press conference today should make it clear that removal of the “patient” language in no way indicates any commitment to moving in June.	23	2
201503	3112	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	It just means that June is not off the table.	23	2
201503	3113	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	I also like the fact that we’ll no longer be boxed in meeting to meeting by our forward guidance.	23	2
201503	3114	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve said that we’re data dependent.	23	2
201503	3115	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I think, the statement is finally consistent with that.	23	2
201503	3116	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of market reaction, I would expect a slightly adverse reaction from this change even though it’s widely anticipated, because the deed is often worse than the expectation.	23	2
201503	3117	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, though, I think any effect should be modest, because the shift downward in the SEP’s federal funds rate trajectory for 2015 will likely be interpreted by market participants as suggesting that the Committee is shifting more toward September, away from June.	23	2
201503	3118	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	As far as the statement language is concerned, I believe I’m like everyone else except President Lacker—I’m perfectly happy with the statement as it reads right now.	23	2
201503	3119	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you, all, for a very rich discussion of the policy issues we face.	23	2
201503	3120	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the statement language, President Lacker made a suggestion for how to change it, but I did not hear any support for it around the table.	23	2
201503	3121	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So unless I see some sudden show of support, I think what I’d like to do is to put forward for a vote alternative B, as it was distributed, with simply the word “earlier” crossed out in two places.	23	2
201503	3122	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	And I would note that Governor Brainard suggested saying something about import prices.	23	2
201503	3123	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I did want to simply mention that, in my press conference statement, I will say something about import prices holding down core inflation.	23	2
201503	3124	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	So why don’t we proceed with a vote on alternative B, with just the two instances of “earlier” crossed out.	23	2
201503	3125	2015-03-18	meeting	LUECKE	Very well.	23	2
201503	3126	2015-03-18	meeting	LUECKE	The vote will be on alternative B, as depicted on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, and on the directive on page 11 of that same handout.	23	2
201503	3127	2015-03-18	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes.	23	2
201503	3128	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	Ta-da.	1	1
201503	3129	2015-03-18	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	1	1
201503	3130	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Excellent.	1	1
201503	3131	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Fantastic.	1	1
201503	3132	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all.	1	1
201503	3133	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I need to tell you that the date of our next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, April 28 and 29.	1	1
201503	3134	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I believe box lunches are available in the anteroom now.	1	1
201503	3135	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	If anyone is staying around until the press conference, there will be a TV in the Special Library.	1	1
201503	3136	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all.	1	1
201503	3137	2015-03-18	meeting	YELLEN	I think we had a good meeting, and we’ll proceed with moving forward to where we need to go.	1	1
