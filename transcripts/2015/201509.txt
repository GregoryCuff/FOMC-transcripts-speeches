201509	0	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	5	5
201509	1	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to welcome Rob Kaplan to his first FOMC meeting.	5	5
201509	2	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Rob became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas just last week.	5	5
201509	3	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In his new role, President Kaplan brings to bear 10 years of academic experience at Harvard University, where he served as a professor and a dean; a long and distinguished career in global finance; and broad experience on corporate and noncorporate boards.	5	5
201509	4	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I have to say, you chose to join us at a very interesting time.	5	5
201509	5	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	5	5
201509	6	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We all look forward to working with you.	5	5
201509	7	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	5	5
201509	8	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I appreciate it.	5	5
201509	9	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me mention, as was indicated in the agenda, that the entire FOMC meeting will be conducted jointly as an FOMC and Board of Governors meeting—and this will likely be true going forward.	5	5
201509	10	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201509	11	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201509	12	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201509	13	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And without objection.	5	5
201509	14	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Our first item of business is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61	6
201509	15	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on Simon to give us the Desk report.	61	6
201509	16	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201509	17	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, a sharp rise in concern about emerging market growth, particularly in China, triggered a broad decline in global risk-sensitive assets.	61	6
201509	18	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Oil and other commodity prices fell, at times reaching levels last observed in early 2009, and inflation compensation measures in the United States and other advanced economies continued to decline.	61	6
201509	19	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Most emerging market currencies depreciated, in some cases quite sharply.	61	6
201509	20	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Nominal Treasury yields were relatively little changed, reportedly in part because flight-to- quality demand was offset by large-scale reserve sales by emerging market central banks, which intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets in a bid to stabilize the value of their currencies.	61	6
201509	21	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Toward the end of the period, as US markets calmed down, investors were intensely focused on the prospects for Federal Reserve policy firming in light of the positive news on US real activity during the intermeeting period.	61	6
201509	22	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I will begin by discussing these financial market developments.	61	6
201509	23	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will then discuss money market developments and operational matters.	61	6
201509	24	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The People’s Bank of China unexpectedly devalued the renminbi versus the dollar following a long period of stability and predictability in the management of that exchange rate, as shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit.	61	6
201509	25	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Although the devaluation was relatively small compared with the increase in China’s trade- weighted exchange rate over the past year, it came on the heels of a string of weak Chinese economic data and the unwinding, at least in part, of a bubble in Chinese equities.	61	6
201509	26	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The devaluation appeared to intensify greatly the existing concerns among market participants about the severity of the growth slowdown in China and the ability of the Chinese authorities to address it appropriately.	61	6
201509	27	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Sentiment toward Chinese policymaking had already been fragile, especially in light of the often heavy- handed and ultimately unsuccessful effort over the past few months to halt the selloff in equities.	61	6
201509	28	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Following the devaluation, capital outflows from China accelerated markedly from already high levels.	61	6
201509	29	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	These outflows led, within a couple of days, to large-scale foreign exchange intervention to prevent further renminbi depreciation.	61	6
201509	30	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The concerns raised by the devaluation, along with a number of significant developments in other emerging markets that I will discuss later, contributed to a broad selloff in global risk assets.	61	6
201509	31	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, equity price indexes in both emerging and developed economies declined sharply.	61	6
201509	32	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The S&P 500 index fell by more than 10 percent over a two-day period before recovering somewhat and is about 7 percent lower, on net, over the period.	61	6
201509	33	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Nominal Treasury yields changed only modestly over the period, and real yields actually increased somewhat at most tenors.	61	6
201509	34	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The middle-left panel shows a decomposition of the changes in forward nominal rates into real and inflation compensation components.	61	6
201509	35	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants expressed surprise that nominal yields did not fall substantially and found the rise in real yields incongruous with the decline in global risk sentiment and flight-to-quality effects that are ordinarily expected to push yields down in such circumstances.	61	6
201509	36	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants believe that this relative stability in nominal yields reflects the downward pressure of typical flight-to-quality flows being offset by upward pressure stemming from sizable sales of Treasuries by Chinese and other emerging market reserve managers intervening to support their currencies.	61	6
201509	37	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Your middle-right panel presents information about Chinese intervention activity.	61	6
201509	38	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	PBOC official reserve data for August showed a decline in reserve holdings of about $100 billion.	61	6
201509	39	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants believe that this figure might understate the scale of Chinese sales—for example, by omitting intervention via foreign exchange derivatives—and estimate that the PBOC’s intervention might have been up to $200 billion last month.	61	6
201509	40	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Contacts believe that the PBOC funded outright interventions in large part via sales of shorter-dated, off-the-run nominal Treasury securities, and, as Lorie will discuss later, primary dealers’ inventories of these securities rose rapidly.	61	6
201509	41	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, the PBOC was reportedly active in a range of other assets and across a variety of other currency pairs.	61	6
201509	42	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally expect continued high levels of intervention to stem depreciation pressures on the renminbi, with some expecting that intervention could total several hundred billion dollars through the spring of next year.	61	6
201509	43	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The combined effect of these actual and anticipated sales probably will put significant upward pressure on Treasury yields, although it is difficult to quantify the effects.	61	6
201509	44	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Chinese officials appear to be hoping that various recently introduced so-called macroprudential measures will stem capital outflows and reduce the corresponding need for further FX intervention and asset sales to stabilize the currency at around its current level.	61	6
201509	45	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	However, investors appear skeptical that these measures will have much effect on capital flows, which are thought to be motivated by expectations for further renminbi depreciation and a loss of confidence in the Chinese economic outlook.	61	6
201509	46	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As further evidence of the possible effect of intervention on US Treasuries, market participants have pointed to a narrowing of swap spreads—the difference between interest rate swap rates and cash Treasury yields—shown in the lower-left panel.	61	6
201509	47	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	According to this argument, the narrowing of swap spreads reflects underperformance of Treasuries versus other fixed-income assets in large part due to the concentrated flow of Treasury sales by reserve managers.	61	6
201509	48	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The narrowing has been most notable in short-dated tenors, in which the majority of reserve selling has likely taken place.	61	6
201509	49	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Concern about a slowdown in China and other emerging markets also drove a steep decline in oil and other commodity prices.	61	6
201509	50	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-right panel, oil prices fell 13 percent on net over the period amid very high volatility.	61	6
201509	51	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition to demand-related concerns, the decline in commodity prices also partly reflects expectations for oil production, both by OPEC member countries and by shale- exploration firms, to respond to recent price declines more slowly and to a lesser extent than earlier believed, as well as expectations for a significant rise in oil exports from Iran following the lifting of trade sanctions.	61	6
201509	52	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Declines in commodity prices, the surprise renminbi devaluation, and concern about fragility in many emerging economies have contributed to a significant decrease in emerging market asset prices, most notably in commodity-exporting economies.	61	6
201509	53	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit illustrates the relationship between countries’ intermeeting currency performance, on the vertical axis, against the share of their exports that come from commodities, on the horizontal axis.	61	6
201509	54	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This panel shows that countries for which energy is a more important export experienced larger currency depreciations; for example, the currencies in the lower-right quadrant depend most on energy exports and exhibited the largest depreciation.	61	6
201509	55	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	These large exchange rate moves appear to reflect concern about the effect of sizable changes in the terms of trade on the economic health and fiscal, financial, political, and social stability of countries whose fortunes are closely tied to commodity exports and to China.	61	6
201509	56	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The performance of the Turkish, Brazilian, Malaysian, and Russian currencies, which lie well below the best-fit line in this figure, also reflects the effects of political developments in these countries as well as, in the case of Brazil, a credit downgrade by Standard & Poor’s to non-investment grade.	61	6
201509	57	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The decline in energy prices has also contributed to a continued fall in inflation compensation at both short and long horizons.	61	6
201509	58	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows the evolution of 5-year inflation compensation as measured in the swaps market over the past several years in the euro area and the United States.	61	6
201509	59	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Each measure is well below its respective 10-year average, represented by the dashed horizontal lines.	61	6
201509	60	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In the United States, 5-year inflation compensation fell about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period and is now near mid-2010 levels, although market measures of deflation probabilities are lower than they were in that earlier period.	61	6
201509	61	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the drop in oil prices, market participants cite low inflation data, the appreciation of the trade-weighted dollar, and concerns about global economic growth as placing downward pressure on US inflation compensation.	61	6
201509	62	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated forward inflation compensation also fell over the intermeeting period in the United States and the euro area.	61	6
201509	63	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Respondents to the Desk’s surveys continue to report that their own forward inflation expectations are little changed.	61	6
201509	64	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	At the same time, they attribute about one- third of the decline in long-forward inflation compensation over the period to a decline in the markets’ overall assessment of inflation expectations, which is more than is attributed to this factor by most term structure models used in the System.	61	6
201509	65	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In response to increased concerns about the inflation and growth outlook, the ECB at its September 3 meeting signaled a willingness to change the size, composition, and duration of its purchase program, should conditions warrant, and adjusted one of the key parameters of its program to give more room to enlarge it if necessary.	61	6
201509	66	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Sustained asset price response to this communication was limited.	61	6
201509	67	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	At its meeting this week, the Bank of Japan lowered its expectations for exports and production because of the slowdown in emerging markets but suggested the Japanese economy continues to recover moderately and kept its inflation outlook unchanged.	61	6
201509	68	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	A majority of Japanese market contacts believe the BOJ will expand the scope of its QE program later this year in pursuit of its inflation goal.	61	6
201509	69	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Some contacts report concerns that advanced-economy central banks—many of which are facing persistently low inflation while already at the zero lower bound and using quantitative easing measures—will be unable to adequately react to an external shock stemming from a significant global growth slowdown.	61	6
201509	70	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In a new survey question, we asked the dealers to estimate the probability that the global economy will be in a recession six months from now.	61	6
201509	71	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The average probability was 20 percent, with a range of individual beliefs from 5 to 50 percent.	61	6
201509	72	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	For comparison, the average probability associated with a recession in the United States was 13 percent.	61	6
201509	73	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Separately, market participants report uncertainty about how well some countries, most notably Brazil, will cope with tighter US monetary policy, and note that many countries experienced significant challenges during the 2013 “taper tantrum.”	61	6
201509	74	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	However, it is important to emphasize that most market participants assess that these difficulties in individual countries by themselves are not material to the US outlook.	61	6
201509	75	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	However, with policy firming likely to take place in the United States in the near or very near future, it is useful to recall that one of the lessons of the taper tantrum was that dollar carry trades might be more pervasive than standard measures indicate, and that their unwind can produce a deterioration of financial conditions in the United States through a decline in global risk appetite.	61	6
201509	76	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Thus, it will be important to monitor closely for evidence of carry-trade-type linkages in offshore dollar markets.	61	6
201509	77	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This is particularly true for activity running through Hong Kong, which is in the unusual position of maintaining a peg to the US dollar while having the most open capital markets with mainland China.	61	6
201509	78	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The rise in uncertainty associated with the global economic outlook prompted an increase in volatility across most assets.	61	6
201509	79	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Your middle-left panel shows the increase in implied volatility, most notably in equities and foreign exchange, in the period since the PBOC’s devaluation.	61	6
201509	80	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Implied volatility for equities in particular remains elevated, although it has come off its highs.	61	6
201509	81	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants reported that liquidity conditions, especially in foreign exchange and equity markets, deteriorated over the period, and that this contributed to some punctuated moves in asset prices, particularly on August 24.	61	6
201509	82	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As in earlier events, such as the Treasury market moves last October 15, there seemed to be increased intraday volatility when large shocks or belief swings required big position unwinds.	61	6
201509	83	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In this context, commentary over the period highlighted the effect of position adjustments by so-called risk parity strategies on market volatility.	61	6
201509	84	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	To date, these liquidity events have been transitory and do not seem to have materially affected market pricing.	61	6
201509	85	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	It is possible that these events are just part of the new landscape for financial markets with no implication for policy.	61	6
201509	86	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	While market participants continue to see an increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting as a real possibility, expectations for this declined notably amid the financial market volatility.	61	6
201509	87	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows the market-implied probability of liftoff at or before the September meeting, derived from federal funds futures prices and data from the Desk’s surveys about where the effective rate will trade in the target range following liftoff.	61	6
201509	88	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The probability had been about 50–50 before the PBOC devaluation and is now about 1-in-4 to 1-in-3.	61	6
201509	89	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have suggested that diverse views expressed in policymaker communications over the period added to uncertainty surrounding the timing of liftoff.	61	6
201509	90	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss policy expectations and possible market reactions more in his briefing.	61	6
201509	91	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Turning to conditions expected at liftoff, for some time the Desk surveys have asked about expectations for inflation between one and two years ahead at the time of liftoff.	61	6
201509	92	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the lower-left panel, the mean expectation is now that inflation between one and two years after liftoff will run a bit low, at 1.8 percent.	61	6
201509	93	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This decline appears to reflect a belief that subdued inflation will be somewhat more persistent than earlier thought.	61	6
201509	94	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Let me conclude by noting the tightening in many common components of financial conditions indexes over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201509	95	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Your lower-right panel shows the intermeeting performance of assets that form the core of most such indexes.	61	6
201509	96	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	As the panel shows, conditions in the equity, high-yield credit, foreign exchange, and real interest rate markets all tightened, with mortgages the significant exception.	61	6
201509	97	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	These moves were large both in absolute terms and in comparison with recent historical behavior.	61	6
201509	98	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This illustrates that adverse developments in China and other emerging market countries have the potential to affect US asset prices in a way that, if sustained, might have significant implications for the US economic outlook.	61	6
201509	99	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	David Wilcox and Steve Kamin will discuss the implications of this risk further in their briefings.	61	6
201509	100	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will now discuss money markets and operational matters.	61	6
201509	101	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	As Simon noted, measures of domestic financial conditions tightened over the intermeeting period, though this tightening was not accompanied or led by any increase in dollar funding strains.	61	6
201509	102	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	We have, however, observed a relatively modest but steady increase in some money market rates since earlier this year, as shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit.	61	6
201509	103	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	This trend continued over the period, and the average effective federal funds rate for the month of August, excluding month-end, reached 14 basis points, its highest level in over two years.	61	6
201509	104	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants have speculated that the increase in the effective rate over recent months has been the result of a number of factors, including the pull of higher secured money market rates.	61	6
201509	105	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	In explaining the more recent rise in repo rates, a number of contacts have pointed to foreign official sales to fund the FX intervention that Simon discussed and an associated increase in demand from primary dealers to finance these Treasury securities.	61	6
201509	106	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Indeed, as shown in the top-right panel, primary dealers’ Treasury holdings have increased since early July, leaving them with a larger amount of Treasury collateral to finance.	61	6
201509	107	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The recent upward pressure arising from these developments is similar to the upward movement in repo rates and the effective rate observed during the maturity extension program, when the Federal Reserve was selling short-dated Treasury securities.	61	6
201509	108	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Amid these higher money market rates, total daily RRP take-up declined somewhat outside month-ends, averaging $78 billion versus $140 billion last period, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201509	109	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The pattern of counterparty participation was generally consistent with prior periods, with money market funds continuing to account for most of the participation.	61	6
201509	110	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The Federal Reserve also continued to test TDF operations over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201509	111	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Take-up at the two overlapping TDF operations in August totaled nearly $125 billion, moderately lower than in the previous operations in May.	61	6
201509	112	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Meanwhile, foreign RP pool participation, shown in grey, was relatively steady over the period.	61	6
201509	113	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	As discussed at the July FOMC meeting, the staff communicated the changes in the repo pool terms of service to FIMA accounts, including the removal of individual target levels and of the requirement that we be notified in advance of changes in daily investment levels in excess of $100 million.	61	6
201509	114	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The new terms took effect on September 4.	61	6
201509	115	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	We anticipate that the size of the foreign RP pool will grow $50 billion over the next several months based on indications from one large account holder that it plans to increase its use of the service.	61	6
201509	116	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	This institution noted that it plans to increase its liquid investments in anticipation of potential market turbulence over the next year related to US monetary policy normalization.	61	6
201509	117	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the recent upward drift in some money market rates noted earlier, expectations for the constellation of short-term interest rates following liftoff have remained quite stable.	61	6
201509	118	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Responses to the Desk’s surveys and outreach to a wide range of counterparties, summarized in your middle-right panel, suggest that market participants view the Federal Reserve as having the necessary tools to control short- term interest rates following liftoff.	61	6
201509	119	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Specifically, the modal expectation is that the effective rate will print only slightly below the midpoint of a 25 to 50 basis point target range, and this expectation has been stable in responses to the Desk’s surveys for some time.	61	6
201509	120	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Other money market rates, with the exception of Treasury bills, are expected to trade at relatively similar spreads to the effective rate as they have over recent months.	61	6
201509	121	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	While respondents to the Desk’s surveys generally express confidence that the effective rate will print within the target range after liftoff—and assign very small probabilities to outcomes outside the range—they do assign a meaningful probability to it printing toward the bottom of that range.	61	6
201509	122	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	In particular, some commentary has highlighted that the effective lower bound may be providing support to money market rates that will recede as the target range is lifted.	61	6
201509	123	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Other commentary has focused on the risks that increased demand for short-term, high-quality assets related to SEC money fund reform and continued declines in dealer repo books will put downward pressure on repo rates and pull down the effective federal funds rate.	61	6
201509	124	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	More recently, market participants have noted that the timing of liftoff relative to the debt ceiling might also affect the path of money market rates.	61	6
201509	125	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Over the intermeeting period, Treasury Secretary Lew extended the debt issuance suspension period through October 30, which allows the Treasury to continue to use extraordinary measures to remain under the statutory debt limit while issuing new securities.	61	6
201509	126	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Staff and market projections suggest that these measures should allow the Treasury debt that is subject to the limit to stay below the statutory ceiling until around late November.	61	6
201509	127	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Staff projections, shown as the dotted light blue line in the bottom-right panel, suggest that bill supply could temporarily decline another $171 billion from current levels if the debt ceiling is not lifted in the near term.	61	6
201509	128	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	This reduction in supply could put downward pressure on money market rates, particularly for outstanding bills, and the potential combination of lower money market rates and reduced bill supply might prompt a sizable increase in demand at our reverse repo operations, particularly at quarter-end.	61	6
201509	129	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Demand for RRPs could be further boosted if, as in the past, money funds seek to avoid so-called at-risk securities or increase their investments in short-term, cash-like instruments in anticipation of possible redemptions.	61	6
201509	130	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	These pressures could increase the risk that demand at the ON RRP operations exceeds the current aggregate $300 billion limit.	61	6
201509	131	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	At this point, we have not seen evidence of concern about a possible disruptive debt ceiling outcome in financial markets.	61	6
201509	132	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	That said, in past episodes, and as shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, bill yields did not reflect such concern until closer to the date when the Treasury was expected to exhaust its extraordinary measures.	61	6
201509	133	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	As in previous episodes, the staff intends to prepare contingency plans for a variety of scenarios and will provide an update to the Committee at the October meeting or sooner, if needed.	61	6
201509	134	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, as detailed in a note sent to the Committee during the intermeeting period and outlined in the top-right panel, the Desk plans to offer term RRPs over the September quarter-end.	61	6
201509	135	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Should the Committee decide not to increase the target range, the Desk would propose offering $250 billion in term RRPs at 3 basis points over the ON RRP offered rate, apportioned between seven- and two- day maturities.	61	6
201509	136	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	This increased offering amount should mitigate, to some extent, the risk that a drop in Treasury bill supply might lead to more quarter-end pressure than we anticipate.	61	6
201509	137	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	This would be somewhat higher than the $200 billion offered over the past two quarter-end dates but below the $300 billion offered in December 2014.	61	6
201509	138	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee decides to raise the target range at this meeting and directs the Desk to temporarily suspend the cap on the ON RRP, the Desk plans to continue to offer the already announced $200 billion in two term operations, also with seven- and two-day maturities, but at a 0 basis point spread to the ON RRP rate.	61	6
201509	139	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Without offering any financial incentive for investing cash for term instead of overnight, we would anticipate limited take-up in the term operations and larger take-up at the ON RRP operations.	61	6
201509	140	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, I would like to provide a brief update on reinvestments.	61	6
201509	141	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk continues to reinvest principal payments on holdings of agency debt and MBS into agency MBS through secondary market purchases, and these operations proceeded smoothly over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201509	142	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Following our update at the July meeting, the Desk began aggregating agency MBS CUSIPs during the week of August 17, as planned.	61	6
201509	143	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Over the period, there was some focus on the FOMC’s reinvestment policy following the discussion in the July FOMC meeting minutes.	61	6
201509	144	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	As in prior surveys, and shown in your middle-left panel, respondents view a phasing-out of Treasury security and agency MBS reinvestments as the most likely scenario and generally expect that reinvestments will be phased out over a 10- to 12-month period.	61	6
201509	145	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your middle-right panel, according to the Desk’s surveys, the median respondent expects that the FOMC will cease some or all Treasury security and agency MBS reinvestments 9 months and 8 months following liftoff, respectively.	61	6
201509	146	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Both of these numbers represent a modest increase from median expectations in the July surveys and continue to reflect a wide range of expectations.	61	6
201509	147	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201509	148	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201509	149	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	61	6
201509	150	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions.	62	6
201509	151	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Jim.	62	6
201509	152	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201509	153	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at exhibit 2, figure 7—“FX Performance over Intermeeting Period and Net Commodity Exports.”	62	6
201509	154	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	What is the lesson I am to draw from this chart?	62	6
201509	155	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In general, countries that export a lot—mainly to China—and have done very well over the past 10 years are suffering quite a lot of exchange rate pressure right now.	62	6
201509	156	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In addition, you see some big outliers down there that I discussed that have idiosyncratic events going on right now, probably the most important of which is Brazil, due to its size.	62	6
201509	157	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	One interpretation is that this line is pretty flat, and everybody depreciated against the dollar.	62	6
201509	158	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe it’s not so much related to commodities—it’s just everyone depreciated against the dollar.	62	6
201509	159	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s a bit of a scale issue here and I agree that nearly everyone did depreciate against the dollar, but there is a relatively weak relationship here, and it does have a negative slope.	62	6
201509	160	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you took into account the depreciation over a longer period of time, you’d see more of a consistent one here.	62	6
201509	161	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	At the previous briefing, I discussed Canada and Norway in terms of the depreciation that they’ve had, and we saw less of that in this intermeeting period, but it’s been substantial leading into this intermeeting period.	62	6
201509	162	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The point we’re trying to get across is, these are really big relative price shocks for these countries, and some of what we saw in the loss of risk appetite is how well they deal with these big, relative price shocks.	62	6
201509	163	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Countries have also been changing their monetary policy stance, something that would tend to depreciate their currency.	62	6
201509	164	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Exactly.	62	6
201509	165	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s not just commodities—it’s commodity market developments in conjunction with monetary policy developments.	62	6
201509	166	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The theory is that you can get some economic stabilization by having a flexible exchange rate.	62	6
201509	167	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And we’re on the other side of that, as you pointed out.	62	6
201509	168	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have a question about panel 12, which gives key components of financial conditions.	62	6
201509	169	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Could you just plot the financial conditions index that you think is the most appropriate?	62	6
201509	170	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Because if you do it this way, then I’ve got to compute in my head what happened to the financial conditions index.	62	6
201509	171	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I think there’s a new one of those produced each day.	62	6
201509	172	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	62	6
201509	173	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	62	6
201509	174	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And they have differences among them with respect to their construction.	62	6
201509	175	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s one that’s been very prominent in the past week, and that one has been given some weight by people outside this building.	62	6
201509	176	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	For the people around this table, I think you can’t rely on an index constructed by someone else for how you should look at the deterioration in financial conditions.	62	6
201509	177	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I tried to emphasize that it’s been mixed.	62	6
201509	178	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Mortgages tightened.	62	6
201509	179	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you put a lot of weight on the housing sector, then this doesn’t look as bad as some other periods.	62	6
201509	180	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you put a lot of weight on the exchange rate, then this is a pretty big intermeeting move.	62	6
201509	181	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you look at some of the bigger indexes that are in the first percentile for the stock market, this is still pretty small.	62	6
201509	182	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We could give you one index, but I think that would be misleading because every situation is different.	62	6
201509	183	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The weights might have worked well in the past, but they might not work well going forward.	62	6
201509	184	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201509	185	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So your point is that it’s a mixed picture with respect to financial conditions.	62	6
201509	186	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201509	187	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	That, we hope, is our spin.	62	6
201509	188	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I have President Evans next.	62	6
201509	189	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201509	190	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Simon, could you talk more about chart 11 on inflation expectations between one and two years after liftoff?	62	6
201509	191	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I assume this comes from the dealer survey?	62	6
201509	192	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s from both the dealer survey and the Survey of Market Participants.	62	6
201509	193	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	62	6
201509	194	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	It seems to show that in June and July of 2014, inflation was expected to be above 2 percent.	62	6
201509	195	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Is that because they thought we would be late to liftoff?	62	6
201509	196	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We were taking a while to taper and we hadn’t finished the tapering, and now should I infer that we’re early to liftoff or right about time for liftoff?	62	6
201509	197	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Also, is there any information from this about how longer-term inflation expectations might be moving?	62	6
201509	198	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I understand that it’s short term, but any information about credibility anchors?	62	6
201509	199	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I can’t look into the heads of the people who put this answer down.	62	6
201509	200	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But you do statistical analysis of other things.	62	6
201509	201	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We do, but not psychology, which I’m not so good at.	62	6
201509	202	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	What has been the case, if you look at the probability distributions we have collected over the past year to a year and a half, there’s less probability assigned to the higher inflation outcomes, so that naturally drags down the average inflation rate that people expect.	62	6
201509	203	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In terms of the probability that inflation will be less than 1.75 percent over one to two years ahead, the dealers think there’s a 30 percent chance, which is not as high as they thought in March.	62	6
201509	204	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The buy side places a slightly higher probability on that outcome than they did in March.	62	6
201509	205	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you average the dealers and buy side together, you get about 45 percent probability, and that’s consistent with the subdued inflation we’ve seen and the current inflation outlook.	62	6
201509	206	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201509	207	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	62	6
201509	208	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	62	6
201509	209	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I want to follow up on President Bullard’s question on panel 12 and then I want to make a link to panel 5.	62	6
201509	210	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I noticed that the MBS OAS came down.	62	6
201509	211	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a clarifying question and a more analytical one.	62	6
201509	212	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	When the Treasury nominal swap spreads come down, that means that the swap rates are coming down more than the Treasury rates, right?	62	6
201509	213	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	They’re both going up, but by less.	62	6
201509	214	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, but they’re actually both coming down, on net, over the period.	62	6
201509	215	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This is the one-year forward rate, so you have to be careful with it.	62	6
201509	216	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And it’s not updated for what happened yesterday.	62	6
201509	217	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you look at the two-year note, it was 80 basis points at close yesterday.	62	6
201509	218	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And you did see swap spreads also fall again yesterday.	62	6
201509	219	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	62	6
201509	220	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, first, the swap rates have fallen?	62	6
201509	221	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201509	222	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the second question is, do we have a view on what is more correlated with the interest rates we think matter for borrowing, like corporate rates, other borrowing rates in the economy, and mortgage rates—is it swap rates or the Treasury rates?	62	6
201509	223	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Treasury securities can have special features that mean that there’s a special premium associated with those, and possibly swap rates are more correlated with the private borrowing rates that we probably think actually matter—that is my question.	62	6
201509	224	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s definitely true that this could be taken as something the private sector would like if they want to swap floating for fixed.	62	6
201509	225	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Overall, though, if you look at high yield OAS, that did move out a reasonable amount but it’s still not a really big change.	62	6
201509	226	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I’ve got 14 basis points over the intermeeting period, which we quoted as being at the 31st percentile.	62	6
201509	227	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	One of the intermeeting periods was 128 basis points, which occurred with the fall in oil prices and the effect of the energy credits.	62	6
201509	228	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	What we tried to do in chart 12 is to give a feeling for the richness of how you might measure financial conditions.	62	6
201509	229	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Are other borrowing rates besides mortgage rates, like corporate bond rates—	62	6
201509	230	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I think corporate bond rates have moved out, so they’re higher, and that’s definitely something that’s been happening over the past few months.	62	6
201509	231	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	But as Lorie emphasized, we’ve seen absolutely zero evidence of signs of stress in funding markets.	62	6
201509	232	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Again, as I said, it’s a new world, and maybe we’ll learn there’s a great index that would’ve told us what to do in a year’s time.	62	6
201509	233	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what we really need is a daily r* out of all this.	62	6
201509	234	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Thank you.	62	6
201509	235	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	You and Thomas can work on it, then.	62	6
201509	236	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	62	6
201509	237	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman Dudley.	62	6
201509	238	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Just a very short intervention on the swap rate.	62	6
201509	239	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The swap rate really is not a good indicator of what other corporate rates are going to be because it doesn’t really have a credit default component in it.	62	6
201509	240	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	When the swap is struck, there’s no notional value, so the swap rate doesn’t really reflect corporate credit rates in a—	62	6
201509	241	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	But holding that constant, it does.	62	6
201509	242	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It affects relative supply, and I think the way Simon was using it was to show that there’s a lot of Treasury supply that’s entering the market, presumably from the liquidation of foreign exchange reserves, and that’s causing swap rates to fall relative to Treasury rates.	62	6
201509	243	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There are some other explanations the Tealbook discusses as well.	62	6
201509	244	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62	6
201509	245	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My question is for Lorie, and it’s concerning the challenges of implementing the reverse repo facility when we decide to start raising rates.	62	6
201509	246	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s a two-part question.	62	6
201509	247	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	One is from panel 15.	62	6
201509	248	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Were you surprised there wasn’t more activity in the reverse repo facility around the end of August and the beginning of September?	62	6
201509	249	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And as you think about the volatility we’ve been experiencing in financial markets—the debt ceiling, the government shutdown, and end-of-the-year effects—how do you weigh those things in terms of thinking about the challenges to actually doing liftoff when we want to lift off?	62	6
201509	250	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are there things that particularly concern you as we think about October, December, or next year and what’s going to be happening, whether we’ll actually be able to lift off effectively when we want to?	62	6
201509	251	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to the first question on not seeing more usage, I guess you’re referring to the financial volatility in markets and flight to quality.	62	6
201509	252	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	We didn’t see any funding pressures, as Simon just discussed.	62	6
201509	253	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	I would think that the type of volatility we’d expect to affect the overnight RRP would be more closely connected to funding pressures than asset price volatility going longer out.	62	6
201509	254	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	So I wasn’t particularly surprised, but we were monitoring it closely to be sure.	62	6
201509	255	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to the year-end and the debt ceiling, given that the Committee is considering suspending the cap at liftoff, I don’t think we would expect to see year-end issues associated with managing the rate because there would be plenty of room to accommodate year-end pressures while targeting the overnight rate.	62	6
201509	256	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	There are other issues associated with liquidity in financial markets— there might be an exaggerated move in broader asset prices just because there’s not as much trading going on during that time of year.	62	6
201509	257	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	So I think there are two separate issues when you look at liftoff at the end of the year.	62	6
201509	258	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	One is related specifically to implementation, and I think the cap should go a long way toward alleviating that if it was lifted.	62	6
201509	259	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	The other is just broader financial market volatility, and I think that one is harder to assess, but I would say that there’s a lot less liquidity at year-end.	62	6
201509	260	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	With respect to the debt ceiling, I think it can go both ways.	62	6
201509	261	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	One the one hand, with the reduction in bill supply, we should expect there to be more pressure to use the overnight RRP due to a shortage of collateral.	62	6
201509	262	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	On the other hand, we don’t know when that really is going to start, and we also don’t know how markets are going to treat the at-risk securities.	62	6
201509	263	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	If market participants think the ON RRP facility is going to be there, they may not withdraw from the money funds that might give them those at-risk securities, and so we might not see the pressures there.	62	6
201509	264	2015-09-17	meeting	LOGAN	I think it’s hard to know with respect to the debt ceiling.	62	6
201509	265	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201509	266	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201509	267	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought panel 12 was quite informative.	62	6
201509	268	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was wondering if you know or if you could provide a similar metric with regard to the decline in market-based measures of inflation compensation during the intermeeting period in terms of a percentile.	62	6
201509	269	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought the percentile metric was very helpful.	62	6
201509	270	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I don’t have that in front of me.	62	6
201509	271	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	At times it was large—you can just look at the time series chart to see that.	62	6
201509	272	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s going to vary by which measure you use.	62	6
201509	273	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There was definitely a period, around the middle-to-late part of August, when it was falling quite strongly, but I don’t have that offhand.	62	6
201509	274	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We can find it for you.	62	6
201509	275	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, if you could.	62	6
201509	276	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s not going to be as big as some of the moves we’ve seen in the past.	62	6
201509	277	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Remember, when I show you a chart like this, it doesn’t tell you what level we start at.	62	6
201509	278	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	A lot of people say, “The stock market was a little high, and so it naturally came down.”	62	6
201509	279	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And it could be that some of those big moves down occurred when inflation compensation was relatively high compared with where it is today.	62	6
201509	280	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	So this is neutral on these statements.	62	6
201509	281	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	This is really looking at some change in change, you could almost argue.	62	6
201509	282	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But if you could provide that to me, that would be useful.	62	6
201509	283	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes, will do.	62	6
201509	284	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	62	6
201509	285	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62	6
201509	286	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	If I could just offer a little bit of additional information regarding President Bullard’s question about the relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates.	62	6
201509	287	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	We’ve done some research on this: basically, econometrically relating changes in currency values to the share of a country’s trade that’s in both oil and non-oil commodities.	62	6
201509	288	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	It turns out that if you run that regression over the entire past year, starting when the dollar started to fall, you actually get pretty precise, statistically significant estimates of the effect of both oil prices and non-oil commodity prices on exchange rates.	62	6
201509	289	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	That explains somewhere in the neighborhood of half of the cross-sectional dispersion of exchange rate depreciations.	62	6
201509	290	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Now, if you take a snapshot of the previous intermeeting period, you might expect that, as it’s a more tumultuous time and a shorter period, you’d get a less precise reading on the relationship between commodity prices and exchange rates, and that is indeed what we found.	62	6
201509	291	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	You still have a statistically significant effect of oil prices on currencies, but it’s a smaller coefficient, and a not-statistically-significant effect of non-oil commodity prices on currencies.	62	6
201509	292	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	That’s all to say that I think the basic relationship between commodity prices and a country’s exchange rate still holds, but it’s been obscured in this past month and a half with the more general market volatility.	62	6
201509	293	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Just to respond to that—why should they depreciate against the dollar?	62	6
201509	294	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	They should really depreciate against a basket of currencies of noncommodity countries, so the dollar is sort of proxying for the noncommodity—	62	6
201509	295	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Well, they probably are.	62	6
201509	296	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	62	6
201509	297	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	But that would be a big part of the world if you include the yen and the Europeans.	62	6
201509	298	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Well, the euro and yen went up against the dollar, so the currencies of commodity countries depreciated against them as well.	62	6
201509	299	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions or comments?	62	6
201509	300	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201509	301	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to ratify domestic open market operations since July.	63	6
201509	302	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63	6
201509	303	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63	6
201509	304	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63	6
201509	305	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’re next going to turn to “System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy,” and I’m going to call on Beth Klee to start us off.	96	9
201509	306	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	307	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Chris Erceg and I will be referring to the materials titled “SOMA Reinvestment Policy.”	96	9
201509	308	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	At the July FOMC meeting, participants discussed various aspects of the decision to end reinvestment, including the appropriate economic conditionality of such a decision and the macroeconomic effects of alternative strategies.	96	9
201509	309	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	In that context, you recently received a follow-up memo that addressed a number of these questions.	96	9
201509	310	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	As noted in the upper panel of your first exhibit, key questions include the following: How much might the choice of reinvestment strategy matter for economic outcomes?	96	9
201509	311	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	How much might the choice of reinvestment strategy affect the path of the federal funds rate?	96	9
201509	312	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	And can reinvestment strategies that are linked to the federal funds rate improve economic outcomes in situations when the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate is binding?	96	9
201509	313	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	In our briefing, Chris and I will provide evidence on these issues and discuss possible implications for the reinvestment language options included in alternative C of the September Tealbook.	96	9
201509	314	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	To start, under the trigger strategies considered in the staff memo—and as noted in the lower panel—the Committee would announce that full reinvestment of the principal payments from Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities would continue until the federal funds rate reaches the trigger—either 1 percent or 2 percent—and then stop permanently.	96	9
201509	315	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	These strategies have several key features.	96	9
201509	316	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	First, they are state dependent and, therefore, in line with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans document, which indicates that the timing of the end of reinvestment will depend on the economic outlook.	96	9
201509	317	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Second, these strategies link reinvestment to the level of the policy rate, a feature that may be conceptually attractive as it then indirectly links the end of reinvestment to economic conditions.	96	9
201509	318	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Third, the conditionality is limited because the triggers, as constructed, imply that reinvestment ends permanently once the trigger is reached.	96	9
201509	319	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Of note, although we assume for illustrative purposes that the trigger strategies are geared toward specific numerical values of the funds rate, these strategies could be communicated through qualitative guidance about how far policy normalization had to proceed before reinvestment would be ended.	96	9
201509	320	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Your next exhibit explores some consequences of the trigger strategies if economic conditions evolve in line with the modal outlook.	96	9
201509	321	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Panel A compares the evolution of the SOMA portfolio under the baseline reinvestment strategy—for which it is assumed that reinvestment ceases roughly six months after liftoff, and which is depicted by the solid black line—with the trigger strategies.	96	9
201509	322	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	The 1 percent trigger— the blue dashed line—delays the end of reinvestment only briefly, while the 2 percent trigger—the red dotted line—delays the end of reinvestment until two years after liftoff, to late 2017.	96	9
201509	323	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	The larger balance sheet under each trigger strategy causes the term premium—panel B—to run a tad lower than under the baseline strategy.	96	9
201509	324	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Because the inertial Taylor rule assumed to govern the federal funds rate in our simulations does not raise policy rates enough to counteract this additional balance sheet stimulus, long-term real interest rates decline a touch compared with the baseline—panel C—and, consequently, the unemployment rate also falls a little more quickly—panel E.	96	9
201509	325	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	However, it is clear that the macroeconomic effects are small, even under the more accommodative 2 percent trigger.	96	9
201509	326	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	You might look at the results and wonder if reinvestment policy could matter much for macroeconomic outcomes.	96	9
201509	327	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Returning to the top of the exhibit, consider a polar case—shown by the green dash-dotted lines in panel A—in which the FOMC announces that the SOMA portfolio will be held constant at its current level for a very long time.	96	9
201509	328	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	In this case, the term premium drops about 40 basis points on the announcement—the green line in panel B—and the unemployment rate, panel E, falls about ¼ percentage point below baseline by 2018.	96	9
201509	329	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	This example highlights the result that reinvestment policy can have sizable effects, albeit under an extreme strategy.	96	9
201509	330	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Turning to your third exhibit, the stimulus from the alternative reinvestment strategies can be offset by a somewhat higher funds rate than implied by the inertial Taylor rule.	96	9
201509	331	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	As seen in panel A, we implement this offset for each strategy by boosting the intercept term of the Taylor rule by enough to achieve nearly the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the Tealbook baseline.	96	9
201509	332	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	As seen in panel B, only a small upward adjustment of the federal funds rate path is required under the trigger strategies—the blue and red lines—to mimic the baseline outcomes for unemployment, panel C, and inflation, panel D.	96	9
201509	333	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	By contrast, offsetting the effects of maintaining a constant portfolio requires a noticeably higher funds rate—the green line in panel B.	96	9
201509	334	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Chris will now continue our briefing starting with your next exhibit.	96	9
201509	335	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Thank you, Beth.	96	9
201509	336	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Although the macroeconomic effects of the baseline and trigger reinvestment strategies do not differ greatly under the modal outlook, trigger strategies can provide considerably more balance sheet accommodation in response to adverse shocks, particularly those shocks that would drive the federal funds rate to the ELB.	96	9
201509	337	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	To illustrate this, in exhibit 4 we consider a recessionary shock that pins the federal funds rate at the ELB for three years under the baseline reinvestment strategy—the solid black line in panel A—and results in the unemployment rate—panel B—rising to 7½ percent.	96	9
201509	338	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Under the 2 percent trigger strategy, the red dotted line in panel A, the public expects that the federal funds rate will remain below 2  percent until 2021.	96	9
201509	339	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Accordingly, SOMA holdings, panel C, are expected to remain at their current level until the funds rate reaches 2 percent in 2021.	96	9
201509	340	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	The larger balance sheet under this strategy results in a much lower path for the term premium—the red line in panel D.	96	9
201509	341	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	As a result, the trigger strategy mitigates somewhat the rise in the unemployment rate—panel B—with the peak rise about 0.4 percentage point lower than under the baseline strategy.	96	9
201509	342	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	The bottom panel discusses three key implications of trigger strategies.	96	9
201509	343	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	First, the balance sheet stimulus under the trigger strategy in an adverse scenario comes from an expectations channel:  Because reinvestment is tied to the policy rate, which is expected to remain low for a long time, the balance sheet is expected to remain large for much longer than in the baseline.	96	9
201509	344	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Second—and relatedly—a “calendar based” strategy that simply delayed reinvestment for a couple of years after liftoff would provide much less economic stimulus in adverse scenarios.	96	9
201509	345	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	This outcome is illustrated by the strategy labeled “liftoff plus 2 years” shown by the dashed blue lines in panel C.	96	9
201509	346	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It delays the end of reinvestment by two years after liftoff, to late 2017, and thus extends the SOMA holdings.	96	9
201509	347	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Because the effects on the term premium— panel D—are quite small, this alternative approach only slightly mitigates the rise in unemployment, the blue lines in panel B, relative to the baseline.	96	9
201509	348	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Returning to the bottom panel, the third key implication is that the trigger strategy only provides noticeable stimulus if the adverse shock occurs before the policy rate reaches the trigger.	96	9
201509	349	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	If the recessionary shocks occurred later, the trigger strategy— through delaying balance sheet adjustment a year or two—would provide only a small degree of additional stimulus.	96	9
201509	350	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	A strategy that would restart reinvestment in response to sufficiently bad shocks could potentially do better in limiting their adverse macroeconomic effects than would an irreversible trigger strategy, at least if this strategy were well understood by market participants.	96	9
201509	351	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Of course, the greater state dependence of this policy might make it more difficult to communicate.	96	9
201509	352	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	As noted in your final exhibit, paragraph 4 of alternative C provides two options to characterize the Committee’s thinking about when to cease or begin phasing out reinvestments.	96	9
201509	353	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	The first is to continue reinvesting “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way,” and the second is to continue reinvesting “at least during the early stages of normalization of the level of the federal funds rate.”	96	9
201509	354	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	You might view “well under way” as qualitatively consistent with the trigger strategies discussed in the memo.	96	9
201509	355	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In particular, market participants might interpret this language as suggesting that reinvestment would not cease until economic conditions had led the Committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate more than a few times.	96	9
201509	356	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In addition, the public might conclude that, in the event that the economic outlook deteriorated, reinvestment could continue for a long time.	96	9
201509	357	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	This qualitative language would leave some ambiguity about how high the federal funds rate would have to rise to trigger an end of reinvestment, although policymakers could help clarify the public’s understanding through speeches, testimony, and other communications.	96	9
201509	358	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In contrast, “at least during the early stages” might be interpreted as indicating that the Committee intends to cease or phase out reinvestment after a few hikes in the policy rate even if the federal funds rate stayed relatively low thereafter.	96	9
201509	359	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Market participants would probably view this language as indicating that policymakers place a relatively high priority on beginning to normalize the size of the balance sheet fairly soon.	96	9
201509	360	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	However, the qualification “at least” would likely suggest that the Committee wanted to retain some option to continue reinvestments if the labor market was to weaken or if inflation was stubbornly low.	96	9
201509	361	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Thank you very much.	96	9
201509	362	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Beth and I will be happy to take your questions.	96	9
201509	363	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s start with questions for Beth and Chris, after which I’ll be very interested in seeking the Committee’s views on these different options.	96	9
201509	364	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I expect that in the not- so-distant future I will be asked more about our thinking, and I’m looking for some Committee- approved language that I could use.	96	9
201509	365	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we start with questions, and then we’ll have an opportunity for comments.	96	9
201509	366	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve got a list of people who have asked to comment, and others can join on.	96	9
201509	367	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But now, questions.	96	9
201509	368	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201509	369	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201509	370	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	371	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First of all, thanks a lot for the excellent memo—I thought it was very informative and very useful.	96	9
201509	372	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d be interested in your perspectives, in terms of the language that you propose, why you decided to go with as ambiguous or qualitative a characterization as you did as opposed to at least mentioning the federal funds rate or maybe actually talking about some numerical range for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201509	373	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why use the term “well under way,” which is open to a lot of possible interpretations?	96	9
201509	374	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think that the trigger strategies potentially can be communicated in different ways.	96	9
201509	375	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	The minutes suggested that the Committee preferred qualitative guidance about the balance sheet, so we wanted to avoid really making it seem that the triggers we provide in our quantitative exercises for concreteness purposes really should be treated as numerical triggers as such.	96	9
201509	376	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had a discussion about this at our previous meeting, and I think our interpretation of the sense of those on the Committee was that they preferred qualitative language to an explicit quantitative characterization.	96	9
201509	377	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	96	9
201509	378	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	96	9
201509	379	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	380	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at panel B of exhibit 2 about the term premium effect, especially the line associated with the constant portfolio.	96	9
201509	381	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Drawing on the simulation, you said there was around a 40 basis point effect on the term premium over a decade.	96	9
201509	382	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Usually we teach people that there’s monetary neutrality, and monetary policy can only have temporary effects.	96	9
201509	383	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This looks pretty much like a permanent effect.	96	9
201509	384	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	The 40 basis points is correct.	96	9
201509	385	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	There are a couple of different things.	96	9
201509	386	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	If you structure the balance sheet so that it’s constant for a very long time, our models suggest that has a very large term premium effect.	96	9
201509	387	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	I think in the memo we estimated it was going to be about 20 years until the size of the portfolio was normalized under this scenario.	96	9
201509	388	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	I think over time the Federal Reserve has used its portfolio in order to affect longer-term interest rates, and there’s a question as to what is neutral.	96	9
201509	389	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	When we have traditionally reinvested, we’ve done it in a way that’s neutral to the Treasury’s issuance of securities.	96	9
201509	390	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	But I think that there are different ways you can think of a neutral portfolio and whether it actually will affect—	96	9
201509	391	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	According to this, if we can grow the portfolio at the pace of nominal GDP growth, we’ll depress term premiums permanently, and we’ll get permanently lower unemployment.	96	9
201509	392	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	That is long-run nonneutrality of monetary policy.	96	9
201509	393	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	I think it fades over time.	96	9
201509	394	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	I don’t think it’s—	96	9
201509	395	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Where does it fade in the picture?	96	9
201509	396	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got—	96	9
201509	397	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Further out.	96	9
201509	398	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201509	399	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The amount of government debt in the hands of the public is lower as long as we’re holding a portfolio of a given size, and that’s what the nonneutrality is—it’s on the size of the government debt, and that’s a particular monetary policy that has been undertaken in a way that does, in fact, make a change in the government debt, and it’s nonneutral.	96	9
201509	400	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Chris.	96	9
201509	401	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	I just wanted to add that it might be helpful to think of the balance sheet policy as essentially affecting what we might call the equilibrium real rate or the natural real rate.	96	9
201509	402	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	From that perspective, balance sheet policies that depress term premiums very persistently would in essence be tantamount to raising the natural real rate.	96	9
201509	403	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	And that’s essentially what’s happening in these exercises, and it would be underscored in exhibit 3, in which you see the increase in the federal funds rate at relatively long horizons.	96	9
201509	404	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Now, of course, this effect is derived from an estimated model.	96	9
201509	405	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s taken from the Li and Wei model, which is estimated over the 1994 to 2007 pre-crisis sample period.	96	9
201509	406	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s consistent with relatively large and persistent effects on term premiums associated with very protracted changes in the level of long-term assets on the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	96	9
201509	407	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	So that drives these very persistent effects, but it’s certainly based on an estimated model over the pre-crisis period.	96	9
201509	408	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201509	409	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201509	410	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	411	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think of this kind of policy intervention as really more akin to a fiscal policy intervention.	96	9
201509	412	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s not about the increase in the liabilities, but really more in terms of the composition of assets that are in the hands of the public, as Governor Fischer was suggesting.	96	9
201509	413	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And so the change in the composition of the assets in the hands of the public lowers the term premium below what it would be otherwise in a permanent fashion, for a given particular time path of public debt issuance by the Treasury.	96	9
201509	414	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Show me a model.	96	9
201509	415	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201509	416	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think, President Bullard, the fundamental non-neutrality theorem says that if all the exogenous nominal variables are changed in the same proportion, that will be neutral.	96	9
201509	417	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But this is not a change that changes them in the same proportion and so it is non- neutral.	96	9
201509	418	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	96	9
201509	419	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	If I may just quickly elaborate on some of the things that President Kocherlakota and also Chris mentioned.	96	9
201509	420	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	You might think of this as if you kept the balance sheet permanently larger, you would have a permanent shift in the equilibrium real interest rate.	96	9
201509	421	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	If you didn’t accommodate that or didn’t take that into consideration in your policy rule by moving the intercept appropriately, you would end up missing your inflation target permanently.	96	9
201509	422	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, the policy rule has, of course, the 2 percent inflation target hardwired into it, so it would constantly push against the resulting inflation overshoot that would result from not adjusting the intercept of the policy rule.	96	9
201509	423	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	But it’s still the case that if you properly took into account the resulting shift in the equilibrium real interest rate in the policy rule, then you would end up reaching your inflation target over time.	96	9
201509	424	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201509	425	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I’m looking at exhibit 3.	96	9
201509	426	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	We discussed this last time, that in principle, a change in the funds rate path should be capable of completely and exactly offsetting the effect of a different balance sheet path.	96	9
201509	427	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So I’m surprised at these little differences in C and D—why doesn’t the funds rate path for the constant portfolio result in the same unemployment and inflation rates as the baseline case?	96	9
201509	428	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Why didn’t you nail it in C and D?	96	9
201509	429	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	And, second, the intercept term in the inertial Taylor rule changes a lot, as shown in A—for example, look at the constant portfolio case—10 years from now, it’s still above 2 percent.	96	9
201509	430	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	How come, in 10 years, the difference in the funds rate paths between the constant portfolio and the baseline case isn’t closer to the difference in the intercept terms?	96	9
201509	431	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So why didn’t you nail it, and why is the funds rate not that much different at the end?	96	9
201509	432	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	I think that in the FRB/US model this is an implementation issue.	96	9
201509	433	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	We were trying to, within the confines of the model, use a relatively simple way of offsetting the additional stimulus.	96	9
201509	434	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s imperfect in exactly insulating the macroeconomic effects, but it comes, I believe, very close.	96	9
201509	435	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In a smaller-scale model that I set up, one can achieve, as one might expect, that perfect insulation, but it’s difficult to do in a much larger model.	96	9
201509	436	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Is this just a computational issue?	96	9
201509	437	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I mean, there’s some number that nails it, right?	96	9
201509	438	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Is that true in the FRB/US model?	96	9
201509	439	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Yes, in principle.	96	9
201509	440	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	You can alternatively adjust the intercept in a small- scale model or put an extremely large coefficient on the output gap.	96	9
201509	441	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	And by doing so—say, the latter approach—you’ll completely insulate the economy from the effects of what is essentially an increase in the natural real rate.	96	9
201509	442	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So were you just guessing and moving and then just gave up before you got there?	96	9
201509	443	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	96	9
201509	444	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Well, I honestly didn’t implement these simulations myself.	96	9
201509	445	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	But, nonetheless, it is difficult to do this in much larger scale models with—	96	9
201509	446	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Very rich transmission structures.	96	9
201509	447	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Exactly.	96	9
201509	448	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Transmission that is much more realistic than in our simple models.	96	9
201509	449	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In simple models, you can completely insulate.	96	9
201509	450	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s easy to do.	96	9
201509	451	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	You have many different ways of doing so.	96	9
201509	452	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	Under an optimal strategy that didn’t penalize the change in interest rates, you can exactly insulate the macroeconomy from the effects of a shift in the natural rate.	96	9
201509	453	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	In bigger models, it’s a lot harder to do.	96	9
201509	454	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s a little mysterious.	96	9
201509	455	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So the right-hand side variables in the Taylor rule are virtually the same—the only thing different is the intercept term.	96	9
201509	456	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So why isn’t the funds rate path different by about the difference in the intercepts?	96	9
201509	457	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	It’s going to depend as well on the exact way that the intercept change is phased in.	96	9
201509	458	2015-09-17	meeting	ERCEG	There are a number of complications.	96	9
201509	459	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But it was, like, 0.15 every period, and after 10 years you’d get—	96	9
201509	460	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Toward the end it’s exactly the same.	96	9
201509	461	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	If you look in 2025, they’re both about 50 basis points apart.	96	9
201509	462	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	96	9
201509	463	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thanks.	96	9
201509	464	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201509	465	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions, or can we begin comments?	96	9
201509	466	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201509	467	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Regarding your choice of a discrete stop versus a tapering strategy—there are pretty large standard errors around how we think this would actually work, because the understanding of this is somewhat experimental, as this has occurred just since the financial crisis.	96	9
201509	468	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	As you think about a strategy that just allows reinvestment to stop completely versus a tapering strategy, why did you pick the particular one that you did?	96	9
201509	469	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	And why not show a tapering strategy, as that’s where the market seems to think we’re going to go?	96	9
201509	470	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	Our Tealbook baseline is with a complete cessation of reinvestment six months after liftoff.	96	9
201509	471	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	We could have chosen a phaseout strategy—it doesn’t make a whit of difference in these models in terms of the macroeconomic outcomes.	96	9
201509	472	2015-09-17	meeting	KLEE	It’s more of a market- functioning issue.	96	9
201509	473	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201509	474	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I have a list of people who’d like to comment, and, again, I’m really interested in your views on the alternative C options.	96	9
201509	475	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin with the Vice Chairman.	96	9
201509	476	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	477	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a brief comment.	96	9
201509	478	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I very much appreciate the staff memo.	96	9
201509	479	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I thought it framed the issues very well—very small effects when using the modal forecast scenario, but more significant effects in terms of insuring against adverse outcomes.	96	9
201509	480	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, reducing the probability of returning to the zero lower bound, which I think is the key issue that we’re really talking about here.	96	9
201509	481	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the language in alternative C, I think we need a small addition.	96	9
201509	482	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m fine with the phrase “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way,” but I think we should add an additional condition that we think that the normalization is expected to prove sustainable or something similar.	96	9
201509	483	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Paragraph 5 in alternative C might read something like “The Committee anticipates doing so until the normalization of the level of funds rate is well under way and is expected to prove sustainable.”	96	9
201509	484	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The notion I have in mind here is that the end of reinvestment should not be tied mechanically to the level of the funds rate but also tied to the economic outlook.	96	9
201509	485	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I could imagine supporting an early end of reinvestment at a relatively low federal funds rate if the economy was forecast to grow very rapidly over the following year with very few downside risks in terms of the economic outlook.	96	9
201509	486	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, the likelihood would be that the Committee would raise the federal funds rate further over the next year, and the probability of an early return to the effective lower bound would be very low.	96	9
201509	487	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast, I’d favor waiting to end reinvestments if the economy was lacking forward momentum even at a somewhat higher federal funds rate.	96	9
201509	488	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because the risk of returning to the effective lower bound would be higher in that case.	96	9
201509	489	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The point I’m trying to make is that we’re delaying reinvestment for a reason—to reduce the probability of returning to the effective lower bound.	96	9
201509	490	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That should really be the parameter that we’re focusing on.	96	9
201509	491	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That probability is not just governed by the level of the federal funds rate, but also the economic outlook at the time.	96	9
201509	492	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We want to end reinvestments when that probability is relatively low, and I think that’s not sufficiently summed up just by “well advanced.”	96	9
201509	493	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you have to get the concept of the outlook in there as well.	96	9
201509	494	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	495	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201509	496	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	497	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m glad to say I’m comfortable with either version of the reinvestment language in alternative C and most other aspects of alternative C as well.	96	9
201509	498	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, but I’ll leave that to tomorrow’s discussion.	96	9
201509	499	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	96	9
201509	500	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought you might appreciate that.	96	9
201509	501	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d like to make a few observations about the staff memo, quite honestly picking up on most of the themes that were discussed in response to some of the questions and also Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments.	96	9
201509	502	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the staff memo, making decisions about the appropriate size of the balance sheet, I think it’s very important that we weigh both the costs and the benefits under a wide range of plausible scenarios.	96	9
201509	503	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The memo emphasized one specific adverse scenario in order to illustrate a potential benefit of using a state-dependent rule for any reinvestments.	96	9
201509	504	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As was described in the memo and in the presentation, in this particular scenario, a state-dependent rule continues reinvestment for several years beyond the baseline, and the larger resulting balance sheet provides additional stimulus relative to the case of ending reinvestments on a preset path.	96	9
201509	505	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in considering the merits of such a state-dependent rule, we shouldn’t lose sight of the bigger issue of the relative costs and benefits of maintaining a very large balance sheet.	96	9
201509	506	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, taking the analysis of the memo to its logical extreme, we should always maintain a very large balance sheet, arguably even larger than what we have today, to provide insurance against negative shocks.	96	9
201509	507	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I’m picking up on something implied by Vice Chairman Dudley’s comment because, according to the Board analysis we discussed, a large SOMA portfolio lowers the term premium and effectively shifts the IS curve out, and this implies a higher equilibrium federal funds rate—it’s about ½ percentage point higher than baseline for the constant portfolio.	96	9
201509	508	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What does that do?	96	9
201509	509	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It provides us with more buffer to use the federal funds rate as a policy instrument to respond to negative shocks.	96	9
201509	510	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see this memo not really being about this scenario or about the strategy for ending reinvestments.	96	9
201509	511	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Really, it’s a question of, fundamentally, do we need a bigger buffer, especially in light of concerns about a continuing very low equilibrium real interest rate?	96	9
201509	512	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In a way, I think the memo narrows the question too much to just the specific language concerning how we would end reinvestments, and we really should think much more carefully about both the benefits more generally of having a large balance sheet, and also revisit the costs around that because the memo obviously can only cover the benefits.	96	9
201509	513	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, we’ve decided through our discussions in the past that the costs of holding a very large balance sheet outweigh the benefits at most times, and we shouldn’t lose track of that in thinking through some of these issues in terms of the reinvestment strategy, as opposed to just focusing on the benefits under certain scenarios.	96	9
201509	514	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I recognize I am veering into the topic of the long-run policy strategy that the Chair has initiated and is under way, but I do think this is an important issue to think about.	96	9
201509	515	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we really do think we’re in a world of a lower equilibrium real rate and we are worried about downside risks, I think we really should be thinking in very broad terms about what the costs and benefits of the balance sheet are.	96	9
201509	516	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And getting back to President Bullard’s question, what do we really understand about the effects of the balance sheet on the equilibrium real interest rate, and what are these tradeoffs that we’re facing?	96	9
201509	517	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that the memo is fine—I have no quibbles about the memo—but it narrows this discussion down far too much.	96	9
201509	518	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The discussion we need to be having is about this broader issue of the costs and benefits of the balance sheet and not just thinking through this one experiment because, more generally, in a stochastic environment, we’re going to get hit by both positive and negative shocks.	96	9
201509	519	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I’m looking forward to the work that’s being started in the work group with regard to the long-run policy initiative, but I do hope that this is one of the issues on which they give us better guidance, and sooner rather than later.	96	9
201509	520	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	96	9
201509	521	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	96	9
201509	522	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good.	96	9
201509	523	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201509	524	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	525	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve had questions from President Bullard and discussions already by Vice Chairman Dudley and President Williams.	96	9
201509	526	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a very interesting issue present in this discussion, which is:  How should we think of the influence of the balance sheet?	96	9
201509	527	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And what this analysis has brought out has been that, essentially, in the “stock” view of what it is that quantitative easing does, all of the quantitative easing that has been done so far is in the balance sheet—it’s there and it’s having an effect.	96	9
201509	528	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Let me ask the next question and then I’ll tell you the effect.	96	9
201509	529	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	When we do quantitative easing, the short rate remains unchanged.	96	9
201509	530	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what happens to other interest rates?	96	9
201509	531	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Our analysis is that quantitative easing goes into the term premium.	96	9
201509	532	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We buy up assets, and the money that’s put into the system goes into longer-term assets and reduces the term premium.	96	9
201509	533	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So the next question is, what do we want to do over the longer term, after we’ve normalized the federal funds rate?	96	9
201509	534	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If we had already reduced the balance sheet to its steady-state level, we might have a lower federal funds rate.	96	9
201509	535	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	At some point, we might even reach the point at which we would be at a near-zero federal funds rate again.	96	9
201509	536	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What the large balance sheet is doing for us is keeping us away from the effective lower bound, as both Vice Chairman Dudley and President Williams pointed out, and it’s providing us with a twist in the term structure which we probably like.	96	9
201509	537	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We haven’t really seen the effects of quantitative easing show up in investment spending very much, but, in principle, it is a factor encouraging investment.	96	9
201509	538	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And the question is: What do we want to do?	96	9
201509	539	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Do we want to keep this effect of having a higher federal funds rate and a lower longer-term rate?	96	9
201509	540	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We’d like the possibility of keeping the federal funds rate positive for longer, I assume, because we don’t like what we’d have to do if we got back down to zero, and it will be politically controversial and so forth.	96	9
201509	541	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s useful to have this “stock of QE” under our control.	96	9
201509	542	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We can reduce it at some time by stopping reinvestment, and we could in effect reduce the stock of QE under our control.	96	9
201509	543	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So this is a kind of investment and also a monetary policy choice, in terms of what term structure we are looking at.	96	9
201509	544	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What this analysis did in my case was to make me think better of holding the larger portfolio for longer because then it would be safer for us and for the economy in terms of keeping us away from the zero lower bound in the event that we get a lot of negative shocks.	96	9
201509	545	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we may get them, we may not get them, but they’re a risk, and we’d prefer not to be there.	96	9
201509	546	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So I don’t know which of these strategies I’d like more.	96	9
201509	547	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think we should look at the likely quantitative effects of the two approaches.	96	9
201509	548	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think that what the analysis does show, particularly with that green line which goes out there forever, is that the effect of QE is 40 basis points on the federal funds rate—that’s what our models say, precisely.	96	9
201509	549	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I conclude that we ought to rethink and keep reinvestment going a little longer.	96	9
201509	550	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We have a slight problem in the fact that when you read what people say, they all assume it’s six months after normalization begins before we end reinvestment.	96	9
201509	551	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Simon, I must get a different set of analyst remarks from that you get, but that’s what I find in the analyst remarks that I read—six months, nine months—and I think we might want to go longer.	96	9
201509	552	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	553	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	554	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	96	9
201509	555	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	556	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I also want to thank the staff for the memo.	96	9
201509	557	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I actually thought it was very helpful.	96	9
201509	558	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I’m sympathetic to the notion that you can’t take into account everything, so for my purposes, this actually worked quite well.	96	9
201509	559	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	My view is that we have our normalization principles, and unless we’re rethinking those, at some point we’re going to have to end reinvestments because we want to get the balance sheet back down to what the normalization principles say.	96	9
201509	560	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	And I found the memo actually helpful in thinking about that.	96	9
201509	561	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	To my mind, I didn’t see that much difference in either the adverse scenario or the normal scenarios with the 1 percent trigger or the 2 percent trigger.	96	9
201509	562	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I like the fact that we’re tying the end of reinvestments to the funds rate because we’re using the same economic conditions.	96	9
201509	563	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	It’s a state-contingent strategy.	96	9
201509	564	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The one thing the memo did for simplicity is not allow for us to start up reinvesting again.	96	9
201509	565	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I would prefer to end reinvestments when the trigger is 1 percent, and then if need be—if things turn out to be worse than our baseline scenario—we can always start reinvesting again.	96	9
201509	566	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	This is a simple memo because, by necessity, it should be to be clear, but in terms of how we approach policy, we could reverse the decision at some point, and I think that’s what my preference would be, because at some point we’re going to have to end reinvestments.	96	9
201509	567	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Concerning the language, the one issue the memo didn’t address is when the Committee would want to provide the public with more concrete information, and I think that’s really a question for Simon and the Desk—how much advance notification do market participants need about what our strategy is going to be?	96	9
201509	568	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	If we can agree on a strategy and if you come back and say there are benefits to being clear, we might want to be more explicit in the liftoff statement about what our strategy is, including putting in, if we agree on a trigger, what that trigger is.	96	9
201509	569	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	If you think that we don’t really need to be that explicit in qualitative language, perhaps you could say something like “when normalization is further along” that would be in between the two choices on the table for alternative C.	96	9
201509	570	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But I think it’s a question really for the Desk about how much advance notification market participants need to prepare for the end of reinvestments.	96	9
201509	571	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	96	9
201509	572	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I think if it’s a 100 percent stop, then that has the potential to affect market functioning, and that’s one thing we could talk about.	96	9
201509	573	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If it was a phaseout and market participants were aware it was going to be a phaseout, I think we shouldn’t worry so much about those market functioning issues because the phaseout should take care of them.	96	9
201509	574	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	96	9
201509	575	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	576	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciated the staff memo.	96	9
201509	577	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	My comments are going to dovetail with some of the previous comments that were made by President Lacker and President Williams.	96	9
201509	578	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Overall, I want to think of the FOMC as just choosing the level of accommodation.	96	9
201509	579	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	That’s maybe just a better way to think about it.	96	9
201509	580	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Accommodation can be provided through two channels—either through the federal funds rate or through a balance sheet policy action.	96	9
201509	581	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In the first set of simulations, the FOMC acts by following an inertial Taylor rule.	96	9
201509	582	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In reality, the Committee chooses how much monetary accommodation to provide based on macroeconomic circumstances.	96	9
201509	583	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So the effects of a particular reinvestment strategy of the type outlined in the memo could be completely offset by an appropriate choice of the federal funds rate path, as has been discussed in the previous comments.	96	9
201509	584	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This is illustrated in the memo.	96	9
201509	585	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So what’s the meaning of different reinvestment strategies and probably different levels of accommodation?	96	9
201509	586	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	We want to leave it up to the Committee to change policy based on whatever the Committee thinks.	96	9
201509	587	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	And surely we want that deliberation to go on, and we want the Committee to be looking at the right level of accommodation at a particular point in time.	96	9
201509	588	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m not sure it’s a useful exercise, the way it’s constructed in the memo.	96	9
201509	589	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	And as far as our policy is concerned, I think we might as well stick to the baseline strategy of ending reinvestments six months after liftoff, and then go ahead and let the Committee choose the federal funds rate path that it judges provides the appropriate level of accommodation.	96	9
201509	590	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In the second exercise in the memo—reinvestment strategies under the adverse scenario—a similar conclusion can be drawn.	96	9
201509	591	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In this scenario, the economy is forced back to the zero lower bound in 2017 for three years.	96	9
201509	592	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	A trigger-type reinvestment strategy could provide accommodation in this scenario, but of course the Committee can simply choose the appropriate level of accommodation by choosing the appropriate level of the balance sheet—that is, presumably by reinstituting QE.	96	9
201509	593	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I know you’re swearing off QE, but if you get in the right circumstance, you’re going to use the tool again.	96	9
201509	594	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The FOMC could get exactly the right level of accommodation and not have to rely on the approximate amount offered by the trigger strategy.	96	9
201509	595	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So why are we going through this elaborate exercise of having the trigger strategy, and then we’re going to adjust our path of the funds rate that’s going to give the right level of accommodation, taking into account what the trigger strategy is going to do over the forecast horizon?	96	9
201509	596	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure that this is that useful of a way to think about it.	96	9
201509	597	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	It’s due to the substitutability of the two approaches to providing monetary accommodation.	96	9
201509	598	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	It appears that there’s little to be gained by tampering with the existing reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201509	599	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think we might as well just allow reinvestments to end at some point after we lift off and call it a day.	96	9
201509	600	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	601	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	602	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	96	9
201509	603	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	604	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Maybe because I’m the newer person, I’m a little more sensitive and maybe even uncomfortable on two fronts as we do the execution.	96	9
201509	605	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m sensitive to the fact that we have some uncertainty regarding the effect of beginning the process of raising rates—that creates its own set of uncertainties, particularly when we start from the lower bound.	96	9
201509	606	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m also particularly uncertain about the effect of beginning to phase down reinvestments.	96	9
201509	607	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Even though I agree with the overall debate and having that second discussion about the broader costs and benefits, I think, from an execution point of view, the one way we’ll find out what the effect of doing each of these is when we do it.	96	9
201509	608	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	From a risk-management and prudence point of view, my own bent—which is why I like the “well under way” language you have here—is to first make sure we are well under way when going through the first exercise of raising the federal funds rate, seeing what we learn, making sure we are in fact well under way.	96	9
201509	609	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Only after we’re comfortable with that—not only what the prospects are, but what we’ve learned from that process—can we then think about beginning the second process, which will have its own degree of uncertainty and learning that come from that.	96	9
201509	610	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I’d rather start that second process second, rather than intermingling these two at the same time.	96	9
201509	611	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	612	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201509	613	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	614	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In terms of our reinvestment policy, once it’s appropriate to raise rates, I’m fine with the language in alternative C that states we expect to continue reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”	96	9
201509	615	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The risk-management benefits from the 2 percent trigger exercise seem desirable to me.	96	9
201509	616	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	617	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	618	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201509	619	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	620	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I thought the questions that were raised by President Williams were important considerations and ones we should think more about, as well as the communication issue that President Mester raised in the context of our existing normalization principles.	96	9
201509	621	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The staff has helped us think about these triggers, but we probably need to think more.	96	9
201509	622	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	As it relates to alternative C, I have a slight preference for the language that says “at least during the early stages of normalization,” based on how we have already characterized our normalization principles.	96	9
201509	623	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I think that language preserves optionality, whereas the alternative language could limit our flexibility to begin the process sooner if we wanted to.	96	9
201509	624	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	That would be my suggestion.	96	9
201509	625	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201509	626	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	627	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201509	628	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	629	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I strongly agree with President Williams’s comments about this.	96	9
201509	630	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I really think this is a big subject.	96	9
201509	631	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I was surprised during the July meeting’s discussion to hear so much sentiment for holding on to a much larger portfolio than I thought we were contemplating a year or two ago.	96	9
201509	632	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	If we get on the road to thinking through a strategy in which we’ve got a big buffer stock, that will be the third normalization strategy for us to adopt over the past three years—we had one last year and one a couple of years before that.	96	9
201509	633	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I was glad to hear there was a fair amount of recognition that on the cost side, there were some political-economy issues and questions involved, and I think those are very important.	96	9
201509	634	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I won’t go into them.	96	9
201509	635	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I think a “global” assessment of the costs and benefits of different approaches needs to take that into account.	96	9
201509	636	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As for language, I was uncomfortable with “well under way”	96	9
201509	637	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	“At least during the early stages”—I wasn’t clear on how we are dividing up normalization into stages, but I guess it’s just a figure of speech that means “early.”	96	9
201509	638	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I liked the sound of President Mester’s suggestion about “until normalization is further along.”	96	9
201509	639	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Before the benefit of a more thorough discussion that convinces me that a bigger buffer would be useful, I’m more in the camp of wanting to end early, as I was at the July meeting.	96	9
201509	640	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But these are important issues and deserve some careful consideration.	96	9
201509	641	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	96	9
201509	642	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	643	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201509	644	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	645	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s been a very rich discussion already.	96	9
201509	646	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have to admit that I was pretty surprised at the July meeting when it became apparent that more than a few FOMC participants viewed halting reinvestments as being a decision that would be very costly to reverse by reinitiating purchases or by beginning reinvestments again, as President Mester suggested.	96	9
201509	647	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this lack of reversibility is pretty crucial in terms of how we think about the appropriate long-run size of the balance sheet, the matter President Williams raised.	96	9
201509	648	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If, as President Bullard and President Mester suggested, we’ll just turn on this tool when we need it and, if we hit the effective lower bound and we need more accommodation, we’ll begin reinvestments again or we’ll begin active purchases again, then I think it’s a very different question than if we view halting reinvestments as having enormous costs associated with it.	96	9
201509	649	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And then we have to weigh the political economy—assuming that those costs are coming from political economy considerations—against the political economy considerations that President Lacker pointed to, which are also very real in maintaining a large balance sheet.	96	9
201509	650	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These are very, very challenging issues.	96	9
201509	651	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we take as given this lack of reversibility—and that’s the way the memo drafted the problem and, in light of what I heard at the July meeting, I am very sympathetic to that way of drafting the memo—this irreversibility leads to worse economic outcomes if we have to return to the effective lower bound.	96	9
201509	652	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I argued at the July meeting, to me this means we should only be willing to halt reinvestments at a point in time when we’re willing to increase the effective lower bound on interest rates.	96	9
201509	653	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Basically, halting reinvestments is taking a tool away from yourself.	96	9
201509	654	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You should only be willing to do that if you are actually willing to take away another tool, which is to increase the effective lower bound on interest rates.	96	9
201509	655	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own thinking is, in light of where I think the long-run neutral real rate is going to be and given our recent experience, I’m pretty loath to throw away these kinds of tools at this stage.	96	9
201509	656	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My preference at this point would be to leave out any reference to reinvestment policy at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201509	657	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Kaplan raised some great points, too, about the learning that’s going to occur.	96	9
201509	658	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He hasn’t been involved in these conversations before, so he hasn’t gotten totally into the “inside the tent” kind of thinking that we all have about this, and I think that’s good.	96	9
201509	659	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that having an opportunity to learn about how this process is going to work before starting to talk about a new thing that we aren’t sure how it is going to work is wise counsel.	96	9
201509	660	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the time of liftoff, the Chair could say that this matter remains under study by the staff and principals.	96	9
201509	661	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it allows us an opportunity to dovetail our thinking about reinvestments with the longer-run operating framework exercise that the Chair initiated.	96	9
201509	662	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One comment on the normalization principles.	96	9
201509	663	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The normalization principles certainly have indicated that the Committee likes having a smaller balance sheet.	96	9
201509	664	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, the normalization principles have also said we want to keep as large a balance sheet as is necessary to be able to conduct effective monetary policy.	96	9
201509	665	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That could be a lot larger than we thought it was going to be three or four years ago—it might be larger than we think it is today.	96	9
201509	666	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this Committee will have to engage in some serious conversations about that.	96	9
201509	667	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, assuming the Committee does want to make a reference to reinvestments, I’m concerned about the vagueness of what’s in the draft of alternative C.	96	9
201509	668	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If Committee members can agree among themselves to the idea of tying reinvestments to something specific in the outlook, something specific regarding the federal funds rate, as was done in the memo, it would be really great to offer that kind of clarity.	96	9
201509	669	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Evans was chastising me for smiling at Chris’s suggestion that we rely on the speeches of the presidents to elucidate what the Committee means by this language.	96	9
201509	670	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The intermeeting period has not given me the kind of confidence that maybe I would like to have with that as a communications device.	96	9
201509	671	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	96	9
201509	672	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ve indicated before, I think if we can agree on a tie to something like the federal funds rate, it would be really good to be able to make that connection as opposed to relying on everyone’s interpretation of what that might mean.	96	9
201509	673	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	674	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201509	675	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	96	9
201509	676	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The language in the normalization principles that you referred to—large enough to conduct monetary policy effectively—my recollection is that the meaning of that was effective control of the funds rate, and I didn’t envision it to be this large.	96	9
201509	677	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But this wouldn’t be the first time different Committee members had different readings of the same phrase.	96	9
201509	678	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that the language is capable of bearing multiple interpretations.	96	9
201509	679	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	96	9
201509	680	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As does most of our language.	96	9
201509	681	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Which is precisely what it’s doing.	96	9
201509	682	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We’re expecting to have effective control of the funds rate with a very large balance sheet from the outset, and if not from the first move, then certainly pretty soon thereafter.	96	9
201509	683	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	So I’m not sure exactly how determinative that is for this.	96	9
201509	684	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	You remember, it was the idea that in a corridor system you’d need lower reserves.	96	9
201509	685	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I just think we’re bringing more assumptions to bear on what we mean by that.	96	9
201509	686	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	That’s all.	96	9
201509	687	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201509	688	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	689	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I’m sympathetic with the substantive policy leaning that Bill and Stan and others have articulated, which I think is consistent with the memo, although not necessarily foursquare with all of the details of the memo.	96	9
201509	690	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	My concern is the one I raised at the July meeting, which is about potential contingencies.	96	9
201509	691	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think President Williams’s caution—to be clear about costs as well as benefits of keeping the balance sheet where it is—is important.	96	9
201509	692	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	As people probably don’t recall, but I’ll remind you, I raised a couple of things that might happen—which I don’t expect to happen, but which might happen—in the early stages after liftoff.	96	9
201509	693	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	One could be a blowing-out of the ON RRP program beyond what we currently expect.	96	9
201509	694	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Another would be a flattening, or even inversion, of the yield curve.	96	9
201509	695	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Under those circumstances, an earlier cessation of reinvestment might be among the more efficacious tools at our disposal.	96	9
201509	696	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	In the interest of clear communication, if we’re going to say something in the statement, I hope we can find a way to put in an appropriate qualification that allows the public and markets to understand that our default position is that we’re going to let rates go up for a while for the reasons Stan said, but that if some dodgy things start happening in financial markets, we might take a somewhat different approach.	96	9
201509	697	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t have a formulation for that, Madam Chair—I apologize.	96	9
201509	698	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s going to be something like that, with that phrase that we always used to stick in—“in the context of price stability.”	96	9
201509	699	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We used to talk about 19 things we were going to do “in the context of price stability,” which gave the message that if inflation started to go too far one way or the other, it might vary what we were going to do.	96	9
201509	700	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe people could come up with a similarly euphemistic phrase that would do the trick.	96	9
201509	701	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I hope we can go in sequence here, and I hope we can get some of the benefits that Beth and Chris were talking about in their memo, but I think we need to allow for the possibility that we won’t be able to keep as pristine a separation of the two policy tools as we would like.	96	9
201509	702	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	96	9
201509	703	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	704	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201509	705	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	706	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I have a strong desire, which I assume is widely shared, to avoid returning to the effective lower bound.	96	9
201509	707	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I also suspect that the possibility of doing so is uncomfortably high.	96	9
201509	708	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	On gearing up quantitative easing again, I want to say a couple of things.	96	9
201509	709	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	First, I think we’ve never looked at asset purchases as other than a second-best tool.	96	9
201509	710	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I think that’s been the way it’s been talked about since the very beginning—uncertain as to its effect, uncertain as to bad effects, and certainly uncertain as to political economy characteristics.	96	9
201509	711	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I would put a decision to end reinvestments and then a decision to reverse that as not at all akin to a decision to start asset purchases again.	96	9
201509	712	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	To me, they’re two completely different things.	96	9
201509	713	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I think if the Committee were to decide to end reinvestments and then six months later there were a shock, I think it would be an easy decision to begin reinvestments again on the grounds that we would have so little to work with in the way of rate cuts to make.	96	9
201509	714	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	So I look at those decisions as very different.	96	9
201509	715	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Those things lead me to a strong preference for the “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.”	96	9
201509	716	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I could learn to like the 1 percent or 2 percent thresholds.	96	9
201509	717	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I will say that the real economy effects are tiny, and, if I’m right they would be even smaller if, in fact, the irreversibility assumption is really not right as a practical matter.	96	9
201509	718	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But I’m open to learning more about those.	96	9
201509	719	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I’d prefer to work with interest rates until we get way away from the effective lower bound.	96	9
201509	720	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	96	9
201509	721	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	722	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201509	723	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	724	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	My judgment is animated by, first, a desire to maintain the parsimony and clarity of our policy framework and, second, by what I believe to be asymmetric risk-management considerations over the period that we are considering.	96	9
201509	725	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Those considerations lead me to favor a 2 percent quantitative target.	96	9
201509	726	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The policy framework that we’ve agreed to over the past year makes the federal funds rate the focal point for our policy stance.	96	9
201509	727	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s clear, it’s familiar to market participants, and it’s empirically well understood, and I’d like to keep the focus on that.	96	9
201509	728	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, we’ve spent considerable effort over the past several meetings trying to make the public understand that our policy framework is based on the economic outlook and not on a calendar.	96	9
201509	729	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I’d be very reluctant to have our reinvestment policy in any way migrate back toward a time-based framework.	96	9
201509	730	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the most parsimonious way to capture economic developments is to condition our reinvestment policy very clearly on the behavior of the one variable that we have focused on, which is the federal funds rate.	96	9
201509	731	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	It summarizes information from a wide variety of economic indicators on progress toward our goals.	96	9
201509	732	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to risk-management considerations, I think the staff analysis did a very nice job of laying those out.	96	9
201509	733	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Like others, I don’t believe the bar for reinitiating QE is at all similar to a bar for a 25 basis point cut, for instance, or turning on and off reinvestment.	96	9
201509	734	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	So I do believe that that effective lower bound constraint is a very important one.	96	9
201509	735	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	For all those reasons, I would like to see the reinvestment conditioned on a 2 percent rate.	96	9
201509	736	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s clear, it gives us that cushion, and we can easily avoid the notion that you turn off reinvestment permanently once you’ve hit 2 percent by making clear that only while you’re above 2 percent would reinvestment cease.	96	9
201509	737	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think that would be pretty easy to introduce into the language.	96	9
201509	738	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That would be my strong preference.	96	9
201509	739	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	740	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	96	9
201509	741	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anybody else who’d like to comment?	96	9
201509	742	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201509	743	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	744	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	This is not only because I failed to thank the staff for their very good work the first time around, so I asked for a second time.	96	9
201509	745	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you for the quality of the work you did.	96	9
201509	746	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think the issue of whether we can stop running off the portfolio at a certain point is critical to this discussion.	96	9
201509	747	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	President Bullard made it sound like it was very easy, but I think it will actually take some thought about how to present that before we can get that as part of the solution.	96	9
201509	748	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What Governor Brainard just said is possibly the solution and what we need—that is, we can begin reinvesting again if the federal funds rate goes below a certain level, and 2 percent sounds attractive.	96	9
201509	749	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That gives us a conditional reinvestment policy, which I think makes a lot of sense in terms of combining the risk-management feature, as I think Governor Brainard and Governor Tarullo called it, with our desire to reduce the size of the portfolio.	96	9
201509	750	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We need to think about what’s going to happen as the portfolio starts getting down to the target level.	96	9
201509	751	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What happens, in that case, if we suddenly find ourselves heading off in a direction that we don’t want to go with the interest rate beginning to decline for a variety of reasons and this leads us to begin to worry?	96	9
201509	752	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We then actually want, at that point, to start buying assets, I think—that is, to do quantitative easing before it’s quantitative easing at zero interest rates, which is a bigger problem.	96	9
201509	753	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	This is just another way of saying we need flexibility on the issue of when we’re allowed to increase the size of the balance sheet in terms of the conditions we place on ourselves.	96	9
201509	754	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think that’s something the staff can work on very well.	96	9
201509	755	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	My conclusion from this discussion is that not everybody, but quite a few people, have referred to the possibility of turning on and off the end of the reinvestment process and that the 2 percent level is a good one.	96	9
201509	756	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And then we might need to specify in more detail what it is that will happen that will allow us to explain why we’re turning it on and off in terms that are clear, understandable, and acceptable to the public.	96	9
201509	757	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think this has been an extremely useful discussion.	96	9
201509	758	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What has come out of it is a way of rethinking our principles for reducing the size of the portfolio.	96	9
201509	759	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Do we have to stick by what we said when we haven’t actually implemented anything?	96	9
201509	760	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If we have found a better way, are we not allowed to use it because we hadn’t thought of using it until now?	96	9
201509	761	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	There must be an elegant solution.	96	9
201509	762	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Last night, I was watching an interview of Justice Souter by Charlie Rose, and there was a discussion on the topic, What do words mean?	96	9
201509	763	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Charlie Rose kept inventing complicated situations and asking, “Is that acceptable under the law?”	96	9
201509	764	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And Souter kept saying, “Well, words are not precise, and that’s why the law can work.	96	9
201509	765	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If there are ways of doing what needs to be done and that everybody understands needs to be done, we need to find a way within the words that exist.”	96	9
201509	766	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I wonder if we can do that for ourselves as well.	96	9
201509	767	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201509	768	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201509	769	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comments?	96	9
201509	770	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Just a question, Madam Chair, for Simon, to return to a consideration that a few of us talked about last time.	96	9
201509	771	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Simon, the consideration is the size of the maturations that are actually occurring at any one time.	96	9
201509	772	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	If I recall correctly, we have about a two-year window from around the middle of next year to 2018 when the amount maturing is relatively small with an occasional month that’s—	96	9
201509	773	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	That’s in the Treasury securities market, yes.	96	9
201509	774	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But then, in 2018, it picks up quite a bit.	96	9
201509	775	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	96	9
201509	776	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	If we ended up delaying cessation of reinvestment until 2018 or later, do you anticipate that would be, in operational terms and in terms of effect on markets, significantly more challenging than if it were to happen during that two-year window?	96	9
201509	777	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Or does it depend on so many other factors that it’s probably not worth using as a criterion?	96	9
201509	778	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	The operational part for Treasury securities is not that difficult because we’re rolling over at auctions.	96	9
201509	779	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	To reinvest the MBS—remember that we’re purchasing in the secondary market, so that has operational cost to it.	96	9
201509	780	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	But it’s the same costs that we have right now, and we also have the experience.	96	9
201509	781	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There’s one issue, which is that if we stopped reinvestment and had to restart, we still have to have the experience to restart.	96	9
201509	782	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And that’s something that we should think about after the discussion today.	96	9
201509	783	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201509	784	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	This has been a useful discussion.	96	9
201509	785	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	If somebody asks me at the press conference tomorrow, I’ll stick with what’s in our normalization principles while we consider this further.	96	9
201509	786	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	For the moment, I’m probably best saying this is something the Committee is discussing and no further judgments have been made yet.	96	9
201509	787	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But I think this has been very productive.	96	9
201509	788	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard, did you want to add something?	96	9
201509	789	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair, how do you want to proceed on this?	96	9
201509	790	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Because, it seems to me, this would be a change in the normalization principles or a change in what we said.	96	9
201509	791	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I will stick with what’s in the normalization—	96	9
201509	792	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	For today.	96	9
201509	793	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I mean, moving forward, is there going to be some future discussion of normalization principles?	96	9
201509	794	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I assume we’ll need to consider what came out of the discussion today and return to you with further proposals or options.	96	9
201509	795	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	And what would be the goal with regard to when we would want to aim to be able to tell market participants what we have in mind?	96	9
201509	796	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, we certainly know the Chair would be asked after liftoff about reinvestments.	96	9
201509	797	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So the more definitive we could be at that moment the better.	96	9
201509	798	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a goal.	96	9
201509	799	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	96	9
201509	800	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And that was the purpose of today’s discussion.	96	9
201509	801	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Arguably, we have to do this soon.	96	9
201509	802	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think that’s a goal.	96	9
201509	803	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	It’s a goal.	96	9
201509	804	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We could always say, “We don’t have anything new for you now.	96	9
201509	805	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	It’s a matter that we continue to discuss, and we’ll let you know further details when we make decisions.”	96	9
201509	806	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We don’t have to provide the information, but I agree it would be desirable to be able to do so.	96	9
201509	807	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But we need to think through what the way forward is after today’s discussion.	96	9
201509	808	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	96	9
201509	809	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201509	810	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go to the staff briefings on the economic outlook.	11	1
201509	811	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll begin with David Wilcox.	11	1
201509	812	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201509	813	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “Material for the US Outlook.”	11	1
201509	814	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The news since the July Tealbook torqued our assessment of the two legs of your policy mandate in different directions.	11	1
201509	815	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	On the real-activity side, we now see the economy as having been operating, and likely to continue to operate, at a higher level of resource utilization than we thought at the time of your July meeting.	11	1
201509	816	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	This reassessment combines four main categories of information.	11	1
201509	817	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	First, as you can see in panel 1 of your forecast summary exhibit, real GDP growth now appears to have been considerably stronger during the first half of this year than we thought at the time of your July meeting.	11	1
201509	818	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Second, the most recent indicators, including yesterday’s encouraging report on retail sales, suggest that some of that greater momentum has carried over into the second half of this year.	11	1
201509	819	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, taking on board the stronger retail sales news, which is not reflected in your exhibit, we’ve marked up our forecast for current- quarter GDP growth about ½ percentage point relative to the July Tealbook and now have it at about 2¼ percent.	11	1
201509	820	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Third, we interpreted the two labor market reports that were issued during the intermeeting period to be a little stronger than we had expected.	11	1
201509	821	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The August unemployment rate, at 5.1 percent, was 0.2 percentage point lower than we had expected.	11	1
201509	822	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The average monthly gain in payroll employment over the past three months is currently reported to have been 220,000, essentially the same as our July Tealbook forecast; however, in line with the average experience in recent years, we expect the first estimate of job gains in August to be revised up about 60,000.	11	1
201509	823	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Fourth, we have also, of course, noted the more-restrictive turn in some of the key variables that shape our outlook, including the decline in equity prices, the higher path for the exchange value of the dollar, and the less-robust outlook for foreign economic activity, and we have tempered our GDP growth outlook in light of these changes.	11	1
201509	824	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	All told, as Missaka showed in his pre-FOMC briefing yesterday, the adjustments we made in response to these four sources of information result in an output gap that is about ¾ percentage point tighter than before in the second quarter of this year, and we have essentially carried that greater tightness into our projection through the next two years.	11	1
201509	825	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	By 2018, a faster pace of monetary normalization begins to gain some traction and the delta in the GDP gap begins to narrow.	11	1
201509	826	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As a check on our judgmental thinking, panel 3 compares our judgmental estimate of the output gap with a couple of purely model-based estimates that I have shown the Committee before.	11	1
201509	827	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The dotted blue line shows our Tealbook estimate of the output gap.	11	1
201509	828	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The red line shows the production-function variant of the output gap from the EDO model, which is one of our DSGE models.	11	1
201509	829	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The black line shows the estimate that comes out of a state-space model embedded in the FRB/US model.	11	1
201509	830	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	This FRB/US estimate is developed by pooling a range of real-side indicators including GDP, GDI, and the unemployment rate.	11	1
201509	831	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The model also includes a New Keynesian Phillips curve with anchored expectations, in an effort to sharpen the model’s inference of the natural rate of unemployment and the level of potential GDP.	11	1
201509	832	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	These three estimates—our judgmental assessment and the two model-based estimates—are unanimous in taking the view that resource utilization has just about returned to its maximum sustainable position.	11	1
201509	833	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	However, before anyone takes too much comfort from the unanimity among these three estimates, I would note that other models in use around the System give markedly different answers.	11	1
201509	834	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s PRISM model shows a GDP gap in the second quarter of nearly 7 percent, and one of the models maintained at New York shows a gap of a little more than 2 percent.	11	1
201509	835	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Also, even the confidence interval that I’m showing here around the FRB/US estimate extends about 2 percentage points in either direction, and that confidence interval surely understates our ignorance because it sets aside both parameter uncertainty and model uncertainty.	11	1
201509	836	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	One important judgmental adjustment in the Tealbook forecast this time around pertained to the unemployment rate.	11	1
201509	837	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	If we had maintained the supply-side assumptions that were embedded in our July forecast and put through our normal translation of the adverse changes in the key environmental variables that I mentioned earlier, we would have shown an unemployment rate that was flat or even rising a touch from its current level.	11	1
201509	838	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Considering the ongoing pace of improvement in labor market conditions, that did not seem the most plausible baseline forecast.	11	1
201509	839	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	To accommodate some further reduction in the unemployment rate, we needed to widen the differential between actual GDP growth and potential GDP growth.	11	1
201509	840	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	In the context of our Okun’s law framework, it didn’t matter much how that wider differential was achieved, but because we were already at the very low end of the spectrum of outside analysts in terms of our forecast for GDP growth, we split the difference and shaved one-tenth or so from our forecast of potential GDP growth in the period ahead and added one-tenth or so to our forecast of actual GDP growth.	11	1
201509	841	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Even with this judgmental add factor, our GDP forecast remains near the pessimistic end of the range of outside forecasters.	11	1
201509	842	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Let me now turn to the inflation leg of your mandate.	11	1
201509	843	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Our forecast here is summarized in panels 4 and 5 of your exhibit.	11	1
201509	844	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 4, we now expect total PCE inflation to turn slightly negative in the fourth quarter on a quarterly-average basis, reflecting a steeper decline in consumer energy prices that in turn results from the lower projected path for crude oil prices.	11	1
201509	845	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	We have also edged down our near-term projection of core inflation—panel 5—in response to slightly weaker-than-expected incoming data and a downward revision to our forecast for imported goods prices.	11	1
201509	846	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Over the remainder of the medium term, our projections of both total and core inflation are essentially the same as in July.	11	1
201509	847	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	This morning’s CPI release, which is summarized in a separate exhibit titled “Material for Consumer Price Index Update,” had no material implications relative to our Tealbook expectations.	11	1
201509	848	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Although the core CPI inflation rate was several basis points softer than we had expected, that had little implication for our assessment of PCE inflation, partly because some of the surprise was in airfares and medical care prices, neither of which feed into the PCE price index, and partly because the small downward surprise in housing prices receives a smaller weight in the PCE index than it does in the CPI.	11	1
201509	849	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The increase in financial market volatility during the intermeeting period affected the baseline through channels that have been standard in macro models for decades— mainly, lower stock prices feeding into a wealth effect, higher private borrowing rates, and a stronger dollar.	11	1
201509	850	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	But if we learned anything from the financial crisis, it has to be that disturbances originating in the financial sector can have serious implications for the real economy reaching far beyond these standard channels.	11	1
201509	851	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Marco Del Negro and Marc Giannoni at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have been working with one of the more interesting recent models that aims to allow a more meaningful role for financial disturbances to affect real outcomes.	11	1
201509	852	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	To shed light on the potential implications of a more serious and protracted version of the turbulence that surfaced last month, they were kind enough to generate one of the alternative simulations that we presented in the Tealbook.	11	1
201509	853	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	In their model, the Baa bond spread proxies for financial turbulence and has strong predictive power for real outcomes during periods of financial distress.	11	1
201509	854	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Since the beginning of this year, the Baa spread has increased about 75 basis points.	11	1
201509	855	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	In the alternative scenario, we assume that it goes up in the fourth quarter by a further 200 basis points relative to baseline and then gradually returns to a more normal level.	11	1
201509	856	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Real GDP contracts sharply almost immediately, and as you can see in panel 6, the unemployment rate— the blue dashed line—rises as much as ¾ percentage point above its baseline trajectory, the black line.	11	1
201509	857	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As severe as these results are, they could have been worse.	11	1
201509	858	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The funds rate in the alternative scenario runs about 100 basis points below baseline, a policy response that prevents the fallout from being even more serious.	11	1
201509	859	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	This simulation helped inform our assessment that the risks to our forecast for real GDP are weighted to the downside and, especially in light of the adjustments we made to the baseline, that the risks to our unemployment projection are now weighted to the upside.	11	1
201509	860	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, I have updated the “Lockhart dashboard” that I first showed you in July.	11	1
201509	861	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	This exhibit, which is the last page in your packet, summarizes a few of the key pieces of information that will be available to you at the next couple of FOMC meetings.	11	1
201509	862	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Specifically, the data that will first be available at the October meeting are in the gold-shaded region, and the additional observations that will become available in time for the December meeting are shaded in red.	11	1
201509	863	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	(The data that are newly available for today’s meeting are shaded in blue.) September Tealbook projections regarding these variables are shown in regular font, while our forecasts from the July Tealbook are shown in italics.	11	1
201509	864	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	A new memo item at the bottom of the exhibit gives the revisions to equity prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since July, as those were two of the key drivers of the revision to our assessment of the outlook.	11	1
201509	865	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As in July, we expect that inflation will continue to run at a low level through the end of this year.	11	1
201509	866	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	At the time of your December meeting, the latest reading on PCE prices that you will have in hand will be the one for October.	11	1
201509	867	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	We now forecast that topline prices over the three months ending in October will decline at an annual rate of nearly ¾ percent.	11	1
201509	868	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Over the 12 months ending in October—the next pair of lines down—we expect that topline prices will have been unchanged.	11	1
201509	869	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Core inflation is expected to run below 1½ percent through this period, whether measured on a 3-month or 12-month basis.	11	1
201509	870	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As for the labor market, we have revised down our forecast for the unemployment rate and now expect that you will have a 5 percent print in hand at the time of the December meeting.	11	1
201509	871	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	We also expect to see continued solid payroll job gains.	11	1
201509	872	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The much bigger jobs number that shows up in the September column in this display incorporates both the gain of 210,000 that we expect to be reported for September itself, as well as the upward revision that we expect to be applied to the August number.	11	1
201509	873	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	As I mentioned earlier, we have nudged up our forecast of third-quarter real GDP growth from the 1.9 percent figure shown in the exhibit to around 2¼ percent.	11	1
201509	874	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Steve Kamin will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201509	875	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, David.	11	1
201509	876	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the material titled “The International Outlook.”	11	1
201509	877	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Since your previous meeting, developments in China triggered fears of a global economic slowdown and led to widespread turbulence in markets.	11	1
201509	878	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Turning points in the global business cycle are notoriously difficult to forecast, and though we have seen a few in recent decades, we have not predicted any of them.	11	1
201509	879	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Bearing that in mind, even after a very rocky month and a half, we are still projecting a strengthening of foreign growth over the next few quarters.	11	1
201509	880	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	However, as indicated in panel 1 of your first exhibit, based on data that came in over the past month and a half, we now estimate that aggregate foreign GDP growth, which was already quite weak in the first quarter, dropped further, to only 1 percent in the second, the slowest pace since 2009.	11	1
201509	881	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Furthermore, weak incoming data for the third quarter, along with the turbulence in global financial and commodity markets, led us to write down a notably lower path going forward.	11	1
201509	882	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Finally, although we believe the financial market responses to events in China were probably overblown, we agree that downside risks have increased to a material degree.	11	1
201509	883	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The developments in China that Simon reviewed earlier have raised two inter- related concerns with investors.	11	1
201509	884	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The first is that China’s economy is not only slowing from the double-digit growth rates of earlier years, but may be falling into something akin to an actual recession.	11	1
201509	885	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the solid red line in panel 2, we do see Chinese growth coming down from its transitory surge in the second quarter, but we are looking for growth to flatten out at around 6 percent, not fall precipitously further.	11	1
201509	886	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Still-strong retail sales suggest that the Chinese economy retains sources of strength, and signs of recovery in the property market are somewhat encouraging.	11	1
201509	887	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Nevertheless, weak incoming data, concerns over the management of economic policy, and our sense that the authorities now face a more difficult task rebalancing the economy in the context of financial vulnerabilities have led us to revise down our forecast from the July Tealbook, the red dashed line.	11	1
201509	888	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	All that said, we are unconvinced by arguments that actual Chinese growth has fallen well below the pace indicated by the official GDP statistics.	11	1
201509	889	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The blue line in panel 2 shows the results of our nowcasting model, which uses data on industrial production, imports, and retail sales to estimate contemporaneous GDP growth.	11	1
201509	890	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Smoothing through the wiggles, the nowcasting model has continued to track the trend in the official GDP statistics reasonably well this year—again suggesting that growth has declined but not collapsed.	11	1
201509	891	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Besides prospects of a Chinese recession, a second and highly related concern for investors has been that August’s 3 percent devaluation of the RMB would be followed up by substantial further depreciation.	11	1
201509	892	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly, the prospect of the world’s second-largest economy allowing its currency to drop precipitously at a time of fragile global demand would be cause for worry.	11	1
201509	893	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	But barring extreme circumstances, a very large further depreciation of the RMB seems unlikely.	11	1
201509	894	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	At present, China’s authorities appear to be walking a tightrope between their longer-term strategy of increasing the role of market forces in determining the exchange rate and avoiding large, abrupt movements that could destabilize financial markets.	11	1
201509	895	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 3, our sense is that, in response to further capital outflows engendered by ongoing concerns about either the economy or future exchange-market policy, the authorities will allow the RMB to slide another couple of percent against the dollar.	11	1
201509	896	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Somewhat further down the road, assuming growth stabilizes and worries of a hard landing subside, we anticipate upward pressures on the renminbi will resume.	11	1
201509	897	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon has described, the recent developments in China led to especially sharp downdrafts in global markets because many economies, especially in emerging markets, were already struggling with disappointing growth, pronounced vulnerabilities, and anticipations of monetary policy tightening in the United States.	11	1
201509	898	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	These market downdrafts, in turn, will likely put additional pressures on global growth over the near term.	11	1
201509	899	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 4, oil prices took another sharp notch down during the intermeeting period.	11	1
201509	900	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Although most of the declines in oil prices since mid-2014 appear attributable to increased oil supplies, the downturn in August appears to owe mainly to concerns about slowing in China—which accounts for 11 percent of global oil demand—and its knock-on effects on other economies.	11	1
201509	901	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, we continue to view declines in oil prices as an eventual plus for the global economy.	11	1
201509	902	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	But our econometric analysis, as well as recent experience, suggests that, in the near term, lower oil prices can be a drag on global growth, as their decline may restrain spending in oil exporters more than it boosts spending in oil importers.	11	1
201509	903	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Besides declines in oil prices, various other market movements have affected the outlook, including widespread declines in equity prices, increases in credit spreads, and, as shown in panel 5, a further appreciation of the dollar.	11	1
201509	904	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The modest devaluation of the RMB by itself added only about ½ percent to the dollar’s value, but sympathetic depreciations of other Asian currencies, hits to so-called commodity currencies, and general gloom about EME prospects, taken together, led the dollar to appreciate about 2 percent in total.	11	1
201509	905	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	We see the dollar rising a little higher during the rest of the year, reflecting our projection of some further depreciation of the RMB as well as the assumed tightening of Federal Reserve policy, before the dollar flattens out and eventually gives back some of its gains.	11	1
201509	906	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 6, the higher path of the dollar implies that net exports are a source of a bit more drag on the economy than they were in the July Tealbook.	11	1
201509	907	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	In light of developments in China and other emerging markets, the downside risks to the global outlook appear to have increased.	11	1
201509	908	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Your next exhibit presents three inter- related scenarios to examine the effects of a crisis in China that lowers Chinese GDP 7 percent below its baseline path and leads to a 10 percent devaluation of the renminbi against the dollar.	11	1
201509	909	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The first scenario, which is represented by the green lines in panels 2 through 5, illustrates the direct effect of such a crisis on the US economy, excluding any indirect effect that a China crisis might exert via spillovers to China’s trading partners.	11	1
201509	910	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Turning to panel 3, because China is not a dominant destination for US exports, the direct effects of this shock—again, the green line— lower US GDP only a little below its baseline path—the black line.	11	1
201509	911	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Similarly, headline inflation (panel 4) and the federal funds rate (panel 5) are only slightly restrained.	11	1
201509	912	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	All told, this scenario illustrates that a hard landing in China will lead to significant damage to the US economy only to the extent that it induces broader economic and financial disruptions around the world.	11	1
201509	913	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The second scenario is labeled “EME slowdown.”	11	1
201509	914	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	In this scenario, turning to the blue line in panel 2, we assume that the China crisis described in the first scenario spills over to other EMEs to an extent consistent with past historical correlations, so that aggregate EME GDP growth falls to zero.	11	1
201509	915	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	However, we assume no financial spillovers to advanced economies, and effects on US growth, inflation, and interest rates, while quite noticeable, are hardly eye-popping.	11	1
201509	916	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	To get eye-popping, our third scenario—represented by the red lines in the panels—embeds the assumption that the recession in China generates much sharper disruptions in other EMEs, along the lines of the distress associated with the Asian and Russian crises of the late 1990s.	11	1
201509	917	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Aggregate EME GDP growth (panel 2) falls below zero and EME currencies decline more than 20 percent against the dollar.	11	1
201509	918	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	We also assume that the turbulence in emerging markets spills over to financial markets in the United States and other advanced economies, triggering sharp declines in equity prices and a widening of credit spreads.	11	1
201509	919	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	The US economy falls into recession and deflation, and the federal funds rate falls back to the zero lower bound.	11	1
201509	920	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	But taking into account the assumptions required to achieve this result, we view the likelihood of this risk materializing as fairly remote.	11	1
201509	921	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	If I could make one final point without sounding like a complete worrywart, I would note that although the global financial turbulence of the past month was triggered by developments in China, anticipation of FOMC liftoff may have played some role in making markets a little more skittish and thus more responsive to Chinese events than they otherwise might have been.	11	1
201509	922	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	Our anticipation is that when you decide to start tightening, volatility in emerging markets will likely remain contained, but scenarios 2 and 3 in this exhibit provide some sense of the tail-risks involved should investor concerns about EME vulnerabilities and the global outlook lead markets to react much more strongly to US monetary tightening that we currently expect.	11	1
201509	923	2015-09-17	meeting	KAMIN	That concludes my remarks, and I’ll pass it on to Francisco.	11	1
201509	924	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Thank you, Steve.	11	1
201509	925	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11	1
201509	926	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11	1
201509	927	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Almost all of you project that real GDP growth this year will be at or very slightly above your assessments of its longer-run pace.	11	1
201509	928	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	And almost all of you see real GDP growth picking up somewhat in 2016 before slowing toward its longer-run rate in 2017 and 2018.	11	1
201509	929	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the top panel, the medians of your projections of real GDP growth this year and during the next two years are a bit above the 2 percent median of your projections of longer- run growth, but a bit below the 2½ percent growth rate recorded in 2013 and 2014.	11	1
201509	930	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Most of you project that the unemployment rate, shown in the second panel, will decline further this year and be at or below your estimate of its longer-run normal rate from 2016 through 2018.	11	1
201509	931	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the third panel, the median of your projections of headline PCE inflation is 0.4 percent this year but climbs to 1.7 percent in 2016 and rises further in 2017.	11	1
201509	932	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Almost all of you project total PCE inflation to be within 1/10 of a percentage point of the Committee’s goal in 2018.	11	1
201509	933	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The final panel indicates that most of you project core PCE inflation near 1.4 percent this year, about the same as in 2014, before increasing gradually over the remainder of the forecast period.	11	1
201509	934	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the June Summary of Economic Projections and with the September Tealbook.	11	1
201509	935	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As indicated in the top panel, the median of your forecasts of real GDP growth in 2015 has risen since June.	11	1
201509	936	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Most of you noted that stronger-than-expected growth in the first half of this year more than offsets a weaker projection for the second half.	11	1
201509	937	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	In contrast, the median values of your projections of real GDP growth for 2016 and 2017 are lower than in June, with several of you attributing the decline in your forecasts to slower projected productivity growth.	11	1
201509	938	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projected paths for the unemployment rate shifted down roughly 0.3 percentage point throughout the forecast period, with some of you attributing a downward revision in your projections to the greater-than-expected decline in the unemployment rate in recent months.	11	1
201509	939	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	All but a few of you also lowered your projections for the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, bringing the median down to 4.9 percent.	11	1
201509	940	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As the third panel indicates, the median of your projections regarding headline PCE inflation was marked down this year, reflecting an appreciation of the dollar and further declines in oil and commodity prices.	11	1
201509	941	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The median of your forecasts for core PCE inflation was also marked down slightly in 2016 and 2017.	11	1
201509	942	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The Tealbook forecasts for both economic growth and inflation are slightly below the medians of your projections for the next three years, while the staff’s forecast for the unemployment rate is roughly in line with the median of your projections.	11	1
201509	943	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the quarter in which you currently judge that the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate and of the economic conditions you anticipate at that time.	11	1
201509	944	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the top panel, many of you currently view the fourth quarter of 2015 as the most likely time of liftoff.	11	1
201509	945	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Since June, six of you pushed your prescribed date of departure from the effective lower bound from the third to the fourth quarter of this year.	11	1
201509	946	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Four of you now judge that it will not be appropriate to raise rates this year, while only two of you held that view in June.	11	1
201509	947	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown by the bottom-left panel, most of you see policy normalization beginning when the unemployment rate is 5 percent or 5.1 percent.	11	1
201509	948	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Most of you project that the unemployment rate at the appropriate time of liftoff will still be above its longer-run normal level.	11	1
201509	949	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Your projections of core inflation at the time of liftoff are more dispersed, with all but one between 1.2 and 1.5 percent.	11	1
201509	950	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Exhibit 4 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate at the end of each year of the forecast period and over the longer run.	11	1
201509	951	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The medians of your funds rate projections now stand at 0.4 percent at the end of 2015, 1.4 percent at the end of 2016, 2.6 percent at the end of 2017, and 3.4 percent at the end of 2018.	11	1
201509	952	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	A sizable majority of you revised down your projections of the appropriate federal funds rate throughout the forecast period, and several of you cited downward revisions to the inflation outlook and to your estimate of the equilibrium real interest rate as reasons for doing so.	11	1
201509	953	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The median of your projections declined 25 basis points in 2015 through 2017.	11	1
201509	954	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Eleven of you also revised down your projection of the longer-run nominal federal funds rate, typically by 25 basis points.	11	1
201509	955	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	A majority of you project that, at the end of 2018, the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be close to, albeit still below, your individual judgment of its longer-run level.	11	1
201509	956	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As in June, almost all of you project levels of the federal funds rate over the next couple of years that are below the prescriptions of a non-inertial Taylor 1999 rule given your projections of core inflation, unemployment gap, and longer-run nominal federal funds rate, indicating that you do not see the Taylor rule as likely to prescribe appropriate policy for the next few years.	11	1
201509	957	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The medians of these Taylor rule prescriptions, plotted as red diamonds, have shifted up in 2015 and 2016 since June, primarily reflecting the rule’s response to the downward revision in your unemployment rate projections, but have edged down in 2017.	11	1
201509	958	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	For 2015 through 2017, the gap between your projections and the rule’s prescriptions, given your individual forecasts of unemployment and inflation, has widened since June, on average.	11	1
201509	959	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	For 2018, the discrepancy between your federal fund rate projections and Taylor-rule-implied rates narrows considerably as most of you project that the dual mandate can be achieved with the federal funds rate being close to its longer-term normal level.	11	1
201509	960	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The final exhibit shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11	1
201509	961	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the figures to the left, your views regarding uncertainty have not changed in a material way.	11	1
201509	962	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Most of you continue to judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections of GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average level over the past 20 years.	11	1
201509	963	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As shown in the panels to the right, most of you continue to see the risks to real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, though seven of you now view risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside—three more than in June—and four more of you now see the risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.	11	1
201509	964	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	The downside risks to GDP growth that you cited include a weaker outlook abroad and tighter financial conditions than currently embedded in your forecasts.	11	1
201509	965	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	As reported in the third and fourth panels on the right, nine of you now see risks to inflation as weighted to the downside—four more than in June.	11	1
201509	966	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Recent declines in market-based measures of inflation compensation and commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar were noted as factors that could place greater downward pressure on prices than currently embedded in your forecasts.	11	1
201509	967	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	Thank you.	11	1
201509	968	2015-09-17	meeting	COVAS	That concludes the presentation.	11	1
201509	969	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	11	1
201509	970	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions.	12	1
201509	971	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201509	972	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201509	973	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks for the briefing, as always.	12	1
201509	974	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I found the discussion of the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A quite informative, as usual.	12	1
201509	975	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was struck by how many of them seemed to me as downside alternatives, especially in terms of the price stability mandate.	12	1
201509	976	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the staff were asked to talk about scenarios that might give rise to an overrun in inflation, what would that potentially look like?	12	1
201509	977	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	We actually contemplated putting in one of those.	12	1
201509	978	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The one that I think is plausible for us is that there’s some drift that occurs in inflation expectations.	12	1
201509	979	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	We debated whether the more plausible direction of drift in inflation expectations is up or down.	12	1
201509	980	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	But I do think that an upward drift of inflation expectations is certainly within our confidence intervals.	12	1
201509	981	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	At the moment, the more natural mechanism, it seems to me, is that the little bit of extra transitory restraint that’s in the inflation pipeline from the dollar and the oil prices is going to put a little more gravitational pull downward on inflation.	12	1
201509	982	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	And so my own assessment is that while I see inflation expectations drift in either direction as quite plausible, I think it’s a little more likely downward.	12	1
201509	983	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	But if I were to put my finger on one scenario that could provide for some upward lift on inflation, I’d point to that one, importantly out of our collective professional ignorance about the basic mechanisms that form inflation expectations.	12	1
201509	984	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201509	985	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201509	986	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201509	987	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	David, let me pick up where you left off there, and thanks for panel 3 on output gap estimates, which makes my question a little more relevant because you mentioned the FRB/US model.	12	1
201509	988	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	When I was looking through Tealbook A, on page 79, I came across alternative models and the FRB/US model.	12	1
201509	989	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I noticed that the core PCE projection coming out of the FRB/US model has 2017 inflation moving down to 1.0 percent, whereas in the June Tealbook it’s at 1.5 percent.	12	1
201509	990	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I wonder what features of the data and the model are generating that somewhat aberrant behavior.	12	1
201509	991	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The FRB/US model has a different wage-price mechanism than the judgmental forecast does.	12	1
201509	992	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The model pays attention to compensation trends.	12	1
201509	993	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	There’s an equation for price markup over marginal cost in the FRB/US model.	12	1
201509	994	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	I’m going to look here for confirmation from my former FRB/US colleague.	12	1
201509	995	2015-09-17	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	That’s correct.	12	1
201509	996	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think we provide you with a graph of the markup of price over marginal cost in your Tealbook materials, but in putting together our inflation projection, the staff has pretty much written that relationship off as noninformative.	12	1
201509	997	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The FRB/US model, partly for a bit of intellectual diversity, hasn’t chucked that specification overboard and views the high level of prices over marginal costs as posing a downside impetus on inflation.	12	1
201509	998	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	And so that’s mainly what’s generating this difference.	12	1
201509	999	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	So the forecast was already pretty low in the June Tealbook at 1½ percent for 2017, but the differential data coming in seem to have moved it downward.	12	1
201509	1000	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12	1
201509	1001	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	My guess is that two things are going on there.	12	1
201509	1002	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	One—probably the more material of the two—is the recent tranche of disappointing compensation news that we got.	12	1
201509	1003	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	The other—which I suspect is quantitatively tiny, but might be there in principle—is that there was a tiny upward revision in nonmarket prices in the annual revision.	12	1
201509	1004	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	So the FRB/US model might be picking up on that, but I’m guessing that the larger of those two is the compensation.	12	1
201509	1005	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Just to close this out, is it fair to say that this implementation of the FRB/US model is putting less weight on the longer-term inflation expectations anchor than other analyses that we normally are looking at or the preferred inflation model that you’re using?	12	1
201509	1006	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	I think so.	12	1
201509	1007	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	There’s an inflation objective for policymakers in the FRB/US model, and that has complete credibility.	12	1
201509	1008	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	So households and businesses don’t question the 2 percent objective.	12	1
201509	1009	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m sorry.	12	1
201509	1010	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Let me clarify.	12	1
201509	1011	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Yes, it has that feature in there, but that’s not enough to pull up the inflation forecast given the other countervailing data developments.	12	1
201509	1012	2015-09-17	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, that’s evident in the projection that you’re pointing to.	12	1
201509	1013	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Yes, okay.	12	1
201509	1014	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201509	1015	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12	1
201509	1016	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	2	2
201509	1017	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	An unusually quiet crowd today.	2	2
201509	1018	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201509	1019	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I suggest we take a coffee break, maybe until 3:45—20 minutes.	2	2
201509	1020	2015-09-17	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201509	1021	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s return to it and get started.	2	2
201509	1022	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start our go-round with President Rosengren.	13	1
201509	1023	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1024	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since our previous meeting, we have seen further improvement in labor markets, although the recent data on wages and prices are consistent with the continued persistent undershooting of our 2 percent inflation goal.	13	1
201509	1025	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Earlier evidence of accelerating compensation in both average hourly earnings and the employment cost index has been revised away, resulting in almost all wage measures continuing to rise at a surprisingly steady 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1026	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because both aggregated and disaggregated data on wages and prices continue to come in quite low, my own forecast does not expect us to reach our inflation target within two years.	13	1
201509	1027	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is qualitatively consistent with the staff forecast of inflation in the Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1028	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because wages and prices have not responded to much-improved labor market conditions in aggregate or, really, even in the disaggregated data, I have lowered my estimate of the longer- run unemployment rate to 4.8 percent.	13	1
201509	1029	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition to the evidence from wages and prices, this estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate is consistent with the rising share of the workforce that is more highly educated and older, demographic groups that historically have had lower unemployment rates.	13	1
201509	1030	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the most pertinent data for this meeting are probably not the government data releases on wages, prices, and real activity, but rather the financial data that have been unusually turbulent since August 24.	13	1
201509	1031	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Stock markets in many parts of the world are down 5 to 10 percent, with some emerging markets down appreciably more in dollar terms.	13	1
201509	1032	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, volatility has risen significantly not only because of the sharp stock price declines, but also because of rising interday and daily volatility.	13	1
201509	1033	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	During periods of significant financial turbulence the FOMC has tended to follow easier policy, a point that will be made in a Boston Fed paper to be presented at our October conference on financial stability.	13	1
201509	1034	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	After Black Monday in October 1987, the FOMC had daily calls through the end of that month to monitor financial and economic conditions and lowered interest rates.	13	1
201509	1035	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Recent stock price movements have been much more modest.	13	1
201509	1036	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	On Black Monday, the stock market fell 22 percent, whereas on August 24, the Dow opened with a decline of over 1,000 points, or about 6 percent, but ended the day down a bit over 3½ percent.	13	1
201509	1037	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nonetheless, the stock price declines did receive significant attention.	13	1
201509	1038	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is certainly possible that some of the eye-catching declines have more to do with problems related to financial market structure rather than a change in the economic outlook.	13	1
201509	1039	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	On August 24, with the Shanghai index down a little over 8 percent, the New York Stock Exchange imposed Rule 48, which allows market makers to not post prices prior to opening.	13	1
201509	1040	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Along with a 1,000 point drop at the opening, a large number of individual stocks, ETFs, and other exchange- traded securities hit circuit breakers, with trading halted over 1,200 times across 466 securities, with 300 of the securities being ETFs.	13	1
201509	1041	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, the prices of a surprising number of large ETFs declined dramatically, with 188 declining in excess of 30 percent.	13	1
201509	1042	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Some ETFs declined by more than 50 percent.	13	1
201509	1043	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some instances, two ETFs with similar strategies experienced materially different interday price movements.	13	1
201509	1044	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Further, the affected securities spanned different sectors and sizes—that is, they were not singularly focused.	13	1
201509	1045	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	This, again, speaks to potential fragilities in the financial market structure.	13	1
201509	1046	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s quite possible that Rule 48 and circuit breakers in individual stocks complicated normal ETF arbitrage, leading to unusually large temporary declines.	13	1
201509	1047	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Ironically, the circuit breakers were implemented in response to May 2010’s flash crash in which the Dow experienced an interday decline of over 1,000 points.	13	1
201509	1048	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In a manner similar to August 24’s events, many stocks and ETFs experienced sharp price declines that reversed within a short period.	13	1
201509	1049	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If problems with market mechanics explain much of the recent volatility in financial markets, we have some significant financial stability analysis that needs to be done to better understand both the role of market mechanics and, possibly, regulatory policy solutions.	13	1
201509	1050	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	But, for now, the appropriate response to this financial upheaval is to reflect the realized loss of wealth and exchange rate movements in our model equations and assume the additional economic information content is modest.	13	1
201509	1051	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, there is some risk in doing so, as it is not yet clear how persistent asset price movements will be and, generally speaking, households and firms tend to respond to such price movements only when they persist for some time.	13	1
201509	1052	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In any event, this is roughly how we folded the events into our own baseline forecast.	13	1
201509	1053	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, there is a darker potential story.	13	1
201509	1054	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our models do a poor job of integrating financial market information, something that David mentioned and something we were all too aware of in 2008.	13	1
201509	1055	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is possible that financial markets are reflecting weaker global growth or other more-fundamental problems that we do not fully understand.	13	1
201509	1056	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In this case, my modal forecast is too optimistic, and the downside risk should be significantly elevated.	13	1
201509	1057	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Unfortunately, I do not think we have enough time to fully process recent market turbulence.	13	1
201509	1058	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	We certainly do not want to begin our first tightening amid a global slowdown.	13	1
201509	1059	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can also imagine the difficulty of keeping the reverse repo facility small during a period of very elevated market turbulence, as many might flock to this convenient source of safe short-term financing during a time of financial tumult.	13	1
201509	1060	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although my baseline forecast involves the assumption of relatively modest effects from the recent financial turbulence, with magnitudes similar to those of the Tealbook, I think it would be wise to wait for more data that can validate the assumption of modest disruption before taking action based on that assumption.	13	1
201509	1061	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will discuss this in more detail tomorrow.	13	1
201509	1062	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1063	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1064	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201509	1065	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1066	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	My remarks today will be centered on what has changed and not changed with respect to the national economic outlook since our previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1067	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that the general contours of the national outlook have not changed very much during the intermeeting period, and that we are on the precipice of making a decision that will demonstrate excessive sensitivity of the Committee to short-term movements in financial markets, especially equity markets.	13	1
201509	1068	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Historically, the Committee has not wanted to react directly to equity price movements, as they are far too unpredictable over short periods and are as likely as not to reverse themselves over the medium term.	13	1
201509	1069	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee is changing its view on this issue, we should say so as forthrightly as possible and inform private-sector players about how we plan to proceed when future movements in equity market prices present themselves, either up or down, in future meetings of this Committee.	13	1
201509	1070	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	One way to get a handle on the intermeeting financial market turmoil is to consider so- called financial conditions indexes or the closely related financial stress indexes.	13	1
201509	1071	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	A 2012 Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Review article by Kevin Kliesen, Michael Owyang, and Katarina Vermann documents the similarities and differences between a wide variety of such indexes.	13	1
201509	1072	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, we have a favorite, which is the St Louis Fed financial stress index, and it has indeed risen sharply over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1073	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Still, the level of the index remains well below the levels reached during the height of the European sovereign debt crisis in 2011 and 2012, not to mention far below the levels reached in 2008 and 2009.	13	1
201509	1074	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, the index was arguably abnormally low during recent quarters and years, with volatility at low ebb and some interest rate spreads unusually compressed.	13	1
201509	1075	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	From this point of view, one might welcome at least some of the return to a more normal market operation.	13	1
201509	1076	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In short, the increase in the St Louis Fed’s financial stress index, or other related indexes, is not enough to cause me to make sufficient revisions to my forecast that would alter my path for monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1077	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that many may be worried about a weaker growth outlook globally than would have been projected at the previous FOMC meeting, but my view is that many of the weak spots globally were clearly flagged during June and July, and that marginally weaker growth prospects globally are unlikely to have a meaningful effect on US growth prospects.	13	1
201509	1078	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we have continued to project in St Louis above-trend growth for the second half of 2015 and, indeed, over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201509	1079	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	We think our growth call for the remainder of 2015 is close to the September 10 Blue Chip forecast, which itself is notably above the Board staff view.	13	1
201509	1080	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Although it is always good to be cautious, we think, on the basis of the data available today, that the staff view is overly pessimistic concerning near-term growth.	13	1
201509	1081	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, the Committee has now received information on the revisions to first-half real GDP growth, which now appears to have been above trend, adding to the picture of an economy that continues to push forward even in the face of a large dollar appreciation over the past year or more.	13	1
201509	1082	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Above-trend growth is likely to continue to mean even tighter labor markets.	13	1
201509	1083	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Jobs reports since the previous meeting have generally been very good.	13	1
201509	1084	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	And, if recent history is a guide, I would expect more upward revisions to currently reported jobs numbers as we go forward.	13	1
201509	1085	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The staff noted this as well.	13	1
201509	1086	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment insurance claims per person in the labor force is at a multidecade low.	13	1
201509	1087	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Job openings per unemployed worker is exceptionally high, and the unemployment rate itself fell to 5.1 percent in the latest reading, matching what the staff projected at the previous meeting would only happen two and a half years from now, at the end of 2017.	13	1
201509	1088	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciate that the staff has now added some downward tilt to its unemployment projections, which have consistently been too pessimistic over the past several years.	13	1
201509	1089	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Still, it is probably not enough, as the unemployment rate is likely to fall below 4½ percent over the forecast horizon with above-trend growth and no major negative shocks.	13	1
201509	1090	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think these outcomes are already in train, as the Committee has already committed to a very easy monetary policy during this coming phase of the business cycle.	13	1
201509	1091	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	There has, of course, been considerable talk about Chinese growth prospects during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1092	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	My assessment is as follows.	13	1
201509	1093	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Shanghai composite index is not a meaningful indicator of US growth prospects and probably not of China’s growth prospects either.	13	1
201509	1094	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This index rose from around 2,000 in the first half of 2014 to 5,000 by June of 2015 before falling to around 3,000 during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1095	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This was a bubble that burst because of factors specific to China.	13	1
201509	1096	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I take the signal for the United States to be small or zero.	13	1
201509	1097	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, many have commented that China may be growing slower than the official numbers indicate.	13	1
201509	1098	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I have, in fact, flagged this comment from business contacts with significant operations in Chinese markets in past meetings, especially those in the energy and manufacturing sectors.	13	1
201509	1099	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I do think that growth may be somewhat slower than official data suggest, but I do not think this is news compared with what was known at our previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1100	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	It is an old issue.	13	1
201509	1101	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	And, in my view, there is scant evidence at this point that China is entering a true hard landing, and on this point I agree with the Board staff analysis.	13	1
201509	1102	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	That brings us to US equity prices, which are down approximately 7 percent during the intermeeting period as of the Tealbook publication.	13	1
201509	1103	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This is news, and, indeed, this is why I am concerned that our pending action will be viewed as a reaction to this development.	13	1
201509	1104	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	One thought that I alluded to earlier is that this may be a more appropriate valuation than previously.	13	1
201509	1105	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	We should think of an appropriate level of equity prices relative to potential GDP, and we should expect equity valuations—really, the value of the US corporate sector—to return to this appropriate level regardless of week-to-week volatility.	13	1
201509	1106	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	If that’s the view, then temporary movements in equity valuations would not have an effect on macroeconomic forecasts and, therefore, on monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1107	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	My final comments concern inflation, which is running low today but is likely to strengthen over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201509	1108	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	According to my board of directors, the firms represented there all expect wages to increase 3 percent this year, even firms that have workers that are on the lower end of the income distribution.	13	1
201509	1109	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I was surprised by that.	13	1
201509	1110	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Low oil prices are having a large effect on inflation, but this effect will dissipate going forward.	13	1
201509	1111	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In any event, low oil prices are ultimately a bullish factor for the US economy, not a negative factor.	13	1
201509	1112	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	TIPS-based expected inflation measures are low and have fallen during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1113	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I would normally be quite concerned about this, but these measures are unfortunately highly conflated with oil price movements and so are difficult to read in the current circumstances.	13	1
201509	1114	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Overall, I am very concerned that the Committee does not overreact to what are essentially financial market developments as opposed to real-side developments during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1115	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I see very tight labor markets ahead, barring a large shock.	13	1
201509	1116	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I also see risk of substantial financial-stability issues arising ahead, particularly if we are viewed as an enabler of asset price bubbles.	13	1
201509	1117	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1118	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1119	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201509	1120	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1121	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The Fifth District economy continued to expand in recent weeks, although our survey results softened a bit.	13	1
201509	1122	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Our manufacturing report was mixed.	13	1
201509	1123	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The composite index fell to 0 in August from a reading of positive 13.	13	1
201509	1124	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As we saw when it dipped earlier this year, the index is at odds with the generally upbeat assessment by our contacts, who indicated that activity remains moderately strong despite less-favorable exchange rates and softer growth in emerging market economies.	13	1
201509	1125	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, service-sector activity remained robust in recent weeks, according to both survey results and contact reports, especially on the retail side.	13	1
201509	1126	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The current retail revenues index rose to 44 in August from 35 in July and 15 in June, reaching the fourth-highest reading in the 22-year history of that series.	13	1
201509	1127	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The nonretail services index slipped a bit in August but, at 28, was still the third-highest reading in that series.	13	1
201509	1128	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Readings on expected activity remained strong across both services and manufacturing.	13	1
201509	1129	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary results for September are a tad softer than August—they won’t be released for a couple of weeks, but they tell the same basic story.	13	1
201509	1130	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Fifth District housing markets continue to strengthen despite supply constraints on the building side that were said to be holding back activity.	13	1
201509	1131	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Several builders report the construction of single-family homes would be higher if not for shortages of labor and lots.	13	1
201509	1132	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The time required to go from initiation to completion of a single-family home is said to have increased.	13	1
201509	1133	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	There are some reports of homebuyers accelerating purchases in anticipation of rising interest rates.	13	1
201509	1134	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Spec building is increasing at price points around $1 million, and we have heard several contacts use the term “bubble” in connection with the multifamily sector.	13	1
201509	1135	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	That said, vacancy rates remain low, and I am never quite sure what people mean by the word “bubble.”	13	1
201509	1136	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Contacts generally reported that commercial real estate and building activity were robust in many regions within our District.	13	1
201509	1137	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Some markets have seen a surge in hotel construction and the emergence of spec office construction.	13	1
201509	1138	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Reports of labor shortages and difficulty finding qualified workers continue to proliferate.	13	1
201509	1139	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Contacts say the number of unfilled job openings is rising, as is the time it takes to fill openings.	13	1
201509	1140	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Employers are converting temporary workers to permanent status more rapidly to avoid losing them, and they are making more initial hires on a permanent basis rather than a temporary one.	13	1
201509	1141	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Although labor scarcity is not universal across occupations, it appears to go well beyond IT and skilled trades.	13	1
201509	1142	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Many contacts cite shortages for lower-wage jobs, such as those in the hospitality and retail sectors.	13	1
201509	1143	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I continue to hear widespread reports of wage pressures in the Fifth District.	13	1
201509	1144	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I recognize that the second-quarter ECI number appears to have thrown cold water on the notion of nominal wage acceleration in the national data.	13	1
201509	1145	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Nevertheless, our contacts report that wage pressures are resulting in some outsized wage gains, and they suggest that such pressures are prevalent in a broadening array of industries and occupations.	13	1
201509	1146	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Additionally, the wage components of our manufacturing and service-sector surveys have strengthened considerably over the past year or so and are now quite close to historic highs.	13	1
201509	1147	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Perhaps the gains we hear about are being offset by weaker wage gains in other occupations, but our reports do seem to indicate that a broader portion of the labor market has tightened in recent months.	13	1
201509	1148	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Despite these indications of rising labor costs, there are no new reports of broad-based acceleration in prices and inflation expectations, at least as evidenced by our survey results, and contact reports suggest that expectations appear to be well anchored.	13	1
201509	1149	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national picture, the most notable aspect of recent economic performance, in my view, besides the unexpectedly rapid tightening in labor markets, is the behavior of household expenditures.	13	1
201509	1150	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Real consumer spending accelerated from less than 2 percent in the years prior to 2014 to over 3 percent since.	13	1
201509	1151	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	This faster pace was interrupted in the first quarter of this year by what are now known to have been temporary factors, including unusually harsh winter weather.	13	1
201509	1152	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But with that pothole behind us, consumption growth has returned to a 3 percent annual rate.	13	1
201509	1153	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Reflecting the momentum in labor markets, real income growth is likely to continue at a solid pace.	13	1
201509	1154	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I expect real PCE growth to remain in the 2½ to 3 percent range, distinctly higher than the average from 2010 through 2014.	13	1
201509	1155	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	This sustained step-up in the pace of consumption growth is important to my thinking about interest rates.	13	1
201509	1156	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I’ll say more about this later, but, broadly speaking, higher real consumption growth should be associated with higher real interest rates.	13	1
201509	1157	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Other components of GDP are showing reasonably healthy growth as well.	13	1
201509	1158	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Business fixed investment weakened beginning late last year, but recent reports indicate that capital goods orders bottomed out last spring and have been increasing since.	13	1
201509	1159	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Nonresidential construction spending, apart from oil and gas, has registered strong gains as well, as has residential investment spending.	13	1
201509	1160	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Even before the August employment report, I would have argued that we had seen substantial further improvements in labor market conditions this year.	13	1
201509	1161	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	With monthly job gains averaging over 200,000 per month and growth in the prime working-age population having slowed considerably, it is not surprising that the unemployment rate has continued to decline at an impressive rate.	13	1
201509	1162	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The August employment report obviously revealed additional labor market improvement.	13	1
201509	1163	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I have spoken in past meetings about broader measures of labor utilization.	13	1
201509	1164	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I have also spoken about alternative approaches to calculating an appropriate benchmark to gauge labor market conditions.	13	1
201509	1165	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	At this point, however, it seems clear that virtually all measures of labor market utilization have fallen enough to be statistically indistinguishable from any plausible normative benchmark one might choose to represent maximum employment.	13	1
201509	1166	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As a result, I don’t see how we can say we have not seen further improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201509	1167	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Some argue that there is likely to be additional slack in labor markets if nominal wage rates are not accelerating.	13	1
201509	1168	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But real wage rates are related to productivity growth, and productivity growth has been slow for several years now.	13	1
201509	1169	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Wage growth in real terms has at least kept pace with productivity gains over that time period and, in the past year, has significantly outpaced productivity.	13	1
201509	1170	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t see the behavior of wage rates as providing evidence that there is any remaining labor market slack.	13	1
201509	1171	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The JOLTS data also seem to suggest that labor market slack is minimal.	13	1
201509	1172	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Job openings have been increasing more rapidly than hiring for several years now, but the divergence has widened at an increasing pace this year.	13	1
201509	1173	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As of July, job openings have increased by 12½ percent from their average in the fourth quarter of 2014, while the hiring rate has been virtually flat.	13	1
201509	1174	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The natural interpretation would seem to be that employers are having an increasingly hard time finding suitable workers to hire, and slack in any meaningful sense has been substantially reduced.	13	1
201509	1175	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	A solid economic outlook and the relative stability of inflation expectations, I think, should give us confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent once the temporary effect of the recent fall in oil prices and strengthening of the dollar have dissipated.	13	1
201509	1176	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The behavior of inflation following the previous oil and dollar moves should bolster that confidence.	13	1
201509	1177	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Over the past six months—that is, from January, which is when energy prices bottomed out, to July, which is the latest month for which we have this data—headline PCE inflation has averaged 2.2 percent, while core PCE inflation has averaged 1.7 percent.	13	1
201509	1178	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	One might argue that the strength in headline inflation was aided by the 7.8 percent rebound in energy prices from January to July, but core inflation was relatively close to 2 percent despite the continuing decrease in import prices this year.	13	1
201509	1179	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I think our experience following the previous disinflationary surprise is good evidence that the 1½ percent decline in the overall price level over the six months prior to last January was transitory and left no lasting effect on trend inflation.	13	1
201509	1180	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thus, to the extent that the current disinflationary impulse from energy prices and the dollar resembles the previous one, it ought to bolster our confidence that inflation will rebound to 2 percent as it did earlier this year.	13	1
201509	1181	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Recent financial market volatility both here and abroad has captured popular attention and seems to have shaped a great deal of market commentary about our pending policy decision.	13	1
201509	1182	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	For me, it’s hard to discern meaningful implications for US growth prospects or inflation trends, and it hasn’t had a significant effect on my policy views.	13	1
201509	1183	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	These recent events bring to mind several historical instances—President Rosengren cited one or two—in which large stock market declines have occurred in the midst of extended economic expansions.	13	1
201509	1184	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The years 1966, 1987, and 1998 stand out.	13	1
201509	1185	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In each of these instances, it is clear with hindsight that stock market gyrations did not signal a deflection in the trajectory of US economic activity, and, in fact, in each case the economy continued to expand.	13	1
201509	1186	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I also think it’s clear with hindsight that our policy reactions were too accommodative.	13	1
201509	1187	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	For example, in the fall of 1998, we cut interest rates three times following financial market reactions to the emerging market turmoil and, as a result, fell behind the curve in 1999.	13	1
201509	1188	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I think the lesson is that we should be careful to not overreact to financial market volatility that is not demonstrably connected to weaker economic fundamentals.	13	1
201509	1189	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1190	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1191	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201509	1192	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1193	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I spent a lot of time during the intermeeting period talking with business contacts, and I thank President Evans for hosting a joint meeting between the Chicago and Cleveland boards that allowed me to gain insights from a wider array of businesses and geography.	13	1
201509	1194	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, the Fourth District economy continued to expand but at a somewhat slower pace than in July.	13	1
201509	1195	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions fell to 9 in August, down from 18 in July, which is about the level it’s been for most of the year.	13	1
201509	1196	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But this aggregate number masks some differences across industries.	13	1
201509	1197	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The auto industry is doing very well.	13	1
201509	1198	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Strong motor vehicle sales reflect mainly retail rather than fleet sales and include a large share of trucks for which profit margins are high.	13	1
201509	1199	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	One of my directors, an auto industry executive, indicated that auto manufacturers and suppliers find it challenging to keep up with demand.	13	1
201509	1200	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Most companies expanded production some time ago by using alternative work schedules with multiple shifts, and there are few other options available to quickly boost capacity.	13	1
201509	1201	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	His company is adding workers to each shift to avoid bottlenecks and to step in for absent employees.	13	1
201509	1202	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Activity in the construction sector, particularly nonresidential construction, remains strong, and the outlook for residential construction has improved as household formation rates have begun to accelerate and house prices have increased.	13	1
201509	1203	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	A director whose company is a large supplier to the construction sector has a very positive outlook.	13	1
201509	1204	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	However, steel manufacturers in the District remain under pressure—feeling the effects of the appreciation of the dollar, slower growth abroad, and weak demand from the domestic energy sector.	13	1
201509	1205	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets remain quite positive.	13	1
201509	1206	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The District unemployment rate stood at 5.1 percent in July, and it has been essentially stable at this low level since late last year.	13	1
201509	1207	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	District payrolls continue to grow at a better than 1 percent pace.	13	1
201509	1208	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Business contacts report that labor markets are tightening and compensation pressures are increasing.	13	1
201509	1209	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In the auto industry, manufacturers and suppliers have been making widespread use of bonuses and overtime.	13	1
201509	1210	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Notable were reports we received from business contacts that wage pressures are now being felt not only for skilled workers in certain fields like construction and IT, which have faced difficulties in finding workers for some time, but also for less-skilled occupations, such as those in the restaurant industry.	13	1
201509	1211	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Another notable aspect of my conversations with business contacts was that, although they certainly noticed the gyrations in the stock market, none suggested that the volatility and decline in equity prices was causing them to change their plans regarding hiring, investment, or spending.	13	1
201509	1212	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	That volatility partly reflects renewed concerns about China’s growth prospects and its implications for commodity prices and growth in other emerging market economies.	13	1
201509	1213	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The dollar has appreciated and oil prices have fallen since our previous meeting, but the recent moves were considerably smaller than those seen last summer, and their implications for economic activity and inflation should be smaller as well.	13	1
201509	1214	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Nonetheless, there has been some tightening of financial conditions in the United States—in particular, lower equity prices and somewhat higher credit risk spreads—but conditions have tended to stabilize and partially reverse over the past couple of weeks.	13	1
201509	1215	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I see the consequences of this tightening in financial conditions as a risk to my forecast, but it hasn’t materially changed my outlook for the national economy.	13	1
201509	1216	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The incoming data have been in line with my expectations for accelerating activity, further improvements in labor markets, and a gradual firming of inflation over time.	13	1
201509	1217	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	We’ve had confirmation that growth in the second quarter was robust, and the economy has entered the third quarter with some momentum.	13	1
201509	1218	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Averaging the estimates from the Cleveland Fed’s two nowcasting models puts third-quarter growth at 2 percent, which is the median across Federal Reserve System nowcasts included in the Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1219	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I’ve marked up my growth forecast for this year to reflect the strong growth we’ve seen in the first half.	13	1
201509	1220	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Partly reflecting somewhat slower-than-expected global growth, I’ve reduced my growth forecast for 2016 and 2017 two-tenths compared with my June projection.	13	1
201509	1221	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But in this projection, based partly on the revisions to past productivity growth, I’ve also revised down my longer-run growth rate two-tenths to 2.3 percent.	13	1
201509	1222	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	So the trajectory of the economy in my forecast remains the same, with GDP growth picking up to an above-trend pace later this year and remaining above trend next year, supported by highly accommodative monetary policy and sound economic fundamentals, including improving household balance sheets and strengthening labor markets.	13	1
201509	1223	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The labor market has made significant progress.	13	1
201509	1224	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Since our previous meeting, unemployment and underemployment rates have declined, payroll growth has remained solid, and the job openings rate has increased.	13	1
201509	1225	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Current labor market conditions are stronger than at the time we began raising rates in June 2004.	13	1
201509	1226	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Today the unemployment rate is 5.1 percent, which is the Board’s staff estimate of the natural rate.	13	1
201509	1227	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	At our June 2004 meeting, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent, which was 0.6 percentage point above the Board’s staff estimate of the natural rate at the time.	13	1
201509	1228	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Looking at job growth, today payroll employment is 2.8 percent above its pre- recession peak.	13	1
201509	1229	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Based on the real-time data available in June 2004, payrolls were more than 1 percent below their pre-recession peak.	13	1
201509	1230	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I believe the economy is at or nearly at full employment.	13	1
201509	1231	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Research by Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Board staff indicates that the gap between the current labor force participation rate and its long-term trend based on demographics is only about 20 basis points.	13	1
201509	1232	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	If actual participation stays flat, the gap is expected to be eliminated by next spring.	13	1
201509	1233	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In this SEP projection, I moved down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate to 5.2 percent from 5.5 percent.	13	1
201509	1234	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Of course, in view of the error bands associated with long-run estimates, I admit this is not a statistically significant change.	13	1
201509	1235	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Still, it recognizes that the unemployment rate has been falling more sharply than I’ve been anticipating, and wage pressures have not yet risen significantly.	13	1
201509	1236	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	With above-trend growth, I see the unemployment rate falling to 4.8 percent by the end of next year and remaining below its longer-run level until 2018.	13	1
201509	1237	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Currently, headline inflation is running below target, but I project inflation will return to our 2 percent objective in early 2017.	13	1
201509	1238	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	This is slightly later than in my June projection to allow for the transitory effects of the most recent declines in energy and import prices to pass through.	13	1
201509	1239	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I continue to anticipate inflation will gradually return to our target because I expect output growth to be above trend, labor markets to continue their strengthening, and inflation expectations to remain stable.	13	1
201509	1240	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In light of the volatility and flight-to-safety moves in financial markets since our previous meeting, I, like the Tealbook, take little signal about inflation expectations from the downward move in inflation compensation measures.	13	1
201509	1241	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The estimate of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s measure of 10-year inflation expectations for September was very little changed from August; it actually went up by 2 basis points, but the measure is up about 10 to 15 basis points since early this year.	13	1
201509	1242	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, although the latest decline in energy prices was not anticipated, inflation dynamics have played out as the Committee suggested they would.	13	1
201509	1243	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In particular, the effects on inflation of last summer’s decline in oil prices and drop in import prices were transitory, as expected.	13	1
201509	1244	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Like President Lacker said, if you look at the six-month annualized rate of PCE inflation, it has moved from negative readings early this year to over 2 percent in July.	13	1
201509	1245	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Six- month core PCE inflation increased from less than 1 percent earlier this year to 1.7 percent in July, and a similar pattern is seen in the CPI, core CPI, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE, the Cleveland Fed median CPI, and the Cleveland Fed trimmed mean CPI.	13	1
201509	1246	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The six-month annualized change in all of these measures as of July is 2 percent or more.	13	1
201509	1247	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	This pattern is consistent with the FOMC’s statement that it anticipates inflation will begin gradually moving up as the effects of earlier declines in oil prices and import prices dissipate.	13	1
201509	1248	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Seeing the inflation numbers play out this way should give us more confidence in our inflation forecast.	13	1
201509	1249	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Now, it’s true that the most recent decline in oil prices and import prices will send the headline readings back down again for a time, but based on past experience, this will also be transitory.	13	1
201509	1250	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Of course, as we discussed here and as the interesting papers at this year’s Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Jackson Hole Symposium underscore, we have to be humble.	13	1
201509	1251	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	There’s considerable uncertainty associated with the inflation forecast, but probably not more uncertainty now than in the past.	13	1
201509	1252	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Although there are pros and cons to any particular study, I read some of the Federal Reserve research that President Lacker cited in a recent speech as saying that we should not be too quick to throw out the models and tools we’re currently using to forecast inflation, most of which suggest a gradual return to target.	13	1
201509	1253	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In the historical data, inflation surprises are frequent and large.	13	1
201509	1254	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In DSGE models, these surprises are often attributed to shocks to the mark-up of price over cost, and they play a key role in modeling inflation dynamics.	13	1
201509	1255	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	We shouldn’t be too surprised that our inflation measures are pushed away from target when the economy is hit by large shocks, but we also should not overreact to such shocks.	13	1
201509	1256	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Finally, underlying my forecast is a funds rate path that incorporates a liftoff from the zero lower bound this quarter and a gradual rise thereafter.	13	1
201509	1257	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	My path is more shallow than in my previous SEP submission.	13	1
201509	1258	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I revised down my long-run funds rate by 25 basis points to 3½ percent, and I anticipate the funds rate to be at that level by the end of 2017.	13	1
201509	1259	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1260	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1261	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201509	1262	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1263	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll start with a few observations from our District contacts over the past few weeks.	13	1
201509	1264	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Those contacts were representatives of businesses and, this time around, of state and local government.	13	1
201509	1265	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Sentiment in the business community continues to be almost uniformly positive regarding conditions and the outlook.	13	1
201509	1266	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Retailers reported good sales activity and optimism about future sales prospects.	13	1
201509	1267	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Homebuilding and commercial real estate industry participants are upbeat.	13	1
201509	1268	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto industry contacts remain delighted with sales, trends, and prospects.	13	1
201509	1269	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Enough of our interviews occurred during the recent period of market volatility to give us a read on concern raised by those developments.	13	1
201509	1270	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We detected little concern that momentum will be disrupted by global economic and financial events.	13	1
201509	1271	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Over this intermeeting cycle, we were attentive to perceptions of general conditions in labor markets and, especially, wage trends.	13	1
201509	1272	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We got the clear impression that hiring challenges persist and have intensified.	13	1
201509	1273	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	A number of our contacts described significant labor shortages and are implementing new strategies to attract personnel—for example, referral and signing bonuses.	13	1
201509	1274	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms are increasingly willing to spend on employee training to address skills requirements.	13	1
201509	1275	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This was the fifth consecutive cycle of contacts in which we heard comments on growing wage pressures for selected job categories or in selected geographies or both.	13	1
201509	1276	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	It was noteworthy that, this past cycle, the District contacts yielded a more generalized sense of rising wage pressures.	13	1
201509	1277	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Turning to my outlook, my baseline forecast for growth falls in the 2½ to 3 percent range over the next few years, which puts me on a stronger growth path than the current Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1278	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My growth outlook is accompanied by continued absorption of labor market slack, broadly defined, and accelerating measured wage pressure.	13	1
201509	1279	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I continue to have confidence that inflation will move to target in the medium term, but I’m not very optimistic we’ll see much improvement in the inflation trend this year.	13	1
201509	1280	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect transitory factors, such as oil and commodity prices, will exert downward pressure on headline and core inflation measures for the next few quarters at least.	13	1
201509	1281	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This view lines up with the Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1282	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The only meaningful change in my assessment of the economy from the July meeting pertains to my sense of the balance of risks.	13	1
201509	1283	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The recent volatility in the markets, apparently a response to increased uncertainty triggered by global economic and financial developments, has not subsided entirely as of this meeting date.	13	1
201509	1284	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s too early to know whether this episode amounts to a bona fide shock or just a nervous spasm in the markets.	13	1
201509	1285	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s also too early to detect any significant effect on the real economy.	13	1
201509	1286	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not projecting a material effect, but evaluation of that question will require some time.	13	1
201509	1287	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1288	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1289	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201509	1290	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1291	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do have one comment about the Twelfth District economy, specifically the Bay Area economy.	13	1
201509	1292	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know if you saw this in the news, but our housing crisis is so extreme that the Salesforce conference, which is going on all week in San Francisco—another reason I’m happy to be here and not at home—brought in a luxury cruise ship to provide housing for the people coming to their big conference because the hotels were all booked.	13	1
201509	1293	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	At Airbnb.com, which is very popular in San Francisco, the rates were described as “astronomical.”	13	1
201509	1294	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think, the fact that people are now living on luxury cruise ships gives you a sense of the state of the San Francisco economy.	13	1
201509	1295	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past five years, real GDP growth has averaged a little over 2 percent, and the unemployment rate has fallen nearly 1 percentage point per year.	13	1
201509	1296	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	All indications are that this pace of expansion, both in terms of growth and the labor market, is continuing despite the sizable global headwinds.	13	1
201509	1297	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, my contacts point to a virtuous cycle of job growth and consumer spending across a broad set of regions and sectors, and I see moderate GDP growth combined with a still-subdued pace of productivity growth, implying that the unemployment rate should continue its downward trajectory at least through next year.	13	1
201509	1298	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This ongoing strengthening of the labor market is in the context of an economy that’s already at or very near full employment.	13	1
201509	1299	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, my forecast, like that in the Tealbook, implies that the unemployment rate will fall significantly below the natural rate of unemployment next year and remain there for quite some time.	13	1
201509	1300	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, like President Bullard, I see this as already in train, in that the momentum in the economy is already in place to create those circumstances, and it doesn’t depend on any policy decisions we make at this time.	13	1
201509	1301	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	https://Airbnb.com Running such a high-pressure economy arguably has some benefits, at least for a while.	13	1
201509	1302	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It may speed the processes of squeezing out remaining pockets of labor market weakness and drawing in some of those who are still sitting on the sidelines.	13	1
201509	1303	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It should also accelerate progress in reaching our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201509	1304	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But there are risks as well, especially if this is allowed to go on for too long.	13	1
201509	1305	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The economic pot may move from a healthy simmer to a full boil and eventually boil over.	13	1
201509	1306	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Managing this risk requires that we respect the lags between monetary policy actions and the effects they have on the economy, and that we not allow imbalances to emerge and grow that can ultimately destabilize the economy.	13	1
201509	1307	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The paths to expansion provide a cautionary tale in this regard.	13	1
201509	1308	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In both cases, the unemployment rate drifted lower and lower, falling below the natural rate, and eventually the economy outran its fundamentals and became increasingly fueled by excessive optimism.	13	1
201509	1309	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, the high-pressure economy proved unsustainable, collapsing under its own weight, at great social and economic cost—a topic I will return to tomorrow.	13	1
201509	1310	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, managing this risk also requires one to know how far is too far, and that brings me to the question of the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201509	1311	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve argued in the past that I view the unemployment gap, the gap between the unemployment rate and its natural rate, the long-run equilibrium value, as being a good gauge of overall slack, but that leads us, of course, to think hard about what the natural rate of unemployment is and how to best estimate that.	13	1
201509	1312	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have spent a lot of time in the Federal Reserve System, and especially the San Francisco Fed, thinking about this issue over the years.	13	1
201509	1313	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And on the heels of the Great Recession, my staff and many others in the System really wrestled with the possibility that the persistent labor market dysfunction related to mismatch or worker scarring might have substantially increased the natural rate, and our conclusion then and now is that the long-run natural rate wasn’t, in fact, much affected by these factors.	13	1
201509	1314	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And now we’re faced with a different question, and that is, with the unemployment rate so low today, we’re asking ourselves whether the natural rate may actually be lower than its pre- recession levels.	13	1
201509	1315	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, of course, a recent analysis by Board staff, as Governor Tarullo commented on at one of our previous meetings, considers this possibility, and that definitely spurred some further research at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.	13	1
201509	1316	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Board staff analysis concluded that the secular decline in the labor share of income, which is well documented, has pushed down the natural rate of unemployment as well in recent decades.	13	1
201509	1317	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They argue that, basically, the decline in the labor share reflects a decline in worker bargaining power which lowers labor costs and makes it more profitable for businesses to hire workers.	13	1
201509	1318	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With the greater profitability of hiring workers, firms want to go out and create more vacancies in order to take advantage of this opportunity to hire more workers and make more money.	13	1
201509	1319	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, with this increase in job vacancies, it also should be easier for workers to find jobs.	13	1
201509	1320	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we should see some signs that job-matching rates are going up.	13	1
201509	1321	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In their paper, they find some evidence for the first hypothesis.	13	1
201509	1322	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is a positive correlation between labor share and the ratio of vacancies to unemployed across industries and states.	13	1
201509	1323	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we found this idea intriguing—in fact, provocative.	13	1
201509	1324	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But after a deeper look at the theory and the evidence, I’m unconvinced.	13	1
201509	1325	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the theoretical implications of a declining labor share for the natural rate of unemployment are far from definitive.	13	1
201509	1326	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some work by my own staff shows that a decline in labor share doesn’t automatically imply that firms can get higher profits by creating new jobs.	13	1
201509	1327	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s an example they studied, that if financial intermediaries are receiving an increasing share of the surplus from output, businesses and workers are both being squeezed and job creation will fall along with the labor share.	13	1
201509	1328	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, in their model, you would find a fall in labor share could actually push up the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201509	1329	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, more importantly, the evidence is inconsistent with the theory.	13	1
201509	1330	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking at the time series data for the United States, vacancies per unemployed worker have not increased as the labor share has fallen over the previous couple of decades.	13	1
201509	1331	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If anything, the data show somewhat of a downward rather than upward movement in recent decades.	13	1
201509	1332	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And looking at the worker side of the equation, you see the same thing.	13	1
201509	1333	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The job-finding rates appear to have fallen, not risen, as the theory would suggest, and we’ve looked at this across different subgroups—short-term and long-term unemployed, and people out of the labor force.	13	1
201509	1334	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, the consistent finding is that job-finding rates are not rising the way the theory would suggest.	13	1
201509	1335	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I really don’t see convincing evidence that the natural rate has come down because of a fall in labor share.	13	1
201509	1336	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	With little evidence that the labor market has become more dysfunctional, my staff has gone back to the tried-and-true method of thinking about the natural rate of unemployment, building on some research that was done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and that’s to focus on the composition of the labor force.	13	1
201509	1337	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, we’re going back to George Perry’s work from 1970 that said the time needed to find a good job match varies across worker groups, depending on age and other things.	13	1
201509	1338	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Think about young workers—they tend to have less-stable employment patterns than older workers.	13	1
201509	1339	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That translates into higher unemployment rates on average.	13	1
201509	1340	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s an old and well-studied idea in labor markets, and studies differ in how they account for this influence on the overall unemployment rate.	13	1
201509	1341	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What my staff did is, they looked at the pre- recession average unemployment rate for groups defined by age, gender, education, and race.	13	1
201509	1342	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They weighted them up by changes in the population shares since 2007, and based on average unemployment rates for the 20 years before the recession, this method yields an estimate of the natural rate prevailing today of 5.0 percent.	13	1
201509	1343	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago staff did a very similar analysis and used similar methods.	13	1
201509	1344	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	They looked at a shorter period of time, and they got a somewhat lower estimate.	13	1
201509	1345	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, going back to this research that we’ve been doing about labor market dynamics and whether there have been structural shifts in the labor market, we’re not really finding any evidence of that.	13	1
201509	1346	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We decided to stick with looking at a 20-year pre-recession sample, and that’s where we came up with the 5 percent number.	13	1
201509	1347	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I don’t expect demographic factors to actually change much over the next few years.	13	1
201509	1348	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that is my long-run view of the labor market.	13	1
201509	1349	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I said earlier, I expect the unemployment gap to turn negative later this year and remain so in coming years.	13	1
201509	1350	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This will push up underlying inflation more quickly toward our target, and that is a good thing.	13	1
201509	1351	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In my forecast, we achieve our 2 percent inflation objective in early 2017 when the effects of the dollar appreciation and of falling oil prices have dissipated—I think this is similar to President Mester’s view.	13	1
201509	1352	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d just mention, we did spend quite a bit of time with the annual revisions, thinking long and hard about some of our long-run views.	13	1
201509	1353	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, similarly to President Mester, I did bring down somewhat my estimate of not only the natural rate to 5 percent, but also long-term growth to about 1.9 percent—based on our research on trends, demographics, and productivity—and the real natural rate of interest to 1.5 percent.	13	1
201509	1354	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And for those who like to read all the details or they can’t sleep at night, I am respondent number 6 in the SEP.	13	1
201509	1355	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1356	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1357	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	There’s a two-hander.	13	1
201509	1358	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	13	1
201509	1359	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201509	1360	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t want to ask President Williams to give away his punch line from tomorrow, but I was wondering what you have in mind when you talk about the economy boiling over.	13	1
201509	1361	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Are you talking in terms of inflation, or are you talking in terms of low unemployment leading inexorably to, unfortunately, very high unemployment?	13	1
201509	1362	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the real side, or on the nominal side?	13	1
201509	1363	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll give a very short answer to that.	13	1
201509	1364	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am thinking in this case about an economy that’s basically becoming unsustainable—living off froth, if you will—and then when it turns, it turns into recession.	13	1
201509	1365	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m really not thinking about the inflation aspect in this particular case, but more that the economy is running off a cliff and then falling.	13	1
201509	1366	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that, really, is the example.	13	1
201509	1367	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	13	1
201509	1368	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1369	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13	1
201509	1370	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Well, thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1371	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	As President Mester just pointed out, in the Philadelphia District we don’t have a luxury cruise ship, but you can spend the night on the Battleship New Jersey if you want to.	13	1
201509	1372	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201509	1373	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Sounds attractive.	13	1
201509	1374	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Well, they thought about it with the Pope.	13	1
201509	1375	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	They were going to open it up for the Pope—not for him, but for others.	13	1
201509	1376	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201509	1377	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	So, back to business.	13	1
201509	1378	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Although there has been a slight deceleration in economic activity in the Third District, growth is continuing at a modest pace, and our contacts, for the most part, remain optimistic.	13	1
201509	1379	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	While employment growth slowed measurably over the past three months, all of the slowdown can be attributed to a 1.6 percent decline in New Jersey’s job creation rate during July.	13	1
201509	1380	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	There’s some evidence, though, that this outsized decline may be due to seasonal adjustment.	13	1
201509	1381	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	With slower job growth, our region’s unemployment rate held steady in July at 5.6 percent.	13	1
201509	1382	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Total compensation, however, has picked up a bit, with 2.6 percent growth in the ECI in the Philadelphia metropolitan area now exceeding that of the nation.	13	1
201509	1383	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Our coincident indexes for the region, which are largely driven by labor market conditions, have grown between 3.02 and 3.88 percent year over year, roughly in line with the nation.	13	1
201509	1384	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting the softness in manufacturing nationally, the general activity index in our August business outlook survey came in at 8.3, which is slightly below its nonrecessionary average.	13	1
201509	1385	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Shipments were a bit stronger at 16.7, and the employment index returned to positive territory after a small negative reading in July.	13	1
201509	1386	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Optimism remained high, as the Future General Activity Index rose to 43.1, well above its nonrecessionary average.	13	1
201509	1387	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	However, the August survey was conducted before the recent turmoil in financial and oil markets, so the preliminary data we have for September’s report, which will be released tomorrow morning, is of particular interest.	13	1
201509	1388	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	As expected, some of the nervousness in global financial markets has spilled over into survey respondents’ views, but, with the exception of the headline index, the spillover was relatively minor.	13	1
201509	1389	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	September’s Current General Activity Index declined to negative 6, although the indexes for new orders and employment increased somewhat to 9.4 and 10.2, respectively, and shipments held fairly steady at 14.8.	13	1
201509	1390	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Also, the Future General Activity Index was largely unchanged in September at 44.0.	13	1
201509	1391	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Broadly speaking, the tenor of the report is slightly upbeat.	13	1
201509	1392	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	My take on the numbers and what we are hearing is that we are not seeing much spillover from financial markets to the real economy, at least not in the Third District.	13	1
201509	1393	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The service sector has shown some limited improvement since we last met, but the indexes for activities, orders, and sales still remain below historical averages.	13	1
201509	1394	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The relative bright spot is the region’s tourism industry, which is reporting record summer activity.	13	1
201509	1395	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Housing in the region continues to recover and appears to be gaining some momentum.	13	1
201509	1396	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Recent months have seen record-high multifamily permits, and single-family permits are improving modestly.	13	1
201509	1397	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	In the Third District, multifamily construction is outpacing the nation as a whole.	13	1
201509	1398	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	House prices, however, continue to grow more slowly than in the nation as a whole, in part because of much lower house price depreciation during the housing crisis.	13	1
201509	1399	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Regionally, nonresidential construction has also improved, with the value of contracts for both commercial buildings and all nonresidential buildings rising appreciably in July.	13	1
201509	1400	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, I believe the real economy remains on solid footing, and that the waning in price pressures is a temporary phenomenon.	13	1
201509	1401	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Although recent negative developments in foreign economies and the stock market are of some concern, I do not anticipate that they will have a large or persistent effect on US growth.	13	1
201509	1402	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Specifically, my forecast calls for real GDP growth of about 2.3 percent this year, as the economy has rebounded from a weak first quarter.	13	1
201509	1403	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	I expect healthy consumer spending to underpin output growth that is modestly above my longer-term trend of 2.3 percent over the medium term.	13	1
201509	1404	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The recent data continue to point to a healthy labor market, and I expect the unemployment rate will edge slightly below my estimate of the natural rate over the next three years.	13	1
201509	1405	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Although the recent data on inflation have been on the weak side, I see this mostly due to the fall in energy prices, so I expect the weakness to be temporary and inflation to begin moving up.	13	1
201509	1406	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	In addition, I am encouraged by survey evidence showing that business owners plan to increase labor compensation.	13	1
201509	1407	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Research by my staff indicates that movements in actual compensation or earnings lag survey measures by 9 to 12 months, so we may soon see increases in wages that get passed through to inflation.	13	1
201509	1408	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	That said, I am a bit concerned about the seeming downward tilt in inflation expectations and will be watching this closely going forward.	13	1
201509	1409	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	On balance, I expect that inflation will rise gradually over the next three years and reach our 2 percent target in 2018.	13	1
201509	1410	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Underlying my forecast is a path for the federal funds rate that is somewhat stronger than the Tealbook, although it is within the range of outcomes suggested by monetary policy rules that we look at.	13	1
201509	1411	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The recent data have not altered my view that the real economy will grow at a pace not too far from trend growth over the next few years, and that it is able to sustain a gradual renormalization of monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1412	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1413	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1414	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13	1
201509	1415	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1416	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I am going to start by talking about the outlook for the energy sector.	13	1
201509	1417	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	This will build on some of Steve Kamin’s comments.	13	1
201509	1418	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Oil price uncertainty, as measured by the oil volatility index, is approaching exceptionally high levels, similar to what we saw at the start of this year and in 2011.	13	1
201509	1419	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Our view, informed by discussion with industry contacts, is that there is likely to be more downside than upside risk at current prices.	13	1
201509	1420	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, we believe oil prices may well fall further from here and stay lower for longer than had been previously expected.	13	1
201509	1421	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me explain some of the reasons why.	13	1
201509	1422	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	First, on the demand side, a significant issue, which we have all talked about, is a possible further slowing of growth in China and China- linked economies.	13	1
201509	1423	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Second, the summer driving season—which, by the way, was very strong— has ended, and we have yet to enter the peak winter heating season.	13	1
201509	1424	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Third and lastly, refineries are now shutting down for normal scheduled maintenance, and that will go on for the next few months.	13	1
201509	1425	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	On the supply side, inventories of crude are large and growing.	13	1
201509	1426	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Global production is more than 2 million barrels per day above global consumption.	13	1
201509	1427	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	And although rig count has notably declined, this is more than offset, in our view, by a very large shadow inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells that could be brought into production rapidly, depending on oil prices.	13	1
201509	1428	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	We have accumulated this supply overhang even as supply outages outside the United States have restricted world oil production by an estimated 3½ million barrels per day.	13	1
201509	1429	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	If any of these outages are resolved—for example, in Libya or Iran—the additional production could easily offset supply declines expected in the United States in coming months.	13	1
201509	1430	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, much of the world’s marginal cost production is located in the United States, and, to a much lesser extent, in Canada and the North Sea.	13	1
201509	1431	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	So if supply adjustments are required, which we think they will be, they are going to need to take place mostly in the United States.	13	1
201509	1432	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, this is going to be challenging and very painful economically, and it is going to be primarily in the area of the shale producers.	13	1
201509	1433	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In response to all of this, producers, as you would expect, are cutting their capital outlays—in some cases, for the second or third time.	13	1
201509	1434	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	For North America as a whole, we expect energy industry cap ex to fall as much as 10 to 15 percent in 2016 versus 2015.	13	1
201509	1435	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite the initial surge of capital that came into the sector early this year, multiple Beige Book contacts reported that the credit situation is in fact worsening for many small- to mid-cap independent producers.	13	1
201509	1436	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	And potential new capital is now resetting its expectations much more realistically to lower prices for longer.	13	1
201509	1437	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe this will likely lead to more defaults, debt restructurings, and merger activity.	13	1
201509	1438	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Based on all of these factors, it is our view that it may not be until sometime in 2017 that global supply and demand get into some reasonable degree of balance.	13	1
201509	1439	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	With that backdrop, let me talk about the Eleventh District.	13	1
201509	1440	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	There certainly will continue to be negative spillovers from all of this in the Eleventh District.	13	1
201509	1441	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	We see it in the manufacturing survey, and, in fact, our most recent survey shows that the new orders component dropped 13 points to negative 12½ after having reached positive territory in July for the first time this year.	13	1
201509	1442	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	The service sector is stronger and more resilient and still growing at close to its expansion average, but we are seeing signs that retail sales are beginning to weaken.	13	1
201509	1443	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition to the effect of the energy sector, Beige Book contacts suggest some of this retail weakness is due to the strength of the dollar, which really affects Texas maybe more than other states because it hurts the purchasing power of Mexican shoppers who contribute significantly to retail sales in the state of Texas.	13	1
201509	1444	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Despite all of this, employment in the Eleventh District has been surprisingly resilient, probably because of the diversified nature of the economy.	13	1
201509	1445	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Even factoring in these negative energy developments, our regional economists still predict that Texas jobs will grow at an annualized pace of 1.3 percent over the final five months of this year, which is the same rate as the first seven months.	13	1
201509	1446	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Although reductions in energy-related jobs have been a negative factor, as of yet they have not affected the regional unemployment rate as much as we would have expected.	13	1
201509	1447	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	What is happening is that many of the people who moved to the area to work in the oil fields have now left and returned to their previous locations.	13	1
201509	1448	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Those who have remained have taken lower-paying jobs in other sectors, which, until recently, have struggled to attract new employees.	13	1
201509	1449	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the pronounced features of our District is severe labor shortages in various areas—construction trades, manufacturing, food, nursing, truck driving, retail, and restaurants.	13	1
201509	1450	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Because of that, despite all of these negative factors from energy, we still see upward wage pressure.	13	1
201509	1451	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	And, related to that, we see a very strong real estate market.	13	1
201509	1452	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	If you look at the areas of the state which are less dependent on energy, the real estate sector remains robust.	13	1
201509	1453	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Our latest reading of Texas home values is up 8 percent year over year in the second quarter.	13	1
201509	1454	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	And we didn’t see much deceleration from quarter to quarter during the first two quarters of this year.	13	1
201509	1455	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	With that, downward price pressures actually accelerated notably in surveys in August.	13	1
201509	1456	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	According to our manufacturing surveys, and in the service sector, our selling price index slipped below zero, which is its first negative reading in nearly five years.	13	1
201509	1457	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	So, with all of this, there are a lot of crosscurrents in the state.	13	1
201509	1458	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	But all in all, even though the Eleventh District has remained resilient, we believe the negative effects of a potentially lower oil price for longer are continuing to unfold, and that probably means the risks in the District are to the downside.	13	1
201509	1459	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Turning to the national economy, we expect to see the unemployment rate reach its longer-term sustainable level by the end of this year—that is, 5 percent—and then fall below that level.	13	1
201509	1460	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	With unemployment low and falling, and with longer-run inflation expectations well anchored, we believe inflation should begin moving up toward our 2 percent objective as the effects of the fall in oil and the rise of the dollar eventually pass through inflation calculations.	13	1
201509	1461	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	By the end of 2017, we believe we are going to be very likely near our inflation target of 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1462	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe conditions outside the United States do pose a real threat to the scenario I just described, though.	13	1
201509	1463	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Major economies—including China, Europe, Brazil, and Japan, for example—face serious demographic, fiscal, and structural challenges.	13	1
201509	1464	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	These challenges have the potential to create spillovers, which could negatively affect the United States, and we believe these challenges are likely to take years versus months to unfold and address.	13	1
201509	1465	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Lastly, regarding the recent volatility in US and other global financial markets, for us this is not, as of yet, a major factor in our assessment of overall conditions, and let me explain why.	13	1
201509	1466	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Although a decline in market value certainly could have negative wealth effects, we believe it has to be viewed in the context of overall valuation levels.	13	1
201509	1467	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in that regard, we believe valuations heading into the summer were fulsome by historical standards—certainly in the United States, but you can make the same argument about non-US markets, maybe even to a greater degree.	13	1
201509	1468	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	When we look at expected earnings, price/earnings ratios, and other key valuation factors, we believe that, in that context, an equity market correction like the one we recently had could potentially be healthy and, in fact, indicative of appropriate reassessment of risk‒return by market participants.	13	1
201509	1469	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1470	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1471	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201509	1472	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1473	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	As we evaluate progress toward achieving our employment mandate within a reasonable period of time, I think we can check the box for “reasonable confidence.”	13	1
201509	1474	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Most of my business contacts thought domestic demand was relatively strong.	13	1
201509	1475	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In the auto industry, low interest rates and incentives have continued to support very robust light vehicle sales.	13	1
201509	1476	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Meanwhile, my director from a large credit card bank indicated that growth in consumer spending, other than gasoline, has been healthy but not spectacular.	13	1
201509	1477	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	He and other bankers also noted that consumer credit performance outside the category of student loans has been very good, with delinquency rates near all-time lows.	13	1
201509	1478	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	A number of contacts reported gains in residential and commercial construction.	13	1
201509	1479	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, real estate markets are quite strong in some areas.	13	1
201509	1480	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	However, construction equipment manufacturers are not so upbeat, with Caterpillar seeing only modest gains and Deere reporting flat demand.	13	1
201509	1481	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Each had stronger expectations for the year back in January.	13	1
201509	1482	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We did hear a few other notes of caution.	13	1
201509	1483	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	United Airlines reported that business travel was down for the entire industry.	13	1
201509	1484	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	And Manpower Employment Services said orders for temp workers have softened, reflecting clients’ uncertainty about the demand for their products.	13	1
201509	1485	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Manpower’s permanent placements were up, but only for skilled workers.	13	1
201509	1486	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Similarly, wage gains were confined to these hard-to-fill occupations.	13	1
201509	1487	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	On the international front, most contacts expressed caution about the prospects for global growth.	13	1
201509	1488	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I did hear a number of positive reports on activity in Europe, with some of the strongest being about Spain.	13	1
201509	1489	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The gains, though, are coming from low levels.	13	1
201509	1490	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Not surprisingly, just about everyone was pessimistic about China, and there were some dire comments about Latin America, especially Brazil, which one large manufacturer described as “going off a cliff.”	13	1
201509	1491	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Turning to the national outlook, my own assessment has not changed a great deal.	13	1
201509	1492	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I expect growth will average about 2½ percent over the forecast period.	13	1
201509	1493	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	That is above the Tealbook, reflecting in part my somewhat higher path for potential output.	13	1
201509	1494	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I expect the unemployment rate will fall to 5 percent by the end of this year, which would match my assessment for the current level of the natural rate.	13	1
201509	1495	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I agree with the Tealbook that, on net, other labor market indicators point to some additional slack beyond what the unemployment rate shows.	13	1
201509	1496	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But I expect these gaps will diminish, too, as we move through this year and next.	13	1
201509	1497	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But inflation continues to be another story.	13	1
201509	1498	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I think we are still quite a way from reasonable confidence that inflation will rise to target over the medium term.	13	1
201509	1499	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the news since July has been disappointing.	13	1
201509	1500	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We have been expecting that the disinflationary influences of energy and import prices would dissipate soon.	13	1
201509	1501	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Instead, over the intermeeting period, oil prices and the dollar have broken in the “wrong” direction.	13	1
201509	1502	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The glimmer of higher wage growth we thought we saw in the ECI in the first quarter also has vanished.	13	1
201509	1503	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	President Rosengren was pretty accurate in forecasting this second-quarter change at our previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1504	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	And the year-over-year increase in core PCE inflation is still just 1.2 percent.	13	1
201509	1505	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Not long ago, some were putting more emphasis on three-month inflation, which had picked up.	13	1
201509	1506	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Now the three-month change in core PCE has moved back down.	13	1
201509	1507	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook speculated that the elevated second-quarter core number was an aberration, in part due to residual seasonality, and that was a pretty good call.	13	1
201509	1508	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	My own forecast is very close to the Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1509	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I also see inflation only slowly marching up to 1.9 percent in 2018.	13	1
201509	1510	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But getting up to this 1.9 percent inflation assessment continues to be tough for me.	13	1
201509	1511	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	None of the inflation models we regularly run at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago get us to 2 percent within the forecast horizon.	13	1
201509	1512	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Nonetheless, like the Tealbook, and like most of us around this table, my judgmental forecast embeds the assumption that inflation expectations will exert a substantial upward pull on actual inflation.	13	1
201509	1513	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But this projection is fraught with uncertainties.	13	1
201509	1514	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The recent memo by Travis Berge, Brad Strum, and Kei-Mu Yi summarized the inflation models used around the Federal Reserve System.	13	1
201509	1515	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The collection of models reported suggests that one needs to put a good deal of weight on survey measures of long-term PCE inflation expectations, which are flat at 2 percent, in order to get a model projection up to target.	13	1
201509	1516	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But relying on long-term inflation expectations isn’t always enough.	13	1
201509	1517	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	As I have discussed here before, our Chicago DSGE model also uses the SPF 10-year CPI expectations to inform its latent inflation trend.	13	1
201509	1518	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The declines in those long-term CPI expectations over the past year and a half as well as other data keep the model’s core PCE inflation forecast down at only 1½ percent in 2018.	13	1
201509	1519	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In a somewhat similar vein, the Board staff’s long-run inflation attractor is currently anchored at 1.8 percent rather than 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1520	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I still find that worrisome.	13	1
201509	1521	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Taken together, these results highlight that current survey inflation expectations could be less helpful than we think, and, to the degree that they are less helpful, any slippage in long-term inflation expectations could put our inflation forecast at even greater risk.	13	1
201509	1522	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	An important ingredient in my SEP forecast is that we avoid such slippage, and that we instead have long-term expectations that are firmly anchored at our inflation target.	13	1
201509	1523	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	It is crucial, then, that the public’s inflation expectations be well supported by monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1524	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In my SEP forecast, long-term inflation expectations are anchored by a policy rate path that aggressively aims to achieve our symmetric inflation target and is not overly averse to inflation outcomes that run moderately above 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1525	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Given what we know today, in my SEP forecast such a policy is consistent with a mid-2016 liftoff in the funds rate and a subsequent shallow path that reaches 3 percent by the end of 2018.	13	1
201509	1526	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	My premise is that it will be the middle of next year before we and the public finally see core inflation moving up more consistently.	13	1
201509	1527	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	By then, I hope we will also have experienced a few months of relative quiet on the energy and dollar front.	13	1
201509	1528	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	This delayed liftoff also provides some extra buffer against important downside risks to the outlook.	13	1
201509	1529	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1530	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1531	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201509	1532	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1533	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The Tenth District economy expanded only modestly since the previous meeting, as weakness in commodity prices and a stronger dollar continue to weigh on the region’s energy, agriculture, and manufacturing industries.	13	1
201509	1534	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, District bankers are monitoring closely their loan portfolios and reviewing collateral values.	13	1
201509	1535	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Our business contacts continue to note difficulty finding qualified labor, and with this, along with the headwinds in the agricultural and energy sectors, we are seeing slowing in employment growth throughout much of the District.	13	1
201509	1536	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national outlook, since our July meeting, the recent revisions in incoming data have led me to slightly raise my overall expectations of 2015 growth.	13	1
201509	1537	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	After expanding only modestly in the first quarter, output growth bounced back significantly in the second quarter.	13	1
201509	1538	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I expect more modest growth in the third and fourth quarters that is sufficient to push 2015 growth to 2.1 percent, which is about 0.3 percent higher than my previous forecast.	13	1
201509	1539	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	And although I see current growth as somewhat above trend, I did mark down my longer-term estimate of growth to 1.8 percent, incorporating some of the soft productivity readings and recognizing the demographic factors pulling trend growth lower over the next several years.	13	1
201509	1540	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Labor market indicators, as others have noted, continue to signal further improvement and a return, in many cases, to pre-crisis characteristics.	13	1
201509	1541	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The NFIB survey, for example, reported almost half of its respondents as seeing few or no qualified applicants for job openings, and that almost 30 percent of businesses are not able to fill some positions.	13	1
201509	1542	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Both of these indicators are above their July 2007 levels and consistent with reports from our District contacts.	13	1
201509	1543	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Likewise, the number of unemployed people per job opening is near its pre-crisis level.	13	1
201509	1544	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	And if you consider the pool of unemployed workers plus people who want a job but are not in the labor force, that measure is also near its pre-crisis level.	13	1
201509	1545	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	These factors not only point to ongoing labor market improvement, but also support expectations of stronger wage growth.	13	1
201509	1546	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Given projected growth and labor market advances, I continue to see reasonable evidence that inflation will rise over the next few years toward 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1547	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have softened, both the median CPI and PCE survey-based five-year, five-year forward measures of expected inflation rose slightly in the most recent SPF.	13	1
201509	1548	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Over the past six months, core PCE inflation has been running at 1.7 percent, compared with a 0.8 percent pace last January.	13	1
201509	1549	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I also find it encouraging that over the past six months, the trend in the broad components of the PCE price index appear to have shifted.	13	1
201509	1550	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	For example, in February, the services component was running at 1.6 percent, its softest six-month pace since 2011.	13	1
201509	1551	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Most recently, the annualized six-month change is 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1552	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The patterns are similar for durables and nondurables.	13	1
201509	1553	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	In general, there is a distinct bottom based on the six-month change in inflation since last January.	13	1
201509	1554	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Since that time, the broad components of core PCE inflation have all moved higher.	13	1
201509	1555	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the BEA revised up inflation in 2012 and 2013 by about ¼ percentage point each year, which means that the price level is about ½ percent higher than we thought it was at the time of our July meeting.	13	1
201509	1556	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of emergent risk, the recent concerns regarding global growth are worth keeping in mind.	13	1
201509	1557	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The downward trend in the New Export Orders Index from the ISM manufacturing survey suggests exporters are facing real headwinds.	13	1
201509	1558	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, I have taken a bit softer export growth into my baseline forecast.	13	1
201509	1559	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Concerns about global growth have also spilled into financial markets, as is evident from the recent stock market volatility.	13	1
201509	1560	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Markets have priced in some headwinds through lower equity prices, although not enough to cause me to alter my forecast for consumer spending.	13	1
201509	1561	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, the VIX is already back to what can be considered a relatively normal range, so any knock-on effects to the real economy from the recent bout of market volatility are likely to be rather modest.	13	1
201509	1562	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1563	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1564	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201509	1565	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1566	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before I go into my prepared remarks, I will offer a brief comment on remarks that others have made.	13	1
201509	1567	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought President Bullard offered some great perspectives on how financial market data should be influencing this Committee.	13	1
201509	1568	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it is important that we use financial market data only as a signal of the underlying real conditions and not as a driver of policy itself, which I took to be his admonition.	13	1
201509	1569	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The one point on which my perspective might diverge most sharply from his is on interpreting the behavior of market-based measures of inflation compensation—or inflation expectations, I would say.	13	1
201509	1570	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I continue to be quite concerned about the downward movement there.	13	1
201509	1571	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It certainly influenced my Summary of Economic Projections submission.	13	1
201509	1572	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some of you might have noticed that I am number 13, and I offered a negative funds rate as being appropriate monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1573	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think, in view of the decline we have seen in longer-term inflation expectations, this is an appropriate response.	13	1
201509	1574	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Obviously, the consensus of the Committee is to view this decline with sanguinity.	13	1
201509	1575	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I hope that that turns out to be the correct attitude.	13	1
201509	1576	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of the flight-to-quality issue, one way to get rid of that issue that President Mester noted is in Treasury breakevens is to look at zero-coupon inflation swaps, which are not contaminated by that.	13	1
201509	1577	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Zero-coupon inflation swaps are also showing that same downward movement, really going back at least a year, possibly a year and a half.	13	1
201509	1578	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think these are, at least to me, markers of real concern to take from financial market data.	13	1
201509	1579	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, Madam Chair, for the rest of my time, I really ask for the indulgence of the Committee, as I intend to spend my time today in a somewhat unorthodox fashion.	13	1
201509	1580	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And for the benefit of Presidents Kaplan and Harker, I advise you don’t try this at home.	13	1
201509	1581	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201509	1582	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather than speaking about the current state—	13	1
201509	1583	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, if they are going to do it, they should do it at home.	13	1
201509	1584	2015-09-17	meeting		[Laughter]	13	1
201509	1585	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Perhaps a better point, Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201509	1586	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather than speaking about the current state of the economy, I will offer some thoughts about the strategic framework that guides the Committee’s policy decisions.	13	1
201509	1587	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This framework will inform the Committee’s decisions about liftoff but, of course, will also inform the long sequence of decisions to be made after liftoff.	13	1
201509	1588	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Governor Fischer has made the point several times that, really, it’s not just liftoff that we have to think about, it’s also the framing of the decisions afterward that really matters.	13	1
201509	1589	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, currently, the Committee has said relatively little publicly about what its policy framework will be.	13	1
201509	1590	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This state of affairs has some obvious downsides in terms of creating policy uncertainty, but there is a silver lining in this cloud of uncertainty.	13	1
201509	1591	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee has room to choose the desirable policy framework without being seen as having violated prior commitments of some kind.	13	1
201509	1592	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My sense from the internal discussions here is that there is a strong desire to return to the “normal” policy framework that was employed during the Great Moderation.	13	1
201509	1593	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My sense, too, is that the Committee’s unwillingness to communicate openly about its post-liftoff framework tends to foster this perception among outsiders that we are going to go back to the way business was conducted before 2008.	13	1
201509	1594	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am going to suggest over the next couple of days that this would be a mistake.	13	1
201509	1595	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, a good policy framework should automatically engender something that approximates a desirable monetary policy response to severe shocks like the one that hit the economy in 2008.	13	1
201509	1596	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our pre-2008 policy framework failed in this dimension.	13	1
201509	1597	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It led the Committee to deliberately promulgate persistent shortfalls in prices and employment.	13	1
201509	1598	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What I’ll do today is point out what I see as being the key conceptual flaw in the pre-2008 framework, and tomorrow I will suggest what I see as a better framework and describe what that better framework would imply for current decisions.	13	1
201509	1599	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To understand my criticism of the pre-2008 framework, it’s useful to go back to the November 2009 meeting, which was the very beginning of the recovery.	13	1
201509	1600	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At that meeting, the latest unemployment reading was 9.8 percent and the staff’s nowcast for core inflation was 1.4 percent.	13	1
201509	1601	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The median participant’s assessment was that, under appropriate monetary policy, the unemployment rate would still be 7 percent in three years.	13	1
201509	1602	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the same time, the median participant’s assessment was that, under appropriate monetary policy, PCE inflation would only rise back to 1½ percent three years later.	13	1
201509	1603	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, three years later, we had unemployment at 7 percent and inflation at 1½ percent.	13	1
201509	1604	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I was reading these numbers, I found them quite surprising.	13	1
201509	1605	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can draw one of two conclusions from them.	13	1
201509	1606	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the one hand, you can say that the Committee was willing, in November 2009, to forgo the timely creation of hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of jobs in the absence of any inflationary threat that was perceived by the Committee.	13	1
201509	1607	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, you can focus only on the price-stability mandate and say that monetary policy can’t do much about unemployment.	13	1
201509	1608	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is a view that has been expressed around this table before.	13	1
201509	1609	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Or, you can focus only on the price stability mandate and say that the Committee was willing to make policy choices and put the credibility of its then-informal 2 percent target in jeopardy.	13	1
201509	1610	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However you put it, it is hard to understand these projections—7 percent unemployment and 1½ percent inflation three years later—as representing the outcome of appropriate monetary policy.	13	1
201509	1611	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why did the Committee view such a persistent and extreme shortfall with respect to its objectives as being appropriate?	13	1
201509	1612	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A quick side note:  Labor market recovery actually turned out to be much worse than that.	13	1
201509	1613	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Unemployment was 7.8 percent three years later, and labor force participation declined much more than the Committee anticipated—or anyone else anticipated, for that matter.	13	1
201509	1614	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Inflation ended up being around what the Committee viewed as being desirable—thanks, I think, in no little part, to choices made by the Committee.	13	1
201509	1615	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But why did the Committee, in November 2009, view such a persistent extreme shortfall with respect to its objectives as being appropriate?	13	1
201509	1616	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The answer, I believe, lies in the pre-2008 policy framework, which centered on variants of the Taylor (1993) rule.	13	1
201509	1617	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And this framework continues to live on in the collection of interest rate rules that we see in Tealbook B.	13	1
201509	1618	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In my view, all of these rules have a key conceptual shortcoming.	13	1
201509	1619	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee has a dual mandate, which is to promote price stability and maximum employment.	13	1
201509	1620	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Taylor rules are based on the presumption that the Committee has other objectives in terms of the time path of interest rates that are independent of the objectives for employment and prices.	13	1
201509	1621	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The original Taylor (1993) rule implicitly presumes that the Committee does not like interest rate gaps.	13	1
201509	1622	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The FOMC desires to keep the federal funds rate close to its long-run level.	13	1
201509	1623	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The rule then trades off the Committee’s unmandated aversion to interest rate gaps against its mandated aversion to unemployment and inflation gaps.	13	1
201509	1624	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Otherwise, if you saw unemployment and inflation gaps going in the same direction—unemployment too high, inflation too low—you should just lower rates some more.	13	1
201509	1625	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the Taylor rule says, wait a second, you shouldn’t be doing that, because actually you don’t want to move interest rates around too much.	13	1
201509	1626	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The way that the Taylor rule resolves this tradeoff—interest rate volatility and gap volatility—especially when the Phillips curve is as flat as it’s proven to be, can result in very odd outcomes.	13	1
201509	1627	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, in November 2009, the staff’s outlook was based on the Taylor (1993) rule.	13	1
201509	1628	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That outlook had unemployment above the natural rate for four years and inflation at or below 1.6 percent for five years.	13	1
201509	1629	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We didn’t get to see the staff outlook beyond a five-year horizon, so I don’t have any sense of when it ever got back to 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1630	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My reading of the transcript, in terms of participants’ contributions, is that aversion to accommodation, as opposed to inflation or unemployment, was really at the heart of that discussion.	13	1
201509	1631	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The big debate at that meeting was, should we plan to raise rates when the unemployment rate is in the 9s or in the 8s?	13	1
201509	1632	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Summary of Economic Projections shows that the key motivating factor for this debate was not really inflation.	13	1
201509	1633	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather, it was the Committee’s willingness to give up on its dual-mandate goals in order to get back to normalizing policy more rapidly.	13	1
201509	1634	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, the Federal Reserve did such a heroic job of successfully healing extraordinary financial market turmoil in the latter part of the past decade.	13	1
201509	1635	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But our monetary policy response was not as successful.	13	1
201509	1636	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I attribute this to the Committee’s policy framework, which deliberately directed the economy toward relatively persistent large employment and inflation shortfalls.	13	1
201509	1637	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we need to have a policy framework that works considerably better in the face of adverse shocks than we had available in November 2009.	13	1
201509	1638	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have argued today that shortcomings of our pre-2008 framework can be traced to its reliance on variants of the Taylor rule.	13	1
201509	1639	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These rules implicitly impose a large penalty on historically unusual settings of the federal funds rate and other forms of accommodation.	13	1
201509	1640	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We need to have a policy framework that is much less averse to an unusual use of our tools as opposed to achieving our objectives.	13	1
201509	1641	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tomorrow I will talk about such a framework and some of its implications for our current decisionmaking.	13	1
201509	1642	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1643	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1644	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201509	1645	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1646	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Just going back to President Kocherlakota’s comments, I don’t remember November 2009 quite that way.	13	1
201509	1647	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Just for the record, we didn’t have tools at the time that could generate a more rapid return, and we were gradually inventing them.	13	1
201509	1648	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had already cut the funds rate target to zero.	13	1
201509	1649	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We had already engaged in some asset purchases.	13	1
201509	1650	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The way I remember it, I think it’s fair to say, it took a while before we decided we could and should really scale up our asset purchases—	13	1
201509	1651	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	13	1
201509	1652	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We learned by doing.	13	1
201509	1653	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	—yes—and use more unconventional forms of forward guidance that would push expectations way out.	13	1
201509	1654	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Our toolkit today has a much better, deeper set of tools to help us achieve our objectives than the one we had in November 2009 did.	13	1
201509	1655	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I remember that, at the time, we were very uncomfortable with actually buying Treasury securities.	13	1
201509	1656	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And the initial Treasury purchase program was quite small, if I remember correctly, because we weren’t even sure how markets were going to react to that purchase program and whether we were actually going to get the desired effect in terms of financial market conditions.	13	1
201509	1657	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But anyway—	13	1
201509	1658	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a great conversation.	13	1
201509	1659	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should continue it—	13	1
201509	1660	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We can take it offline.	13	1
201509	1661	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will say that the framework the Committee had in place shaped the way market participants were thinking about when interest rates would rise.	13	1
201509	1662	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A lot of the surveys, for example, done by the Open Market Desk had a number of primary dealers seeing interest rates going up when the unemployment rate was still in the 9s.	13	1
201509	1663	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There were tools that were under our control and at our disposal.	13	1
201509	1664	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think this is certainly something we can talk about over drinks.	13	1
201509	1665	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And beyond.	13	1
201509	1666	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	13	1
201509	1667	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Over many drinks.	13	1
201509	1668	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	13	1
201509	1669	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Switching gears, as far as I’m concerned, the economy has been on essentially the same trajectory now that it has been on for some time, growth slightly above trend and sufficient to lead to a gradual tightening in the labor market.	13	1
201509	1670	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the key question is whether this is going to continue.	13	1
201509	1671	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the key sectors of the economy, I agree with others.	13	1
201509	1672	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Consumer spending seems to have relatively firm underpinnings because it has solid job gains and low inflation, and the inflation shocks actually are boosting real income.	13	1
201509	1673	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The housing sector also seems to be a positive, with activity encouraged by strengthening sales and rising prices.	13	1
201509	1674	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Sturdy job gains and low mortgage rates have provided, I think, significant support for the sector, and I certainly expect the housing sector to continue to recover over the year ahead.	13	1
201509	1675	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Nevertheless, I do think there are risks in terms of growth, and I think they’ve very much swung to the downside.	13	1
201509	1676	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Despite what I think is a relatively sturdy second-quarter GDP report, I believe the economy has somewhat less forward momentum than maybe some others around the table think, and, most significantly, I think the risks around that baseline outlook are tilted to the downside.	13	1
201509	1677	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning to the economic growth outlook, I think there are a number of reasons for concern.	13	1
201509	1678	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Most importantly, we do have a quite dicey international situation, with growth slowing in China and commodity prices weakening broadly, and I think this is putting considerable strain on a wide array of emerging market economies.	13	1
201509	1679	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, last week we had the downgrade of Brazil’s sovereign debt rating to junk bond status by S&P.	13	1
201509	1680	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So we’ll see how that actually plays out.	13	1
201509	1681	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think generally what’s happening is that we’re undergoing a pretty significant regime shift from a few years ago when strong Chinese demand was keeping commodity prices well above the marginal cost of new production.	13	1
201509	1682	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The result was a very favorable terms-of-trade shift for many EMEs that are commodity producers and a very strong impetus to investment in those countries.	13	1
201509	1683	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, all of that has been reversing, and I think the risks are that the consequences for global growth could turn out to be stronger and longer lasting than we’d expected.	13	1
201509	1684	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The terms-of-trade reversal we’ve already seen is leading to a sharp slowdown in EME growth, currency weakness, a deterioration in many countries’ fiscal positions, and significant political stress.	13	1
201509	1685	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is a nonnegligible risk of an unfavorable dynamic that could persist for some time.	13	1
201509	1686	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So let me just sketch this out.	13	1
201509	1687	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not saying this is going to happen, I just think there’s some probability mass on this outcome.	13	1
201509	1688	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Weakness in commodity prices leads to further stress on many EMEs.	13	1
201509	1689	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That leads to corporate difficulties, which we haven’t seen much of yet, further capital flight, and further currency weakness.	13	1
201509	1690	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	For us, it means that dollar strength persists, and this erodes our own growth momentum and puts further downward pressure on inflation.	13	1
201509	1691	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the strong dollar increases the stress on EME corporates that have significant dollar-denominated debt exposure.	13	1
201509	1692	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The stronger dollar also squeezes US profit margins, leading to weaker corporate earnings and a softer US equity market.	13	1
201509	1693	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	US financial conditions keep tightening.	13	1
201509	1694	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know how much weight to put on this scenario, but what I think is interesting about this scenario is that it has several important reinforcing feedback loops.	13	1
201509	1695	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We saw in the financial crisis that that’s how you can get pretty bad outcomes.	13	1
201509	1696	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that the risks here are not zero.	13	1
201509	1697	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	When we went around the table, a lot of people were just saying, “There’s stuff going on in the markets.”	13	1
201509	1698	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the markets are reflecting fundamental developments that are occurring in the global economy, and as a consequence of that, I take those financial market developments more seriously.	13	1
201509	1699	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial conditions have already tightened significantly as the dollar has appreciated on a broad trade-weighted basis, and the US equity market has weakened.	13	1
201509	1700	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I, like others, don’t put much weight on the equity market decline yet because it hasn’t been in place for very long, but the dollar strength has been persistent and does threaten to undermine US net exports.	13	1
201509	1701	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m particularly struck by the weakness of the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso versus the US dollar because we generally think that those countries have pretty good economic policy and institutional structures.	13	1
201509	1702	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet currently the Canadian dollar trades at 1.32 per US dollar; a year ago it was at 1.10.	13	1
201509	1703	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The same for the Mexican peso, which has depreciated about 30 percent over the past year and nearly 10 percent over the past three months.	13	1
201509	1704	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	These are two major US trading partners whose currency has moved a lot, and I don’t think we’ve really seen the consequences of that in terms of our trade.	13	1
201509	1705	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, apart from international developments, I think there are other reasons to be concerned about the growth outlook.	13	1
201509	1706	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So let’s just set aside the international stuff for a minute.	13	1
201509	1707	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, job gains have been strong relative to the underlying growth trajectory.	13	1
201509	1708	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	People have said, “Well, that’s just going to continue.”	13	1
201509	1709	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not obvious to me that that would continue because one thing that is happening is, profit growth is really slowing down.	13	1
201509	1710	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	And we’ve heard that a number of corporations are now really looking at how they are going to raise earnings, and maybe they’re going to have to start being tougher and begin to think about downsizing.	13	1
201509	1711	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I think we’ve had a pretty significant climb in inventory investment, and that provided a significant contribution to growth in the first half of the year.	13	1
201509	1712	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In the second quarter, the real nonfarm inventory build was almost $120 billion at an annual rate.	13	1
201509	1713	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s probably more than double what’s sustainable over the longer term.	13	1
201509	1714	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, earlier this year, we were talking about how the household savings rate seemed high relative to what was implied by the historical relationship between household net worth and disposable income.	13	1
201509	1715	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That was making us feel more optimistic about consumption, that consumption could grow faster than income for a time because the household savings rate was high.	13	1
201509	1716	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But after revisions, it doesn’t look high anymore.	13	1
201509	1717	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re back at 4.8 percent of disposable income.	13	1
201509	1718	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the same level we saw in 2013 and 2014, so I don’t think we have so much support from that.	13	1
201509	1719	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, with the exception of the softness in commodity prices, I also don’t think the situation has changed much, and I don’t think it is particularly worrisome as long as the economy continues to grow at an above-trend pace.	13	1
201509	1720	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If you could guarantee that the economy was going to grow at an above-trend pace, I wouldn’t be that worried about the inflation outlook, but because I’m worried about the strength of US growth, that does make me worry about the mechanism that’s going to push inflation back up toward our objective.	13	1
201509	1721	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is that, despite falling energy prices and weaker import prices, the trend for core inflation has flattened out.	13	1
201509	1722	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggests to me that if growth does remain above trend, then the low inflation problem will take care of itself.	13	1
201509	1723	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, the fact that nominal wage growth has not picked up yet implies that we still, in my mind, have excess slack in the labor market.	13	1
201509	1724	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Combined with the sluggish growth trend and the downside risk to growth threatened by international developments, this suggests to me that the costs of waiting, in terms of beginning monetary policy normalization, are pretty low right now.	13	1
201509	1725	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	My preference would be to wait a bit longer so we can better assess the consequences of developments in China and among the EMEs in terms of the implications regarding US growth and inflation.	13	1
201509	1726	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, the risks around liftoff right now are asymmetric.	13	1
201509	1727	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If we go now and the international market developments prove to be of sufficient intensity to deflect the US economy away from our objectives, the cost could be quite high to us.	13	1
201509	1728	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Conversely, if we wait a little bit longer and the effect turns out to be insignificant, then we can go before year-end, and I don’t really think we give up much in terms of our ability to achieve our objectives.	13	1
201509	1729	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Speaking for myself, I won’t feel particularly bad if we waited and then it turns out everything is fine.	13	1
201509	1730	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think I’ll feel pretty good about that.	13	1
201509	1731	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1732	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1733	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201509	1734	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1735	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	My views about the likely trajectories of economic activity and inflation are not very different from the views I held in July.	13	1
201509	1736	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I believed then that we were closing in on full employment, and I believe that is even more true today.	13	1
201509	1737	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And I said then that I was reasonably confident that inflation would move back toward 2 percent in the not-too-distant future, and that is still my view.	13	1
201509	1738	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	However, like most of you, I’ve become more concerned about the situation abroad over the past several weeks, and this leads me to attach more downside risk to my projection than I would have done at our previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1739	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The effect of foreign developments has been reasonably small so far, though, of course, these developments may well take longer to affect us than the short period since China’s exchange rate adjustment, and we shall simply have to keep monitoring these developments.	13	1
201509	1740	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	There has been a lot of discussion about inflation over the intermeeting period and during this meeting so far.	13	1
201509	1741	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is no surprise, considering that this is the part of our mandate on which we are most obviously missing our target, and so I’d like to focus the remainder of my remarks today on inflation.	13	1
201509	1742	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Many discussions of inflation start with the 12-month core PCE inflation rate, which is currently 1.2 percent and projected to be 1.3 percent by the end of the year, although total PCE inflation is projected to be only 0.3 percent at that time.	13	1
201509	1743	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The main reason for the 1 percentage point difference between the core and the total rates of PCE inflation arises from the recent declines in oil prices, which are expected to be temporary.	13	1
201509	1744	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	However, changes in oil prices have an effect on PCE prices that goes beyond the prices that are excluded by using the core PCE inflation rate.	13	1
201509	1745	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Oil prices affect the cost of production of many goods.	13	1
201509	1746	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Moreover, the appreciation of the dollar has direct effects on the prices of many goods.	13	1
201509	1747	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The additional effect of recent changes in oil and import prices on the inflation rate— over and above what’s picked up in food and energy prices—is estimated by staff at approximately 0.4 percentage point this year.	13	1
201509	1748	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Accordingly, we can conclude that the declines in oil and import prices together have reduced the overall inflation rate by approximately 1.4 percentage points.	13	1
201509	1749	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	More-rigorous methods of stripping out the transitory factors, such as using the Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE or a weighted median PCE price index and other measures, yield a reasonably similar conclusion on balance.	13	1
201509	1750	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But regardless of the exact figure we use, I think that a good portion of the factors holding down underlying inflation are transitory, the result of changes in oil and other commodity prices and of the exchange rate.	13	1
201509	1751	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If the exchange rate stops appreciating, and that is highly likely, its downward pressure on core inflation will gradually stop.	13	1
201509	1752	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, if the price of oil eventually stops decreasing, its drag on core inflation will also abate.	13	1
201509	1753	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Although it’s difficult to predict when the exchange rate and the price of oil will stop rising and falling, respectively, it is almost certain that current trends in these two variables will stop in the medium term.	13	1
201509	1754	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	As a result, I am reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward 2 percent in the medium term.	13	1
201509	1755	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I leave the rest for tomorrow, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1756	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1757	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1758	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201509	1759	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1760	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Like, I think, most of you, no matter your disposition on monetary policy, I haven’t changed my baseline outlook very much over the course of the past six or seven weeks.	13	1
201509	1761	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But as Vice Chairman Dudley explained a couple of minutes ago, the downside risks are palpably greater than they were, even though, in July, I and people to my left—I don’t mean ideologically, I mean geographically [laughter]—were also concerned about potential downside risks.	13	1
201509	1762	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I would embrace everything Vice Chairman Dudley said and just add one other piece of information here.	13	1
201509	1763	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think if it had just been US equity markets going down, even if it had gone down 6 percent over the day rather than 3 percent, I truly would have taken no notice of that, particularly after a long period of appreciation of equity markets.	13	1
201509	1764	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And even if it had just been China’s equity markets in isolation, I wouldn’t have taken too much signal from that.	13	1
201509	1765	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s a combination of what have long been known to be building concerns with the amount of leverage and credit in China in the background as Chinese officials responded in a less-than-fully- considered fashion to what was going on with the correction in the job market.	13	1
201509	1766	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And I believe the reason they responded in a less-than-fully-considered fashion was not because they’re bad or uninformed or inept policymakers.	13	1
201509	1767	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	To the contrary, they’re really quite good at what they do, but it’s a difficult situation, and whenever you’re in a difficult situation, there are no great policy options.	13	1
201509	1768	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	My impression is that the thing that worries Chinese officials most in the near term is the amount of margining that lies behind a lot of those holdings in equity markets, and the margining is connected very directly to the amount of credit extended through the shadow banking system.	13	1
201509	1769	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think what is less fully realized is how closely that connects to the regular regulated banking system as well in China.	13	1
201509	1770	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I read the concern with putting a floor under Chinese equities to be indicative of the level of concern with the state of credit and leverage throughout the Chinese economy right now.	13	1
201509	1771	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously my impression is based on incomplete information and selected contact, but the impression I have is that if the decline in Chinese equity markets was to renew and continue for a while, there would, notwithstanding the concerns and the failures last time around, be some sort of effort to put another floor under it because there’s going to be another point at which the amount of potential losses are such as to provide more-direct risks to the banking system.	13	1
201509	1772	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So, I think, as Bill was suggesting, it’s what lies behind both the market movements and the policy responses and some of the policy uncertainty about the market movements that suggests potential for longer-term problems.	13	1
201509	1773	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, like Vice Chairman Dudley, I think we really don’t know how this will play out.	13	1
201509	1774	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think it’s almost certain that over the next several years, China is going to have challenges, but whether those challenges translate into the somewhat lower growth hypothesized by the Board staff or something a little more disruptive, we just don’t know.	13	1
201509	1775	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I want to spend the rest of my time on labor markets, and having made a joke about what Narayana is doing, I’m going to proceed to do something not dissimilar, which is to try to give a bit of perspective on how we’ve been assessing labor markets, not monetary policy as a whole.	13	1
201509	1776	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	There is a lot of talk within this room, by many of you outside this room, and by many other people about how we are close to or at fill-in-the-blank:  the natural rate, full employment, maximum employment, whatever it may be.	13	1
201509	1777	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And what I want to know is, how do people know this?	13	1
201509	1778	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, it is tautological to say that we’re closer to full employment, maximum employment, the natural rate, than we were at the July meeting and the June meeting and the meetings before that because, during this period, unemployment has been going down and job creation has been such that we’re creating more jobs than the number of entrants into the labor market.	13	1
201509	1779	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Almost tautologically, we are closer.	13	1
201509	1780	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But how much closer are we, and how do we know how much slack remains?	13	1
201509	1781	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Conventionally, the way in which we collectively made judgments about labor market tightness or getting to the natural rate or getting to the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment was by looking at prices or, oftentimes, actually, more directly at wages, which were thought to be a leading indicator of prices.	13	1
201509	1782	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Remember that the “I” in NAIRU stands for inflation, and that was where we and other analysts were trying to make that connection.	13	1
201509	1783	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I didn’t count, but six or seven of you referred to wage pressures being reported from your Districts.	13	1
201509	1784	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I have to say, a number of presidents have been reporting wage pressures from their Districts for some years now, and I take it to be the case that the number of you now talking about it suggests that we may be closer to the point at which wage pressures start translating into the data.	13	1
201509	1785	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But as of this moment, they really haven’t translated into the data as a whole.	13	1
201509	1786	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That, of course, is a reminder of what people have also commented on, which is that the Phillips curve broke down as a predictor of what would happen to inflation based on unemployment well before the crisis and the recession, during a period in which labor markets were changing significantly in what quite likely seems to have been a secular, rather than a purely cyclical, fashion.	13	1
201509	1787	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, people, including the people around this table and their staffs, have subsequently made efforts to assess labor market tightness based on some set of past relationships, but to date I don’t think these relationships really panned out as particularly robust.	13	1
201509	1788	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not the fault of anybody.	13	1
201509	1789	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think anybody knows what those relationships are now.	13	1
201509	1790	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	A few years ago around this table, I remember people were talking about how the persistence of the rightward shift in the Beveridge curve showed that there was structural unemployment and, therefore, the natural rate must be higher, and we were all of a sudden going to begin seeing wage inflation.	13	1
201509	1791	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That didn’t happen, right?	13	1
201509	1792	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Remember there was a suggestion a couple of years ago that since short-term unemployment rates were now back to pre-recession levels, we were functionally getting close to the natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201509	1793	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It was a good try, but that one didn’t work out either.	13	1
201509	1794	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams has just suggested another approach—to use demographics and try to project where the “natural rate” would lie.	13	1
201509	1795	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I think if you disconnect the concept of the natural rate of unemployment from at least wage inflation, if not price inflation, then the whole concept actually gets more than a little bit squishy, because what is it that we’re talking about now?	13	1
201509	1796	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Are we talking about “satisficing” unemployment?	13	1
201509	1797	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Do we think it’s good enough, it’s low enough?	13	1
201509	1798	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think we’re not actually any longer in the realm of doing analysis, but instead acting on some intuition.	13	1
201509	1799	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Just because U-3 is toward the low end of where it has been over the course of the past couple of decades doesn’t tell us much.	13	1
201509	1800	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe it’s temporarily lower now because of elevated part-time employment for economic reasons and the lower-than-trend labor participation ratio.	13	1
201509	1801	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe not.	13	1
201509	1802	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	For me, this dilemma—and I mean to project it as a dilemma rather than people being wrong, because we’re all wrong, in a sense, because nobody actually has a convincing set of explanations.	13	1
201509	1803	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But for me, it was crystallized in the staff briefing to the Board at yesterday’s meeting when I noticed that the projected path of wages over the next couple of years was rising, and the explanation given in the briefing was not principally because of labor market tightness, but because productivity gains would be passed through and inflation would pull up wages.	13	1
201509	1804	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, I asked about the productivity gains issue because, I think my understanding is that productivity gains matter for how much wages can go up over the medium-to-long term, but in the short term, wages really should be about the supply and demand of labor rather than near- term productivity increases.	13	1
201509	1805	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But even so, productivity gains clearly haven’t been passed through in anything like one-to-one or even 50 percent fashion in recent years.	13	1
201509	1806	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	They might be at some point, but it’s a little hard to predict.	13	1
201509	1807	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Then, what about inflation?	13	1
201509	1808	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Well, where did the inflation come from that was going to pull up wages?	13	1
201509	1809	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It came from inflation expectations, and we’re back, as David Wilcox noted a little earlier this afternoon, into a reliance on a mechanism that we don’t completely understand, and what we really don’t understand is how those expectations change.	13	1
201509	1810	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	They seem to have worked, and I think the reason the staff has hit upon the approach they’ve taken is, they’ve found some things that had been working reasonably well over the past five or six years.	13	1
201509	1811	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Assuming anchored expectations and assuming that the now-low productivity gains will get passed through seems to be working, but not because there’s a theory regarding why this is all working this way.	13	1
201509	1812	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Instead, it just kind of seems to be working.	13	1
201509	1813	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, in the absence of anything better, that’s what we’re going to use.	13	1
201509	1814	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	As is almost always the case, I admired the staff’s straightforwardness in explaining what they knew and what they didn’t know, and why they were doing what they did.	13	1
201509	1815	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But in the absence of that theoretical understanding that comports with empirically observed facts, we’re left not knowing whether we’re just in an extended period of reversion to a certain set of correlations and causal relationships that existed for a long enough time to produce a bunch of economic laws and curves that then find their way into people’s textbooks, or whether the changes that have been noticed in labor markets over the past 15 to 20 years have now cumulatively created a new set of correlations and causal relationships that are nontransitory and that we don’t fully understand.	13	1
201509	1816	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And, President Williams, the Board research paper that you referred to by Andrew and David is another effort to get into that.	13	1
201509	1817	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think you were slightly unfair because I think you were referring to the aggregate data and they made a big point of trying to disaggregate the data.	13	1
201509	1818	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think anybody thinks you can figure out much from the aggregate data.	13	1
201509	1819	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But even if we abstract from that, they’re being very tentative, as I think everybody has to be right now.	13	1
201509	1820	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So, this level of uncertainty, as I’ve said before, about even the theories on which we’re operating, seems to me to argue for more than the normal amount of doubt about the reliability of forecasting based on past observed relationships, particularly medium-term forecasting.	13	1
201509	1821	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And I cannot resist this.	13	1
201509	1822	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I pulled out the September 2014 SEP.	13	1
201509	1823	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	With the exceptions of Presidents Harker and Kaplan—who weren’t here—everybody around this table was wrong, and we were all wrong in the same direction on both inflation and unemployment for 2015.	13	1
201509	1824	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We all projected unemployment as being higher than it actually is, and we all projected inflation as being higher than it actually is.	13	1
201509	1825	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And that was just a year ago.	13	1
201509	1826	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And I suspect, again, it’s because of the difficulty of reading what’s going on now, and to me that suggests reliance on a more pragmatic policy approach, which is a little bit more—sorry, Jim and Esther—a little bit more of a show-me approach.	13	1
201509	1827	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I actually want to see some hard data before acquiring reasonable confidence in the direction in which we’re going and a little bit more skepticism about projecting what will happen based on past observed relationships.	13	1
201509	1828	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Let me end by saying that I honestly do not mean this to be an argument of “low rates forever because of uncertainty.”	13	1
201509	1829	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We saw an example just this morning in the United Kingdom.	13	1
201509	1830	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	After a period of growth being noticeably above trend, their wage report was really quite strong.	13	1
201509	1831	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We would love to be getting a 2.9 percent wage report like that, and it may be that the kind of pressures that more of you are now hearing about anecdotally will translate into that in the not- too-distant future, in which case I think we can all feel more confident about the fact that we really are getting somewhat closer to a meaningful concept of the natural rate.	13	1
201509	1832	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think that the reliance on past correlations is something that can lead us astray in a period that has, maybe only temporarily but certainly for a while, really disrupted a lot of those correlations.	13	1
201509	1833	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1834	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1835	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201509	1836	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1837	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I used to succeed Jeremy Stein in these events, as most of you will remember, and in many cases I would think, you know, I’d really rather think about what Jeremy just said than read my remarks.	13	1
201509	1838	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And I sort of feel that way now.	13	1
201509	1839	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Dan has raised some very thoughtful points, which will take me some time to digest.	13	1
201509	1840	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Anyway, domestic developments since the July meeting have been mixed but positive on balance.	13	1
201509	1841	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Abroad there are increased risks of a global slowdown that could create headwinds for US growth and inflation, and, in particular, we face tighter financial conditions here in the United States in the form of a stronger dollar and lower equity prices, among other factors.	13	1
201509	1842	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Governor Tarullo made this point, and I was going to make it tomorrow, but I’ll just echo it today, which is that this really has nothing to do with a drop in the US stock market.	13	1
201509	1843	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I have been a stock market investor for a long time.	13	1
201509	1844	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I would say that a 7 percent stock market decline after a very long period of expansion would mean just about literally nothing for the US economy.	13	1
201509	1845	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	This is about a story of a plausible tail risk, or maybe more than a tail risk, of a global economic slowdown.	13	1
201509	1846	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	There is nothing about an equity put.	13	1
201509	1847	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And to the extent there is any confusion, our communication should be clear publicly on that.	13	1
201509	1848	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Data on the real economy have come in better than expected.	13	1
201509	1849	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Payroll growth has been strong.	13	1
201509	1850	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Unemployment has declined faster than the staff forecast.	13	1
201509	1851	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	First-half GDP was revised up by 1 full percentage point since the previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1852	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Inflation has come in about as anticipated, but it is likely to be held down at least for a while by the stronger dollar and the additional decline in oil prices.	13	1
201509	1853	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Looking forward, the tighter economy should move inflation higher in the medium term, but for now inflation is both below mandate and declining—a situation that complicates the setting for our policy decision, as I will discuss tomorrow.	13	1
201509	1854	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Wages and compensation have continued on their path of 2 percent growth or a little better, disappointing hopes, including my own, that they would be moving to a higher plane.	13	1
201509	1855	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	However, with very low inflation and trend productivity, real unit labor costs have actually been rising modestly—rising about as fast as they were before the crisis and as fast as they have for a long time.	13	1
201509	1856	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And employers may be taking the view for now that the current wage increases fully compensate workers for their real marginal product.	13	1
201509	1857	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Now, a real employer would never use those words, but it’s not hard to imagine an employer thinking, Why would I be paying higher wages in a world in which inflation is incredibly low, growth is slow, and productivity increases are quite slow?	13	1
201509	1858	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I find that to be quite a plausible narrative, although I also believe that wages are sending a signal about slack.	13	1
201509	1859	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I think the Chair has been very careful not to make wages a litmus test for a rate increase, and I would say, I think that’s the right place to be.	13	1
201509	1860	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I can imagine a world in which we had price inflation that went up and wages that don’t respond, no matter how low unemployment goes.	13	1
201509	1861	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I can imagine a different world in which wages go up more than price inflation does, and the long- time decline in labor share starts to reverse.	13	1
201509	1862	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t want to stand in the way of that if it was to happen.	13	1
201509	1863	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I think we ought to focus on price inflation, which is, of course, our statutory mandate.	13	1
201509	1864	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Although my September SEP forecast is close to the Tealbook baseline, I expect the unemployment rate to fall faster and inflation to move to 2 percent sooner than in the baseline.	13	1
201509	1865	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In the Tealbook, growth for 2016 to 2018 continues at 2 percent, which is almost exactly the average over the past four years.	13	1
201509	1866	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But there is a sharp slowdown in the number of payroll jobs, from an average of 2.6 million over the past four years to an average of 1.5 million for the next three years.	13	1
201509	1867	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I understand that to be a way of returning productivity growth closer to trend.	13	1
201509	1868	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But this is a key assumption that has critical implications for policy.	13	1
201509	1869	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	For the four years ending in 2015, again, growth was 2.1 percent and unemployment declined at 0.9 percent per year.	13	1
201509	1870	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	For the next three years, growth is 2.0 percent and unemployment declines 0.1 percent per year.	13	1
201509	1871	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Now, productivity may increase in the next three years, and I certainly hope that it does.	13	1
201509	1872	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But, of course, predicting it in the short term is treacherous, and it seems to me there is a reasonable probability that there won’t be such a sharp break in the data.	13	1
201509	1873	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	If there isn’t, then taking the growth forecast as given, the result would be higher payroll growth, lower productivity growth, and a substantially faster decline in the rate of unemployment, what might be called the “more of the same” scenario, and that is, in fact, my forecast.	13	1
201509	1874	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	With growth much like that in the Tealbook, I have the unemployment rate declining to 4½ percent, or perhaps even below, in 2017, well below my estimate of the natural rate of 4.9 percent.	13	1
201509	1875	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	By the way, I am number 2, as we are giving out our numbers [laughter].	13	1
201509	1876	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And that path is consistent with the idea that we ought to be prepared to let unemployment decline below the natural rate to help lift trend inflation and support a more robust recovery from the ravages of the global financial crisis.	13	1
201509	1877	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	While my point forecast is reasonably optimistic, as others have noted I think we need to acknowledge the risk of a period of global economic weakness, which has clearly increased since the previous meeting.	13	1
201509	1878	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Weakness and policy misfires in China have meant declining commodity prices and financial turmoil, putting pressure on a range of emerging market economies, and tightening financial conditions globally.	13	1
201509	1879	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In recent years, we have had frequent briefings focused on the potentially significant ramifications for the US economy of a slowdown or a crisis in the emerging market economies, and there are two such alternative simulations in this cycle’s Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1880	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Although China faces significant structural difficulties and very challenging longer-term transition issues, I see it as unlikely that there will be a near-term crisis.	13	1
201509	1881	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But China’s growth is slowing, and that is having sizable effects on the rest of emerging Asia and other emerging market commodity producers.	13	1
201509	1882	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	The usually reliable hand of China’s technocrats has seemed much less sure of late.	13	1
201509	1883	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	As capital flows from emerging market economies have increased recently and some key countries like Brazil and Russia are already in precarious economic situations, the risk of a broader crisis has clearly risen.	13	1
201509	1884	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I think the Committee has gone to extraordinary lengths to be both patient and transparent about the path of policy.	13	1
201509	1885	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	The rest of the world has had plenty of warning and time to get ready for US tightening.	13	1
201509	1886	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Still, tightening into an actual emerging markets crisis scenario is something else again.	13	1
201509	1887	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And although I see that as unlikely, I am at least inclined to pause to allow this risk to evolve.	13	1
201509	1888	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1889	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201509	1890	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201509	1891	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1892	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As I always do, I benefit from hearing from every member of the Committee, save for the Chair, which I appreciate, and it helps inform my perspective.	13	1
201509	1893	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent developments reinforce, perhaps, or intensify the crosscurrents that we have seen in the economy for some time, and, I think, in a material way that affects current and expected future progress toward our objectives.	13	1
201509	1894	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	On the one hand, the underlying momentum on domestic real activity has strengthened, and we have seen some nice progress on the employment leg of the mandate.	13	1
201509	1895	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, the foreign economic outlook, I think, has again contributed materially to financial tightening and poses downside risks to the outlook.	13	1
201509	1896	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We see no indication of an acceleration in either wages or prices, and inflation remains stubbornly below our target.	13	1
201509	1897	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me just spend a moment on each of these.	13	1
201509	1898	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As you all have noted, the labor market has continued to improve nicely.	13	1
201509	1899	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The three-month moving average of payroll employment growth was 220,000 in August, similar to average gains so far this year, and August payrolls are likely to be revised up.	13	1
201509	1900	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, there continues to be improvement, on balance, along the three main margins of labor market slack.	13	1
201509	1901	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite this, the ongoing diminution of slack has yet to result in any noticeable acceleration in our three broad measures of wages.	13	1
201509	1902	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Average hourly earnings through August as well as compensation per hour and the employment cost index through the second quarter all suggest that nominal wage growth is only in the 2 to 2¼ percent range, which is little different than the pace we have seen over the past several years.	13	1
201509	1903	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The absence of such acceleration suggests that resources still are not fully utilized, and I think other data send a similar signal.	13	1
201509	1904	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Participation for prime-age adults remains well below pre-recession levels and below what pre-crisis trends in participation for this group would suggest.	13	1
201509	1905	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains well above longer-run norms, even allowing for some move-up in the equilibrium level in recent years.	13	1
201509	1906	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As others have pointed out, although it is difficult to know with any precision what the natural rate is, the absence in recent quarters of any upward movement in nominal wage growth and price inflation has to be seen as some indication that the natural rate is below the current level.	13	1
201509	1907	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And I think it’s interesting to note that since our submissions in June, it appears that nine Committee members—and I’m just staring at the dots—have moved their point estimates for the natural rate below 5 percent.	13	1
201509	1908	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, domestic activity has been proceeding at a reassuring pace on most dimensions, suggesting demand is solid.	13	1
201509	1909	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Although inventory investment in the second quarter looks elevated, suggesting a negative contribution in the second half of the year, other components of business investment look better than they did in July.	13	1
201509	1910	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, nonresidential building investment rose strongly in the second quarter, offsetting the weakness that we had seen in drilling investment, and indicators of equipment investment have also turned up of late.	13	1
201509	1911	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Strong auto sales and growth in other components of retail sales suggest consumer spending is rising at a welcome pace moving into the second half.	13	1
201509	1912	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Continued job growth and lower gas prices should continue to support this.	13	1
201509	1913	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And the latest data on building permits and starts continue to paint a picture of gradual recovery in housing.	13	1
201509	1914	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Overall, despite an anemic contribution from government spending, domestic demand is advancing.	13	1
201509	1915	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Domestic final sales rose 2½ percent in the first half of 2015, and the Tealbook expects similar growth in the second half.	13	1
201509	1916	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, manufacturing exports are on the soft side, and that brings me to the crosscurrents.	13	1
201509	1917	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking back over the past year, it is very clear that foreign economic conditions are weighing on real activity and inflation as well as on financial conditions in the United States.	13	1
201509	1918	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	At the end of last year, persistently weak aggregate demand in the euro zone and in Japan, as well as the policy response, were kind of the main story.	13	1
201509	1919	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	More recently, weakness in foreign demand has really focused on emerging market economies.	13	1
201509	1920	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Growing recognition of this weakness has pushed the dollar up further, so after the 12 percent we saw earlier, we now have an additional movement, and the dollar now lies 15 percent above its level last summer.	13	1
201509	1921	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	China, in particular, has been the focus of an intermeeting reassessment of global growth prospects.	13	1
201509	1922	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think China’s contribution really has to be seen in the broader context of spillovers both in real activity and the financial sector, not directly through trade channels to the United States but as they reverberate around the global economy.	13	1
201509	1923	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, China has been at the center, really, of a commodity supercycle that has now endured for over a decade and has been a very important source of demand for many commodity exporters and is also very closely connected to many of the other neighboring economies in the region.	13	1
201509	1924	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, the buildup of past property and more recent stock market bubbles, together with a rapid run-up in business debt levels and growing perceptions that Chinese policymakers are not managing policy or communications as deftly as previously anticipated, have raised concerns, I think, about broader global growth prospects and potential downside risks.	13	1
201509	1925	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And those risks are compounded and perhaps amplified by well-known weakness in the quality of macroeconomic data that, I think, risks perpetuating the fog around the growth trajectory.	13	1
201509	1926	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking forward, in terms of the US economy, I, like several other members of the Committee, really don’t see the intermeeting developments as narrow equity market corrections centered on the United States.	13	1
201509	1927	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I really see it as a broader reassessment of global growth prospects and questions about China’s trajectory.	13	1
201509	1928	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think there is a nontrivial probability that we will see, sometime in the next few quarters, an additional adjustment of China’s exchange rate regime.	13	1
201509	1929	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I can’t tell you when or by how much, but it does seem like they are in the midst of an adjustment process, and that in turn is likely to reverberate, particularly because many other foreign economies facing weak internal demand—including in East Asia, the euro zone, and Japan—will have to adjust their policies accordingly.	13	1
201509	1930	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The direct and indirect effects of that further adjustment will remain a material risk to our own outlook.	13	1
201509	1931	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, my sense is that the effects of dollar appreciation, even the dollar appreciation we have seen so far, are likely to be quite persistent, and those effects, if the dollar appreciates further, are likely to lead to additional restraint both on real activity and on US inflation.	13	1
201509	1932	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	That comes against a backdrop in which US core PCE inflation remains quite subdued.	13	1
201509	1933	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The underlying trend, as many have noted, remains between maybe 1¼ to 1½ percent, similar to the pace that we have seen in the past couple of years and noticeably below our target.	13	1
201509	1934	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	If you look at the 12-month change in core PCE prices, or even if you look at the change in the Dallas Fed trimmed mean, we are still substantially below our target and have not made any progress.	13	1
201509	1935	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And although survey expectations provide some reassurance, the risks seem tilted to the downside, as inflation compensation has moved back to the historically low levels reached at the beginning of the year.	13	1
201509	1936	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	For all those reasons, I do see considerable value to waiting, and that value outweighs the cost.	13	1
201509	1937	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But because we will have an opportunity to return to this tomorrow, I’d be particularly interested to hear from those who put the start of policy normalization in the third quarter of this year about the potential risks of waiting, because I think that would be helpful in informing my own policy outlook.	13	1
201509	1938	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201509	1939	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everyone for a very interesting round of comments and, I think, some very interesting observations on the current situation.	13	1
201509	1940	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I thought I would wrap things up, if you wouldn’t mind, by giving a summary of my own assessment of the incoming data and their implications for the outlook.	13	1
201509	1941	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, as almost all of you noted, we’ve seen continued solid gains in monthly payrolls.	13	1
201509	1942	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And at 5.1 percent, the unemployment rate stands just a touch above the median of our estimates of its longer-run normal level.	13	1
201509	1943	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Broader measures of labor utilization like U-6 also have moved down as the number of discouraged workers continued to decline, and involuntary part-time employment edged down further.	13	1
201509	1944	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Consistent with the views I heard expressed around the table, I think these developments confirm that labor market conditions have improved considerably since earlier in the year.	13	1
201509	1945	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	For me, they’re also consistent with the conditions that, at the July meeting, I said in my own view could warrant raising the funds rate in September.	13	1
201509	1946	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But back in July, I also indicated that stronger readings on wages would strengthen the case for liftoff, and instead, exactly the opposite has occurred.	13	1
201509	1947	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And so, for me, wage developments weaken the case.	13	1
201509	1948	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	At the time, the available data seemed to suggest that wages were finally beginning to respond to diminishing slack.	13	1
201509	1949	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Since then, new readings on the ECI, hourly earnings, and compensation per hour all indicate that we’re still stuck at wage increases in the vicinity of 2 percent, a very subdued pace if the economy really is near full employment.	13	1
201509	1950	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t want to make too much of the news.	13	1
201509	1951	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The relationship between nominal wage growth and slack is far from tight, and other factors you’ve mentioned around the table, such as weak productivity growth and global competition, may explain why wage gains remain anemic.	13	1
201509	1952	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Still, firms continue to attract and retain workers without raising wages, and even though we’ve seen an impressive increase in job openings, the quits rate has flattened out, and that is despite all the reports we hear about how difficult firms find it to fill some jobs.	13	1
201509	1953	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	On the margin, the disappointing wage data have reinforced my sense that we are still a ways from full employment, even if the economy is very close to the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	13	1
201509	1954	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The current rate of involuntary part-time employment remains more than 1 percentage point above its pre-recession level, and the labor force participation rate remains below the staff’s estimate of its trend.	13	1
201509	1955	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, with the public dissatisfaction with the state of the labor market so widespread, I suspect that the current level of the trend participation rate is actually higher than the staff’s estimate, although I’m fairly confident in the trend’s downward slope, which I think can be estimated more reliably.	13	1
201509	1956	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Eliminating slack along these additional dimensions may well necessitate a temporary decline in the unemployment rate below its longer-run normal level.	13	1
201509	1957	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, pulling discouraged workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful employment opportunities and strong hiring.	13	1
201509	1958	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Similarly, firms may be unwilling to restructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater difficulty filling part- time positions.	13	1
201509	1959	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Beyond these dynamics, which effectively imply that the natural rate of unemployment is likely to run below its longer-run value for a time, a temporary undershooting of the longer-run level of unemployment could have other advantages, including speeding the return of inflation to 2 percent and even possibly reversing some of the adverse supply-side effects of recent years.	13	1
201509	1960	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to growth, like most of you, I anticipate that labor market conditions will improve somewhat further over the rest of this year and into 2016, helped by continued moderate growth in real GDP.	13	1
201509	1961	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	My forecast is not too different from the one I had back in June.	13	1
201509	1962	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The data on spending and production received since then, in fact, have been somewhat stronger than I expected and—I think this coincides with what I heard around the table—stronger than what many of you expected.	13	1
201509	1963	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Most prominently, real GDP growth in the first half of the year has been revised up by more than 1 percentage point to 2¼ percent.	13	1
201509	1964	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Readings on consumer spending and residential construction into this summer have been solid, while the remarkable contraction in drilling activity appears to have bottomed out.	13	1
201509	1965	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, I would not describe overall growth as robust.	13	1
201509	1966	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	First, the strong growth in real GDP in the second quarter was most likely a payback for transitory weakness in the first.	13	1
201509	1967	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, second, overall growth is being held back by an appreciable and continuing drag generated by the behavior of net exports.	13	1
201509	1968	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	After factoring in the recent monthly trade data and the expected restraint from dollar appreciation and weak foreign growth, the staff estimates that real GDP is likely to expand at an annual rate of only 2 percent in the second half of the year and in 2016.	13	1
201509	1969	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	One implication of the incoming data and the near-term outlook is that the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate remains low and shows no obvious signs of rising this year.	13	1
201509	1970	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	That’s an inference that follows directly from the combination of continued moderate growth and a real funds rate that remains well below zero.	13	1
201509	1971	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	This stasis would seem to conflict with the story told by our medium-term forecasts, which imply a significant increase in the equilibrium real rate over the next few years as various headwinds restraining economic activity continue to fade.	13	1
201509	1972	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The explanation, of course, is that one headwind—namely, exchange rate appreciation and weak foreign growth—has strengthened over the past year.	13	1
201509	1973	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	This restraint has increased further since our previous meeting with the recent appreciation of the dollar, especially as it has been accompanied by an appreciable fall in stock prices and a modest rise in risk spreads on corporate bonds.	13	1
201509	1974	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	FRB/US model simulations suggest that these intermeeting financial and international developments, if they persist, would have demand effects similar to those generated by a 50 basis point hike in the federal funds rate.	13	1
201509	1975	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Whatever their implications for the modal outlook, recent movements in the dollar and other financial factors, coupled with increased concerns about the prospects for growth in China and the emerging market economies, certainly suggest that the downside risks to the US economy have increased to some degree, and several of you have noted the same thing.	13	1
201509	1976	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Turning to inflation, information received since our previous meeting, specifically lower oil prices and a higher dollar, suggests that the transitory factors currently holding down inflation are likely to fade a bit more slowly than I previously judged.	13	1
201509	1977	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	For example, the Tealbook now shows overall PCE inflation on a four-quarter basis running at only 1 percent through the first three quarters of next year.	13	1
201509	1978	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	That’s down ¼ percent from the July Tealbook.	13	1
201509	1979	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, I still expect that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent, provided—and this is key—that the labor market completes the return to full employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.	13	1
201509	1980	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned a moment ago, I anticipate that the labor market will continue to improve in coming quarters and, barring some adverse shock to the economy, I expect that the economy is likely to stay in the general vicinity of full employment over the medium term, assuming appropriate adjustments to monetary policy over time.	13	1
201509	1981	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	That said, we can’t say with certainty what those adjustments will be, as we do not know how foreign economic conditions will evolve, how financial conditions will develop, or how rapidly the remaining domestic headwinds will fade, as recent events amply illustrate.	13	1
201509	1982	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But I’m cautiously optimistic that this condition for meeting our inflation objective will be met.	13	1
201509	1983	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I also judge long-run inflation expectations to be reasonably well anchored and at a level consistent with the gradual return to 2 percent inflation.	13	1
201509	1984	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	That said, the decline in inflation compensation over the past year concerns me somewhat, even if staff analysis suggests that it’s primarily related to shifts in risk and liquidity premiums.	13	1
201509	1985	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I said at our previous meeting that from my standpoint, a renewed decline in inflation compensation would give me pause, and, in fact, it has declined quite substantially.	13	1
201509	1986	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	All in all, my confidence that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium term has not increased during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201509	1987	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201509	1988	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I look forward to hearing your views during the policy go-round.	13	1
201509	1989	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest that we break now and have dinner, but I would suggest that we begin early.	13	1
201509	1990	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	There is a press conference tomorrow.	13	1
201509	1991	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I want to give everybody adequate time for what’s bound to be an interesting policy discussion.	13	1
201509	1992	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I would like to propose that we start off tomorrow morning at 8:30, and Thomas will then begin his briefing.	2	2
201509	1993	2015-09-17	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201509	1994	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	September 17 Session .	2	2
201509	1995	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201509	1996	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready to begin our policy go-round.	2	2
201509	1997	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me call on Thomas to brief us on the monetary policy alternatives.	21	2
201509	1998	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201509	1999	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201509	2000	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As has been the case at each meeting since June, the key issues for your decision today are whether or not the criteria for beginning policy normalization have been met and, in either case, how to communicate in an effective way the reasons for the decision and the Committee’s thinking about the likely response of policy to economic developments going forward.	21	2
201509	2001	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Since you submitted economic projections in June, the incoming information on economic activity and the labor market has been stronger than you anticipated, and the unemployment rate is now lower than you expected—developments that clearly mark further progress on the Committee’s labor market criterion for liftoff.	21	2
201509	2002	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 2 percent objective, held down importantly by declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy imports.	21	2
201509	2003	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, as discussed earlier, global economic and financial market developments over the intermeeting period have led to a tightening of financial conditions and could pose downside risks to economic activity while putting further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.	21	2
201509	2004	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As summarized on exhibit 1, alternatives A, B, and C provide policy options that reflect differing assessments of the potential effects of recent economic and financial developments on the outlook.	21	2
201509	2005	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Starting with alternative B, paragraph 1 states that “economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace”—in line with the Committee’s previously stated expectations—and indicates that, apart from the continued softness in net exports, the expansion has been somewhat more broadly based than earlier in the year.	21	2
201509	2006	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The paragraph also presents a more confident assessment of the diminution of economic slack than in previous statements, suggesting that, in the Committee’s view, labor market conditions are quite close to meeting the criterion for liftoff.	21	2
201509	2007	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, it casts recent inflation developments less favorably, suggesting that the effects of the declines in energy prices are not yet behind us and recognizing that market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower.	21	2
201509	2008	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 continues to describe an outlook in which economic activity will expand at a moderate rate and labor market indicators will move toward mandate- consistent levels.	21	2
201509	2009	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In describing the risks to the outlook, alternative B acknowledges that developments abroad “may restrain [domestic] economic activity somewhat”—a concern that many of you cited in your SEP comments on the outlook.	21	2
201509	2010	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	However, paragraph 2 indicates that, while the Committee is monitoring developments abroad, those developments have not, at this point, tilted the balance of risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market appreciably to the downside.	21	2
201509	2011	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the outlook for inflation, alternative B indicates that recent global developments “are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.”	21	2
201509	2012	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	This assessment seems consistent with the fact that many of you have lowered your projections for inflation over the near term as well as with the increase in the number of you who see the risks to inflation to be to the downside.	21	2
201509	2013	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	With this assessment of the outlook for inflation, and the decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Committee would convey that it is not yet reasonably confident about its expectation that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	21	2
201509	2014	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As summarized in the middle panel, the Committee’s characterization of the recent information on economic activity and the labor market in alternative A would be the same as in alternative B.	21	2
201509	2015	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Nonetheless, its description of recent inflation developments would show greater concern, and it would indicate that recent global developments have shifted the risks to the outlook for economic activity to the downside and will impose some additional restraint on inflation.	21	2
201509	2016	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As a result, the Committee would signal that it does not expect to begin normalizing policy for some time.	21	2
201509	2017	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, alternative A states that if the Committee did not “soon” see incoming information indicating “that inflation is beginning to move back toward 2 percent,” the Committee would provide additional accommodation to achieve that goal within one to two years.	21	2
201509	2018	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the lower panel, alternative C would begin normalizing the level of the federal funds rate.	21	2
201509	2019	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In summarizing the economic background for such a decision, paragraph 1 offers the perspective that economic growth has been moderate, on average, so far this year, and, after citing some key factors showing further improvement in the labor market, it states more definitively that resource slack has diminished.	21	2
201509	2020	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 provides further support for the assessment that labor market conditions have met the criterion for liftoff by indicating that labor market indicators are “approaching” mandate-consistent levels.	21	2
201509	2021	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In evaluating the risks to this outlook, the Committee would acknowledge the need to monitor developments abroad but would not suggest that those developments are likely to be consequential for the United States, or that they have altered the Committee’s assessment of risks to the outlook.	21	2
201509	2022	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In alternative C, the Committee would also state that, although inflation is anticipated to remain low over the near term, policymakers have gained sufficient confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium run to begin to remove policy accommodation.	21	2
201509	2023	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In paragraph 2, the Committee would state its assessment that the transitory factors holding down inflation “will dissipate,” and that the key determinants of the inflation outlook—continuing improvement in the labor market and stable longer-term expectations—are in place.	21	2
201509	2024	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	I should note that even if you view the policy choice in alternative C to be premature in the present circumstances, you may want to comment on whether paragraph 4 should include the bracketed “balanced approach” language that you discussed at the July meeting.	21	2
201509	2025	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Beth and Chris already highlighted in their briefing the language options regarding reinvestment policy.	21	2
201509	2026	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Your second exhibit reviews market and participants’ monetary policy expectations and some factors likely to shape the market reaction to statements like in the drafts for alternative B or C.	21	2
201509	2027	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the top-left panel, market participants’ assessment of the probability of a September liftoff, as derived from federal funds futures, varied significantly over the intermeeting period, as Simon already mentioned.	21	2
201509	2028	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The probability appeared to respond to the turbulence in global financial markets, policymaker communications, and incoming economic data.	21	2
201509	2029	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The probability distribution of the timing of liftoff derived from the responses to the Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers—shown to the right—suggests that the perceived odds of policy firming at this meeting are slightly less than 30 percent.	21	2
201509	2030	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the table in the middle-left panel, although federal funds futures imply notably lower perceived odds of an imminent rate hike than was the case a day before the 1994 and 2004 tightening moves, they still indicate significantly higher odds than were attached to liftoff right before the June meeting.	21	2
201509	2031	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The measures of expectations also signal a considerable degree of uncertainty about the timing of liftoff.	21	2
201509	2032	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Market participants, on average, place fairly similar odds on liftoff this week, later this year, and next year, as indicated by the fairly uniform distribution of the blue bars in the upper-right panel across the September, December, and later meetings.	21	2
201509	2033	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	This could, in principle, reflect disagreement among survey respondents who individually are quite certain in their views.	21	2
201509	2034	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	However, even among respondents who selected September as the most likely date of liftoff, the median probability attached to a September liftoff was only about 50 percent.	21	2
201509	2035	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	This fact highlights that, indeed, many of them do not seem to hold strong convictions about any one given date.	21	2
201509	2036	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, as shown in the middle-right panel, views are considerably dispersed.	21	2
201509	2037	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	As the distribution of the dots in the leftmost column shows, respondents to the Desk’s surveys of primary dealers and market participants report probabilities for a rate increase at this meeting that range from zero to 60 percent, and the degree of dispersion is similarly high for the December and March meetings.	21	2
201509	2038	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In sum, the current state of market expectations seems consistent with your communications that have for some time emphasized data dependence and, in light of the mixed signals coming from the labor market and inflation, created optionality for when to move.	21	2
201509	2039	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	At the same time, as discussed in the bottom-left panel, whether or not the FOMC decides to raise the target federal funds rate, there could be a revision in investors’ policy expectations that may result in a noticeable market reaction—and one that is hard to predict.	21	2
201509	2040	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	A key point, however, is that the overall market response will be shaped not only by the decision about whether to lift off, but also by the Committee’s communications, including the language in the statement, its economic projections, and the SEP dots.	21	2
201509	2041	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The dots, in particular, indicate that your outlook has not changed materially.	21	2
201509	2042	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The path of the federal funds rate based on the median projection in the SEP, shown in the bottom-right panel, not only remains fairly shallow, but also has shifted down a bit.	21	2
201509	2043	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Such a shallow path might diminish the risk of an outsized market reaction to a statement like alternative C because it conveys the Committee’s intentions to continue to provide a high degree of accommodation for some time.	21	2
201509	2044	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Similarly, as your projections of the federal funds rate continue to indicate that many of you see policy normalization likely to begin later this year, a draft statement like alternative B might be read as clearly keeping interest rate increases later in the year on the table and need not lead to a significant change in the expected path of policy.	21	2
201509	2045	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Having said so, as noted back in the bottom-left panel, there are certainly some risk factors that might trigger an outsized response, especially when you decide to first raise the target range.	21	2
201509	2046	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The fact that longer-term Treasury term premiums are on the low end of their historical range raises the possibility that, after years of the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the first rate hike may trigger an abrupt rise in term premiums toward more typical levels, as witnessed during the taper tantrum.	21	2
201509	2047	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, technical factors and market dynamics could play an important role in amplifying movements in interest rates, as witnessed during the taper tantrum.	21	2
201509	2048	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	If investors were to unwind positions abruptly in response to a monetary policy surprise, this could amplify interest rate movements.	21	2
201509	2049	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201509	2050	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	That completes my prepared remarks, and I’ll be happy to take questions.	21	2
201509	2051	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21	2
201509	2052	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone have questions for Thomas?	22	2
201509	2053	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	22	2
201509	2054	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have one quick question on the middle-left panel of exhibit 2, “Probability of Tightening the Day before the FOMC Meeting.”	22	2
201509	2055	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	My memory of the 1994 tightening cycle was, not only was it a little bit of a surprise when we started, but also that the pace was somewhat surprising.	22	2
201509	2056	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, the 10-year rate went up quite abruptly.	22	2
201509	2057	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	How do you think about not only the start of tightening, but also the pace of tightening once we begin?	22	2
201509	2058	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	In fact, there is, as you may have noticed, a box in Tealbook B that looks in greater detail at some of these events.	22	2
201509	2059	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s interesting that, actually, the pace of tightening expected over the first six months in 1994 wasn’t all that rapid, and, as you point out, there was then a substantial surprise over the course of the year.	22	2
201509	2060	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So that clearly could lead to stronger market responses subsequently over time.	22	2
201509	2061	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Here, in my exhibit, I try to focus essentially on the liftoff event, not on, say, the six months or a year following that event.	22	2
201509	2062	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, while I certainly don’t want to downplay potential financial stability challenges for some institutions if such a scenario came to pass, I think it is still noteworthy that that, of course, happened basically against the backdrop of an economic situation that was more favorable than expected.	22	2
201509	2063	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So that should be a positive, all else being equal.	22	2
201509	2064	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	22	2
201509	2065	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions?	22	2
201509	2066	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22	2
201509	2067	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201509	2068	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Simon, could you give us any indication—do market commentators or the people you talk to provide any information about how the SEP funds rate numbers might inform their assessments of the pace of liftoff or anything like that?	22	2
201509	2069	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We added a new question to get numbers back on the SEP medians, because you’re now presenting the medians.	22	2
201509	2070	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	In terms of the dot plot, I’d say that the medians we got back from the responses look pretty close to what will be published today.	22	2
201509	2071	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	They’re basically expecting about 25 basis points to be knocked off the medians, and that’s what I think the SEP shows.	22	2
201509	2072	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Could you just repeat the second part of your question?	22	2
201509	2073	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Will the dispersion of the dots or anything about the distribution of what we give them and how they—	22	2
201509	2074	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I think they’ll be focused on how many participants have moved liftoff to 2016.	22	2
201509	2075	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I’d say that, having read some of the commentary, the notion of four participants putting liftoff in 2016 is probably about what market participants expected—I know this sounds a little bit strange because I’m talking about your choices here.	22	2
201509	2076	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There will be focus on dots 4 to 7, and that’s where a lot of people look for a median, as opposed to taking the median of all 17 responses.	22	2
201509	2077	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	My answer was probably a little bit confusing.	22	2
201509	2078	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	No, that’s helpful.	22	2
201509	2079	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We’ve said things like that before, too.	22	2
201509	2080	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	22	2
201509	2081	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	22	2
201509	2082	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question.	22	2
201509	2083	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Conditional on not moving today, where do you think the probability mass for today would shift, based on how B is currently written and the SEP dots?	22	2
201509	2084	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	This question is for either Thomas or Simon.	22	2
201509	2085	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	The one thing that struck me when reading the dealers’ responses was, I did not find a lot of evidence for the, as it has come to be called, “one or none” view—namely, that not moving in September would immediately lead dealers to assume that, therefore, there is not going to be any move over the remainder of this year.	22	2
201509	2086	2015-09-17	meeting	LAUBACH	So I didn’t find in the write-ups anything that pointed in that direction.	22	2
201509	2087	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Do you think the mass would move to December so that December would go up a lot, or would it be spread across—	22	2
201509	2088	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	You’re seeing a little bit more weight on the next meeting.	22	2
201509	2089	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Part of that will depend on how they assess whether there has to be a scheduled press conference for a move at the October meeting.	22	2
201509	2090	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	What I think Thomas was saying is, we definitely expect mass to go to December.	22	2
201509	2091	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We’re unsure, and it might depend on the press conference, exactly where it goes relative to October.	22	2
201509	2092	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	And then some mass will go into next year, and that’s basically because stuff can happen over the next few months.	22	2
201509	2093	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There are a lot of things that can happen regarding the debt limit that will push people to move further out, I think.	22	2
201509	2094	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	22	2
201509	2095	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22	2
201509	2096	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I would guess that what will happen to the market’s views depends very heavily on what is said in the press conference and what guidance we give for the coming months.	22	2
201509	2097	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m not sure we get a very good guess independent of that.	22	2
201509	2098	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Yes, but there’s also one market commentary I saw, which indicated that, if everyone was given the transcript, the statement, the SEP, and the transcript of the press conference in advance, most people could still not guess what the market reaction would be.	22	2
201509	2099	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	22	2
201509	2100	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	It’s useful to be humble when trying to predict what might happen, whichever outcome is chosen.	22	2
201509	2101	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone have other questions for Thomas?	22	2
201509	2102	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201509	2103	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, with your indulgence, I would like to start off today’s policy go-round by recommending to the Committee that we adopt alternative B and keep the federal funds rate target range unchanged.	23	2
201509	2104	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me explain the basis for this recommendation.	23	2
201509	2105	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that a good case can be made for moving today.	23	2
201509	2106	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The data that we’ve received since our July meeting on the labor market and domestic spending have been strong, arguably stronger than we expected.	23	2
201509	2107	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Domestic spending appears to be on a solid course, and the labor market has continued to improve, with the unemployment rate declining into the central tendency of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.	23	2
201509	2108	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	There may well be enough domestic momentum to overcome the slightly greater-than- anticipated drag due to the behavior of the external sector and the tightening of financial conditions.	23	2
201509	2109	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Inflation is way below our target, but there’s no news there.	23	2
201509	2110	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We expected that to be the case.	23	2
201509	2111	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	A significant portion of that shortfall is due to transitory factors, particularly oil prices and the dollar.	23	2
201509	2112	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Although core inflation, even abstracting from the depressing effect of import prices, is running below our objective, with the labor market continuing to improve and survey measures of inflation expectations remaining stable, we should eventually see upward pressure on inflation, returning it to target.	23	2
201509	2113	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	There are lags in the effect of policy, so we need to move in a timely fashion to avoid overshooting our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201509	2114	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In terms of communications, we’ve prepared the markets for the beginning of normalization later this year.	23	2
201509	2115	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve consistently argued that the significance of a decision to make a small upward adjustment in the funds rate range should not be overblown.	23	2
201509	2116	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	What matters is the path of the funds rate, and we’ve said that we see good reasons why that path is likely to be shallow.	23	2
201509	2117	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Conceivably, raising the target range for the funds rate might even boost the confidence of households and businesses, spurring rather than retarding domestic spending, and perhaps the incessant market focus on the timing of liftoff has itself become a source of uncertainty that’s roiling markets and raising volatility.	23	2
201509	2118	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps our credibility is at stake if we don’t get on with the job.	23	2
201509	2119	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We may seem as though we’re overreacting to market volatility.	23	2
201509	2120	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I see this as the case for raising rates.	23	2
201509	2121	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I also see a case for not raising rates today, however.	23	2
201509	2122	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the final analysis, I think that case is stronger.	23	2
201509	2123	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps most important, my judgment that we should stay on hold reflects my assessment of the balance of risks.	23	2
201509	2124	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, should it turn out that we’ve waited a bit too long to raise rates, thereby raising the odds that inflation overshoots our 2 percent inflation target, or that we’re forced to move rates up less gradually than we’d prefer—I see those risks as less severe than the risks of moving too soon.	23	2
201509	2125	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I do not want to repeat the experience of other central banks that have tried to free themselves of the zero bound prematurely and later had to reverse course, allowing inflation to move lower during the process.	23	2
201509	2126	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m also concerned about what we will communicate to markets and the public about our reaction function and our likely future behavior if we move today, at a time when concerns about the global outlook have created uncertainties that have been reflected in the recent market turmoil and after financial conditions have already tightened notably.	23	2
201509	2127	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’d be moving when additional deflationary pressure from further dollar appreciation and lower oil prices is working to delay at least slightly our likely return to our inflation target and when it’s hard to find evidence of any fear whatsoever in the marketplace of a 1970s-like inflationary spiral or any sense that the FOMC is “behind the curve.”	23	2
201509	2128	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’m concerned that we will appear to be hell-bent on raising rates, with the consequence that the dollar might rise significantly and market expectations about the likely future policy path could also shift up substantially.	23	2
201509	2129	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The fact that markets attach only around 30 percent odds to a move today heightens this concern.	23	2
201509	2130	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We set out two criteria for raising rates—that we see some further improvement in the labor market, and that we have reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2131	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	As I said during the economic go-round, we clearly have seen some further improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201509	2132	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But as I also noted yesterday, incoming data pertaining to the inflation outlook have not, on balance, improved my confidence that inflation will move up to our target over the next few years.	23	2
201509	2133	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The dollar has strengthened yet further during the intermeeting period.	23	2
201509	2134	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Oil prices have moved yet lower.	23	2
201509	2135	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, importantly, those initial indications of an acceleration in wages we thought we had seen have disappeared entirely from all of the main national wage and compensation measures.	23	2
201509	2136	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve gone out of my way to insist that wage acceleration not be viewed as a litmus test for raising the funds rate.	23	2
201509	2137	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But wage trends are not irrelevant to assessing the remaining degree of slack in the labor market, and the absence of any broad-based wage pressures adds to the case that there remains significant labor market slack.	23	2
201509	2138	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In effect, I see the short-run natural rate of unemployment as considerably lower than my estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	23	2
201509	2139	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	This means that there is more scope for improvement in the labor market before inflation pressures emerge, and I see no penalty in allowing the unemployment rate to drift below its estimated longer-run normal value if such an outcome has no adverse implications for inflation.	23	2
201509	2140	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I’d ask you to recall simulations in past Tealbooks of an optimal control path that attaches no weight to unemployment outcomes—it weights only inflation outcomes.	23	2
201509	2141	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Those simulations of an optimal control path tell us that we should be acting more aggressively, pushing unemployment down well below its longer-run normal level.	23	2
201509	2142	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And the benefit would be that we would promote a more rapid return of inflation to 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2143	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, this is a reason why I think it makes sense to continue setting as a condition for a first increase in the federal funds rate that we see some further improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201509	2144	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Lastly, I’d note that inflation breakevens have moved yet lower, significantly lower.	23	2
201509	2145	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Despite all of the familiar reasons, this isn’t a definitive indication that inflation expectations have moved down, but it’s certainly disquieting.	23	2
201509	2146	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	While the decline in inflation compensation may not reflect any change in the modal outlook for inflation, I think it plausible that at least a portion of the decline reflects increasing downside risks to inflation.	23	2
201509	2147	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	After all, market participants are increasingly concerned about the global outlook.	23	2
201509	2148	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	They appear to perceive the equilibrium real rate as quite low.	23	2
201509	2149	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	And, with the funds rate at the zero bound and inflation already well below our target, they likely worry that the Fed will have very little ammunition to respond to negative shocks.	23	2
201509	2150	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	This means that inflation could easily fall short of the target in coming years.	23	2
201509	2151	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I share these concerns, and that’s an important reason, I believe, that the risks around our projection that inflation will return to 2 percent are unbalanced to the downside.	23	2
201509	2152	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, the tighter the labor market becomes, the more balanced the risks also become.	23	2
201509	2153	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	There are additional reasons to hold off raising rates today.	23	2
201509	2154	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	They pertain to the global outlook and the fact that overall financial conditions have tightened materially in recent weeks.	23	2
201509	2155	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	As we discussed yesterday, risks to the global outlook have certainly increased.	23	2
201509	2156	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The continuing decline in commodity prices is restraining growth in a number of countries that are commodity exporters.	23	2
201509	2157	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Two of our most important trading partners, Mexico and Canada, have been significantly affected.	23	2
201509	2158	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The prospects, as we discussed, for Chinese growth are highly uncertain, with rising downside risks.	23	2
201509	2159	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Net exports placed a considerable drag on US growth during the first half of the year, and we could see a yet greater effect.	23	2
201509	2160	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, I’m concerned that we could see significant further appreciation of the dollar.	23	2
201509	2161	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thus, I believe it would be prudent to have some additional information to inform our evaluation of the global outlook before raising rates.	23	2
201509	2162	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, we have seen a material tightening in financial conditions in recent weeks, with US equity prices down and the value of the broad dollar and risk spreads higher.	23	2
201509	2163	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We must always be careful not to allow monetary policy to respond to volatility in the markets.	23	2
201509	2164	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But the shifts we have seen represent a material tightening in overall financial conditions.	23	2
201509	2165	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Not surprisingly, recent indicators of consumer confidence have retreated somewhat.	23	2
201509	2166	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	It’s conceivable that markets will rebound in the coming weeks and the perceived risks to the global outlook may subside.	23	2
201509	2167	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	If so, a failure to move today will not leave us far behind the curve, if at all.	23	2
201509	2168	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	So my recommendation to the Committee is that we not raise rates today, and that we explain that decision by highlighting that global economic and financial developments have imparted some restraint to the economic outlook and have placed further transitory downward pressure on inflation.	23	2
201509	2169	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We would explain that we have seen continued improvement in the labor market and gained greater confidence about the outlook for domestic spending.	23	2
201509	2170	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	The US economy in that important sense is doing well, but we want to wait for some additional evidence, which could include further improvement in the labor market, to bolster our confidence that inflation will rise to 2 percent in the medium term.	23	2
201509	2171	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We would also emphasize that, despite these recent developments, we have not fundamentally altered our outlook, and that an initial increase in the federal funds rate is a real possibility later this year and what most participants still expect.	23	2
201509	2172	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I believe communications along these lines would be entirely consistent with the criteria we’ve established for an initial hike in the funds rate and with sensible risk-management considerations.	23	2
201509	2173	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, and we’ll continue our go-round.	23	2
201509	2174	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start with President Lacker.	23	2
201509	2175	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2176	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I think now’s the time to raise the federal funds rate target.	23	2
201509	2177	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I’ve felt this way for some time, as you all know, but I haven’t been hell-bent on dissenting.	23	2
201509	2178	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I’ll be listening to this morning’s discussion with great interest, but, at this point, my sense is that it’s going to be difficult to persuade me to support further delay.	23	2
201509	2179	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Our decisions about policy are inevitably decisions about the appropriate level of the short-term real interest rate.	23	2
201509	2180	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	There are a number of approaches to assessing the appropriate real rate, but I’ll start with consumption growth.	23	2
201509	2181	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Basic economic theory tells us that a sustained increase in consumption growth should be associated with higher real interest rates.	23	2
201509	2182	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Granted, this connection isn’t always tight in the data, but the underlying reasoning strongly suggests that a negative 1.2 percent real interest rate is unlikely to be appropriate for an economy with persistent consumption growth at the rate we’ve been seeing.	23	2
201509	2183	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Now, admittedly, there are good arguments for why today’s short-term real interest rate should be lower than historical norms, and these include the global savings glut, an increase in demand for safe assets in the wake of this financial crisis, and ongoing caution on the part of American households.	23	2
201509	2184	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Indeed, a range of attempts at quantification yield measures of the natural real interest rate that are relatively low by historical standards, yet all of these estimates are markedly higher than the actual current level of the real federal funds rate of negative 1.2 percent as reported in the Tealbook.	23	2
201509	2185	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The Laubach-Williams estimate that we’ve been discussing in the past couple of meetings is approximately zero right now—minus 0.1 percent.	23	2
201509	2186	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond have developed an alternative approach to the Laubach-Williams exercise, one that’s somewhat more agnostic about identifying assumptions and yields an estimate of 0.72 percent.	23	2
201509	2187	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But the error bands encompass the Laubach-Williams figure, so it’s a very similar estimate.	23	2
201509	2188	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook’s estimate of what they call the longer-run funds rate is 1.25 percent, and this is what’s used in the Taylor rule implementations that they report on in Tealbook B.	23	2
201509	2189	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The Tealbook’s FRB/US-model-based estimate of what they call the equilibrium real funds rate is now positive 0.47 percent.	23	2
201509	2190	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Taking any one of these measures as a guide, short-term real interest rates are too low now.	23	2
201509	2191	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Taken together, I think they argue strongly for a rate increase.	23	2
201509	2192	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	A related and complementary approach to assessing interest rate policy is to compare current interest rate settings with patterns of behavior that have been successful for us in the past.	23	2
201509	2193	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The standard approach to summarizing our past behavior is through algebraic policy rule formulas, such as the various versions of the Taylor rule.	23	2
201509	2194	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Tealbook B, as I said, lists the predictions of several of these, and all but one now support raising the nominal funds rate.	23	2
201509	2195	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The one that does not support an increase in rates is the first-difference rule, which, in a sense, is predicated on the assumption that a zero federal funds rate was appropriate last quarter, an assumption that is by no means obvious.	23	2
201509	2196	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The intercept in a Taylor rule is often identified with the natural rate of interest, and some argue that if the natural rate has declined, we should make a corresponding downward adjustment to the prescriptions of those rules.	23	2
201509	2197	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	I point out, however, that the Tealbook already uses a lower natural interest rate assumption than it used to.	23	2
201509	2198	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Now it’s at 1¼ percent in the way it implements those rules.	23	2
201509	2199	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	One would have to argue for a natural interest rate that’s far lower than the estimates I cited—implausibly lower, I might argue—in order to rationalize the current real federal funds rate in the usual Taylor (1993) or Taylor (1999) rule as well as in the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	23	2
201509	2200	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Of course, one should be wary of using any of these Taylor rules to dictate how to behave at any one meeting.	23	2
201509	2201	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	However, I think the consistent story they tell reinforces the view that the time has come to raise rates.	23	2
201509	2202	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The historical pattern of behavior that’s encapsulated in these rules has delivered generally good outcomes over the past several decades and has conditioned public beliefs about how we’re likely to behave in the future.	23	2
201509	2203	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Such beliefs provide essential foundational support for the monetary stability that we currently enjoy, and we should not take this stability for granted.	23	2
201509	2204	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	If we were to continue to delay, we would be departing even further from the pattern of behavior that has served us well in the past.	23	2
201509	2205	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The historical record strongly suggests that such departures are risky and raise the likelihood of bad outcomes.	23	2
201509	2206	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In particular, the most damaging departures have been associated with the pursuit of estimates of full-employment unemployment rates that proved, in hindsight, to be too optimistic.	23	2
201509	2207	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The prospect of inflationary risks may seem remote right now.	23	2
201509	2208	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	“Disinflationary pressures” appears to be the catch phrase of the day.	23	2
201509	2209	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	We should remember, however, that the economic outlook can change rapidly.	23	2
201509	2210	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In mid-2003, for example, falling core inflation evoked a state of high anxiety.	23	2
201509	2211	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	But just over half a year later, growth and inflation were rising, and the need for tighter policy became clear.	23	2
201509	2212	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In hindsight, we moved too late and too little in that episode as well.	23	2
201509	2213	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	One might reply that because conditions might change, why not just wait and see?	23	2
201509	2214	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	That strategy often seems attractive, particularly when financial market volatility appears to have increased uncertainty.	23	2
201509	2215	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Waiting for the resolution of uncertainty can be a trap, however.	23	2
201509	2216	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	There’s always something new around the corner about which one could be uncertain, or, to quote Governor Fischer quoting a former colleague of his, “It’s never clear next time.	23	2
201509	2217	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s just unclear in a different way.”	23	2
201509	2218	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	As I noted yesterday, we have a history of letting financial market developments affect our policy in ways that we later regret, and we should be mindful of this.	23	2
201509	2219	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	The deeper response is that we know that policy affects the economy with lags, so we should strive to position ourselves in a way that balances future risks.	23	2
201509	2220	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Those risks have been shifting steadily over time as household spending has accelerated and labor market conditions have tightened.	23	2
201509	2221	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Growth in this expansion may have been disappointing when compared with historical averages, but not so much when compared with currently realistic assessments of our capabilities, given productivity and population trends.	23	2
201509	2222	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	In fact, US economic conditions have improved quite significantly over the past six years, all things considered.	23	2
201509	2223	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	It’s time to recognize the substantial progress that’s been achieved and align rates accordingly.	23	2
201509	2224	2015-09-17	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2225	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2226	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201509	2227	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2228	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Although I think the policy decision at this meeting is a close and difficult call, I support the policy decision in alternative B.	23	2
201509	2229	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I will also support the statement as written.	23	2
201509	2230	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I have sympathy for Chair Yellen regarding the challenge, even the danger, associated with significant editing of the statement on the fly, particularly just before a press conference.	23	2
201509	2231	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	So I will not suggest any changes, even though I think the statement, and the Committee’s communications more generally, may fall short of what’s needed—a point that I’ll get to in a moment.	23	2
201509	2232	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	By the standard of some further improvement in the labor market, I believe liftoff is justified.	23	2
201509	2233	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, I do accept that the inflation data on their face could discourage a liftoff decision at this meeting.	23	2
201509	2234	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The combination of declining year-over-year core PCE inflation and weakening market-based expectation measures is troubling.	23	2
201509	2235	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, I was prepared to look through the inflation data and base a liftoff decision on an assumption, obviously a critical assumption, that the positive forces at work in the economy will eventually result in upward inflation pressures pushing us toward target in a reasonable time frame.	23	2
201509	2236	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Why not lift off with the decision at this meeting?	23	2
201509	2237	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	As I stated in the economic go-round, recent global economic and financial developments have raised the risk to the outlook, in my estimation, and present a challenging environment for executing liftoff.	23	2
201509	2238	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This is the deciding factor for me.	23	2
201509	2239	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The uncertainties that are the likely cause of the recent market volatility justify delaying liftoff a meeting or two.	23	2
201509	2240	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	A delay would give the Committee time to gain confidence that the real economy is not being derailed by these developments.	23	2
201509	2241	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Let me turn to post-statement communication of an alternative B decision and communication in general.	23	2
201509	2242	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I increasingly feel the statement, and our approach to communication more generally, requires a rethink as we approach the next couple of meetings.	23	2
201509	2243	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Said differently, I’m concerned about our approach to forward guidance, and I’d like to offer some thoughts in that regard.	23	2
201509	2244	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned the Committee’s communication has contributed and is contributing to market volatility.	23	2
201509	2245	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned we have allowed our mantra of “data dependence” to become a liability.	23	2
201509	2246	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The shift from strict time-dependent guidance to a more flexible approach based on economic conditionality was appropriate.	23	2
201509	2247	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Over the past several months, however, data dependence has become, effectively, the barest-minimum practical guidance.	23	2
201509	2248	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	The phrase provides too little basis for the public to grasp what will drive the Committee’s decisions in the near future.	23	2
201509	2249	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I perceive the need for an attempt to achieve greater consensus on what will both trigger liftoff and drive rate decisions of the Committee as we go forward and then find a way to communicate that consensus to the public.	23	2
201509	2250	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My concern is that, without firming up our guidance, we will continue to fall short of providing the needed clarity about our policy intentions.	23	2
201509	2251	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned the guidance status quo will work at cross-purposes with attaining our objectives.	23	2
201509	2252	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	We will continue to foster a guessing game in the markets that could contribute to unsettled conditions.	23	2
201509	2253	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	I recognize the impracticality of trying to engineer substantial statement changes in the remainder of this meeting.	23	2
201509	2254	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	To offer something concrete, however, I suggest that in the intermeeting period, building on our answers in our SEP submissions 3(c), the Committee conduct a virtual go-round on options for forward guidance as captured in a variety of statement alternatives.	23	2
201509	2255	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	This discussion might also include statement language at liftoff.	23	2
201509	2256	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Again, I will not suggest actual changes to the alternative B statement.	23	2
201509	2257	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	But if asked what, concretely, I have in mind to make guidance more substantive, I would have liked to see, after the first sentence of paragraph 3, something in substance more along these lines:  First, “the Committee is satisfied that there has been sufficient improvement in labor market conditions.”	23	2
201509	2258	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Next, “the Committee expects that, with continued improvement in labor markets and momentum in economic activity more generally, inflation will rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.”	23	2
201509	2259	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Finally, “in making its policy decision at this meeting, the Committee recognized the elevated risks associated with recent economic and financial developments.	23	2
201509	2260	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	When the Committee views these risks to have dissipated—and absent material negative changes in economic conditions—it is prepared to initiate increases in the federal funds rate range.”	23	2
201509	2261	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Because I see an alternative B decision at this meeting as a deferral or a delay, not just a normal course “no decision” in which the Committee holds off for more or better data, I prefer communicating a strong predisposition—with the usual caveats, of course—to lift off at an upcoming meeting.	23	2
201509	2262	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Statement guidance substantively along the lines of what was just suggested would serve this purpose, in my view.	23	2
201509	2263	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2264	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Those are very interesting suggestions.	23	2
201509	2265	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We will follow up.	23	2
201509	2266	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2267	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201509	2268	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2269	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In my view, we have met the conditions for liftoff, and I therefore prefer alternative C.	23	2
201509	2270	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the employment side of the mandate, we are at or very near full employment.	23	2
201509	2271	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unemployment is at or within sight of the natural rate.	23	2
201509	2272	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And many other measures of labor market conditions have approached or exceeded their long-run or steady-state values.	23	2
201509	2273	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This reduction in slack gives me confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years.	23	2
201509	2274	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	The only reason inflation has not made much progress toward that goal is the offset from the drop in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar.	23	2
201509	2275	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, these facts will only temporarily depress the inflation rate.	23	2
201509	2276	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Furthermore, alternative measures of inflation, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s trimmed mean rate, suggest that underlying inflation is already closer to our objective than some other measures would suggest.	23	2
201509	2277	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In considering the appropriate stance of policy, I start with commonly used benchmarks for monetary policy, such as policy rules and the optimal control simulations.	23	2
201509	2278	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on my forecast, nearly all suggest that we should raise rates now or already should have raised rates some time ago.	23	2
201509	2279	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that’s just a starting point for thinking about policy, and there are valid arguments for delay and continuing to err on the side of caution relative to these benchmarks.	23	2
201509	2280	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the zero bound remains a constraint on our ability to deal with adverse shocks.	23	2
201509	2281	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve already done a great deal of keeping rates lower for longer, but this remains a concern.	23	2
201509	2282	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, there are some notable downside risks at present, as many people mentioned, including further dollar appreciation and concerns about growth abroad.	23	2
201509	2283	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, inflation has been running below target for quite some time, and a low-inflation environment remains in effect around the globe.	23	2
201509	2284	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are also compelling arguments in favor of moving sooner rather than later, however.	23	2
201509	2285	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, the long lags of monetary policy require taking out some insurance against the possibility that the high-pressure economy in train for next year will boil over.	23	2
201509	2286	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We do not have the luxury of delaying liftoff until we’ve reached or exceeded both of our policy targets.	23	2
201509	2287	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	At that point, we’d be hopelessly behind the curve.	23	2
201509	2288	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, there are some upside risks to our outlook that balance the downside ones.	23	2
201509	2289	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Lower oil prices haven’t yet sparked a surge in consumption, but that may change as households start interpreting the decline as more permanent.	23	2
201509	2290	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Housing starts, which remain well below historical averages, could also surprise on the upside.	23	2
201509	2291	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Finally, I’m concerned that, by staying at the zero bound for too long, we may be creating new economic and financial imbalances.	23	2
201509	2292	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although these risks appear contained for the present, we already have elevated price-dividend ratios in equity markets, high and growing house-price- to-rent ratios, continued capital movements into emerging market economies, and other riskier investment vehicles that could become problematic.	23	2
201509	2293	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Further delay in raising rates will incite additional search for yield and exacerbate our exposure to costly reversals.	23	2
201509	2294	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	At this point, I want to respond to President Kocherlakota’s question about what it means to boil over.	23	2
201509	2295	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I’m going to go back to June 2005, when I was one of the briefers of the FOMC.	23	2
201509	2296	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We were talking about the housing bubble.	23	2
201509	2297	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	You may disagree with the word “bubble,” but house prices were very elevated in June 2005.	23	2
201509	2298	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	There was a discussion of what that meant for the economy, and I was one of the presenters as a member of the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.	23	2
201509	2299	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I remember then Vice Chairman Geithner asking me during a break, “What do we do about it now?	23	2
201509	2300	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s mid-2005.	23	2
201509	2301	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	House prices are, by our own estimates, 25 or 30 percent overvalued.	23	2
201509	2302	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is already in place.	23	2
201509	2303	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do we raise interest rates and prick the bubble?	23	2
201509	2304	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Or do we wait around and clean up?”	23	2
201509	2305	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, it’s important to remember that this was not in the context of a financial crisis— that’s not what we were worried about at the time.	23	2
201509	2306	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That was perhaps a mistake.	23	2
201509	2307	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We were worried about what would happen if house prices fell 20, 25, or 30 percent, and then about what effect that would have on the economy, just from purely macroeconomic concerns.	23	2
201509	2308	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	What I realized personally in that sidebar conversation was, I didn’t actually have a good answer.	23	2
201509	2309	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Once the overvaluation of house prices had already occurred, we didn’t have good options regarding how to reduce these imbalances.	23	2
201509	2310	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Raising interest rates sharply would create, clearly, huge negative repercussions and probably would accelerate the decline in the housing market, which was unsustainable.	23	2
201509	2311	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Waiting around to see what happens and clean up afterward obviously wasn’t a good answer.	23	2
201509	2312	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I came away from the conversation thinking about that for the past 10 years, and I realized, you know, the time to have that conversation was in 2002 and 2003.	23	2
201509	2313	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s when we first saw signs that things were getting out of whack—concerns about and risks to the economy were rising.	23	2
201509	2314	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And thinking about where the tradeoffs really were at that point—not being driven by housing or stock market bubbles, because we went through this in the 1990s, too, but really weighing what the costs are of seeing how far this economy will go and taking into consideration those risks before they actually become problematic.	23	2
201509	2315	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me put that in context.	23	2
201509	2316	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Today, according to a standard measure, the house-price-to- rent ratio is about 30 percent above historical norms.	23	2
201509	2317	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	We can disagree about what the average level is—and the Board’s staff has its own views on this—but if you take historical norms between 1980 and 2000, the standard price-to-rent ratio is about where we were in 2003.	23	2
201509	2318	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	And house prices are rising very dramatically today.	23	2
201509	2319	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I’m not talking about a financial crisis, because regarding our bank supervision and financial stability, I think we’re in a situation that’s 10 times better.	23	2
201509	2320	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of macroeconomic risk—the risk that, a couple of years from now, we’ll be in a situation in which the economy is threatened, whether by asset prices in general or other imbalances—I believe there are real concerns.	23	2
201509	2321	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t want to get into the position, once we’re in the situation that we faced 10 years ago, of having to ask, “Well, what do we do now?”	23	2
201509	2322	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the past, I’ve weighed these pros and cons and come down on the side of delaying liftoff.	23	2
201509	2323	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the ongoing improvement in the labor market and the general economy has tilted the balance of these arguments in favor of raising rates sooner rather than later.	23	2
201509	2324	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	I therefore believe that a rate increase today will be the best policy choice.	23	2
201509	2325	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, I recognize that it is a close call, and I did listen very carefully, Chair Yellen, to your weighing of these issues.	23	2
201509	2326	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, a different weighting of the pros and cons that you described may lead one to prefer delaying liftoff until the next meeting or even the one thereafter.	23	2
201509	2327	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	As such, I’m willing to be patient and support alternative B today as written.	23	2
201509	2328	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I do think it is important, picking up on the comments of President Lockhart, that we do keep all future meetings live, including October.	23	2
201509	2329	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	If developments between now and then argue for liftoff, we should be ready to take that action, call a press conference, and provide an opportunity for the Chair to explain our decision at that time.	23	2
201509	2330	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2331	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2332	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201509	2333	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2334	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201509	2335	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I did not view this decision today as a close call.	23	2
201509	2336	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	With little time to process recent financial market movements and international concerns, we need more time to understand whether there’s been a more significant underlying change in economic fundamentals.	23	2
201509	2337	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The first footnote in Tealbook A makes clear that the economic effect of delaying a tightening by a meeting or two would have a de minimis effect on variables we care about.	23	2
201509	2338	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Tightening at this meeting, with excessive volatility and using new tools to get us off the zero lower bound, risks a much more complicated start to our tightening cycle.	23	2
201509	2339	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It also risks the possibility of tightening at the start of a more significant global slowdown, which is not in my modal forecast but is now a more elevated risk.	23	2
201509	2340	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Reasonable risk management leads me to want to see more data before acting.	23	2
201509	2341	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	That said, I do view the time to raise rates as being near.	23	2
201509	2342	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the U-3 unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic to summarize labor market conditions, it also should not be ignored.	23	2
201509	2343	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Employment growth has been pretty strong this year, and broader measures of slack—	23	2
201509	2344	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	U-4, U-5, and U-6—have also improved significantly.	23	2
201509	2345	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we’ve underestimated how quickly unemployment rates would decline, it is possible that we will face much tighter labor markets sooner than I have in my forecast.	23	2
201509	2346	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If that were to happen, I would expect less delay in reaching our inflation target.	23	2
201509	2347	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the recent market volatility and the uncertainty about the inflation forecast, I would prefer that our tightening, whenever it begins, be quite gradual.	23	2
201509	2348	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	A risk to waiting too long to lift off is that we may need to tighten more quickly than is in my SEP forecast.	23	2
201509	2349	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, waiting until next year risks a more pronounced decline in unemployment than is in my modal forecast and a more rapid return to 2 percent inflation than we currently envision.	23	2
201509	2350	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Under those conditions, we would be caught behind the curve and need to make a more rapid adjustment to policy.	23	2
201509	2351	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d prefer to avoid such a circumstance.	23	2
201509	2352	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would like each of the meetings, whether they coincide with an SEP release and a planned press conference, to be live.	23	2
201509	2353	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the domestic and global economy is slowing down, there will be no need to tighten.	23	2
201509	2354	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, if labor markets continue to improve and the recent financial market turbulence does not leave much trace in the data going forward, it seems prudent to me to begin a gradual tightening process relatively soon.	23	2
201509	2355	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have a couple of quick comments on the reinvestment discussion.	23	2
201509	2356	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I didn’t comment yesterday because I wanted to process people’s comments.	23	2
201509	2357	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I had a couple of quick takeaways.	23	2
201509	2358	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, when we don’t know what we will do, I don’t think we should provide forward guidance.	23	2
201509	2359	2015-09-17	meeting		[Laughter]	23	2
201509	2360	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I disagree.	23	2
201509	2361	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201509	2362	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can imagine a scenario in which we actually sell long-term assets.	23	2
201509	2363	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is the tabletop scenario, where we meet our dual-mandate goals but commercial real estate and residential real estate are in a bubble, somewhat like what President Williams was talking about.	23	2
201509	2364	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that case, I would certainly consider selling long-term assets, with the very purpose of steepening the yield curve.	23	2
201509	2365	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can also imagine a scenario in which we maintain a large balance sheet.	23	2
201509	2366	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the equilibrium real federal funds rate is low, we may want to keep long rates low and short rates higher than otherwise to minimize the chance that we return to the zero lower bound.	23	2
201509	2367	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	It has been costly to be at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201509	2368	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer to minimize the chance that we return there.	23	2
201509	2369	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are not willing to raise our inflation target, we should consider maintaining a higher balance sheet.	23	2
201509	2370	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	The discussion yesterday was very good but implied to me that we should maintain balance sheet flexibility as prudent risk management.	23	2
201509	2371	2015-09-17	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2372	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2373	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201509	2374	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2375	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative C for today.	23	2
201509	2376	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 4, I support adding the bracketed “balanced approach” language.	23	2
201509	2377	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 5, I suggest using the language in the bracketed choice “at least during the early stages of normalization.”	23	2
201509	2378	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I remain very concerned that a decision at this meeting to adopt alternative B will essentially cement the idea of a “Yellen put” in the eyes of financial markets.	23	2
201509	2379	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The added language in alternative B, paragraph 2, basically says that the global selloff during the intermeeting period is our basis for nonaction.	23	2
201509	2380	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	No amount of explaining will disguise this fact.	23	2
201509	2381	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The message will be lost on no one.	23	2
201509	2382	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’re kidding ourselves about what this means for the future of the Committee.	23	2
201509	2383	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The problem with this is that it will create questions as to how the Committee will react to future selloffs or booms in financial markets.	23	2
201509	2384	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Many argued yesterday that the implications for US growth and inflation, not the global financial turmoil, were the key determinants of this decision.	23	2
201509	2385	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	However, most of the weak spots around the world have been well known—Brazil and Russia were cited yesterday—and were widely discussed at previous meetings.	23	2
201509	2386	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Chinese devaluation was indeed a surprise to markets during the intermeeting period, but it was not a big enough event to have a meaningful impact on US monetary policy strategy.	23	2
201509	2387	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Chinese growth is, indeed, slowing and will continue to slow in coming years, but this has been well known for some time and hardly qualifies as news.	23	2
201509	2388	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The evidence of an actual hard landing in China is very limited, and our own staff assessment is that such a scenario is unlikely, on the basis of the data available today.	23	2
201509	2389	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In a nutshell, we are making a decision today that emphasizes vague, unspecified, and likely quantitatively small effects on the US economy emanating from the RMB depreciation decision.	23	2
201509	2390	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This is not a good basis for US monetary policy strategy.	23	2
201509	2391	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Some are claiming that global commodity price declines are the driving factor here, but, on balance, this is a bullish factor for the United States, not a bearish factor.	23	2
201509	2392	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	One of my concerns is that we are sending a very muddled message about our reaction function.	23	2
201509	2393	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	We have in many ways become very discretionary in our policy choices, citing different factors on different days, even when the general nature of the economic situation has not changed appreciably.	23	2
201509	2394	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Concerning inflation, I’m delighted to learn that there’s been a sudden shift in sentiment on the Committee toward strict inflation targeting—that is, running monetary policy with heavy emphasis on inflation and little or no emphasis on output or employment gaps.	23	2
201509	2395	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I actually think this would be a reasonable way to proceed and could lead to reasonably good policy in the United States, but it has not enjoyed as much popularity in the past as it has recently.	23	2
201509	2396	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	However, there is a problem with what I’m calling strict inflation-targeting approaches in the current circumstances.	23	2
201509	2397	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Strict inflation targeting says that the reason we are still at the zero lower bound is that inflation is below target.	23	2
201509	2398	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	This would be a good reason to be at perhaps a 2 percent policy rate, still well below long-run normal levels.	23	2
201509	2399	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	But it is not a good reason to be near zero on the policy rate, 350 basis points below normal levels.	23	2
201509	2400	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	That suggests a very high elasticity of the federal funds rate to the inflation gap.	23	2
201509	2401	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In other words, a relatively small inflation gap implies a lot of accommodation—a 0 percent federal funds rate.	23	2
201509	2402	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	What that means is, as inflation rises, the federal funds rate will, at least if you are taking this approach, rise very quickly, and that is not what the Committee is saying.	23	2
201509	2403	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Fischer’s assessment from yesterday on the idea that temporary factors are influencing inflation, as many have said around here.	23	2
201509	2404	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	As these abate, a strict inflation-targeting approach would suggest a rapid increase in the policy rate.	23	2
201509	2405	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	We’re evidently not planning to do that, so it’s exactly this process that will lead to perceptions that the Committee is far behind the proverbial curve.	23	2
201509	2406	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I see this as a poor decision today, and I just want to think about what the fallout will be and how the Committee has to manage going forward.	23	2
201509	2407	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Even though I think we’re not making a good decision here, we can make good decisions in the future.	23	2
201509	2408	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	I see four consequences.	23	2
201509	2409	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	First, I think that the Committee will be viewed as shifting to a “late and fast” strategy and away from an “early and gradual” strategy.	23	2
201509	2410	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The perception in markets, which is already there, will be that the Committee will not move until we’re forced into action.	23	2
201509	2411	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	It also suggests that the Committee is perhaps more willing to scramble to catch up, if necessary—or at least that’s the way we’re weighing that risk.	23	2
201509	2412	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Second, this shift toward a late-and-fast strategy, combined with an undefined reaction function, will mean even more volatility in the future due to uncertainty about Fed policy than we would otherwise have.	23	2
201509	2413	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	What we’re saying, essentially, is that when the Committee moves, it may have to move faster.	23	2
201509	2414	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, it is not that clear what the Committee might react to, because we’re taking a very discretionary approach to our policy and a very eclectic approach to what variables we want to cite in making our policy decision.	23	2
201509	2415	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Third, I think there’s more risk now of an outsized increase in rates at some point in the future, not unlike the moves of 50 or 75 basis points that were made in 1994.	23	2
201509	2416	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	If you’re going to play the late-and-fast strategy, then you’ve got to possibly be ready to move more quickly than I think the Committee is currently ready for.	23	2
201509	2417	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Markets will sense this, and this will create additional uncertainty in financial markets.	23	2
201509	2418	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, I think there will be a continued and exacerbated mismatch between market expectations and FOMC expectations about future policy.	23	2
201509	2419	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee will now put out its SEP.	23	2
201509	2420	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	It will have a policy rate path, but those in the markets that think the Committee will never move will be emboldened to move even further into the future.	23	2
201509	2421	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	So there will be more of a gap now between what the FOMC expects regarding monetary policy and what the market expects.	23	2
201509	2422	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Those gaps can’t persist indefinitely.	23	2
201509	2423	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	They have to be reconciled at some point, and that process leads to additional volatility in markets and is part of what was going on here, I think, during the summer.	23	2
201509	2424	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Those are my four takeaways for the consequences of today’s decision.	23	2
201509	2425	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Again, I support alternative C.	23	2
201509	2426	2015-09-17	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2427	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2428	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201509	2429	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2430	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I believe there’s a strong case for moving the federal funds rate up at this meeting.	23	2
201509	2431	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The Committee has laid out two criteria for liftoff—some further improvement in labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to our target of 2 percent over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2432	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In my view, those conditions have been met.	23	2
201509	2433	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Labor market conditions certainly continued to improve over the intermeeting period, and, in my view, the economy is at or nearly at full employment from the standpoint of the Fed’s dual-mandate goal.	23	2
201509	2434	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The inflation criterion for liftoff is appropriately based on the expected path of inflation and not on its current level.	23	2
201509	2435	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	No doubt inflation has been running below our goal of 2 percent, but the effects of last summer’s oil price decline and fall in import prices have been passing through to the headline inflation numbers.	23	2
201509	2436	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	This, combined with the fact that the labor market has been tightening faster than expected and inflation expectations have been generally stable even in the face of commodity price declines, should give us more confidence in our inflation forecast.	23	2
201509	2437	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Starting normalization before we reach our dual-mandate goals is prudent if we want to minimize the risk that we’ll have to move rates up considerably more aggressively than we’re currently anticipating.	23	2
201509	2438	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been indicating for some time that we expect a gradual path.	23	2
201509	2439	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I would like us to take actions that help maintain the credibility of that scheme.	23	2
201509	2440	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	As Governor Fischer said at our July meeting, the data control the gradualness.	23	2
201509	2441	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	However, our policy actions can influence the data by influencing how the economy evolves.	23	2
201509	2442	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Now, should the recent volatility in financial markets give us pause?	23	2
201509	2443	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I think not.	23	2
201509	2444	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The economy has fared well through it.	23	2
201509	2445	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Volatility measures and risk spreads remain elevated but are moving back down.	23	2
201509	2446	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	As Chair Yellen pointed out, the decision to act depends on an assessment of the risks.	23	2
201509	2447	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I view the change in financial conditions and reassessment of global growth since our July meeting as a downside risk to the outlook rather than implying much change to the modal outlook.	23	2
201509	2448	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But we’ve taken out insurance against this downside risk by keeping interest rates considerably lower than almost all of the policy rules suggest, even as the Tealbook- consistent equilibrium interest rate has been rising—in this Tealbook it’s now 0.47 percent.	23	2
201509	2449	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I believe that Chair Yellen’s insightful leadership of the Committee has prepared the public for liftoff.	23	2
201509	2450	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In the current environment, after keeping the funds rate at zero for over six years, I would expect some residual uncertainty surrounding the decision.	23	2
201509	2451	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The fact that there’s not unanimity across market participants and forecasters that liftoff will occur at this particular meeting doesn’t deter me.	23	2
201509	2452	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Most are still expecting a rate hike this year, and a resolution of some policy uncertainty might actually be viewed favorably.	23	2
201509	2453	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In addition, no matter how well we have prepared and signaled such a change, I’d expect some volatility in the markets at liftoff.	23	2
201509	2454	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I don’t think we should be too bothered by that, either.	23	2
201509	2455	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	What would concern me more is if, on liftoff, the public’s expectation about the path of policy after liftoff changes and becomes much steeper than the path we’re currently anticipating.	23	2
201509	2456	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	In other words, might liftoff be read as the beginning of rate increases at each meeting thereafter so that we have a steep path going up?	23	2
201509	2457	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	The Chair has emphasized that the Committee anticipates that economic conditions will evolve in a way that warrants keeping the funds rate below its longer-run level for some time.	23	2
201509	2458	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	This certainly shows up in our SEP.	23	2
201509	2459	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But the market path implied by market data is considerably shallower than in the SEP, which suggests that the message of a gradual path is coming through loud and clear.	23	2
201509	2460	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thus, while there is some risk that the act of liftoff may appreciably change policy expectations, I believe appropriate communications at liftoff will be sufficient to mitigate this risk.	23	2
201509	2461	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Chair Yellen and the Committee have navigated some very difficult waters over the past year, as the start of normalization is near.	23	2
201509	2462	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	With considerable effort, we’ve reached a point at which there is a favorable alignment of expectations of a rate increase and the data that support such an increase.	23	2
201509	2463	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe this is something we should take for granted.	23	2
201509	2464	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Current economic circumstances are very favorable in terms of being able to communicate the rationale for action and post-liftoff policy, and careful communication is a crucial component of a successful liftoff.	23	2
201509	2465	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Yes, there are risks to moving.	23	2
201509	2466	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	But there are also risks to not moving, including having to move more aggressively later on if we delay too much further.	23	2
201509	2467	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Action is going to send a signal, but so will inaction.	23	2
201509	2468	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	We may not see such favorable conditions for communications for some time.	23	2
201509	2469	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I believe we should seize the day and act.	23	2
201509	2470	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Of course, I do understand that this is not the majority view, and I respect colleagues who see things differently.	23	2
201509	2471	2015-09-17	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2472	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2473	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23	2
201509	2474	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2475	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Given my economic forecast, I continue to hold the position that it is quite important that monetary policy begin to raise rates.	23	2
201509	2476	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	However, I am not adamant that it be done at this meeting.	23	2
201509	2477	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The recent turbulence in financial markets and the softening of energy prices and price pressures in general probably make this meeting less than optimal for liftoff, although I expect these are temporary headwinds.	23	2
201509	2478	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	It is, however, my strong belief that we should begin our normalization process sooner rather than later, and that the process should be gradual.	23	2
201509	2479	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	At the least, the statement language should make clear that if we continue to see improvements in the labor market over the next couple of months, the Committee will move to raise rates.	23	2
201509	2480	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Earlier liftoff makes a gradual path of policy firming more likely, and it will still allow us to maintain an accommodative policy stance for some time.	23	2
201509	2481	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	I’m becoming concerned that we will find ourselves treating every bump in the economic road as a reason for delay, with the effect that monetary policy moves further and further from what can reasonably be viewed as normal.	23	2
201509	2482	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	The longer we wait in anticipation that all signs point in the same direction, the more likely it will be that future policy adjustments will need to be very aggressive, and I worry about the economic consequences of being in that position.	23	2
201509	2483	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Beginning normalization should send a reassuring message and will underscore the belief that the economy is on solid footing, and that inflation will return to target.	23	2
201509	2484	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	It seems that the least normal element of the current economic environment is our inability to return monetary policy to a more normal mode of conduct.	23	2
201509	2485	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Like Presidents Williams and Rosengren, I also encourage the Committee to consider every meeting, including October, as a potential and appropriate time for liftoff.	23	2
201509	2486	2015-09-17	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2487	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2488	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23	2
201509	2489	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2490	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Based on economic data and the outlook for the economy discussed yesterday, I do believe we’re at a point at which it’s appropriate to begin the process of removing accommodation—if not today, then very soon.	23	2
201509	2491	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I do support alternative B today because I am of the view that economic conditions abroad might have the potential to spill over to the United States, thereby increasing the uncertainty about the US outlook and negatively affecting data in the months ahead.	23	2
201509	2492	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	However, I would say that I believe these non-US economic uncertainties will continue for some extended period.	23	2
201509	2493	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, I don’t believe the overall level of this uncertainty is going to diminish in the coming months.	23	2
201509	2494	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	The nature of the weakness and spillover threats from abroad relates to deeply embedded, in some cases, structural, demographic, and other issues that are likely to take years, versus months, to manage and address.	23	2
201509	2495	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	So my preference would be that we soon begin the process of removing accommodation and address these potential spillover threats by adjusting the expected path of accommodation, versus delaying much further the start of the process.	23	2
201509	2496	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In my view, delaying for too long the start of the process of removing accommodation at this stage carries a cost.	23	2
201509	2497	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	While a lower unemployment rate, of course, is desirable, it has the potential to create unhealthy imbalances if it’s supported by artificially accommodative financial conditions.	23	2
201509	2498	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Such conditions maintained for too long may encourage investment and borrowing decisions that cannot easily be reversed or unwound when policy eventually normalizes, as it must.	23	2
201509	2499	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	This increases the chances, in my view, of a hard landing, which, to me, means excess investment, inventory buildup, and financial asset valuations that are more likely to lead to negative economic effects later when more normal policy is put into place.	23	2
201509	2500	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	In my experience, imbalances like these are often not obvious until after the fact, and they need not be accompanied by above-target inflation.	23	2
201509	2501	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	So I would say that, on the upside, prudent risk management dictates that we begin the process of scaling back accommodation as the economy approaches our best estimate of potential.	23	2
201509	2502	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	I can and do support alternative B as written at this meeting, though, because I believe that it is prudent to use the next several weeks or months to confirm that conditions for liftoff are sustainable, allowing us to act in October or December.	23	2
201509	2503	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	But I would suggest that, in the statement, we send a signal that the economy has moved closer to satisfying the conditions for liftoff by substituting the word “approaching” for the phrase “continuing to move toward” in the third sentence of paragraph 2 in alternative B.	23	2
201509	2504	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	So, in that third sentence, it currently says “continuing to move toward,” and my suggestion is to instead substitute the word “approaching.”	23	2
201509	2505	2015-09-17	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2506	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2507	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201509	2508	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2509	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate your earlier comments today, and let me say I have full confidence that, in your press conference today, you’ll describe the conditions for our decision.	23	2
201509	2510	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B, which leaves our policy rate unchanged.	23	2
201509	2511	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Even with unchanged policy, I expect that inflation will remain too low for too long.	23	2
201509	2512	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	And if we start moving rates up too soon, I fear the FOMC could lose credibility on its commitment to a symmetric 2 percent objective.	23	2
201509	2513	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	This loss could risk de-anchoring inflationary expectations, with profound consequences in the longer run.	23	2
201509	2514	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The Bank of Japan, the ECB, and other central banks have risked and arguably lost credibility with regard to their inflation targets, and they may well be facing more difficult economic circumstances because of those earlier policy choices.	23	2
201509	2515	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We should continue to tread warily so that our own policy choices don’t lead us down the same path.	23	2
201509	2516	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	When I consider the outlook, I find it difficult to have much confidence that inflation will sustainably get to 2 percent over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2517	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, if we don’t keep an appropriately high level of accommodation in place, we risk this cycle ending with inflation topping out below 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2518	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	That would certainly jeopardize faith in our target.	23	2
201509	2519	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Around the world, downside inflation risks abound.	23	2
201509	2520	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Since our June SEP round, the United States has been buffeted by additional disinflationary headwinds from low energy, commodity, and imported goods prices.	23	2
201509	2521	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In the US, the improvement in the labor market has not yet produced any meaningful signs of wage or cost pressures.	23	2
201509	2522	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	It’s no wonder that none of my business contacts cite any concerns about rising inflationary pressures.	23	2
201509	2523	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	There’s another reason I find it hard to be confident that we are headed to 2 percent inflation at an appropriate pace.	23	2
201509	2524	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I’m referring to what I think must be a concern by many on this Committee about a modest overshooting of our inflation target.	23	2
201509	2525	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, I will say that in my initial prepared remarks here, I had “tacit concern.”	23	2
201509	2526	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But it turns out you were much more explicit in your own concern about overshooting, and I think others have been today as well.	23	2
201509	2527	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I sense that many participants’ SEP forecasts are trying to thread the needle to get to 2 percent without any risk of overshooting.	23	2
201509	2528	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	With inflation so very low, that’s the only way I can rationalize some of our SEP policy rate paths, at least given my outlook.	23	2
201509	2529	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I infer that these paths reflect a serious aversion to PCE inflation heading to, say, 2½ percent.	23	2
201509	2530	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But after six or seven years of inflation averaging 1½ percent, whether we briefly touch 2 percent during that time isn’t really relevant.	23	2
201509	2531	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	And with forecasts for several more years below target, we should be very nervous about advocating policies that seek to eliminate any chance of 2½ percent inflation.	23	2
201509	2532	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Outsized concerns over exceeding 2 percent inflation will risk signaling that our price objective is a ceiling and not a symmetric target.	23	2
201509	2533	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	It also risks us joining other central banks that are struggling with the consequences of not sufficiently defending their inflation objectives from below and of ignoring the added risk emanating from the zero lower bound.	23	2
201509	2534	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, I don’t see much risk of inflation running anywhere near 2½ percent over the forecast period.	23	2
201509	2535	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	To the contrary, the inflation risks largely seem to be to the downside.	23	2
201509	2536	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook alternative scenarios highlight this.	23	2
201509	2537	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Like President Kocherlakota, I can’t recall the last time every alternative simulation was more pessimistic about inflation than the baseline scenario, which isn’t that optimistic to start with.	23	2
201509	2538	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	From a risk-management perspective, these adverse alternatives suggest there could be significant benefits to delaying any substantial increase in the funds rate in order to build up a buffer stock of inflation pressures.	23	2
201509	2539	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	In turn, such a buffer would reduce the risk of returning to the zero lower bound if these plausible shocks indeed come to pass.	23	2
201509	2540	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Another way to put this is that our policies should allow a higher probability of inflation rising to the range of 2 to 2½ percent for a time.	23	2
201509	2541	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	To achieve a symmetric 2 percent objective in the face of the likely asymmetric policy risks emanating from the nonlinearity of the zero lower bound, we have to allow ourselves a reasonable chance of going above 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2542	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Less bold action could signal that we were content to have PCE inflation settle in at 1.5 to 1.9 percent, the latter being the Tealbook outlook in 2018.	23	2
201509	2543	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	My SEP date for policy liftoff is June 2016.	23	2
201509	2544	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	This is not as extreme as the dot chart might suggest.	23	2
201509	2545	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	After all, my overall funds rate path is not all that different from the implications of the Tealbook’s path.	23	2
201509	2546	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	If things play out as expected, the differences are mainly around near-term timing.	23	2
201509	2547	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	My SEP submission delays liftoff both to build a risk-management buffer and to allow us time to better assess the outlook before making a policy move.	23	2
201509	2548	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	At the end of 2016, I have the funds rate range at 75 to 100 basis points.	23	2
201509	2549	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	From today, that’s a total of three increases of 25 basis points each.	23	2
201509	2550	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	My subsequent path is a touch steeper than the Tealbook’s, so we both arrive at about the same rate by the end of 2018.	23	2
201509	2551	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I believe that lower rates in the near term, followed by a bit faster ascent after we have more confidence in the inflation outlook, would allow for better risk assessment and would be appropriate as long as our inflation outlook is below 2½ percent.	23	2
201509	2552	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Again, the way to get to 2 percent within a reasonable period of time, or at all, is to make sure you give yourself a reasonable chance of getting to 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2553	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Finally, I think our medium-term policy focus should be on communicating our commitment to a 2 percent symmetric PCE inflation objective.	23	2
201509	2554	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Like President Lockhart, I feel that the term “data dependence” hasn’t been sufficient for the public to understand how policy will react to incoming data.	23	2
201509	2555	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	But I believe President Lockhart’s suggestions are limited to clarifying when liftoff will take place.	23	2
201509	2556	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	We need more than that.	23	2
201509	2557	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Providing more information with respect to our funds rate path milestones and how they relate to the inflation outlook would be quite valuable for supporting the achievement of our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201509	2558	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	The SEP dot chart should be helpful on this score if we focus most of our communications on the central portions of the chart.	23	2
201509	2559	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Saying “more gradual than normal” isn’t enough unless we say it a lot.	23	2
201509	2560	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Beyond today, if inflation headwinds continue to challenge our outlook even as we begin liftoff, then I think our communications, especially those discussing data dependence, will need to signal even more aggressively our full commitment to achieving our 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.	23	2
201509	2561	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201509	2562	2015-09-17	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2563	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2564	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201509	2565	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2566	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Alternative C aligns with my own views of the economy’s continued expansion, even in the face of various headwinds over the past several years—an economy that warrants a continued accommodative stance of policy but not zero interest rates, in my view.	23	2
201509	2567	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The benchmark policy rules that supported the Committee’s decisions to add accommodation via LSAPs several years ago are the same ones that have been signaling for some time that a shift in policy is appropriate.	23	2
201509	2568	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	However, for a Committee that has lacked reasonable confidence to begin a gradual normalization over the past few meetings, the prospects of liftoff in the face of global growth uncertainty and the related headwinds to the United States are actually less compelling, I think, today.	23	2
201509	2569	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I understand the desire to wait for a few more meetings, with the intention of having a clearer picture of the outlook.	23	2
201509	2570	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting for more certainty over the course of a few more meetings may seem comforting and costless.	23	2
201509	2571	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I think it carries its own cumulative risk.	23	2
201509	2572	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	The potential exists to get caught in a time-inconsistency trap by projecting liftoff in the near future but, when the time comes, lacking the conviction to carry out the policies underpinning our projections because of wanting to see just a few more data points.	23	2
201509	2573	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	I’ll offer three brief thoughts for today’s decision.	23	2
201509	2574	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	First, in view of the continued improvement in labor market conditions, the decision not to lift off at this meeting must surely reflect the Committee as not yet having reasonable confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2575	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	If this point is not emphasized, markets may view our reaction function as now incorporating things like market volatility and foreign developments into our near-term decisionmaking process.	23	2
201509	2576	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Second, I believe the heavy emphasis on data dependence is injecting substantial uncertainty into markets and is too backward looking.	23	2
201509	2577	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	So, in addition to data dependence, monetary policy needs to emphasize being forward looking.	23	2
201509	2578	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	We should place more emphasis on how incoming data are affecting our assessment of the outlook rather than inadvertently sending a message that we’re responding to the most recent data points.	23	2
201509	2579	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, postponing liftoff increases the probability that rates will have to be increased more rapidly than we currently anticipate.	23	2
201509	2580	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting until inflation is nearer to 2 percent and unemployment is below its longer-run normal rate may put the Committee in a difficult position of having to adjust rates more steeply and, as a result, create heightened risk around financial stability and our growth outlook.	23	2
201509	2581	2015-09-17	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2582	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2583	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201509	2584	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2585	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m going to do the risky thing here and try to be more reactive to comments that have been offered around the table than I customarily would be.	23	2
201509	2586	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will start with what President George just said, which is that the Committee should do more both internally and externally to emphasize the need to condition monetary policy on the outlook.	23	2
201509	2587	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should always be seeking to make policy to align the medium-term outlook for our goal variables of prices and employment with our longer-term objectives.	23	2
201509	2588	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, when I say the term “outlook,”	23	2
201509	2589	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I mean to include risks to that outlook as well.	23	2
201509	2590	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As President Evans emphasized, those risks really are all asymmetrically on the downside at this stage because of the zero lower bound and our inability to be able to respond effectively to those risks.	23	2
201509	2591	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What I heard from many around the table is a desire to incorporate other considerations besides the outlook into our thinking.	23	2
201509	2592	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Lacker started off by talking about how the Taylor rule had given very good outcomes for us in the past.	23	2
201509	2593	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Embedded in the Taylor rule is a sense of the desirability to have interest rates close to their long-run normal level.	23	2
201509	2594	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Lockhart talked about being satisfied with gradually moving back toward 2 percent over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2595	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we want to be aligned between our medium-term outlook and our long-run goals.	23	2
201509	2596	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have to be more aggressive than that.	23	2
201509	2597	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We want to be actually back to 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2598	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, as President Evans suggested, taking into account the closeness to the effective lower bound, we might want to be willing to have some overshooting in the medium term in terms of our modal inflation outlook, just to guard against those downside risks.	23	2
201509	2599	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Several people talked about being concerned about disliking rapid increases in interest rates.	23	2
201509	2600	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Again, this is introducing a non-goal-oriented consideration into your policy decisionmaking.	23	2
201509	2601	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To offer some context, when we’re talking about rapid increases in interest rates, we’re talking about increases faster than 25 basis points a quarter.	23	2
201509	2602	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to offer that the baseline in the SEP is 25 basis points per quarter.	23	2
201509	2603	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee—again, as President Evans mentioned—would have a better alignment between its medium-term outlook and its long-run objectives by waiting and then raising rates at a slightly faster pace.	23	2
201509	2604	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Something more like the 2004–06 pace, which I believe was actually viewed as fairly measured, would deliver a better outcome.	23	2
201509	2605	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The next few meetings and the decisionmaking around liftoff are really critical not just for the course of policy in the near term and how it’s going to affect the economy, but also in terms of setting up the strategic framework of how the Committee is going to think about policy.	23	2
201509	2606	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We continue to be overly influenced by a collection of Taylor-like rules.	23	2
201509	2607	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I suggested yesterday that this had served the Committee extremely poorly during the course of the recovery.	23	2
201509	2608	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To try to clarify one of my points in that discussion about November 2009, that was not a QE meeting.	23	2
201509	2609	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It was a meeting in which the Committee had terminated QE1, and was thinking about, how do we best time the removal of accommodation—specifically, the increase of interest rates—with the improvement in the economy so as to best support the recovery?	23	2
201509	2610	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The debate within the Committee, shaped by Taylor rules, had the dovish side in the 8s in terms of the unemployment rate and the hawkish side in the 9s.	23	2
201509	2611	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was there.	23	2
201509	2612	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was on the Committee at the time, so this is about self-reflection and self-criticism as much as anything else.	23	2
201509	2613	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is about the problem with our framework that was in place before 2008 imprisoning the Committee into an unduly slow recovery.	23	2
201509	2614	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We do not want to have that happen again.	23	2
201509	2615	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The way you don’t have that happen again is by conditioning the policy decisions now about liftoff and afterward much more firmly on the outlook for prices and employment and by building in, I think, risk protections along the lines that President Evans has suggested.	23	2
201509	2616	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I look at what’s happening in the world, and we look at all of the experiences countries have had in trying to escape the zero lower bound.	23	2
201509	2617	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I am drawn, Madam Chair, to alternative A.	23	2
201509	2618	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do not think that this is the time to be considering liftoff.	23	2
201509	2619	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I look at what’s been happening with regard to how financial markets are considering the credibility of our target.	23	2
201509	2620	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Without meaning to be overly critical, as I listen to this debate, I can understand why financial markets are doubting the credibility of our target, because there’s just a comfort level with, “Eventually, we have to get back to 2 percent.	23	2
201509	2621	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s got to happen.”	23	2
201509	2622	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That only happens if we make decisions to make it happen.	23	2
201509	2623	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is how we get credibility for our target.	23	2
201509	2624	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s how Paul Volcker got credibility for the target in the 1980s.	23	2
201509	2625	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s how we have to get there.	23	2
201509	2626	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s through our decisions.	23	2
201509	2627	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we remove accommodation now, with inflation running as low as it is and projected to take as long as it is to get back to target, we are not sending the right message about credibility.	23	2
201509	2628	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am drawn to alternative A.	23	2
201509	2629	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that will set us up better to have a framework that is explicitly goal oriented.	23	2
201509	2630	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’ll allow us to respond more effectively to shocks going forward, as opposed to putting weight on having interest rates at some normal level.	23	2
201509	2631	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The only thing that “normal level” should mean for this Committee is that we are hitting our price and employment objectives over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2632	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll close in terms of President Williams’s point.	23	2
201509	2633	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought it was a very telling and compelling one, in part because I bought a house in June 2005, so it really—	23	2
201509	2634	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	It hurts.	23	2
201509	2635	2015-09-17	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201509	2636	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It did hurt.	23	2
201509	2637	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a challenging issue, and it deserves a lot more attention from the Committee.	23	2
201509	2638	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is the fact that house prices are 30 percent overvalued right now a reason to be less accommodative?	23	2
201509	2639	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s a subject that should be discussed.	23	2
201509	2640	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will point out that, as I’m sure President Williams knows, if the Laubach-Williams natural real rate is going to be low for a long time to come, house prices are going to be elevated relative to historical norms, and that’s something we’re going to have to live with if we want to hit our goal variables.	23	2
201509	2641	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s the only comment I’ll offer on that.	23	2
201509	2642	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I appreciated your setting out the alternatives at the beginning, but I felt you left out the most compelling one, which was alternative A.	23	2
201509	2643	2015-09-17	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	23	2
201509	2644	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2645	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201509	2646	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2647	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I thought we had an exceptionally interesting discussion yesterday, and I’d like to start by reflecting on it.	23	2
201509	2648	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Broadly speaking, two sets of views were expressed, and they were also mentioned by the Chair in her opening remarks this morning.	23	2
201509	2649	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The first set of views starts from the two criteria we specified earlier this year that would have to be met before we first raise the interest rate.	23	2
201509	2650	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The criteria we set out were, first, that there be further progress in the strengthening of the labor market and, second, that members of the Committee believe with reasonable confidence that the inflation rate will reach 2 percent in the medium term.	23	2
201509	2651	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	As I explained yesterday, I believe we’ve met those criteria.	23	2
201509	2652	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	To justify that view, one has to explain why, when the actual inflation rate is so far from 2 percent, we can say that we’ve met those criteria.	23	2
201509	2653	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The explanation is simple—that the current low inflation rate is due largely to declines in the price of oil and to the appreciation of the exchange rate, both of which are temporary.	23	2
201509	2654	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	By the calculation I described yesterday—which takes into account not only the difference between the actual and core PCE price deflators, but also the indirect effects on the inflation rate of the decline in the price of oil and of the exchange rate—the underlying inflation rate is approximately 1.6 percent at present.	23	2
201509	2655	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	To be sure, those two criteria are only necessary conditions for raising the interest rate.	23	2
201509	2656	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll say more on that later, for I’ll end by making the case that we can delay raising the federal funds rate beyond the end of this month, but that if current conditions continue, we should raise the federal funds rate before the end of the year.	23	2
201509	2657	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The second set of views starts from the fact that there is no inflation in sight, and that we should not raise the interest rate even though, in the view of many, the labor market is close to the natural rate of unemployment.	23	2
201509	2658	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, we should stay at the effective lower bound, possibly allow the unemployment rate to decline below the natural rate, and raise the interest rate only when we clearly need to deal with the inflation rate, which, if we were writing for the newspapers, we’d say is “when we see the whites of the eyes of inflation.”	23	2
201509	2659	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In this view, we can and should wait before raising the federal funds rate either because the natural rate of unemployment has fallen to well below 5 percent or because we can allow the actual rate of unemployment to fall below the natural rate and thus contribute to dealing with aspects of the labor market that are not yet at what we think is their normal condition—we’re talking about the participation rate, the long-term unemployment ratio, and part-time employment for economic reasons.	23	2
201509	2660	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	When we reach reasonable levels of those variables, we can raise the interest rate and move toward the natural rate of unemployment from below.	23	2
201509	2661	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s important to note that, at least in my view, the explicit adoption of such an approach would be widely viewed as a change in the FOMC’s monetary policy strategy.	23	2
201509	2662	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Now, both of these views have merit.	23	2
201509	2663	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The choice between them has been complicated by developments abroad.	23	2
201509	2664	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Just over a month ago, on August 11, China devalued its exchange rate rather clumsily and after a Shanghai stock market bubble had burst.	23	2
201509	2665	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And there was a bubble.	23	2
201509	2666	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Even the governor of the Chinese central bank described it thus.	23	2
201509	2667	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The Chinese exchange rate move created shock waves, one of which arrived at the New York Stock Exchange on August 24, when the Dow Jones index declined in the morning by over 1,000 points and then closed down by 588 points, about 3.8 percent.	23	2
201509	2668	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	By the way, I wonder whether we’re not going to have sharper, more rapid changes in prices in the stock markets as electronic trading develops further.	23	2
201509	2669	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Subsequently, emerging market and developing-country problems, many of which had started well before the Chinese devaluation, began to draw the attention of markets in the industrialized world.	23	2
201509	2670	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	For example, the Brazilian economy is in trouble.	23	2
201509	2671	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The Russian economy is doing badly.	23	2
201509	2672	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So are other countries in Latin America.	23	2
201509	2673	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So are some countries in Southeast Asia and Africa, and even Canada and Australia are suffering from effects of the declines in the price of oil and of other commodities.	23	2
201509	2674	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Less mentioned are the improvements in the euro zone, the fact that the United Kingdom’s economy is moving ahead well, the expectation that the Indian economy will grow this year at over 7 percent, and the possibility that India is going to be the China of the next I-don’t-know-how-many years.	23	2
201509	2675	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	What are we to do?	23	2
201509	2676	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the choice between going now and going soon is very close.	23	2
201509	2677	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In light of the genuine uncertainty caused by the Chinese devaluation and the subsequent realization that there were other difficulties in the global economy, I can support not raising the interest rate now and waiting until either October or December to raise the rate.	23	2
201509	2678	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve got a series of observations on our discussion that I can’t figure out where to put in this statement at a logical place.	23	2
201509	2679	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So I’ll talk about them now, and, if they’re out of order, you’ll make the appropriate corrections and let me know what they are so that I can improve this in retrospect.	23	2
201509	2680	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, we’re all very concerned about the problems in foreign economies.	23	2
201509	2681	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	When I listen to them, they sound much larger than what I found in the Tealbook in terms of their effects on the US economy.	23	2
201509	2682	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think the Tealbook forecast was made in full knowledge of the situation in the global economy, and we can be sure that the staff attempted to take into account the quantitative effects of the external situation on the US economy.	23	2
201509	2683	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I do believe it appropriate that, besides expressing our worries about foreign economies and describing links between their economies and ours, we should try to make a quantitative estimate of how large those effects are likely to be.	23	2
201509	2684	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	These are, admittedly, early days, but the evidence so far is that those effects will not derail the impressive recovery of the United States’ economy since 2009, where, in particular, the labor market has continued to strengthen at a remarkably steady—indeed, impressive—pace.	23	2
201509	2685	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The next comment I’m going to make is that one keeps hearing about this “unduly slow” recovery.	23	2
201509	2686	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think it’s unduly slow.	23	2
201509	2687	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s remarkable, in fact, what has happened to the unemployment rate.	23	2
201509	2688	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If you’re thinking about GDP, that hasn’t recovered.	23	2
201509	2689	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But the difference between what’s happening to labor and what’s happening to GDP is productivity, and I don’t think monetary policy is responsible for that.	23	2
201509	2690	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I have a few other points.	23	2
201509	2691	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We keep saying we will look through supply shocks, but we don’t.	23	2
201509	2692	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We keep talking about how low the inflation rate is.	23	2
201509	2693	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is largely a result of two large supply shocks, and we’d better remember that we look through supply shocks when one day we find inflation above 2 percent because of supply shocks.	23	2
201509	2694	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We also tend to forget that we have a cushion of 40 basis points as a result of the enlarged balance sheet, as the discussion yesterday of the effects of beginning to run off our portfolio made clear.	23	2
201509	2695	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Another point is, remember that the price of housing is high because we put the interest rate very low.	23	2
201509	2696	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So it may not be a sign of a pathology.	23	2
201509	2697	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It may be a sign of health that monetary policy worked as planned.	23	2
201509	2698	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That, nonetheless, does mean that there’s possibly going to be some pain when we start raising interest rates from the housing market.	23	2
201509	2699	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	There are two more things in the collection of random—but not totally random— observations.	23	2
201509	2700	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Regarding the question of whether the real wage should start rising independent of the behavior of productivity is an interesting one.	23	2
201509	2701	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve had some discussions with people who say, “Well, tell me where productivity comes into the Phillips curve.”	23	2
201509	2702	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Productivity comes in, in fact, in a way that was mentioned yesterday by Governor Powell and, I believe, by someone on the other side of the table—probably President Williams.	23	2
201509	2703	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Productivity affects the demand for labor, and that’s where it comes in.	23	2
201509	2704	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, this is not a scientific observation, but this is one that is useful to remember.	23	2
201509	2705	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think that the experience of what happens when stock prices begin to go down or when something goes wrong in the financial markets is summarized by something Warren Buffett said, which I’m sure is more correctly attributed to someone else.	23	2
201509	2706	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	You know, in the United Kingdom, everything was said by Shakespeare or Churchill.	23	2
201509	2707	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In France, it was de Gaulle.	23	2
201509	2708	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In the United States, it’s Lincoln or Buffett.	23	2
201509	2709	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201509	2710	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Buffett said that when the tide goes out, you see who’s been swimming naked.	23	2
201509	2711	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	And mostly, as you start unwinding some excitement in the financial markets, you discover that there’s a whole lot more that’s been going on than you knew about.	23	2
201509	2712	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is something that gives me pause when we say, “Well, we’re not seeing much in the way of problems right now.”	23	2
201509	2713	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But that’s a general comment.	23	2
201509	2714	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I clearly support alternative B.	23	2
201509	2715	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But I’d like to add that, while we may not yet be at the maximum-employment level and are certainly not at the target inflation rate, I think we can soon comfortably start, and should start, the gradual process of returning to a normal stance of monetary policy.	23	2
201509	2716	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I would like to deal with one issue that is frequently mentioned at this point in the discussion.	23	2
201509	2717	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It’s that of the foreign central banks that raised the interest rate prematurely.	23	2
201509	2718	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I know one of those examples very well.	23	2
201509	2719	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The Bank of Israel was the first central bank to raise its interest rate in 2009.	23	2
201509	2720	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It raised the rate from 50 basis points to 75 basis points.	23	2
201509	2721	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It did that because the economy was growing and inflation was above the target range, largely due to the fact that housing prices were rising rapidly.	23	2
201509	2722	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It stayed on this path of raising rates until they reached about 3 percent, when the European crisis developed and the effect of the Federal Reserve’s QE, which had begun after the Bank of Israel had raised the rate, began to become obvious.	23	2
201509	2723	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, they followed Keynes’s advice—when the circumstances changed, we changed policy.	23	2
201509	2724	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That’s what I think has happened in most of these cases.	23	2
201509	2725	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I regard the proof that if you raise the rate, you’re going to raise it too early as not recognizing the dynamics of what was happening in the global economy, where 2009, as was mentioned yesterday, looked like the end of the recession for many.	23	2
201509	2726	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Then, sometime around 2010, we began to realize that, actually, it was more complicated than that and we had to do more.	23	2
201509	2727	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I could say the United States reversed policy.	23	2
201509	2728	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Why?	23	2
201509	2729	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	It invented QE.	23	2
201509	2730	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	So it also cut interest rates.	23	2
201509	2731	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think that that example is worth a whole lot, though it’s become part of, certainly, what I read in the newspapers whenever I see a discussion of this.	23	2
201509	2732	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Now I’ve spoken for too long, but I’m going to speak a little bit longer.	23	2
201509	2733	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Once we become more confident that the global economy is not at the start of a serious crisis, and that the external effect on US economic activity and inflation of foreign developments is likely to be subdued, I believe we should get started.	23	2
201509	2734	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I gave a lot of reasons for that in the July meeting.	23	2
201509	2735	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In the interest of saving time, I won’t repeat all of them now.	23	2
201509	2736	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But let me briefly mention four of the main reasons, with apologies for repeating myself.	23	2
201509	2737	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	First, monetary policy will continue to be very expansionary even after we start moving, for we are not about to lift off vertically.	23	2
201509	2738	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	We are about to begin the process of gradual normalization.	23	2
201509	2739	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I recommend that we think very hard about the assertions made by even highly respected economists and policymakers that raising the federal funds rate at this meeting or in the near future could be an epochal mistake and realize that they’re almost certain to be wrong.	23	2
201509	2740	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Even after we make our first move, monetary policy will be extremely expansionary.	23	2
201509	2741	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Furthermore, this will be a surprise to no one, and many around the world agree that this change should come soon.	23	2
201509	2742	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Some in the emerging market countries even want it as soon as possible.	23	2
201509	2743	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we’ve now held the nominal interest rate at its effective lower bound for six years and nine months.	23	2
201509	2744	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In so doing, we’re sending a signal that the situation in the US economy is still extremely far from being normal.	23	2
201509	2745	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The interest rate aside, I do not believe that is the current situation.	23	2
201509	2746	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If the Federal Reserve sends a well-reasoned signal that we think the US economy is now strong enough to begin normalizing, we would be providing an important boost to confidence of businesses and households.	23	2
201509	2747	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	That’s something the Chair mentioned as a possibility in her opening statement.	23	2
201509	2748	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	The improvement in confidence would have a positive effect on spending and job creation.	23	2
201509	2749	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Third—and this is also an important point—beginning normalization when we’ve met the criteria that we’ve set out to meet will enhance the credibility of the FOMC.	23	2
201509	2750	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Conversely, if we continue to delay despite meeting these criteria, market participants and Fed watchers will not know what to make of our communications, and our credibility will suffer.	23	2
201509	2751	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Now, there is a statement that has recently been made that practically any argument that’s made on the basis of credibility is bound to be wrong.	23	2
201509	2752	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	I think that, while we should always examine arguments that rely on credibility with suspicion, credibility really matters for a central bank, particularly for the most important central bank in the world.	23	2
201509	2753	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	In this regard, I have considerable sympathy with President Lockhart’s view that the markets need to understand better what we intend to do.	23	2
201509	2754	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	One of the best ways to achieve that is by doing what we have said we will do.	23	2
201509	2755	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, the decisions we make this year are going to affect the economy next year and after that, so we need to be moving our policy stance with future conditions in mind.	23	2
201509	2756	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	If the situation in foreign economies stabilizes—note that I am not saying “if foreign economies stabilize,” just “if their situation stabilizes”—and if, as the SEP suggests, most of us agree that we should start normalization this year, we need to think about whether to start it in October or December.	23	2
201509	2757	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	There is an attraction to the idea of going in October, because, if the objective situation so justifies, that would demonstrate to the public that we can, indeed, make decisions eight times a year, not just four times—at press conference meetings.	23	2
201509	2758	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	But, of course, I do understand the preference of not a few FOMC members for December.	23	2
201509	2759	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	To conclude, I support alternative B and believe that in our statements, we should emphasize that we stand by our frequently repeated statement that we expect the beginning of normalization to occur in 2015.	23	2
201509	2760	2015-09-17	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2761	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2762	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201509	2763	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2764	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I wasn’t going to comment on our external communications, but I have to say I’m now going to do so because of this reference that was made to a Yellen put.	23	2
201509	2765	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I want to recall what the Chair has said, both externally and internally.	23	2
201509	2766	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	At her June press conference, she laid out a way of thinking about when, whether, and how we are going to raise rates.	23	2
201509	2767	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	She made reference to the SEP, which, as a factual matter, indicated that most, though not all, participants in the FOMC, under expected conditions, thought that it would be appropriate to raise rates later in the year.	23	2
201509	2768	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	She scrupulously stayed away from any reference to a particular month.	23	2
201509	2769	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	In our July meeting, the Chair at one point said, “Opining in public on the exact timing of the first move, in my own view, not only detracts from our consensus-driven deliberative process, but also can easily confuse markets and the general public, adding to volatility and, ultimately, diminishing the effectiveness and credibility of our policy.”	23	2
201509	2770	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	A few minutes later, she went on to say, “So my suggestion for all of us is to refrain from speculating about the time of liftoff.”	23	2
201509	2771	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Within days of the end of our FOMC meeting, many FOMC participants were out talking about when they thought liftoff might be appropriate.	23	2
201509	2772	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	There was always some formalistic caveat stuck in there, but we all know what happens with the press when you talk about a particular month.	23	2
201509	2773	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And that’s exactly what happened.	23	2
201509	2774	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe their intent was to try to move public expectations toward a September liftoff.	23	2
201509	2775	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	At that juncture, understandably, sentiment began to shift toward an expectation that September was going to be the month.	23	2
201509	2776	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Then, with the China developments, there was renewed speculation about whether that would, in fact, be the case.	23	2
201509	2777	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, assuming we go with alternative B—which it sounds as though we’re going to do—with that outcome, there is, indeed, some risk that some commentators and observers out there say, “Oh, they were ready to go, but then you had this market instability.	23	2
201509	2778	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So, once again, the Fed feels as though it has to support markets.”	23	2
201509	2779	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I genuinely do not believe that that risk would be as high as it is had everyone followed what the Chair asked for in the July meeting, because it would not look as though we had done a reversal—we lean toward September, and then, when the market instability arises, we don’t do it.	23	2
201509	2780	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	The Chair herself had set out an analytical framework that, by definition, was withholding judgment on that.	23	2
201509	2781	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I realize that any plea for self-discipline and collegiality is probably not going to have much effect, but I think this is an instance in which we do run some risk of someone saying something along those lines.	23	2
201509	2782	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s because, I think, we didn’t follow the guidance that she gave both in her June press conference and just among us in the July meeting.	23	2
201509	2783	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Turning to the substance of this decision today, as I mentioned yesterday: I’d looked at our SEPs for the past few years, seeing how wrong we had all been, myself included, about where both inflation and unemployment were going to be.	23	2
201509	2784	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So I went back to look at what I said during the economic and monetary policy go-rounds late last year, and I confirmed my own memory that I actually expected us to be in a different place.	23	2
201509	2785	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I did expect to be on the cusp of a decision to raise rates, based on the way I thought the economy would go.	23	2
201509	2786	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But that isn’t the way things have turned out, and I wanted to explain why, as I said in July, I didn’t think it was likely that I would be for a rate increase in September, although I was open to the possibility that some things would happen in the interim that would change my mind.	23	2
201509	2787	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I guess what I’m saying is, it didn’t take the China problems to get me to the position I am taking today.	23	2
201509	2788	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	People have alluded to this already—actual inflation, both core and headline, is not moving in the direction of our target, and it hasn’t started moving there over the past couple of meetings.	23	2
201509	2789	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Market measures of inflation compensation have actually drifted down a little bit, as people noticed.	23	2
201509	2790	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Even the talismanic inflation expectations, on which we put so much emphasis—they’re still there, but, even at the edge, there’s been a little shakiness as well.	23	2
201509	2791	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	People refer to the transitory factors, and, surely, both the dollar and oil prices themselves at some point are going to start to have less effect on inflation.	23	2
201509	2792	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think it’s worth noting that it’s been several years now that there’s been some reason why inflation is held down, contrary to the expectations that almost everybody on this Committee, to a greater or lesser degree, has had during that period.	23	2
201509	2793	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	This is the old Roseanne Roseannadanna line on Saturday Night Live:  “It’s always something.”	23	2
201509	2794	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s always something that fades, but then something else comes in.	23	2
201509	2795	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s a little hard to escape the observation that inflation has been running lower—and by a significant amount—than we all were projecting it would be moving a year or two or three ago.	23	2
201509	2796	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	In that context, I think one has to start asking the question, “Is something different going on here?”	23	2
201509	2797	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We talk a lot about what’s “normal” or “natural.”	23	2
201509	2798	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Those are dangerous words in analysis because they can be a substitute for analysis—just to say, “Well, we know where the end point is.	23	2
201509	2799	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s where we were before.”	23	2
201509	2800	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Sometimes, as a matter of everyday life, that’s probably the best way to proceed.	23	2
201509	2801	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But when you come to consequential decisions after a period in which some very unusual things have happened, it’s probably a good idea to ask yourself whether yesterday’s normal or yesterday’s natural is still normal or natural today.	23	2
201509	2802	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Quite apart from economics, I believe we can all think of things that, 30 years ago, were regarded as normal and natural, but that we today regard as aberrant.	23	2
201509	2803	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Since coming here, because I wasn’t schooled in this stuff formally, I’ve tried to read a lot of monetary policy history.	23	2
201509	2804	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I’m struck by the fact that, over time—and I’m not just talking about the Federal Reserve—central banks generally have made many mistakes, both to a hawkish and a dovish outcome, because of the fact that they didn’t appreciate that the external conditions in economic and financial markets had changed.	23	2
201509	2805	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Now, you can’t do that every meeting, and you shouldn’t do it every meeting.	23	2
201509	2806	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But we’ve been through this period when the economy has defied our predictions both with respect to unemployment and with respect to inflation, and it’s done so consistently.	23	2
201509	2807	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Under those circumstances, I think you at least have to start asking yourself that question.	23	2
201509	2808	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I surely don’t have some substitute paradigm for thinking about inflation and monetary policy today, but it’s that perspective that has led me to what I characterized yesterday as my show-me attitude—not that inflation has to be at 2 percent, for heaven’s sake.	23	2
201509	2809	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That’s a caricature.	23	2
201509	2810	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That’s not it.	23	2
201509	2811	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s looking for some evidence that we are actually moving in that direction.	23	2
201509	2812	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	As I said yesterday, it can happen.	23	2
201509	2813	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	If I were sitting on the UK MPC right now, I would feel quite differently—with above-trend growth; inflation having moved up to, I believe, 1.6 percent and people seeming to expect it to inch up a couple of tenths more; and a nice 2.9 percent wage gain.	23	2
201509	2814	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Frankly, a year ago, I thought we’d be around there right now and I really would feel quite differently.	23	2
201509	2815	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But we’re not there, and there are risks to moving when I’m not seeing enough momentum to give us some assurance that we’ve got a bit of a buffer.	23	2
201509	2816	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a matter of, “Oh, there’s so much uncertainty.”	23	2
201509	2817	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, there’s always uncertainty.	23	2
201509	2818	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And it’s not a matter of saying, “We’ve got to get to 2.”	23	2
201509	2819	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	For me, it wouldn’t even necessarily have to be headline or core inflation or wages—it’s got to be something, though, and that’s what I’m not seeing right now and haven’t for a while.	23	2
201509	2820	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I want to say that I looked through the 2011 spike in commodity prices, so I know that people look through things.	23	2
201509	2821	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But what I worry about is, we continue to tell ourselves we’re going to look through everything, and we continue to keep looking through things, even though it’s different things year after year.	23	2
201509	2822	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s really the perspective.	23	2
201509	2823	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll offer a couple of concluding comments.	23	2
201509	2824	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	First, I fully understand what the Chair and others have said about why it’s not just liftoff, but the path of interest rates and all of that—the Chair and Governor Fischer both said it in the go-round today.	23	2
201509	2825	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But liftoff does matter.	23	2
201509	2826	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	If David just puts 25 basis points into the models, it doesn’t seem to matter that much.	23	2
201509	2827	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it does matter because it’s going to communicate to the world how we are thinking about inflation and our willingness to do things when inflation is where it is.	23	2
201509	2828	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think we can get around the fact that the first move will be heavily scrutinized and interpreted.	23	2
201509	2829	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Second, let’s not fool ourselves, either.	23	2
201509	2830	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We can talk until we’re blue in the face about how, “Oh, we want a shallow path.	23	2
201509	2831	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	We’re going to do one move, and we’re going to sit back.”	23	2
201509	2832	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Speculation will immediately turn to, “When are they going to move next?	23	2
201509	2833	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	And how frequently are they going to do it?	23	2
201509	2834	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Do they have a timetable?	23	2
201509	2835	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Every other meeting?	23	2
201509	2836	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Every meeting?	23	2
201509	2837	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Every third meeting?	23	2
201509	2838	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Every fourth and a half meeting?	23	2
201509	2839	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	What is their presumption here?”	23	2
201509	2840	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	So I don’t think we’re going to escape those issues.	23	2
201509	2841	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, on language, I agree with President Lockhart’s top-level point but disagree with the second point.	23	2
201509	2842	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	The top-level point is, it would be good if, even internally, we could get some more agreement and then possibly communicate it externally.	23	2
201509	2843	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Where I differ, for the reason I said a minute ago, is in the articulation that we’re reasonably confident that inflation is there.	23	2
201509	2844	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	The improvement in the labor market is a more or less objective thing.	23	2
201509	2845	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	You can argue whether there is enough progress here or there.	23	2
201509	2846	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But either there is or there isn’t.	23	2
201509	2847	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	I think that, to many people, the reasonable confidence about inflation has come down to, “Look, we just think we’re close enough to eliminating slack that it’s going to start happening.”	23	2
201509	2848	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That may not be irrational, but it’s still highly subjective, and it’s hard as a basis for coming together on something that we can agree on, even internally, as a trigger.	23	2
201509	2849	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	But I definitely think it would be worth the effort.	23	2
201509	2850	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Regarding President George’s comments, I couldn’t agree more.	23	2
201509	2851	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the data point issue, we do not want the world thinking, “Their decision turns on whether the next employment report is 210,000 jobs or 140,000 jobs.”	23	2
201509	2852	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	That’s just not where we want to be.	23	2
201509	2853	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	As President George said, getting the discussion to be more about the outlook will be much more productive, even if we have different outlooks individually.	23	2
201509	2854	2015-09-17	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2855	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2856	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201509	2857	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2858	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B today as written.	23	2
201509	2859	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	For me, this has been a close call, and I do think you can make the case in a pretty strong form on either side of this decision for today.	23	2
201509	2860	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In fact, that’s exactly what the Chair did in her opening remarks.	23	2
201509	2861	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	The Committee has guided markets to expect liftoff by the end of this year, subject to incoming data.	23	2
201509	2862	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Those data have been, on balance, perhaps a little better than expected.	23	2
201509	2863	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But we have additional disinflationary forces arriving, albeit ones we view as transitory, and a higher risk of a global slowdown.	23	2
201509	2864	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In addition, US financial conditions have tightened since the July meeting by well more than 25 basis points, according to well-publicized external estimates.	23	2
201509	2865	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	So there’s no sense of the Committee getting behind the curve.	23	2
201509	2866	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	To me, it makes sense to defer liftoff for this meeting to let both the inflation picture and the global situation settle down.	23	2
201509	2867	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I do not view the situation as it exists today as justifying a lengthy delay before liftoff.	23	2
201509	2868	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see a need to see the rates of inflation or nominal wage growth rising prior to our liftoff.	23	2
201509	2869	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I would be satisfied with at least some reasonable stability in the dollar, so that we could be sure that the recurring temporary factors holding down inflation are finally abating.	23	2
201509	2870	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I would, of course, also need to see continuing growth to support ongoing tightening in the economy.	23	2
201509	2871	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Frankly, if real GDP growth is strong enough, then I might be persuaded to lift off even in the absence of other factors.	23	2
201509	2872	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Turning briefly to the Committee’s two-part test for liftoff: I view the first part of the test—some further improvement in the labor market—as met for this meeting.	23	2
201509	2873	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	There’s been substantial improvement in the labor market.	23	2
201509	2874	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	And, while there’s no doubt additional slack, unemployment is now at or near most estimates of the natural rate.	23	2
201509	2875	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Even if the natural rate— either the short-term rate or the longer-term rate—is significantly lower than current estimates, which is a distinct possibility, we’re already on a path, it seems to me, to unemployment in the mid-to-low 4s by the end of 2016.	23	2
201509	2876	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	So, from this perspective solely, I think it’s getting to be about time to start raising interest rates.But the inflation test is more complicated.	23	2
201509	2877	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In the Tealbook baseline, inflation returns to 1.9 percent in 2018, which, one might argue, is itself a decent argument that the test is met.	23	2
201509	2878	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	After all, the test is appropriately about the medium term.	23	2
201509	2879	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But today inflation is not just well below the 2 percent objective.	23	2
201509	2880	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	It’s also very likely to decline in the coming months, albeit due to factors we view as transitory.	23	2
201509	2881	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	So declaring the inflation test to be met would require the Committee to look through a substantial transition period and place a great deal of weight on the Phillips curve.	23	2
201509	2882	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	To put it simply, intermeeting developments have not increased my confidence of inflation moving toward 2 percent in the medium term.	23	2
201509	2883	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I see this as a problem, and I see a risk of sending a signal to markets that the Committee is not serious about the 2 percent objective.	23	2
201509	2884	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	For me, delaying liftoff for a meeting or two may provide some evidence that we’re serious about reaching the 2 percent objective and allow time to understand the evolution of global developments.	23	2
201509	2885	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	There’s been some discussion of a so-called dovish raise, whereby the Committee would raise interest rates at this meeting or a subsequent meeting, but then wait for some time to let the effects settle in.	23	2
201509	2886	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	The sense of this is that the Committee’s communications have been confusing to the markets—you hear this from market participants quite a bit—and that we’re, in effect, getting in the way of the economy now, as the Chair referenced in her remarks, and causing trouble in the markets.	23	2
201509	2887	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	That will become increasingly the case if uncertainty increases, and we ought to just lift off get it over with.	23	2
201509	2888	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Now, I don’t support that approach at this meeting, but I do think that if either the October meeting or the December meeting provides a reasonable opportunity to go ahead and lift off, I would be inclined to look very carefully at that and take it, if possible.	23	2
201509	2889	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	We had a chart today that Thomas presented that showed the distribution of expected timing of liftoff by FOMC meeting.	23	2
201509	2890	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I’d really like to see the likelihood of liftoff be way north of 50 percent by the time we lift off.	23	2
201509	2891	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	In fact, in my perfect world, it would be 100 percent.	23	2
201509	2892	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	But I realize that’s not likely in a world in which the Committee is of different views and in which we’re being very data driven.	23	2
201509	2893	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	I’d still like to see that be much higher than 50 percent, and I think it would be very unwise to lift off at a time when the market is not expecting it.	23	2
201509	2894	2015-09-17	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2895	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2896	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201509	2897	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2898	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Well, I appreciate the opportunity to hear from all but one member of the Committee, and many of the considerations that have been, I think, very eloquently put on the table on both sides of this debate also affect my own judgment about the appropriate policy rate path.	23	2
201509	2899	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	As many of you have stated, in recent months, domestic real activity has expanded at a resilient pace.	23	2
201509	2900	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ve seen improvement in consumption, growth, housing, and the labor market.	23	2
201509	2901	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	The U-3 measure of unemployment has declined further, suggesting a reduction in labor market slack, although the absence of any firming in any wage or compensation measures suggests that some slack remains on other margins, such as participation and involuntary part-time employment.	23	2
201509	2902	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, headline inflation has moved further away from our target during the intermeeting period.	23	2
201509	2903	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Market-based measures of inflation expectations have again drifted down, and the 12-month change in core PCE inflation appears stubbornly mired at around 1¼ percent, where it has been for some years now.	23	2
201509	2904	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	These developments lead me to conclude we are likely still in the quadrant of inflation– resource utilization space in which both our full employment and inflation objectives are consistent with accommodation.	23	2
201509	2905	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I sense some concern that, by continuing accommodation at current levels, the economy could soon breach resource constraints.	23	2
201509	2906	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	But there is a risk associated with that approach, in light of the fact that monetary policy acts with a lag, and that it may lead to a buildup of inflationary pressures, a rise in inflation expectations, and, consequently, persistent inflation materially in excess of our 2 percent target.	23	2
201509	2907	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the persistent and sizable deflationary forces from the international environment, the estimated small effect of resource utilization on inflation, the persistence of core inflation materially below our 2 percent target, and the important gravitational force of inflation expectations suggest that this risk is likely still to be relatively modest.	23	2
201509	2908	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Financial markets appear to agree with that judgment.	23	2
201509	2909	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Perhaps most important, we have substantial policy space for addressing this risk.	23	2
201509	2910	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while it is important to remain vigilant with regard to the possibility of an unexpected emergence of inflationary pressures, I believe that, at present, we should place considerably more weight on a different risk—that the underlying momentum in the domestic economy is not strong enough to withstand the considerable deflationary pull of the international environment.	23	2
201509	2911	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In these circumstances, by tightening prematurely, we risk falling short of both our inflation and full employment targets over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2912	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, for those who believe that a hike of 25 basis points might be warranted in September, macro models at the Board and elsewhere suggest that intermeeting international developments alone have produced a notable tightening in US financial conditions roughly equivalent to an increase of 50 basis points in the federal funds rate.	23	2
201509	2913	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	And it’s important to underscore that most of that—indeed, almost all of it—comes from exchange rate movements and not from movements in equity markets or domestic financial markets that may prove temporary.	23	2
201509	2914	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, as I discussed yesterday, the risks to the US outlook from additional international headwinds are weighted to the downside.	23	2
201509	2915	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	China appears to be only partway through a complicated adjustment of its exchange rate regime and broader financial market reforms, and it faces considerable challenges regarding the clarity of communications as well as piercing the fog surrounding its macroeconomic data.	23	2
201509	2916	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In these circumstances, any further policy moves could prompt a broader reassessment of underlying fundamentals that could, in turn, be amplified by real or perceived linkages to the exchange rates of other important economies in their neighborhood as well as to important commodity producers.	23	2
201509	2917	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In that regard, as has been noted, two of our closest trade partners, Canada and Mexico, have already seen sizable currency depreciations.	23	2
201509	2918	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I view these effects on the US economy as likely to be relatively persistent.	23	2
201509	2919	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, over the past year, we’ve seen a strong feedback loop between expectations of policy divergence between the US and our major trade partners, and financial tightening that takes place through exchange rate and financial market channels, which front-runs our policy process.	23	2
201509	2920	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, my reading of the risks is informed by the large majority of episodes in recent years in which policy tightening in other advanced economies, prompted by improving domestic activity, was soon followed by a reversal of policy and, in several important cases, subsequent migration to the effective lower bound and beyond.	23	2
201509	2921	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Those episodes have all proved costly.	23	2
201509	2922	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think we could find only one exception, Iceland, which has several very special features as a result of their financial crisis.	23	2
201509	2923	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, from the perspective of risk management, we have considerably greater latitude to adjust the path of policy in response to higher-than-expected inflation than we have to provide additional accommodation in response to additional financial tightening.	23	2
201509	2924	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	In light of that—both the substantial financial tightening that has taken place and its likely effect on the outlook, the additional downside risks that could materialize from global developments, and the asymmetry of risk-management considerations—the risks of moving prematurely seem to me to outweigh the risks of waiting.	23	2
201509	2925	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Alternative B provides a nice summary of the Committee’s outlook and how that is likely to condition the policy rate path for the period ahead.	23	2
201509	2926	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Paragraph 1 provides a good description of recent developments, contrasting the reassuring growth in the many domestic components of aggregate demand and progress on employment with considerable softness in net exports and the additional restraint on headline inflation and market-based measures of inflation expectations.	23	2
201509	2927	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I would note that the one important piece of information missing from this paragraph that certainly informs my thinking is the soft indicators that have come in across the board on compensation.	23	2
201509	2928	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I strongly support the sentence in paragraph 2 that describes the implications of developments abroad for risk considerations.	23	2
201509	2929	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s important to acknowledge that foreign developments are a key risk to the achievement of our objectives.	23	2
201509	2930	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Inclusion of this language enhances the clarity of our communications by informing observers that we are paying attention to these developments because of their potential effect, through many channels, on the US outlook.	23	2
201509	2931	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	My own judgment is that recent global developments and possible future developments pose downside risks to the outlook, but I can support the more neutral language and alternative B more generally.	23	2
201509	2932	2015-09-17	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2933	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2934	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201509	2935	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2936	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23	2
201509	2937	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I was hoping that I could support lifting off at this meeting for two reasons.	23	2
201509	2938	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	First, it would have meant that we had satisfied our criteria of labor market improvement and confidence that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2939	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, as I said at earlier meetings, September is a better month to begin normalization than December, economic conditions and outlook being equal.	23	2
201509	2940	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Unfortunately, the global economy has not cooperated.	23	2
201509	2941	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there are significant risks to the growth outlook that make it uncertain whether we will see further improvement in the labor market and whether we will see inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201509	2942	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of what happens from here, I hope the international outlook improves and financial conditions stabilize.	23	2
201509	2943	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If this happens and US growth stays on track, then I could support lifting off relatively soon, certainly later this year.	23	2
201509	2944	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve argued that December is not ideal in terms of market functioning considerations.	23	2
201509	2945	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think that should be sufficient by itself to deter us if everything else lines up in support of moving.	23	2
201509	2946	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to moving in October, I don’t believe we should rule that out as an option.	23	2
201509	2947	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	But if we did move in October, that might demonstrate an urgency that would be difficult to reconcile with the fact that we have relatively sluggish growth and still-too-low inflation.	23	2
201509	2948	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	People might be confused.	23	2
201509	2949	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s the rush of moving in October?	23	2
201509	2950	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I see the bar for moving at a meeting without a press conference as somewhat higher than that for moving at a press conference meeting.	23	2
201509	2951	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think that’s the reality.	23	2
201509	2952	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’d be surprised if, in six weeks’ time, we got data that push us over the bar.	23	2
201509	2953	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I am very supportive of Governor Powell’s comments.	23	2
201509	2954	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be good for the market to have a very high probability when we actually move.	23	2
201509	2955	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	If things cooperate and everything moves in a nice way, what I would prefer, rather than moving in October, would be to have a very “hawky” statement in October that pointed very strongly to December, so that you could get all of that probability mass on December, and then just go in December.	23	2
201509	2956	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that would be a better way to go.	23	2
201509	2957	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, whether the world is going to cooperate like that, we’ll have to see.	23	2
201509	2958	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I had a couple of comments on the so-called Yellen put.	23	2
201509	2959	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We really have to disabuse people of this notion.	23	2
201509	2960	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We care about the economic outlook.	23	2
201509	2961	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Financial conditions matter in terms of affecting the outlook when they change, and if those changes in financial conditions are sustained, then we need to take them into consideration.	23	2
201509	2962	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	We need to explain that to people over and over again.	23	2
201509	2963	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m sympathetic with Jim in the sense that this is a risk that people will take this reaction as a response to financial markets, but I don’t think it is.	23	2
201509	2964	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	My views of why we should wait at this meeting have nothing to do with the fact that the stock market is a little weaker than it was before.	23	2
201509	2965	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	It has to do with the fact that there are actually some real things going on that are affecting financial conditions, and those changes have a risk for the outlook.	23	2
201509	2966	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to explain that over and over again.	23	2
201509	2967	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201509	2968	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201509	2969	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I heard one suggestion in the go-round for a language change in alternative B, but I think most of you who support alternative B indicated your preference to go ahead with it as written.	23	2
201509	2970	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	So unless I hear a groundswell of support for some change, I’d like to propose that we vote on alternative B as written.	23	2
201509	2971	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Matt?	23	2
201509	2972	2015-09-17	meeting	LUECKE	This vote will cover alternative B on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout and the directive on page 11 of that handout.	23	2
201509	2973	2015-09-17	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker No President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes.	23	2
201509	2974	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize that, around the table, there is considerable support for moving—if not today, then in the near future—and I promise that in my press conference, I will do everything I can to emphasize that.	23	2
201509	2975	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201509	2976	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff argued me out of raising a bunch of questions around December, and Vice Chairman Dudley just addressed this.	23	2
201509	2977	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Could I ask Simon and Lorie to comment?	23	2
201509	2978	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Sitting far from it, should I be concerned about what we’ve heard before regarding the thinness of the market?	23	2
201509	2979	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Should I also have some concern about whether you have any staffing issues or whether you’re just going to declare that everyone will need to cancel all of their plans and be there for that period?	23	2
201509	2980	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	In addition, I’d like to know whether there are other execution considerations in December that, as we get conceivably closer to it, could cause us to get more nervous that it’s too tricky.	23	2
201509	2981	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Could you address that?	23	2
201509	2982	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I’ve got no concerns.	23	2
201509	2983	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If you want to lift off in three days’ time, we can do it.	23	2
201509	2984	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	So I don’t think you should take that into account.	23	2
201509	2985	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	I believe Vice Chairman Dudley’s viewpoint is, markets tend to be a little bit thinner in December, and some of the impact on financial conditions could be harder to control.	23	2
201509	2986	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	If it’s the case that, leading into that date, markets are pretty sure liftoff is going to happen in December, then desks will be staffed for some of the things that you’re interested in.	23	2
201509	2987	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	People staff their desks to get cash invested at year-end, because a lot of cash arrives at year-end.	23	2
201509	2988	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	We have complete capacity to do that at any time.	23	2
201509	2989	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	There are no staffing issues.	23	2
201509	2990	2015-09-17	meeting	POTTER	Most of my staff wouldn’t know what decision the Committee has made until the statement is released.	23	2
201509	2991	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	Another point is, if we do get to a situation in which the expected probability of a December liftoff are quite high, people are going to staff their desks appropriately.	23	2
201509	2992	2015-09-17	meeting	DUDLEY	So getting that probability up actually could have a benefit of minimizing some of those risks.	23	2
201509	2993	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to October, if I’m asked if it’s a possibility, I’m not announcing now that I will have a press conference.	23	2
201509	2994	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But I will give the response that I’ve given in the past—which is that we have the capacity to hold a press briefing if we decide to move.	23	2
201509	2995	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Then, since every meeting is a “live” possibility, if we decided to move in October, that is what we would do.	23	2
201509	2996	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Would you have to, in your thinking, announce an October press conference some days ahead of the meeting?	23	2
201509	2997	2015-09-17	meeting	LOCKHART	Or would you just do it at the meeting?	23	2
201509	2998	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	No, we would do it in the meeting.	23	2
201509	2999	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In point of fact, the reporters— starting with today’s meeting, I guess—will now receive the statement and be writing their stories to go out when the statement comes out at 2:00.	23	2
201509	3000	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Michelle, please correct me if I say anything wrong here.	23	2
201509	3001	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	They will be in the lockup room that is directly next door to the room over on K Street where today, for the first time, I’ll be holding the press conference.	23	2
201509	3002	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	In October, if we wanted to move and they’re there and have the statement, we could actually have a live press conference.	23	2
201509	3003	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	We would just move them next door and do that, or there could be a press briefing.	23	2
201509	3004	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But there really wouldn’t be any technical problems in doing that.	23	2
201509	3005	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I could announce now that I would hold a press conference in October, but I think that would be locking me permanently into press conferences after every meeting.	23	2
201509	3006	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	For reasons we’ve previously discussed, I’d really prefer not to do that.	23	2
201509	3007	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	But there are no technical obstacles at all to doing that.	23	2
201509	3008	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I will do my best at the press conference to leave later this year a very live option.	23	2
201509	3009	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	If the data come in consistent with a move, as many of you have said, we will, even if we don’t move in October, have the opportunity to change the statement in a way that raises expectations of a move.	23	2
201509	3010	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	I believe I have an economic outlook speech scheduled for early December and probably further testimony, and there would be an opportunity, if we think we’re going to do that, to prepare the markets to expect that that’s going to occur.	23	2
201509	3011	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	If you are staying around and care to watch the press conference, I believe there’s a TV in the Special Library.	1	1
201509	3012	2015-09-17	meeting	YELLEN	Our next meeting will be on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 27 and 28.	1	1
