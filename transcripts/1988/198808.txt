198808	0	CROSS	 Just before the June FOMC meeting, the dollar rose  substantially and it has remained well bid throughout most of the  intermeeting period, although the dollar did slip some last week  and again today following the release of data showing a larger  trade deficit. But for the period as a whole the dollar has been  well bid, and most of the dollar's rise has been against the mark  and associated continental currencies. Since the June meeting,  the dollar has risen from DM1.82 to DM1.88, or about 3-1/2  percent. Also, all of our intervention has been to sell dollars  for marks. We've sold just over $3 billion and the Bundesbank  has sold as we have, if troop dollars are  included.  Against several other currencies, however, the dollar has  been more stable. Tpday's exchange rates for the yen, sterling,  and the Canadian dollar, for example, are only marginally  different from the levels of seven weeks ago. As a result, these  currencies, too, have strengthened against the German mark and  other continental currencies. These three countries Japan, the  UK, and Canada all are showing vigorous economic growth and,  with the notable exception of Japan, they have high nominal  interest rates.  The movement of the dollar/mark exchange rate over recent  months reflects the markets' growing confidence in the United States  situation, together with disappointment about investment returns  in Germany. As for the United States, dealers have been  impressed with evidence suggesting that external adjustment is  proceeding, as well as a feeling that the authorities want a  stable or rising dollar during the pre-election period. They see  the brisk economy and expectations of more inflation as implying  higher interest rates here in the months ahead. By comparison,  the German economy is not all that robust and investment  prospects are not all that promising. Interest rates are still  relatively low in nominal terms, and the prospects for capital  gains coming from an expanding economy, declining interest rates,  or a rising exchange rate look remote.  One mechanism that has pushed the dollar up is the covering  of dollar positions, not only by foreign exchange traders but  also investors and others. Looking back to the start of the  year, there must have been large-scale short positions in the  private sector, since our 1987 current account deficit was  financed or even over-financed by the central banks. As the  dollar moved up, first in response to the vigorous G-7  intervention and then in response to the improving prospects for  the currency, many corporate customers and institutional  investors sought to reduce their short positions, by adjusting  their hedges and commercial leads and lags and other means.  We have intervened to try to limit the dollar's upward  movement. The idea is to avoid an abrupt upsurge in the  dollar/mark that might attract even more covering activity that  would ratchet up the dollar to higher and perhaps unsustainable  levels. Such a result could impede the trade adjustment we  require and possibly cause volatility that could spill over into  other financial markets.  In these circumstances, the United States has intervened and since  your last meeting we have sold $3.1 billion. All of these sales  occurred before the recent discount rate increase. The result of  these operations is that we have put back about one-third of the  $9.4 billion which we took out of the market when we were  resisting the dollar's fall during the 14 months after Louvre.  With the dollar having risen substantially from its low point in  early January against all currencies, it is now above the levels  prevailing at the time of the Louvre in terms of the mark,  although it is still well below the Louvre levels in terms of the  yen.  Following last Tuesday's discount rate increase, the dollar  rose during the course of that day, but in following days  retreated, without official intervention, to levels below those  prevailing before the announcement. We have naturally wondered  why the dollar has slipped back. One factor may be that,  although the timing of the move caught the market by surprise,  the fact that the Fed would be willing to tighten when necessary  was widely anticipated; and it may be that the market thought the  Fed knew something they didn't, and the inflation danger is worse  than they thought. The market may also have been affected by  expectations, in light of commentary by European officials, of  offsetting interest rate increases in Germany and elsewhere, and,  in addition, there may have been a view that the dollar was at  levels likely to lead to a strong G-7 response.  Looking back, actual or anticipated intervention by the  major central banks seems to have been a significant factor in  keeping the dollar from rising more strongly, and I suspect the  market will continue to pay a great deal of attention to the  G-7's effort to foster exchange rate stability.  Mr. Chairman, since the June meeting, we have sold $1.4  billion against marks on behalf of the Federal Reserve. We also  purchased from customers a very small amount of currencies to  augment balances a total of $11.6 million equivalent of yen and  $17.9 million equivalent of marks. I would request approval of  these transactions.  In other operations, the Committee earlier approved our  participating with Treasury in purchasing up to $3 billion  equivalent of yen directly from  and one-half of that amount has now been purchased. In addition,  on August 1 the Bank of Mexico drew the entire $700 million of  its Federal Reserve swap facility, as authorized by FOMC vote on  July 28, and also drew the entire $300 million of its Treasury  ESF swap facility. The Bank of Mexico is scheduled to repay both  swaps on September 15.  There are three items to report on other Treasury ESF swaps:  On July 1, the National Bank of Yugoslavia repaid $16.1  million of its outstanding $50 million swap.  On July 29, a special $232.5 million swap facility was  arranged for the Central Bank of Brazil as part of a  $500 million bridge financing arranged with the BIS and  other monetary authorities.  On August 4, Treasury announced it would help arrange  loans to Argentina of up to $500 million to bridge to  future World Bank loans consisting of ESF funds and a  BIS facility for other creditors. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	1	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Are there any questions for Mr. Cross? If there are no questions, I would entertain a motion to ratify the actions taken since the last FOMC meeting. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0

198808	5	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Joan Lovett, would you report on the-- 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	6	CORRIGAN	 Could I, Mr. Chairman, just make a comment rather than raise a question? Sam Cross mentioned in the course of his remarks that he thought that intervention on the part of the major central banks in this intermeeting period had helped curtail, if you will, the rise of the dollar. I think that's a fair statement. I want to actually make a more general, albeit a brief statement, about intervention because I think it has gotten a bit of a bad name. It's not that I have any illusions about the ability of intervention to be decisive in terms of the position of a currency either short term or long term--but I do think there is a characteristic of the foreign exchange market, at least as I see it, that we have to keep in mind. And the characteristic is the equivalent of these very sophisticated and very aggressive forms of program trading in the foreign exchange markets whereby individual institutions and individual traders take very, very large positions. And they're willing to push those positions to the very limit. One of the things that those trading strategies do is reinforce, in my judgment, the tendency toward one-way markets--in a context in which the perception is that you can make a quick buck by pushing that as far as possible. And as long as those trading strategies are as dominant as I think they are, the dangers that can be associated with one-way markets become all the greater, and the tendencies for the exchange market to overshoot all the greater. My point in those circumstances is this: I think that intervention does play a useful role in reaffirming the fact that there are two-way markets. And I think that in and of itself is of value even if one can not argue persuasively that a particular exchange rate could or should emerge from the process. But I do think that the presence of the central banks does create something of a conviction toward two-way markets. If there's any doubt about that, all you have to do is talk to traders. They will say that they tend to be much more cautious when they feel that the central banks may be on the scene. So, I do think that these trading strategies --and the way at least I think they manifest themselves in the market--provide to me a fairly convincing case that there is merit or wisdom in the central banks showing their hand from time-to-time in the market even if one is agnostic about the effects in terms of a particular exchange rate at a particular point in time.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198808	7	GREENSPAN	 When do you envisage--was it 1984, 1985, 1986--that this process would have changed? Because, obviously the evaluation of the Jurgensen Report, which endeavored to filter through all such relationships, was unable, at least to the best it could judge, to find any significant intervention impacts. Is this something that you're suggesting is-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	8	CORRIGAN	 I think the character of the market has changed in the last several years. All you have to do, in one sense, is just look at the sheer volume of transactions. If you use CHIPS transactions as a proxy--an imperfect proxy, but one which still is a pretty good way to do it because our survey suggests that something like 90 percent of the CHIPS traffic is foreign exchange transactions--they're up. And if you look at what has happened in the development of the derivative markets in foreign exchange, perhaps especially the options [market], it's very clear that the sheer size of the market and the amount of turnover has grown enormously. Look at the profits that all the major banks and investment banks are generating quarterly from foreign exchange trading. I still can't fully understand that myself. But every single quarter, with an exception here or there, all of these major firms are generating very sizable profits from foreign exchange trading. If you look at some of the individual trading strategies, at least in some cases, they are a very elaborate form of program trading applied in a different area. I think all of those things taken together do constitute a change--admittedly over time--but a change in the character, the structure, the fabric of the market. And I wouldn't argue with any conviction that the totality of those things is decisive, in any sense of the word, in producing these tendencies to overshoot that we see in the markets. But I do think that they can be tempered a bit. Indeed, as I said, the foreign exchange traders say they behave differently when they sense the central banks are on the scene. Again, I'm not trying to make an argument that necessarily would dispute any of these earlier reports--finding point estimates and being able to say that this pattern of central bank intervention produced this result. I'm agnostic myself about that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198808	9	GREENSPAN	 But at some point, the type of hypothesis you're raising is testable. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	10	CORRIGAN	 It should be. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198808	11	TRUMAN	 Mr. Chairman, in the Jurgensen report, it's fair to say that group did not really examine closely, in a statistical sense, the effectiveness of intervention in the framework that President Corrigan is putting forward. In fact, it concluded that in the very short run there was some case for the effectiveness of intervention, and that I think is close to what President Corrigan has said is a testable proposition. That's about all you can say. Translating that in terms of the early 1980s, and the notion that some central banks then had--and even now have--a practice of being in the market in order to constantly provide a sense of two-way risk [unintelligible]. The Bank of Canada, for example, follows a strategy of that type. And from time-to-time the Bank of England has done it, although not recently. And that was recognized as one motivation for intervention that was different from a motivation designed to alter the medium-term course of exchange rates. And I think President  Corrigan is now commenting on the merits--saying that in some situations, there might be a case for intervention, even recognizing that in terms of altering the medium-term course of exchange rates, a sterilized intervention is likely to be singularly ineffective. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	12	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	13	HELLER	 Mr. Truman said part of what I wanted to say, but I think there's an important distinction between the types of intervention. The kind that just dribbles $50 million in every day, which seems to me at least to have virtually zero effect, is the kind of intervention that shows up in the Jurgensen Report as having very little effect. On the other hand, if you're hitting a one-way market with a certain relatively large intervention, then you really get the market impact that you're talking about. But I think what you've got to ask is whether by doing that you're also creating uncertainty. I think you are. And by creating the uncertainty you're reducing the incentive to take positions, because they're built on the one-way certainty. Then you've got to ask yourself the broader question of whether a central bank is contributing to increasing or decreasing the uncertainty. Clearly, we like to think that we are moving the market towards the ultimate equilibrium, thereby somehow or other reducing fluctuations. But I think that is really tough to substantiate econometrically because you're dealing by necessity with small samples and periods that are very difficult to compare. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198808	14	JOHNSON	 What is the average in terms of dollar transactions per day? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	15	CROSS	 The average in terms of what? 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	16	JOHNSON	 Dollar transactions per day? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	17	CROSS	 The United States or worldwide? 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	18	JOHNSON	 Well, worldwide. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	19	CROSS	 We don't really know. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	20	JOHNSON	 You don't know? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	21	CROSS	 We know what we do and they know what they do. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	22	JOHNSON	 I think [theirs is] very large relative to what [we] do 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	23	BLACK	 Very large. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198808	24	CROSS	 On the part of the United States--. Sorry to give you numbers, but worldwide it's probably equal to at least $300 or $400 billion a day. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	25	HELLER	 Yes, but, Sam, that is not the relevant number for intervention purposes. What is relevant, I think, is the size of the open position in the market. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198808	26	CROSS	 Well, that we don't really know.  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	27	HELLER	 And clearly no one knows, but that's what you're trying to do. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198808	28	CROSS	 When we are intervening we are trying to bring about a certain influence. And certainly, the market is constantly and intensely out there watching to see what signs we--and by that I mean the central banks collectively--are giving. They are very much concerned about whether there is evidence that the central banks are going to [intervene]. The central banks can hurt them when they choose to come into the market. And they certainly pay great attention to that in all cases. And they can, on occasion, keep some of these movements from moving in one direction or another and kind of getting-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	29	ANGELL	 Well, I'm not a purist on intervention. I think there are times when that certainly is constructive. But I would believe that to intervene all the time is a good way of demonstrating that you have very little power and, thereby, you are not affecting in any way this perception of a two-way risk. It seems to me that if central banks are willing to alter the basic scarcity of their currency they can do a great deal to influence its exchange value. And if intervention is trying to coincide with central banks' willingness to do that, it can indeed give a perception of a two-way risk. I find it particularly dissatisfying to have intervention to the level and the extent that we have done during this intermeeting period while at the same time we clearly wanted to decrease the scarcity of dollars in world markets. I see no point whatsoever in demonstrating that we were unsuccessful. They might find it out anyway without our so clearly making it evident. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198808	30	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	31	HOSKINS	 I wasn't going to comment because I think my position on this is fairly well known. But Jerry has raised the issue in the context, I guess, of orderly markets. I'm not sure what a one¬ way market is other than the fact that people are bidding the price up or down on a particular instrument. And I don't see this instrument as much different than any others. We trust the markets to do pricing in general, so then I don't see why we have a particular problem with allowing markets to price currencies. If it's an orderly markets argument, then it seems to me that we should come in when markets are presumed to be disorderly; and that means not very frequently. If we are in all the time, then it defeats the purpose, it seems to me, of the orderly markets argument. I'm not in favor of the orderly markets argument either. I think there may be points in time when we would want to intervene in situations where there's a panic or crash. Other than that I just don't see what we gain by it, other than getting a wider spread between bid and ask. It seems that we are adding uncertainty to the market unnecessarily. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198808	32	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	33	JOHNSON	 I have sort of a technical question. I'm not a purist on intervention either, although I think there are times when the signal is useful and there are times that it's useful for reasons of international cooperation, even regardless of the substance-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	34	GREENSPAN	 I would agree with that.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	35	JOHNSON	 But the one thing I have been worried about recently is--this is a question I guess for Joan Lovett and Don Kohn and Sam Cross--when we are doing consistent interventions and it's working in the other direction from our open market operations, it does run the risk I think of confusing the federal funds market as to what our reserve needs may be. If we have a larger drain need--say it appeared when we are tightening--if the market is not aware of our intervention actions to sell dollars, they may not know specifically or may considerably underestimate the draining requirements of the Open Market Desk. And that can lead to some strange behavior in the funds market, it seems to me. How do we deal with that? It seems to me that we don't want that kind of uncertainty in the funds market. Maybe we want the two-way risk on the foreign exchange market, but we don't want this uncertainty in the open market operations. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	36	LOVETT	 That hasn't been a factor during this most recent period, in part because so many people in the market are trying to put together estimates about how reserves are going to behave--very much the same way we are. Data on reserves are released with a lag, but it's a relatively brief lag, so people are able to speculate as to what factors are influencing reserve behavior. That brief lag may cause people to wonder momentarily in a transition period about the impact on the funds rate. But I think over just a relatively short length of time they've been able to perceive that. For example, in the recent period, people have been watching the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and have seen a rise in other assets and have concluded from that rise that while there are many components in it, the foreign exchange component has probably been a fairly large one; and therefore, our needs to add reserves going forward would be smaller than they had thought heretofore. So it seems as though it has worked out in this past period. Any sort of disturbance on the funds market has been fairly brief. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	37	KOHN	 I agree with what Joan said--there can be no more than a 7-day lag before they get our balance sheet. I would just add that I think the only time that it was-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	38	JOHNSON	 Seven days, though, can be important. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	39	KOHN	 But most of the time those transactions are quite small, particularly taking account of what's done for our own account. It really is lost in the noise relative to the Treasury balance, float, and all those other things. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	40	JOHNSON	 But truly that's just as big. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	41	KOHN	 There was one period here, in which we did the off-market transactions with that had a much larger effect and caused us, I think, to have a slightly different view of our own reserve needs than the market did. But that wasn't the usual kind of intervention. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	42	LOVETT	 I think it was only temporary. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	43	KOHN	 And that only lasted three days in terms of-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	44	LOVETT	 One other part of that--whenever there is central bank intervention, the financial markets have been quite  sensitive to listen to that. Each morning one hears what the rumors are as to whether central banks are in or not in, so that when they take a look at what they think might be affecting reserves, that would be one thing they tuck in the back of their minds to some degree. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	45	CROSS	 Most of our intervention has been done in a way which was designed to be noticed, because that was part of the purpose. And I have been impressed with the extent to which the people who watch these things closely have a pretty good fix on the amounts being done, and they know the purposes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	46	JOHNSON	 A good example, though, is this yen trans¬ action that we are doing, which is not constructed to be noticed I think. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	47	CROSS	 That's right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	48	JOHNSON	 And that's reported with a 7-day lag? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	49	KOHN	 It's not reported per se. but it's in 'Other Assets 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	50	JOHNSON	 Okay. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198808	51	CROSS	 It gets in the balance sheets and we will announce it. I give a quarterly report in September, and in that we will indicate that we have purchased these currencies. We will not be specific about the source--the counterpart--but we will indicate publicly that we have picked up these currencies. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	52	GREENSPAN	 Unless there are any further questions on this issue, I would like to move forward to domestic operations. Joan Lovett. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198808	53	LOVETT	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Following the last Committee meeting, the allowance for  adjustment and seasonal borrowing was raised by $50 billion to  $600 million. While this objective was maintained during the  intermeeting period, Federal funds rates were persistently firmer  than would normally have been associated with the allowance. For  much of the period, market expectations exerted an upward tug on  rates while Desk operations sought to resist that tug in order to  keep expectations from becoming entrenched.  Right after the last meeting, it was anticipated that  funds would trade in the area of 7-1/2 percent or a shade higher  once quarter-end pressures had passed. At the July 19 conference  call, however, it was reported that market psychology had lifted  the anticipated level to a 7-5/8 - 7-3/4 percent range and, by  the August 5 conference call, it was noted that funds were  trading in the area of 7-3/4 to 7-7/8 percent. As you know, the  increase to $700 million of path level borrowing reported at that  call never took on operational significance with the move on the  discount rate following so closely. With the 6-1/2 percent  discount rate established on August 9, it was anticipated that  $600 million of borrowing would be associated with Federal funds  in the area of 8 to 8-1/4 percent.  Desk operations were geared to providing reserves early  in each of the three full maintenance periods. A large need was  seen in the first period but fairly modest ones thereafter. The  strategy was to let excess reserves accumulate early on so as to  blunt the firming tendency in the money market. That approach  seemed to be working in the first period as Fed funds rates  softened gradually toward -- and a bit below - - anticipated  levels. In that context, an improbably large upward revision to  required reserves late in the period was viewed with considerable  skepticism. The size of the revision was highly unusual in  itself for so late in the period. It had the effect of  introducing about a $10 billion additional need and, if correct,  of virtually eliminating the accumulated excess reserves for the  period. Both outcomes seemed suspect in light of the quite  comfortable money market then prevailing. Consequently, the Desk  added only a modest amount of additional reserves. In fact, the  required reserves estimates proved to be correct, surprising both  the banks and the Desk. Funds firmed quite late and borrowing  bulged. Borrowing had already been running high because of heavy  use of the window over the July 4 weekend and the Wednesday bulge  brought the first period average to $1.3 billion. Borrowing  averaged about $600 million in each of the next two periods.  With the Desk continuing to meet reserve needs early, it was  vulnerable to some overshoot and, in fact, drained modest amounts  as both periods ended. Borrowing is averaging $560 million so  far in the current period, with funds coming in at about 8.15  percent until refunding settlement pressures yesterday lifted the  average to 8.20.  Bills were acquired from foreign accounts early in the  intermeeting period when reserve needs were thought to be larger.  However, the bulk of the reserve adjustments for the period were  made with temporary operations. On a few occasions, System RPs  were used on the more modest scale usually associated with  customer-related RPs in an effort to confront upward rate  pressure.  Why did rates firm beyond expectations? The bulge in  borrowing late in the 7/13 period was probably a contributing  factor. The level itself was considered an aberration by market  participants but it likely produced more cautious reserve  management strategies, at least on the part of the banks that  borrowed. In addition, the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony  on July 13 planted seeds of caution in two respects. The first  was his reference to the advisability of monetary policy erring  on the side of restraint. The. second was his indication that the  FOMC's central tendency expectation for real growth in 1988 was  2-3/4 - 3 percent. Market participants were unsure whether  Committee members believed that the implied slowing required over  the second half of the year would occur naturally or in response  to further monetary actions. Data on the economy released  throughout the period began to cast doubt on the likelihood of  the former scenario. Against this background, while the reserve  numbers were seen in hindsight as indicating that the Desk was  leaning against funds rate pressures as much as possible within  its reserve objectives, it was perceived as likely that this  effort would, at some point, be abandoned.  Thus, while anticipating and building in a firmer  System stance, the market was nonetheless surprised by the  discount rate change on August 9. There had been periodic rumors  of such a move over the interval, particularly on the heels of  strong employment reports, but most participants did not think  imminent action was likely. Consequently, yields adjusted  further following the move. Treasury bill rates, which had  already risen by 25 to 50 basis points, rose a further 10 to 25  basis points. Three- and six-month bills were auctioned  yesterday at 7.05 and 7.51 percent, respectively, compared with  6.59 and 6.75 percent just before the last meeting. The Treasury  has ended its prolonged period of bill paydowns and, in fact,  raised about $8-1/2 billion of new cash in the bill market during  the interval -- about $1-1/2 billion through larger regular  auctions and $7 billion through a longer-term cash management  bill sold in conjunction with the August refunding. These bills  mature next April, giving an assist to indicated needs ahead and  running off when tax receipts will have come in. Rates on  private short-term paper -- CDs, commercial paper and bankers'  acceptance -- rose by about 65 to 100 basis points. The prime  rate rose by a full percentage point to 10 percent in two stages  -- the first right after the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and the  second following the rise in the discount rate.  Yield gains on intermediate and longer maturities were  more moderate over much of the period but began to catch up  toward the end, leading to a net rise of about 50 to 60 basis  points. With data on the economy looking pretty robust,  inflation concerns were never far from the surface. The June  employment report on July 8 and the rise in the GNP price  measures reported on July 27 were particularly unsettling in this  regard. Still, the dollar's strength was lending support and  technicals were very firm. There had been little new supply of  Treasuries or corporates for much of the period and the strong  dollar was encouraging demand from foreign investors. Moreover,  it appeared increasingly certain that no bonds could be offered  by the Treasury in August and perhaps for some time beyond.  Against this background, the Treasury's announcement on August 3  of plans to sell $22 billion of coupons at the quarterly  refunding -- evenly divided between 3- and 10-year issues --  caused barely a ripple.  The strength depicted in the employment report on  August 5 brought market fundamentals back to the forefront,  however, as the rise in nonfarm payrolls came to a combined gain  of over 800,000 for the two months ending in July. Following the  rise in the discount rate, the status of the dollar came into  question as participants were unsure about the response from  foreign monetary authorities. Expectations of demand from  foreigners began to falter and, with two main props to the market  eroding - - firm technicals and strong foreign support - - yields  backpeddled quickly. The distribution of the 3-year issue  proceeded relatively well at the higher yield levels but the 10-  year is still being digested. Japanese interest in the auctions  was a bit modest relative to past experience, especially given  the absence of a long bond.  As to the current stance of Fed policy, perceptions  generally center on a borrowing objective of $600 - $650 million  and funds trading in an 8 to 8-1/4 percent range, gravitating  more toward 8-1/8 - 8-1/4 percent. The economy is seen to be  strong but not out of control. The latest news on producer  prices was a disappointment, suggesting that increased price  pressures may be closer at hand. While at this juncture there is  little anticipation that a further dramatic policy move is  imminent, most participants believe that the Fed has some further  snugging to do over the balance of the year. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198808	56	LOVETT	 Initially this morning, when the trade numbers first came out, the long bond was down about a point. It seemed that for a brief juncture it would be holding, and I don't know whether it changed further since. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	57	KOHN	 I think right before we came in, it had come back a little bit from the low point. So it was probably down about 1/2 point or less. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

198808	64	HOSKINS	 I have one question. Are you perceived in the markets as changing the way that you signal market participants as to where you want reserves or where you want the funds rate? Are you making a distinction between customer and System operations that is different? It seems to me, as I observe it in the newspapers anyway, that we are trying to signal more directly where we are with respect to funds. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198808	65	LOVETT	 Well, I think, during part of the period there was an effort to let the market know that if expectations had carried the rate beyond what the Committee had voted, that seemed to be a way of letting them know that. The reason, of course, was that these expectations could become embedded; and we were trying to signal that they were really moving faster than the Committee had instructed. The longer those things persist, the more people begin to feel that--if these expectations really get imbedded in the structure of rates--when the Committee meets again, we may have taken the decisions from it. So we felt it necessary to give a signal when rates seemed to be ratcheting higher. That was particularly true when funds seemed to be getting sticky at the 7/8ths level. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198808	66	HOSKINS	 That kind of gets to the heart of whether we are focusing on borrowings or the funds rate and all that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0

198808	73	PRELL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ted will be following me with some comments on this morning's trade data as well as some remarks on the implications of recent foreign exchange market developments. In the broadest terms, the thrust of our economic forecast has  not changed greatly from what it has been for a while. However, the  events of recent months have, in effect, upped the ante noticeably.  Growth has been stronger than we anticipated, levels of resource  utilization have risen faster, and it appears that the policy action  needed to rein in inflationary pressures may be greater than we earlier  thought. Indeed, it was as recently as the March Committee meeting that  we were predicting that the fed funds rate would peak below 8 percent.  In last month's chart show, we indicated that we expected to  see business activity begin to decelerate this summer. The information  received since then, however, has run counter to that view. The June  and July labor market data are the most important evidence on this  score, with employment rising sharply and the unemployment rate edging  lower on balance.  Since the Greenbook was published last week, the incoming data  have only reinforced the impression of strength. Revised figures on  retail sales indicate that consumer spending was higher than the  Commerce Department estimated for the second quarter. And although the  gain in sales reported for July was modest, it appears that we are on  track with our forecast for better than 2-1/2 percent growth in real  consumer outlays in the third quarter,  Meanwhile, last week's data also revealed that business  inventories probably grew less in the spring than Commerce thought.  Inventories look leaner at midyear than we had expected them to be, and  we now believe that efforts to build stocks will be positive factor in  aggregate demand over the next few months. In our June forecast, a  slowing in non-auto inventory accumulation contributed to the projected  second-half deceleration of GNP.  The picture also has changed in the automotive sector. Sales  of cars and light trucks have held up well, and in addition, the  Commerce Department has revised its seasonal factors. Consequently, it  no longer looks like car production will exert the appreciable drag on  measured GNP growth in the current quarter that previously was  anticipated.  The July data on industrial production are indicative of the  continuing strength of the manufacturing sector generally. Output is  estimated to have risen another eight-tenths of a percent last month and  growth in this quarter seems likely to exceed by a substantial margin  the 4-1/4 percent annual rate of increase registered in the first half.  The gains last month were widespread, but especially noteworthy is the  further evidence of strong demand for capital goods. Production of  business equipment rose 1 percent, matching the average increase in the  preceding three months.  We have received only a few pieces of statistical information  on capital spending since the last meeting. What we have received,  coupled with the anecdotal information, suggests to us that, not only  will business fixed investment show the kind of second-half strength  that we had been expecting previously, but likely will be carrying  greater momentum into 1989. Real BFI is now projected to rise 4-1/2  percent next year, as compared with 2-1/4 percent in our previous  forecast. It is our sense that rising utilization rates and profits are  prompting a good many manufacturers to enlarge their capital spending  programs, which will push up outlays for both equipment and industrial  structures. The historical evidence suggests that capital spending is  very insensitive to interest rate movements in the short run, and we  think that it would take stronger fears of recession or of substantial  dollar appreciation to reverse the current underlying momentum of  investment.  The strengthening in this key element of domestic spending  works to offset the effects of a higher dollar on output growth in 1989    and helps explain the upward revision in our projection of interest  rates. We now are looking for a federal funds rate in the 9-1/2 percent  range by next spring and Treasury bond yields in the vicinity of 10-1/2  percent. This isn't all that much higher than in the June chart show,  but it does signal our judgment that the economic winds against which  the Fed is attempting to lean may be considerably stiffer than we  previously had anticipated.  Real GNP growth in the second half of 1988 is now projected to  be about 2-1/2 percent, just a little faster than in June. However,  that figure includes the effects of the drought on farm output, which  look to be substantially larger now. If one abstracts from those  losses, growth is more like 3-1/4 percent, and consequently we are  expecting that the unemployment rate will remain in the 5.3 to 5.4  percent area   about a quarter point lower than in the last forecast.  Moreover, capacity utilization rates, now approaching 84 percent for  total manufacturing and exceeding 87 percent in the primary processing  industries, are higher than we previously expected. Under the  circumstances, we believe that pressures on resources are great enough  to pose the risk of a serious acceleration of inflation.  The second-quarter data on wages and total compensation confirm  that there already has been a pickup in labor cost inflation since last  year. Depending on which series you look at, compensation growth over  the past year has been 1/2 to 1-1/2 percent faster than in the preceding  12 months. Reports of shortages of workers have become more numerous,  as have those of substantial jumps in pay to attract or hold employees.  On the price side, the indications of acceleration are less  clearcut. The prices of some basic industrial commodities actually  have softened recently, probably in part because of the dollar's  appreciation. However, as we look at final goods and services, we think  there are at least hints of some step-up in the trend of price  increases. The most recent report on producer prices, released on  Friday, certainly was striking, with the index for all finished goods  excluding food and energy up 0.6 percent and the consumer component of  that measure up almost a full percent.  Despite the fact that we are showing a slowing in growth next  year that produces an upcreep in the unemployment rate and a slight  decline in capacity utilization, we have forecast a rise in compensation  of about 5 percent in 1989 and an increase in GNP prices of about 4-1/2  percent. Both of these inflation numbers have been raised almost 1/2  point since our last projection. In making this forecast, we have  continued to discount considerably the more pessimistic predictions of  many econometric models, but I must say that we do so with a greater  uneasiness. Those models no longer appear to have had so great a  proclivity to over-predict, now that the hourly compensation figures for  1985 to '87 have been revised upward.  I would like to conclude my remarks with a couple of  legislative notes. First, we have not yet incorporated into our  forecast a hike in the federal minimum wage. There is a clear risk that  the Congress will pass a bill. Our assessment is that the effect of  such a law would be to add a couple of tenths to the rate of  compensation increase in 1989.  The other legislative area that comes to mind increasingly as  we look at the possiblibility of still higher interest rates is fiscal  policy. Our model simulations suggest that, if the Greenbook forecast  is correct in its assessment of underlying demands for goods and  services, holding short-term rates at current levels would prevent the  anticipated deceleration in growth, and cause inflation trends to look  considerably worse in 1990.  On the other hand, the models suggest that much greater  monetary restraint than we have assumed would be required if there were  a desire to begin reducing inflation rates before 1990. The interest  rates we already have in our forecast probably would be enough to  exacerbate significantly the pressures on the thrift industry in  particular, and we are all aware of the financial exposures elsewhere in  the economy. Moreover, pushing up real interest rates might tend to  boost the dollar, which may not be attractive. Under the circumstances,  early action to cut the federal budget deficit looks to be a possible  key to easing the apparent tension between the objectives of reducing  inflation and fostering continued external adjustment.As Sam Cross has already reported, the Q.imiiprue Department this  morning released its preliminary estimate of the June trade deficit  based on the cif valuation of imports and Census reports. She deficit  was $ 12.5 billion, and the May deficit was revised down to $ 9.8 billion from the preliminary estimate of $10.9 billion. Both  agricultural exports and oil imports declined in June. Non-oil imparts rose sharply after quite a large downward revision in the May figure_ non-agricultural exports declined slightly in June, but exports in May were revised up.  Taken together these new figures imply a very slight increase  in the trade deficit in the second quarter compared with the figures BEA  used in preparing the preliminary estimate of real GNP. In 1982  dollars, the revision might subtract a tenth of a percentage point, at an annual rate, from the estimated growth rate of real GNP in the second  quarter.  The May-June data were broadly in line with cur own estimate  that was used as tbe basis of the Greenbook forecast. That outlook  involves a continued, but more gradual, narrowing of our trade and current account deficits through the end of 1989. In that projection, the trade deficit reaches $100 billion at an annual rate and the current  account deficit reaches about $120 billion at an annual rate in the  fourth quarter of next year.  Two key elements influenced the staff forecast prepared for this meeting. First was the better-titian-expected performance of the  trade deficit in recent months, especially with respect to non-oil  imparts. Second was the stronger dollar.  Considering, first, near-term trade developments, it is our judgment that seme of the decline in non-oil imports observed in the second quarter is likely to be temporary. In part, it appears to have been associated with the modest inventory correction that took place in  those months. Moreover, inventories of Japanese vehicles at dealers in  the United States were at relatively high levels at the start of the new  quota-year in April. Therefore, it is likely that the seasonal pattern of automotive imports from Japan will change this year even if the total  for the year does not change much. Indeed, through June, shipments from Japan were running about 15 percent below the front-loaded pace of last  year.  Although such considerations lead us to conclude that part of  the decline in non-oil imparts in the second quarter was temporary,  revisions in the historical data suggest a lower volume of non-oil  imparts in the recent past, and we are more confident that some of the  weakness in non-oil imports will persist for a while. At the same time,  the recent robust behavior of nonagricultural exports tends to reinforce  our view that a substantial correction of the external accounts is  underway, even if it is unlikely to continue at the torrid pace of the first half of this year.  This improving trend in our external accounts was one of the factors, along with a favorable perception of the stance of United States  monetary policy, that led to the strengthening of the dollar over the  past couple of months in exchange markets. In July, the average level  of the dollar in terms of the other 6-10 countries' currencies was about  7-1/2 percent above the average in May.  In constructing our forecast, we had to reach a judgment about how the dollar is likely to fare in the future. We built into our forecast a projection that holds the dollar roughly flat at its July level on average far the balance of the year. In 1989, the dollar is  projected to resume its decline at a moderate rate. On balance the dollar's average level over the forecast period is about 8 percent higher than in the last Greenback. As a consequence, in the fourth ijwH-PT- of 1989, the dollar's foreign exchange value in real terms against other G-10 currencies is projected to be essentially the same as it was in the fourth quarter of last year, though the dollar would be a bit lower in real terms against the currencies of the major developing  countries.  Three elements influenced our thinking about the dollar.  First, as I already noted, we concluded that the adjustment in our  external accounts was proceeding somevhat better than we had expected.  Second, we continue to believe that sustained external adjustment cannot be achieved with the dollar at its current level, and at some point its  decline will resume. In other words, we suspect that the euphoria in  the foreign exchange market may have been a bit overdone. Third, we  incorporated into our projection for the dollar the effects of the  higher level of United States interest rates that are now assumed in toe basic  forecast.  The higher dollar compared with the last Greenbook, of course, has implications for cur forecast. I thought it might be helpful to give the Committee some sense of the timing and the magnitude of the implications for the pressure of aggregate demand, where the estimates are based on the staff's econometric models. I would emphasize, however, that these models are generally more useful in helping us to  understand the overall magnitudes of effects than in predicting their precise time patterns.  As a first approximation, one can think of the new projected path of the dollar relative to the path in the last Greenbook as a discrete real appreciation of the dollar of about 8 percent in the third quarter of 1988. Our models suggest that such an appreciation should reduce the level of real GNP by about a rpyirftpr of a percentage point in the first half of 1989 and by about half a percentage point in the second half of toe year. We would expect most of the impact would be  felt by the end of the forecast period.  In our forecast, two conflicting influences tend to modify  somewhat the effects of toe dollar's appreciation. First, the strong  near-term performance of the trade balance that I dismissed earlier led  us to delay toe impact of the stringer dollar far a couple of quarters;  in effect, the projection starts off from a better level of zeal net  exports. Second, because toe higher level of the dollar is in part  caused by toe higher projected path of United States interest rates and because we are net debtors on portfolio investments, net service payments were increased somewhat in real terms; this adds to the drag from the higher  dollar on real net exports of goods and services. However, lest one think that toe stronger dollar implies that real net exports become a overall negative in our forecast, I would point out that about one third  of the expansion in real GNP in 1989 is still projected to come from an  improvement in real net exports.  Finally, one might be interested in toe implications far the  staff's outlook of a projection for toe dolla r in which it essentially remains at its recent elevated level throughout toe projection period but without requiring changes in United States monetary or fiscal policies to  accomplish that feat, other than those incorporated in cur basic forecast. Since the dollar now is expected to be stable around its  recent level through yearend and decline only moderately thereafter, a  stable dollar all the way through the end of 1989 has only a small  impact on demand pressures at toe end of the forecast period   that is it would reduce the level of real GNP in the second half of the year by about a quarter of a percentage point. Most of the impact comes in  1990.  In other words, if toe dollar were to remain stable around its  current level, toe near-term reduction of demand pressures would be minimal. On the other hand, if toe dollar were to appreciate  substantially further in the next couple of months, a significant impact might be felt by the middle of next year.  Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentation. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	74	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Questions for either gentleman?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	75	PARRY	 Ted, I have a question about your net export number. With this small decline in the value of the dollar that you're assuming, wouldn't a model forecast typically give less of an improvement in net exports than what you're showing? It seems to me that for this year it's something like $47 billion, and for the next year it's $32 billion. At least some of the models I've seen would suggest that with that kind of very small decline in the value of the dollar you would have a more significant slowing in the improvement in net exports than you have. Was that managed to some extent or-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	76	TRUMAN	 Well yes, I think to some extent it was because, as I mentioned, we were encouraged by what we had seen in the first half of this year. So, given that, along with other anecdotes and so forth and so on, we have carried a bit more of that through to the second half of the year. And, in effect, that attenuates some of the effect of the dollar alone on the forecast. So we scaled it back a little bit on the basis of an assessment of what the appreciation to date has achieved for us, or how much it's going to achieve for us. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	77	PARRY	 So at least that's one area where perhaps it could turn out that there'd be a little less pressure in terms of growth? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	78	TRUMAN	 That's right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	79	PARRY	 Okay, thank you sir. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	80	TRUMAN	 It could also be a little more. I must say you try to put it down and-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	81	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	82	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I was just going to ask Ted: Have you redone your projections of net exports since you got the Census merchandise trade figures? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198808	83	TRUMAN	" Essentially, they are very close, [even] with the revision. Although the June number is ""bad"", the May revision was quite large and in fact if anything, the two together were a little better than we expected in our forecast. They were a little worse than what was implicit in the GNP numbers. But it translates to something like maybe a 10th or two at an annual rate on the second- quarter real GNP. So that's not going to change anything. And both components pretty much matched up with what we suspected. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	84	BLACK	 This figure for net exports for, say, the fourth quarter of 1989 would not be very far off from $47.2 billion then? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198808	85	TRUMAN	 Yes. The number would be exact. I think that number, if I may put it that way, had less impact on us than normal. I wouldn't-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	86	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	87	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the staff for giving us these drought-adjusted GNP projections because I think these really give us a more realistic appraisal of the pressure on resources that we are likely to see during the rest of the year than  the ordinary GNP numbers. The decline from the drought is hardly a usual source of decline in the GNP because it doesn't generate any resources that you can shift into other uses in the economy. So, if you look at drought-adjusted growth rates for this past quarter and the next two quarters, you get 3.6 percent for the second quarter--a number I got from my staff--3.8 percent in the third quarter, and 2.8 percent in the fourth. And I must say that this adds up to two full years now of running the economy substantially in excess of our long- term growth potential. We have a real barn burner of an economy on our hands. That's the only thing I can see. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	1.0
198808	88	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	89	JOHNSON	 I wanted to ask Mike a question. What percentage of the GNP growth rate is investment demand considered to be in terms of the components of the growth rate? Is that a big factor? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	90	PRELL	 If we look at the next couple of quarters, real BFI accounts for a third of the GNP growth in the third and the fourth quarters. Over the course of next year, it accounts for about 20 percent of the growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	91	JOHNSON	 It's pretty significant. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	92	PRELL	 It's clearly a key dynamic income-generated sector in this forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	93	GREENSPAN	 If you add in the inventories that go with that as one of the long production cycle, you're getting nine months of consolidated inventory in front of the expenditure outlook. I suspect the numbers would be a significant increment over that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	94	PRELL	 As I noted, we now are looking for inventories, at least over the second half of this year, to be positively contributing to GNP growth. And we are looking for it to be significantly in the manufacturing area, related in part to this durable goods strength in business equipment in particular. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	95	JOHNSON	 How big of a factor is PDE in that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	96	PRELL	 It's the bulk of it--if not more than that if we are right in our forecast of negative nonresidential structures over the second half and essentially flat next year. So the whole story is producers durable equipment. And a large part of that story is our reading of the current trend in the computer and office equipment area, which has been growing very rapidly. While we had it tailing off noticeably over the forecast period, it remains a strong element in the forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	97	JOHNSON	 The reason I'm asking is because I was struck by the presentation to the Board yesterday and talking with Charlie Schultz earlier who made a comment I thought was kind of interesting. He said that a lot of that PDE growth--correct me if I'm wrong--is the deflator. The decline in prices for producers durable equipment is generating a lot of the real output side of that. If you apply a fixed-weight deflator to PDE, I don't know that you get a totally different result, but what does it do?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	98	PRELL	 I think that would overstate the contribution that makes. The PDE deflator is declining-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	99	GREENSPAN	 It's not the PDE deflator; it's the computer component. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	100	JOHNSON	 Computers. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	101	PRELL	 Indeed, but looking at the total PDE number-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	102	JOHNSON	 I was noticing yesterday it was down about 3 percent, or 2-1/2 percent. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	103	PRELL	 The total PDE deflator is declining at something over 2 percent a year in this forecast. Given that we have PDE rising at 14 percent this year and 6 percent next year, it isn't the whole story by any means. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	104	JOHNSON	 It's not the whole show. Well, say you apply the fixed-weight deflator though, how much would that take out of the growth in PDE? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	105	PRELL	 It's not so much I think the fixed-weight as the question of whether you want to really deflate those computer expenditures at that rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	106	JOHNSON	 Okay that, then. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	107	PRELL	 I don't-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	108	JOHNSON	 I'm not suggesting we should, but I'm saying I think that's a relevant measure. But-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	109	PARRY	 But if you didn't take that into account, it would be very misleading. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	110	GREENSPAN	 But I think the issue is-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	111	PRELL	 I think the other thing to consider is that, in a sense, your potential and actual growth would be lowered by the same token. Your measured real growth would be slower and your potential real growth would be slower, but resource utilization quotations in the short run wouldn't be materially different. So, I think we are getting distortions of some of the numbers, in effect, by this base- to-base year against which we are measuring PDE prices--computer prices in particular. But I think the real crux of the matter is that no matter how you slice it, we are at levels of resource utilization much higher than they had been or than we had expected. That's what's really driving our inflation forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	112	JOHNSON	 Okay. But you're suggesting, though, that the potential number changes with the way you look at the deflator? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	113	PRELL	 Well, if you were to assert that GNP growth has been overstated by the use of these 1982 price deflators, then presumably potential GNP growth is also being commensurately overstated. So it doesn't give you any more room to maneuver. I think it's important to have some handle on what's happening with the  capital stock for one's assessment of productive potential. But that's a much longer-horizon issue. This is sort of like those other questions relating to the possible mismeasurement of output whether it's [unintelligible] or anything else that affects both actual and potential output [unintelligible]. And it doesn't do much for the gap. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	114	PARRY	 Isn't the analytical issue raised here that you may be overstating inflation a little bit--that there has actually been more real growth because of declining prices, which has not been taken account of in the fixed-weight index. It seems to me that may be a bigger analytical issue in this area. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	115	PRELL	 Well, this gets into very complicated, almost metaphysical, issues. I'm not sure that there really is a problem in the sense of overestimating. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	116	JOHNSON	 But you can't look at the fixed-weight on one side only. It seems to me that you've got to be consistent. And like you say, if you believe the deflator issue is important on the growth side, then you should be looking at the implicit deflator otherwise-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	117	PRELL	 I'm not sure; it depends on the question. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	118	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think this question-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	119	JOHNSON	 Well, it's almost an apples and oranges problem, though. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	120	GREENSPAN	 Now we are about to get into the discussion of what is the definition of a unit of economic output. And that's going to go on for six weeks! 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	121	JOHNSON	 Yes. Okay, I will stop. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	122	GREENSPAN	 I'd appreciate that. I think they're horrible. We had a running debate at the Board meetings on this subject--on the effect of the shifting base of the price index in the GNP--which probably at this stage fills up about six looseleaf books of about 1,000 pages. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	123	JOHNSON	 That's right. It doesn't change the overall story, but it does around the margin. That's okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	124	GREENSPAN	 Change the structure. President Melzer. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	125	MELZER	 Mike, I wondered on the personal consumption expenditures, does the greater amount of floating rate debt--home equity loans as well as ARMs--in this cycle have a significant impact there? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198808	126	PRELL	 We've thought about that. I must say the amount of quantitative work we have done to date on this is not as much as I think we want to do over time. It's hard to get a fix on the household portfolio. Our assessment is that probably the amount of what I might call rate-sensitive assets does not exceed the amount of rate-sensitive liabilities in quite the same proportion as it previously did. But, on balance, an increase in interest rates tends  to augment household cash flow. We don't think the changes that have occurred really would make a big difference in the responses of the household sector in the short run. But it is a new ball game to some extent, and there are distributional questions that we don't have a real good fix on. So I think it's something worth giving further thought and investigation to. But our basic assessment is that it doesn't make a big difference. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	127	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	128	HOSKINS	 I was intrigued by your comments about inflation and what might be necessary to get it moving in the downward direction. In fact, your forecast does have it moving down and I think you have the peak in the fourth quarter. I guess that prompts the question: What kind of tightening do you have in mind in terms of interest rates? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198808	129	PRELL	 Well, there're two things I should say. One, the quarterly pattern between now and the end of next year reflects in significant measure the quarterly pattern of food price increases, which are strong until next spring and then are tailing off toward the end of the year. The second thing is that it reflects the particular pattern of oil prices and energy prices that we have assumed in this forecast. And that is an element that contributes to inflation in the first part of next year, after having been essentially flat in the second half of this year. So the bulge there is somewhat misleading. More fundamentally, we think the trend is one of acceleration at least through much of next year, and then tending into 1990 with an ever so slight upward tilt to compensation and underlying price trends. We assume that interest rates will continue to move up over the next couple of quarters and we essentially have that 9-1/2 percent area funds rate being reached by early next spring. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	130	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	131	HELLER	 I was wondering whether Ted Truman could say a few more words about the economic, and particularly the monetary policy, assumptions that he has underlying the dollar forecast in other countries, especially Japan and Germany? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	132	TRUMAN	 For the monetary policy side, we have interest rates abroad rising at about half the amount that they do here over the forecast period. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	133	HELLER	 What they will do in the future or they-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	134	TRUMAN	 Yes, that's right. So, that may be between 1/2 and 3/4 of a percentage point on short-term rates abroad over the forecast period. On the fiscal policy side, we don't have anything built in of a particularly stimulative nature in any of those countries. As you know, there's a slight expectation that fiscal policy in Germany will be coming in tighter in this forecast horizon. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	135	HELLER	 Thanks. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	136	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	137	SEGER	 Mike, could you elaborate a little bit more on the interest rate outlook pattern? I know you mentioned fed funds are expected to reach 9-1/2 percentby next spring, and I think you said long-term Treasury bonds, 10-1/2 percent. It's hard to hear this morning at this end of the table, but I think you said 10-1/2 percent by next spring. Are you suggesting that this will be the peaking of rates for this cycle or that this is just sort of a run? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	138	PRELL	 Again, I express that we recognize the uncertainty about these things and wouldn't want to be excessively precise in our characterization of what is involved in this forecast. But basically, we have the rates getting up to that level by the second quarter of next year and staying there. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	139	SEGER	 How about mortgage rates? I noticed in your commentary you indicated that you think housing is probably number one on the hit list, as we tighten further. But when I went through and looked at some of the forecast numbers I didn't see really major downward revisions. So, maybe you can tell me what kind of mortgage-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	140	PRELL	 We've made only a modest downward revision in housing starts as we get out into 1989 some ways. We've made some upward adjustment in the mortgage rate forecast. Mortgage rates have been running a bit tighter to the Treasuries than they had previously. We have mortgage rates getting up towards 12 percent in the second half and very possibly around 12 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198808	141	SEGER	 12 percent. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	142	GREENSPAN	 Are there any further questions for either gentleman? If not, we are ready to do our round robin. Who would like to start off? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	143	BOYKIN	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I'll start with the Eleventh District and get the less -than-good news out of the way early. I would say that the perception of what's happening in the Texas economy, and the Eleventh District generally, is improving somewhat. I think we are beginning to see some evidence showing through in the statistics. We did have growth in our District in the last half of last year that had kind of plateaued or stalled out during the first half of this year. But now we do think that we are seeing some renewed or resumed growth in the District and this is reflected in the employment numbers and that is primarily centered in Texas. Those categories where we are not seeing much improvement, of course, remain in the construction side of it, finance, and insurance. We do have our real estate remaining weak. We've had fairly good rains in our District, although somewhat spotty, but the feeling is that the rains have ameliorated the drought effects. The information that we are getting from our bankers around the District is that they don't see a major threat to timely repayment of agricultural loans in the District. We are somewhat nervous, I guess, about oil prices. If we do get a decline there, that obviously will be a negative. However, there has been so much adjustment to lower oil prices that it would not have the same effect as earlier declines had. Given the fact that our economy seems to be so much more closely linked to the national  economy, and given the fairly good forecast for the national economy, we feel that that will continue to be a pull for us and will be positive. Attitudinally, as far as the financial situation is concerned, I think there is a great deal of relief with the approach to the resolution of the First Republic situation, and that has received very good press, has been very well received. Now the remaining speculation is whether the last big one will have to have some kind of relief. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198808	144	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	145	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, economic activity in our District continues to show I think very, very considerable strength. That's particularly true in the manufacturing sector, and more specifically in those activities that are either related to exports or capital goods where those operating levels continue to be very, very high. The steel industry, for example, is continuing to run at quite close to capacity. The third quarter is normally a period in which the steel industry shuts down a bit to deal with maintenance, but this year the maintenance is being deferred to deal with continuing demand. Chemicals and paper are continuing to run at high levels. Auto production schedules for the third quarter are considerably higher than in the third quarter of last year. So, I do think on the capital expenditures side, Mike has certainly covered it very well. I think we are going to see higher increases in capital expenditures than we may have forecast. And I'm sensing from a lot of companies that they really are thinking about adding significantly to their expenditure level. I have just a couple of comments on the agricultural situation, other than crop estimates, which you've seen. First, implements: Interestingly, as we got started on this drought thing, it did not show up in implement sales. Through June they were holding pretty well; but the July numbers are now in and, on a comparative basis, July sales of tractors and combines, for example, are considerably under last year. That's not surprising, but certainly this is a negative feature. Agricultural banks, a second element of agriculture comments: We surveyed the agricultural banks in our District again last week, and the story I think continues to be more positive than one had expected it to be. The weak producers were weeded out in the previous adjustment. Those credits now on the books are farmers who are strong enough that they can deal with this drought without a renewal of significant problems among the banks. To me, the most surprising shift that I've sensed over the last month or two is this employment thing. There has been, I think, quite a modification in attitudes out there. There is now, I think, quite persistently a shortage of [unintelligible]. The manufacturers I have talked to are running at very high levels, and their constraint really is the availability of labor to deal with it. And that's also the case I think in the service sector. I was talking to somebody the other day that has opened two major retail stores in Chicago. They put out applications, or requests for applications, and they were flooded with people. But they have high standards for their employment, and the applicants came in short on that. Therefore, they have opened one of their stores very significantly undermanned. As I  talk to people, it seems that the shortage of labor really is beginning to be felt. There are a couple of key contracts for which negotiations have just started. And I think people have been following that very closely. My sense of all this is that the wage side and the inflation picture are going to continue to accelerate. We are going to continue to see increases in wage costs . 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198808	146	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	147	PARRY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy continues to grow at a healthy pace, with particular strength in the coastal states, excluding Alaska. This growth appears to be putting upward pressure on wages. For example, in southern California, Oregon and Washington, employers are having difficulty hiring qualified workers at prevailing wages. I also might say parenthetically that in California the minimum wage rose to $4.25 effective July 1st. Inventories are satisfactory to lean throughout the District at both the manufacturer and retail levels. In some industries, including paper and aluminum, low inventory levels result from strong demand combined with limited production capacity. When we checked with District retailers, they indicated that the previously excessive inventories in women's apparel, which were quite a problem a couple of months ago, have been brought under control. If I may turn briefly to the national economy: Even with the drought, real growth is likely to exceed the growth of potential output during the second half of this year. And next year we expect growth similar to that in the Greenbook, assuming further significant tightening of monetary policy between now and mid-1989. We do have a somewhat stronger dollar and a smaller improvement in net exports, but in our forecast this is offset by stronger consumption than that which is incorporated in the Greenbook. With the economy continuing to grow above or at potential over the forecast period, inflation in 1989-- measured by the fixed-weight deflator--seems certain to accelerate by the roughly 1/2 percent that is in our forecast and the Greenbook's. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	148	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	149	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to tell a little different story today than I usually do. In fact, since I've been sitting on this Committee I have not had an opportunity to report lower economic activity in the Sixth District at any time. But I'm going to make that kind of a report today because activity in the Sixth District, with the exception of Florida, is slower than in the nation. I think this is partly a reflection of strength elsewhere. Of course, Louisiana and Mississippi have been in the doldrums for some time, but now Georgia is beginning to experience slower growth than the rest of the country, basically because of less immigration than in the past. Having said that, several of the region's manufacturing industries are quite strong. Paper and pulp products, for example, ship building, and petrochemical plants are starting modernization and expansion projects, basically in reponse to pressure on capacity. They also report higher prices for materials. I've talked to a lot of business people and really pressed very hard since the last meeting on the wage question. And I don't  think I'm really much more ahead than I was the last time in the sense that, while there is this anticipation of higher wages and a fear that it's going to happen, I'm not hearing that it actually has taken place. Some of the people that I've talked to are in fact labor union people, and in the organized labor sector I don't get any report, at least in our area, of any pressure for wage increases of any kind. They report to me that job security is basically the major concern of workers at the present time. However, I would also report what Si Keehn mentioned that there does seem to be a shortage of labor, particularly in the service area. And a number of firms that I've talked to are having difficulty getting entry level people even though they're paying above the minimum wage. Of course, in Louisiana the unemployment rate is the highest in the nation and so the expansion that we have in some industries like chemicals is taking place in a very soft market for labor. In addition to this, we've had substantial layoffs and will continue to have substantial layoffs at Lockheed, where the work force is estimated to fall from 20,000 to 12,000 over the next 12 months--a very, very substantial layoff. And that's occurring right now. We are also getting cutbacks in the automobile plants, and TVA is cutting back in Alabama as well as in Tennessee and that's supplying labor to the region. We also have a fraction of Eastern Airlines cutting--, a relatively small impact, but a negative one nonetheless. Nonresidential construction in our region is stronger than the rest of the nation; it's up about 4 percent, which perhaps is a little surprising. I am a little concerned about the projects that are on the drawing boards, particularly in the city of Atlanta. I'm concerned that the volume of new office space is not going to be absorbed very soon. We have fortunately had some rainfall. It has been very spotty, but I think it has provided enough moisture to salvage the soybean crop, at least for the time being. So we are doing a little better there. Looking at the national economy, we have no basic differences with the Greenbook forecast. There's a slight difference perhaps in unemployment, which we don't expect to rise quite as much, and our inflation forecast would be marginally higher. I think, however we look at it, we are looking at a very strong economy. And I don't see that that is going to abate any time soon, and that obviously has implications for policy. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198808	150	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	151	MELZER	 Anecdotal information that I've picked up in some recent calls would tend to confirm what's in the Greenbook. For example, I would describe retailers as guardedly optimistic. August got off to a good start in the first week and then was somewhat slow in the second week, but I think that was felt to be largely weather- related. In general, I think retailers feel that they've got their inventories in pretty good shape. They don't feel terribly exposed and they are guardedly optimistic about the prospects here. On the manufacturing side, you pick up the sense of strength still in capital goods orders --backlogs, and so forth. The commentary  on the raw material price increases over the last year or so is that there's still some evidence of difficulty in passing all of that along. In the District itself, our numbers for the most recent quarter, which would be the second quarter, reflect what Bob Forrestal has described. Some employment declines show up in construction, textiles and apparel, food processing, and the like. But in general, we have paralleled the rest of the country. I don't attribute too much to this weakness. I think it has to do, as Bob said a while ago, with the fact that there's strength elsewhere as opposed to signs of imminent weakness in our District. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198808	152	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	153	BOEHNE	 The District economy continues to operate at very high levels, with increasingly tight labor markets. The only part of the District where I'm hearing complaints about the pressures on wages is from the Jersey shore; and that's largely, I think, from the Second District's garbage floating down there. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198808	154	CORRIGAN	 We've got a lot of that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198808	155	BOEHNE	 As I say, there's nothing new. As far as the nation--I think it has been said a variety of ways--but the bottom line is that we are in a territory of accelerating inflation and we have to resist that growth. The only questions are timing and magnitude. As far as the components of risk, I agree that the risks are on the upside on capital spending. But we may get more restraint on consumption this time around than we have in the past, largely I think because of the increase in variable interest rates on consumer- type loans, both home equity loans and also variable-rate mortgages. If people have to spend an extra $50 or $100 a month on mortgage payments, that gets right into consumption fairly quickly. I think the shorter lags on consumption really are what we want because, as you look at the profile of the expansion, we are getting personal consumption growing 2-1/2 percent and what we really would like to do is get it down in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range to be able to bring about the shift toward the external sectors. So I think that we really do need to watch this consumption. We may find that we'll get quicker restraint from monetary policy tightening than we have in the past. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198808	156	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	157	HOSKINS	 The story in the District hasn't changed much. There is still strength across the board in the manufacturing sector, so I won't bore you with the details of that. What we've focused on, and what many of you have focused on, is what's happening in labor markets. We have two areas where we have some shortages occurring right now. One happens to be in the service areas, at entry level positions. It's particularly bad in the Columbus area, which has had a very strong economy. The second area is in the more skilled positions in manufacturing, and that's across the board in a number of different cities where capital projects are underway. So, we are experiencing some labor shortages right now. A major bank in the Columbus area is talking about total compensation increases in the neighborhood of 5-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent--I can't define it any better than that--because of the difficulties of getting people on board in that market and the rising wage rates at the entry level.  In terms of retail activity, the Pittsburgh market has a 15 to 20 percent hike in wages for entry level people because a major retailer there is in the market trying to hire 1,200 people. In terms of sales, They've noticed a significant increase in what she would call back-to-school buying. They would have expected about a 10 percent gain and what they're getting is something on the order of 25 percent. Now that is firm specific, so there could be some things that have gone on within the firm generating that. The only sign of weakness that I could find happens to be in a little stainless and steel strip indicator that I follow. It's an index of new orders put out by one firm, and that's dropped significantly in the month of July. What this seems to mean is that we haven't seen any signs of real weakness. We don't have a boom; but we have continuing strength across the board and some tightening up in labor markets. As we look at the national picture, we don't see it much differently than the staff, a little higher on the inflation side. I think we have a little more in terms of the labor compensation built in than they do, but not a lot. I think the risks are clear, probably not worth stating, but I'll do it anyway. They're obviously on the inflation side at this point. I don't think we've seen sufficient signs that our policies have impacted the economy. Maybe there's a lag that we haven't seen yet--that they will begin to impact. But I think we ought to gear our policy more towards the risk of inflation. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198808	158	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	159	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I share Frank Morris's appreciation of the staff's efforts to give us some drought-adjusted figures for the GNP for the projection period. Obviously, that drought has been a severe blow to a lot of parts of the country, but there's really nothing that monetary policy can do in the short run to deal with that. So, I think we need to focus on these drought-adjusted figures in trying to plan the course of monetary policy. These figures show GNP, after a bulge in this quarter, working down on a drought-adjusted basis to around 2 percent in the early part of next year. That seems to me--in light of the tightness in labor markets and the higher levels of capacity in a lot of key industries--to be about as fast as we would want GNP to grow at this stage. I'm not quite as optimistic as Ed Boehne was--and I gather, probably Martha--that on the basis of these variable rates on consumer loans, consumption will slow down as much as the staff has guessed. They've got 1.3 percent throughout each quarter of 1989. If I had to guess, I would think it's probably going to run higher than that-- although that would certainly be a desirable rate, in view of the necessity of getting that down to the point that we can accommodate an improvement in our balance of payments. What really bothers me most, I think, is what bothers most of the others: that despite all this tightening that we have done up until now, and the staff's projection of considerably more tightening beyond this, we've still got pretty big increases in inflation projected. For example, the CPI less food and energy is rising at over a 5 percent rate at the end of next year, and much the same sort of thing is true for the fixed-weight GNP deflator, which is close to  4-1/2 percent. These may be too high, I don't know, but they certainly seem reasonable to me, given the upward pressure on wages and employment costs that are now becoming increasingly apparent. And what this means to me is that we still have a serious inflation threat facing us. And if we have projected inflation at less than it actually tarns out to be, then that's going to cross, I think, a pretty important threshhold in terms of what it would do to inflationary expectations. And I think that could be very serious indeed. So I hope we can hold it down some--at least as low as the staff is projecting. And I would like to think we can do better than that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198808	160	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	161	STERN	 With regard to the national economy, a point that the staff commented on and that I would emphasize is that it seems the surprises this year really have been almost uniformly on the upside. The incoming statistics seem to continue to indicate strength, as I read them, and it seems to me that we have used up capacity more quickly than we had anticipated. As I look at the District economy, both the measures of economic performance and the anecdotes I'm hearing suggest to me that surprises may continue on the upside for some time longer. I commented last time that, at least in many of the diversified economies of our District, we had boom or close to boom conditions, and that's continuing in those economies. The one really new piece of information that I picked up in the last several weeks that I wasn't hearing much about earlier--and allowing for all the caveats such as I don't know what the seasonal factors are and the sample is small and so forth--is that I have heard from a wide range of manufacturers about their ability to raise prices now 4 or 5 percent. In some cases this is the first price increase in 2 or 3 years. But they are now putting them in place. And some have commented that this is now the first increase; they plan on another one later in the fall. So for what that's worth, I think I've started to hear a lot more, not about concerns about inflation, but about actual price increases. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0

198808	163	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, the New England economy appears to have moved into a new phase at the beginning of the fourth quarter of last year. For 13 years we were an economy that was growing faster than the economy as a whole, and about 40 percent faster in terms of the rate of growth in personal income. Since September of last year, we've seen a situation in which the rate of growth in New England is running a little over 1/2 the rate of growth of employment for the country as a whole and about the same rate of growth of personal income. I've been analyzing this and I've concluded that the reason for the slowdown is simply sheer shortages of labor. The unemployment rate is 2.8 percent for New England as a whole. And there's just no way that we are going to be a growth area in the next decade, it seems to me. This is causing some embarrassing spinoffs. The governor of Massachusetts has found his revenues coming in well below projections. And, of course, the reason is simply that Massachusetts is fully employed; we can't grow the way we've done in the past.  Th e only state in New England which is doing better than the national average in terms of growth of employment and income is Maine. And that's the state with the highest unemployment rate and with a lot of people underemployed in the labor force. But the rest of New England is flat out. If you look at the areas of employment for this fully employed economy, there are only two occupational areas where we are doing better than the national average. One is finance, insurance, and real estate, and the other is construction. I find this rather alarming because the reason, of course, is that we still have this big commercial office building boom going on. we are starting to see signs around Stanford of surplus space. But I just got a report from and they're projecting that the current vacancy rate of 11 percent in Boston, which is still low by national standards, is going to drop to 8 percent by the end of 1989. I think this is baloney. And I think what it means is that by the end of 1989, the real estate business-- and I'm afraid some of our bankers are going to find themselves having invested in some of these buildings --will be taking on the characteristics of Houston and Dallas. So, I think we are definitely in a turning point situation, which stems sheerly from the fact that we just don't have any labor for growth any more. I see state spending in Massachusetts being projected--, they're projecting a rate of growth of revenues next year of 8.3 percent. It's not going to happen. It can't happen in the slow-growing environment that we are going to have. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198808	164	SEGER	 Big tax increase. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	165	MORRIS	 I think something has to give there. It's not going to be before the election. I think the euphoria is going to be disappearing and we'll be facing a lot of the problems of a slow- growing economy. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198808	166	PARRY	 Do you have a significant in-migration? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	167	MORRIS	 we are getting some in-migration, but the problem is our housing is so scarce that the price of residential housing has just ballooned in the past few years. It has gone to astronomical levels. we are up to New York and San Francisco levels. And it's very difficult to move people into Boston; they get sticker shock when they see our residential real estate prices. So I think the prospect of more than a modest in-migration is very, very dim. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198808	168	PARRY	 We are getting record in-migration in California. I think it's about 700,000 or something like that a year--it's incredible. And we have similar housing problems, but I guess it's just that you can find cheaper areas. Plus, there's a very large [unintelligible]. That seems to keep a lid on things a bit. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	169	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	170	CORRIGAN	 Well, in some ways, Mike Prell gave my report. I think I agree very much with how Mike characterized the economy. Getting to the anecdotal stuff, I really haven't much to add. There is more talk about scarcities in the labor market, even in terms of part-time jobs and things like that. In terms of anecdotes, I think we'll get a better fix on things in early September. I think most of these major companies come back after Labor Day and sit down  and really begin the process of thinking in earnest about 1989 and so on. I think that some of the feedback that should begin to flow out of that will probably give us a better and fresher picture of what the situation is. But at least for now, virtually every comment I hear is very much on the bullish side. In the context of the outlook and the forecast, I have just a couple of comments. Looking at the external side of the Board staff forecast and, for what it's worth, the New York Fed staff forecast, both have real net exports in GNP terms in the fourth quarter of 1989 below -$50 billion. And I think that is quite a remarkable result in one sense. But I think it belies something else that gets kind of lost in the dust here--and that is, that both also have for the year 1989 a current account deficit that's still $125 billion. And those current account deficits are going to have to be financed. I mention that because, while there's a certain element of euphoria in markets and elsewhere about adjustments taking place, the fact of the matter is that in financial terms, as measured by the current account, we still have very, very large external imbalances. And for that matter, the budget deficit is still sitting there stuck somewhere around $150 billion. So, I don't see that a lot has been achieved in terms of significant progress on both the internal and external financial imbalances that are the root cause of many of our problems. On the inflation side, I guess my biggest concern by far at this point, Mr. Chairman, is that I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that the inflation genie is already out of the bottle. I don't take any forecast very seriously, but if we look, for example, at our own forecast--which by the way has a very modest increase in interest rates with orders of magnitudes about half of what Mike is talking about--it has a GNP deflator toward the middle and the end of next year at rates of increase of 4-1/2 percent and higher. It has a fixed-weight deflator of 5 percent and higher; it has a CPI of 5-1/2 percent and higher; it has compensation per man-hour at 5 to 5-1/4 percent and higher. By each one of those measures, the acceleration in the rate of inflation is somewhere in the area of 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points over what has been the experience for the past several years. That to me is very problematic in its own right. But what is particularly problematic is that it just doesn't take much at all for those price forecasts to end up a threshhold level higher. In other words, instead of pushing and penetrating 5 percent on some measures you could easily get results that break through the 6 percent level. It takes very little to go wrong, at least in the context of our price numbers, to produce that result. As I said, our forecast differs from the staff only in the sense that I think the interest rate assumptions or, if you will, the policy assumptions may be somewhat different. But when I look at the situation in that light, it does produce that fear on my part that we may already have an accelerating inflation problem on our hands that is going to be very costly to deal with. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198808	171	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	172	GUFFEY	 Mr. Chairman, with respect to the Greenbook forecast, on a year-over-year basis our forecast would be very  similar. However, looking at the shorter term--and I'm taking about the third and fourth quarters, and particularly the third quarter--our forecast is a bit higher. I hate to describe it as substantially higher, but in terms of final sales, for example, consumption is roughly a percentage point higher or so in the third quarter and also somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. That suggests that the last half of the year is a bit stronger than the Greenbook forecast. And it implies, at least to me, some further pressure on wages and prices that may not otherwise be built into the Greenbook over the forecast period. With regard to the regional forecast, as has been the case over the last couple--and perhaps the last three--years, we are improving in the District, but at a pace somewhat slower than the national recovery rate, as measured by personal income, for example, employment, and other similar measures. Retail sales are moderately higher than they were a year ago with inventories reported to be about in line--as a matter of fact, being trimmed within the last month or two. Auto sales are holding up; measured year-over-year they are a bit higher than a year ago. Two areas that are particularly important in our District are energy and agriculture. The level of energy prices has continued to damp the enthusiasm of people for going out and spending money to stick holes in the ground. As a result, there is not much enthusiasm--particularly in that belt which would include Oklahoma, parts of Colorado, and Wyoming, which are still depressed because of energy. Laid on top of that, obviously, is the agricultural situation of the drought, which has been very varied across the District. If you look for example, at Nebraska, parts of Kansas, and western Oklahoma, they've had ample rain and the crops will reflect that. If you look, on the other hand, at eastern Kansas, Missouri, and up into Si's area in Iowa and on east beyond that, the drought has had a very serious impact. Having that in mind, our numbers are a bit stronger than the Greenbook. It isn't clear to me whether or not some of that may be explained by the drought impact and the timing of that impact on those numbers. By and large in the agricultural sector, there will be an impact on the producers, but if you look into the financial sector that finances agricultural production--as I think Si may have mentioned his survey shows--the banks are in pretty good shape. As a matter of fact, they have gotten rid of a lot of the bad loans over the adjustment period. They have built their capital back, according to our survey, by over 10 percent. And in a sense, they are in very good position to accommodate this drought impact. I would find something to worry about if this were to be a two-year drought instead of a one-year drought; then that story would change dramatically. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198808	173	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	174	SEGER	 I have just one comment and a couple of anecdotes that I've picked up in the last few days. The comment involves the drought-adjusted real GNP growth figures. I too found these very interesting, particularly to see the amount of deceleration that it shows over the fourth quarter. That's really dramatic--from 3.8 to 1.8 percent. So it does paint quite a helpful picture. Also, one thing I haven't heard mentioned in connection with the drought is the  fact that it motivated the people down the street here to rain about $3.9 billion on farmers in the form of cash. That ought to do something for somebody. On the anecdotes, a number of people in home building have expressed to me concern about the latest upward move in interest rates. I would say that their numbers are somewhere around 100 thousand to maybe even 200 thousand starts a year more pessimistic than what we are showing. Also, one of the things that has been pointed out to me involves defense spending and the impact of this investigation that's going on here in Washington--looking at the [unintelligible] and procurement process--and what this means as far as the slowdown in the actual granting of new defense contracts and also the payout of some existing ones. This may help your area, Frank; it gets a lot of this money up there. Also on the export side, a number of manufacturers are very concerned about this rebound in the dollar because they were just really moving forward to emphasize exports and to gear up for producing more products for export. And now, as they see the dollar rebound, they're concerned that maybe they'll get geared up just in time for the market not to be there. I think that that is something certainly to look at, particularly any increase that's above today's already higher levels. And the final thing I've picked up is in the consumer area. I was talking to a couple of days ago, who told me that the only strong area there was sales of air conditioners; you can all figure out why that has been the case. And the sales of lawnmowers have been very weak. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	175	BLACK	 I can explain that, Martha. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198808	176	SEGER	 Snowplows are coming up. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	177	BLACK	 One of us is really-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198808	178	SEGER	 But it is sort of interesting that that was the exact comment made. This person also mentioned the concern over the consumer debt burden and what that may do in the future, particularly if economic growth does slow dramatically. I believe that some retailers are looking at this variable-rate loan issue and whether or not the higher interest rates in the market feed back into the consumer budget more rapidly, because even though ARMs are often adjusted only once a year, the variable rate credit cards and the home equity lines often are adjusted monthly. Therefore, we would get a more prompt feedback. And I know there is some concern out there that that would be another source of restraint on consumer spending. So, that's just a little bit extra on anecdotes for you. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198808	179	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	180	ANGELL	 It seems everyone wants to comment about the drought. Let me mention one item of caution, and that is that a drought has an impact not only upon the supply side of production, but also on the demand side. And no one really knows whether or not the demand side effects are less than or greater than the impact upon the supply side. So, I think I'd have to caution that there is a much larger segment of the United States society that is affected by agriculture and the loss of rain. It may affect behavior in regard to consumption as  well as durable goods expenditures. So, I think there's some uncertainty here that needs to be kept in mind. In the second place, I think you have to remember that just as we have the drought-adjusted GNP figures for 1988, you're going to do the same process for 1989. We are looking at agricultural production in the grain area that is only at 73 percent of capacity; and that's going to go to 97 percent of capacity next year. And you're going to have a dramatic move forward, because when you change the acreage reduction to qualify for government programs from 27-1/2 percent to 10 percent, you're getting more than that change in plantings because the higher price will induce some people not to play the game. That is, there will be farmers who will leave the program restrictions altogether. So there'll be an impact for GNP that is not a capacity or inflation induced impact that does need to be considered. And the final thing I might mention about the drought is that no one really knows how much that bill they passed is really going to cost. It has a lot of complexities in it, in regard to $50,000 and $100,000 limitations and whether the $100,000 encompasses other payments. So there will tend to be, in some sense, probably less actual outlay than may have been anticipated. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198808	181	GREENSPAN	 You mean it'll be less than $3.9 billion? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	182	ANGELL	 It could very well be less than $3.9 billion because no one has really done a microeconomic analysis regarding how many of the people who are supposed to receive the payments will be restricted by the caps. And there will be some farmers who will reject the payments because they do not want to commit themselves to two years of crop insurance. So, there are a lot of uncertainties there. I think that all of us would recognize that we have more strength [in the economy] right now than we would like to have. And I would agree with Jerry that certainly the rate of inflation currently going on is unsatisfactory. But it seems to me that that's an indication that our policy wasn't exactly what it should have been in previous periods. Certainly, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, we did not have the monetary policy in place that in hindsight we would like to have had in place. I think we can learn something, however, by the impact of this discount rate increase and looking at the bond markets. Now, I have looked at key markets because I think there's a lot of instruction there. The bond market weakened, of course, as it always does when the discount rate increases. It almost didn't for 30 minutes this time; the bond market almost tried to remain strong in the face of a discount rate increase, because there were some people there apparently at first who thought that the Fed's going to be tighter, so that improves the outlook for inflation. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198808	183	GREENSPAN	 That wasn't the reason. They were all shocked into silence and incoherence. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	184	JOHNSON	 They were waiting for the phone.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	185	ANGELL	 But it didn't take long for the normal stance to develop, which was that, after all, if the Fed did this drastic thing which wasn't expected--and, of course, it makes the markets a little angry for us to do something that they don't expect us to do--then things really must be worse than they anticipated. And so we have a kind of feedback that, if we are not careful, impacts the bond market. Now the equity markets, it seems to me, also reveal some indication about how monetary policy affects perceptions. And I think the rate of real investment is not unrelated to equity market behavior. It seems to me that in spite of the fact that you can't see everything you want to see, Lee, there's some evidence there to say that there's some restraint in place. I think the foreign exchange markets also certainly can be expected to operate with feedback loops--from the bond market particularly. And when the United States bond market has a difficult period of time, then I think you'd expect foreign exchange markets to react to that. My own view is that the foreign exchange markets will probably continue to be stronger than anticipated, and indeed, that's our primary policy mistake--that we did not stand against the foreign exchange depreciation which in a sense is behind [our having] a heavier growth path than we should have had. I think commodity prices also are showing some effect of monetary restraint. And I don't know whether the rest of you have noticed it or not, but to me it's kind of pleasing to have M2 be on a 4 percent growth path; and maybe we'll get it down to 3 percent. When you get ready to do your report, Don, I guess I want to find out what impact a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate and a 10-1/2 percent rate will have on M2 growth. Certainly, that seems to me to be a difference. And I guess it's pleasing to me to see that when M2 growth got up to 8 percent and right above our target range that, policywise, we were able to turn that around and bring that down to an acceptable level. Now I don't know whether 4 percent is right or 3 percent or 2 percent, but I guess I'm more confident than others are that if we stay with 4 percent or 3 percent or 2 percent on M2 growth that things will work out so that we'll all be happy with the inflation results down the pike . 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198808	186	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	187	HELLER	 Let me start out by observing that there's an enormous difference between the tone of this discussion and the tone of the discussion that you would hear, for instance, in the OECD economic policy committee or WP3. When foreigners are talking about the United States these days it is generally with admiration: Gee, I wish I were in your shoes--with the possible exception of the Japanese. I listen to this discussion here, and it is probably the most pessimistic discussion I've heard for the last two years around this table. I'm not exactly sure what accounts for that difference except that people look a lot more skeptically at their own future. Overall, I still think everything is going more or less according to plan. If you look at the various components of GNP, we continue to have the best progress in the export sector and the investment sector, and that's exactly the way it should be. We had growth last quarter of gross domestic purchases of 1.1 percent. If you look at the projections out--2.3, 1.4, 2.7, 1.7, and 1.2 percent-- they are all in that ballpark range. So, certainly it's not going to be a runaway economy in any sense of the word. Yes, there are certain  areas where we do see shortages; quite a few people have talked about skilled labor shortages. But I fail to see how a tight monetary policy will produce more skilled workers to alleviate that particular shortage. Actually, I saw a very interesting article produced by the Chicago Fed research department that was arguing essentially that the wage pressures wouldn't be as pronounced as many people were going to expect. I don't like the PPI increases any more than anybody else; I think that is a worrisome index indeed. But on the other hand, as Governor Angell just pointed out, the commodity prices which are even further down the pike, are again very well behaved and roughly on the level that they were exactly one year ago. I think the difference between the GNP deflator and the fixed-weight price index isn't only due to base periods and things of that sort. It's due to the fact that Americans are smart and they are shifting away from the expensive products to the less expensive products. As a result, actual inflation is less than the inflationary pressures which are emanating from some sectors. The dollar continues to be strong as well. I think overall if you have to make a judgment on whether you really want a much stronger economy, you would say no. Do you really want a much weaker economy? I certainly would say no. And, therefore, I've come up with the conclusion that we shouldn't tinker all that much. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	188	GREENSPAN	 Any further comments on this round robin? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	189	HOSKINS	 I see commodity prices as having moved up more than Bob Heller does. I look at the indexes in the Economist magazine and they're all up 20 percent or better versus a year ago. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198808	190	JOHNSON	 Depends on which one you look at. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	191	ANGELL	 It depends on which index you're looking at. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198808	192	HOSKINS	 Well, [unintelligible] whether you're using SDR, dollar, or sterling index. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198808	193	GREENSPAN	 Have they got grains? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	194	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	195	ANGELL	 The Economist index is the highest year-over¬ year rate of increase of any index. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198808	196	GREENSPAN	 That's [a reflection] largely of grain. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	197	HOSKINS	 I can't tell what's in it. It just says all items, food, industrial. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198808	198	HELLER	 If you're looking at the Federal Reserve index, it's within a fraction of a percentage point from the level a year ago. Is that correct?  	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	199	JOHNSON	 It's the same with the Journal of Commerce. But there are a couple of them that are much higher; there are a couple that are no change. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	200	HELLER	 Especially some indexes that are weighted. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	201	JOHNSON	 Depends on what you weight it by, too. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	202	PARRY	 Bob, you made the comment that the slowdown is just what the doctor ordered. Is that correct? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	203	HELLER	 Domestic. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198808	204	PARRY	 Domestic that we see in the forecast. What is the monetary policy implication associated with that forecast? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198808	205	GREENSPAN	 That's the next session. Governor Johnson's got a relevant comment. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	206	JOHNSON	 I don't know if it's relevant, but I've got a comment. I think everyone has laid out the risks pretty well. Almost everyone agrees that the risks are on the upside, and that's the way I feel. I think the risks are tilted more toward the upside, although I don't think they're zero on the downside either. We've seen that even with a half point change in the discount rate--it went from 6 to 6-1/2 percent, relative to where the funds rate is now. And in the scheme of things, you wouldn't think that would be a big factor, but you see nervous ripples in the financial markets when you do that. We've all seen over the last year or so how expectations can change fairly dramatically. And I think we have to be cautious about that. So, I think we should be concerned about the magnitude [and] the timing of the actions we take. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	207	GREENSPAN	 It seems to me you're also getting over into the next session. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198808	208	JOHNSON	 Okay, I'll get away from that. But the other thing I wanted to say on the overall view, in terms of actions that we've taken in the past and depending on what we do in the future: I don't think it's going to be that easy to manage the adjustment process by the actions we take. I think our moves, in the past, have had an effect of strengthening the dollar, and they would continue to do so. They're going to affect both domestic and overall demand. Either the exchange rate flows through and it weakens our competitiveness some, or foreign central banks try to stabilize the dollar and you're going to get a weakness on the foreign demand side. I know Ted pointed out there are some lags. But eventually that'll take place. So I'm not sure we should believe that we can get the adjustment process at the same time we get the slowing down. I think most of what we are seeing on the adjustment process is a result of where the exchange rate has come to this point. We've had a substantial adjustment on the discount rate; we'll have lagged effects for some time to come. But I think a price-stable economy here is consistent with a fairly large current account deficit. I don't think you can get them both down unless you have--I don't know, maybe a major recession would do it. But I'm not sure that's in our interest to do.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198808	209	GREENSPAN	 If there are no further comments, and before we break for coffee, I was hoping that Don Kohn could get his remarks in. 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	210	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You'll need the coffee. It turns out my comments overlap substantially the subjects Governor Angell covered, post-drought anyhow. Wayne, you and I will have to think about the implications of that some time together. The rise in short-term interest rates as policy firmed over the  intermeeting period was accompanied by developments in other key financial  variables that may have important implications for interpretation of the  extent of monetary restraint and its possible effects on the economy.  One such development was the rise in bond yields, which at least in the  Treasury market, more than matched the increases in short-term rates.  Another was the strength of the dollar at least until this morning and  a third was the slowing trend of money growth.  Some increase in bond rates is to be expected when short-term  rates rise; even if investors are led to revise down their estimates of  short-term rates some time in the future, that time usually is sufficiently remote that the effects of a higher near-term course for rates  generally dominates. But most often, the increase in long-term rates is  less than that for short-term rates. In recent weeks, the outsized rise  in Treasury bond yields seemed primarily a reaction to the implications  of incoming economic and price data for the strength of demands on  financial markets and the response of the Federal Reserve. A substantial portion of the increase in bond yields preceded the discount rate  increase, which itself may have been partly viewed as symbolic of the  depth of the Federal Reserve's concern about economic and inflation  prospects, and we have seen further increases in the last few days  following PPI and trade data..  The net result is that judging from the yield curve, the market  apparently sees us as still having to do at least as much additional  tightening as before the latest moves. As Mike has already indicated,  this information has had a similar effect on the greenbook forecast, in  which rates are seen to need to rise to higher levels than were  previously thought necessary to achieve about the same degree of  restraint on inflation pressures.  Contributing to the view that substantial rate increases are  still in store may be a sense that real rates have not risen very much.  To be sure, increases in nominal interest rates, by themselves, could  have important effects on the spending of some debtors or potential  borrowers especially those whose ability to meet additional interest  expense is constrained by limited access to credit or liquid assets.  For many others, however, it is likely that the level of real interest  rates is the more important variable in spending decisions. What  limited information we have from surveys reinforces the perception that  inflation expectations have increased substantially since the early  spring so the rise in real rates has been considerably less than the  rise in nominal rates. Indeed, real rates may be only a little higher  than levels prevailing through much of last year levels that were  consistent with robust growth in 1987 and so far in 1988, despite the  destruction of wealth in the stock market.  Some other indicators, however, suggest the possibility of a  somewhat greater effect of recent policy, at least on expectations.  Commodity prices outside of food and energy have been relatively  stable for a considerable time, perhaps indicating some check on demand  pressures. One factor contributing to the behavior of commodity prices,  may have been the strength in the dollar. That strength may be related  in part to monetary policy, and in part to progress in the trade  balance, as Ted has discussed. The weight given to these two influences  in the dollar's recent behavior, and how they affect future dollar  movements will have an important bearing on its relationship to demand  in the economy and the need for monetary restraint. A dollar that  stayed high or rose further in response to monetary restraint would be  an important channel to damp demand in 1989 and beyond; a dollar that  remained strong principally because over time the external balance was  improving more rapidly than expected, though helping to damp inflation  pressures from rising import prices, might not greatly reduce the degree  of additional monetary tightening needed to contain inflation.  Finally, the money stock, especially M2, has decelerated  substantially in July. While some of this reflected special factors, we  expect only a limited rebound in August and September. In the bluebook,  we have revised down our projection for M2 growth over the June-to-  September period from 5-1/2 to 3-1/2 percent, with much of that revision  accounted for by the effects of the rise in interest rates over the last  six weeks. These effects, along with those of the earlier tightening,  will continue to depress money growth in the fourth quarter. Even in  the absence of further increases in rates, we would expect growth over  the last four months of the year to be around 4 percent, bringing  expansion for 1968 to, or even a bit below, the midpoint of the annual  range. Moreover, under the income and interest rates of the staff  greenbook forecast, we project M2 growth in 1989 well down in its  tentative range, perhaps not far above its lower bound.  While long-run trends in money and prices track each other  reasonably well, in a cyclical context interpretation of money stock  behavior, such as the sluggish growth projected, depends importantly on  the conditions in which it occurs. In the staff forecast, those  conditions include strong underlying demands on the economy and a  monetary policy that moves to damp those demands to contain inflation.  The rising interest rates produced in those circumstances interact with  an interest-sensitive demand for money to produce substantial increases  in velocity, enabling relatively modest money growth to support considerable expansion of income. Under different circumstances very  different money growth rates might be needed to achieve the Committee's  economic objectives. If, for example, demands were weak so that  interest rates dropped substantially, stronger money growth might be  needed for a time to sustain the expansion and would have little implication for inflation performance. On the other hand, in the face of  even more robust demands, or if the Committee were to opt for faster and  more certain progress against inflation, even slower growth than now  anticipated might be needed. The staff forecast implies declines in  real M2 through the end of 1989. Previously, declines of this duration  have been followed by recession. However, the predicted decreases in  real M2 are relatively small, and are consistent with considerable  restraint on domestic demand while the forward momentum of the economy  is supported to an important extent in the forecast by improvements in  the external sector.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude my briefing with a  discussion of a different topic that of borrowing and federal funds  rate guides to the implementation of policy. In the bluebook, $600  million of borrowing is associated with federal funds trading in a 8 to  8-1/4 percent range. The lack of a point estimate reflects some  uncertainty as to whether the special factors that seem to have been  affecting that relationship will persist. The most important of these  appears to be expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to  tighten. Such expectations are not surprising given the state of the  economy, and our announced intention to err on the side of restraint.  In these circumstances, banks may reduce current demands on the discount  window in favor of borrowing in the federal funds or other markets, in  order to remain in the good graces of the discount officer for when the  spread of market over discount rates is even higher. While we attempt  to factor this kind of behavior into our estimates, expectations seem to  have intensified over each intermeeting period in keeping with data  suggesting unanticipated strength in the economy. As a consequence the  Desk and the specifications in the bluebook have tended to underestimate  the federal funds rate that has accompanied a given borrowing target by  around 10 basis points over the period of tightening since late winter.  By themselves, errors of this magnitude have no economic  significance. However, Committee members seem increasingly troubled by  deviation of federal funds from their expected values, and by the process in which the market anticipates our tightening, pushing up the funds  rate; then we validate that anticipation and the market builds in yet  another tightening. This process need not be allowed to persist. If the  FOMC stuck to its borrowing objective over a sufficient time, expectations would prove to be wrong and the funds rate would ease back. The  FOMC frequently has validated tightening expectations because it did not  want to suggest to the market a different course for policy; however, if  the markets were wrong about the appropriate course for policy, disappointing them would be only temporarily disruptive, and stabilizing over  the long run. That the Committee has chosen not to keep its borrowing  objective in the face of market expectations suggests that it has not  been dissatisfied with the outcome.  Even so, as a consequence of some dissatisfaction with the  process, open market operations have paid greater attention to daily  movements in the federal funds rate recently. This has meant that  reserves have been added or absorbed when funds approached informal  discomfort levels, even if not strictly called for by the reserve objectives. This can be seen in a considerably smaller standard deviation  of the funds rate around desk expectations than before the stock market  crash. And it is mirrored in larger standard deviations of borrowing  around its objective to cushion the effects of short-term shifts in the  borrowing function. While funds rate levels and market perceptions have  always had a role to play in the timing of open market operations,  recently operations seem to be evolving more towards a borrowing objective with a funds rate constraint, and that evolution was particularly  marked in the last intermeeting period.  This may be a workable compromise that limits the room for  funds rate variations, particularly in situations in which the Committee  is concerned about persistent tendencies for tighter or easier money  market conditions than the Committee wants, without specifying formally  a narrow federal funds target. However, it does have some potential  effects that may need to be considered. At this time it contradicts the  public position of the Committee that it has returned to pre-October  operating techniques. As a consequence, it may confuse market participants and we saw some of this in recent maintenance periods when we were  on both sides of the market within a few days without major reserve  factor revisions. The scope for such confusion widens as some operations  are undertaken as rate protests, and some to hit borrowing objectives.  More importantly perhaps, it does risk evolving into a more narrow funds  rate targeting procedure, if the informal limits are tightened. The  Committee has discussed this option several times in recent months,  deciding in each case that the discomfort of unanticipated federal funds  rate variations was outweighed by the desirable elements of flexibility  in the current system. However, recent informal instructions to the  Desk may suggest a different assessment of these considerations. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	211	GREENSPAN	 Thank you Mr. Kohn. We'll take a break now and when we come back we will first discuss what Don has been suggesting and then we'll go to a round robin on the Committee discussion on policy. [Coffee break] 	2	2	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	212	GREENSPAN	 [Unintelligible] Mr. Kohn and Governor Angell. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	213	ANGELL	 Don, I appreciate your-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	214	KOHN	 Oh, I thought the questions were going to be for Governor Angell. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	215	ANGELL	 Well, fortunately, I get to ask the questions. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	216	KOHN	 Okay. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	217	ANGELL	 Don, for the fourth quarter of 1988 and the first quarter of 1989, M2 growth was, I think you said, 4 and 3-1/2 percent. Could you give me some confidence intervals on those estimates? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	218	KOHN	 Actually, I'll give you our point estimates and you can put your own confidence intervals around them. Mine would be very wide; I have 3-3/4 percent for the fourth quarter of 1988 and 3- 1/2 percent for the first quarter of 1989. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	219	ANGELL	 Do you want to give me the standard error of the estimates then on-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	220	KOHN	 No. I don't have one, but-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	221	ANGELL	 Well, give me just sort of a range. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	222	KOHN	 Oh, I would say plus or minus 1-1/2 percentage points. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	223	ANGELL	 Oh, that's pretty narrow. Okay. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	224	KOHN	 I just made that up. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	225	ANGELL	 I don't mean to cast aspersions on your forecast, but that's pretty tight. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	226	KOHN	 The basic point, as I see it, is that the rise in interest rates that we already have will be damping M2 growth relative  5/16/88 -29- to its rates so far this year. So, I think we'll be seeing things at least below 6 percent, or under 5 percent. Now, I don't know how far under it will be--3-1/2 or 4 percent is our basic forecast --but I think the message is pretty clear. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	227	ANGELL	 Thank you. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	228	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	229	MORRIS	" On page 12 of the Bluebook you say that the tightening of reserve positions under alternative ""C"" immediately following the discount rate hike would be somewhat surprising to market participants. I find that statement surprising. It seems to me that the market is anticipating us to follow-up the discount rate increase with a firmer policy and that they'd be surprised if we didn't. "	22	22	2.0	1.0	1.0
198808	230	KOHN	 I think that's true in a general sense. If you look at, say, futures market rates and things like that, bill rates are a little higher by the end of the year than they are now, but not by a lot. And I guess I think generally they expect us to firm. I'm not sure they'd expect a full half percentage point. The Bluebook in part was addressing that point--another half percentage point on the funds rate a week after the half percentage point increase in the discount rate. I think you're right in the sense that the market is anticipating some gradual firming of the funds rate over the remainder of the year. You can see that in these surveys of market expectations. But I don't think they'd be anticipating something of this magnitude this soon; that's all I meant to say. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	231	JOHNSON	 Wouldn't you see that in bills? I don't think you've seen that in the spread of bills over the funds rate. You've had a little bit of upward pressure, I think, because of supply conditions, due to the suspension of the long bond. But you don't see a big spread developing in bills over the funds rate. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	232	KOHN	 No, you don't. In fact, the bill rate looks a little low relative to the funds rate. I would associate that a little bit with some of the uncertainties associated with a discount rate increase, a little flight to liquidity--not much, but a little. But I think if you do look at the-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	233	GREENSPAN	" The futures markets don't show the type of tightening that's in alternative ""C"". "	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	234	KOHN	" Not in ""C"", no. But at least the money market services surveys that we get do show some gradual firming seen by-- "	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	235	GREENSPAN	 Well, the question is, which is the more valid approach: to look at the futures markets for the Treasury bills, or at a survey of forecasters? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	236	KOHN	 If the forecasters have the investment funds, they ought to be consistent with one another. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	237	SPEAKER	 That's right.  	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	238	GREENSPAN	 And if they are not, which do you choose? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	239	KOHN	 I don't have specific numbers in front of me. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	240	GREENSPAN	 My recollection, however, is that the forward markets are showing less of an increase than is implicit in the forecast. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	241	SPEAKER	 That's right. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	242	KOHN	" Certainly less than alternative ""C"". "	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	243	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	244	STERN	 I think this is a version of Governor Angell's question. But what has been the historic performance of the M2 model or equation recently? Has it been tracking reasonably well? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	41.0
198808	245	KOHN	 It's not too bad. We missed last year--actually the GNP revisions didn't do us any favors because M2 was low already relative to the model projection by about a percentage point. Now it's low by about 2 percentage points after GNP was revised up. We have several models, but one of them I'm looking at--this is one that missed last year by about 1-1/4 percentage points in fact--was right on in the first quarter and underpredicted the second quarter by a couple of percentage points. It hasn't been bad. You should understand that these projections are not strictly model-based projections. We do take into account the errors that the models have been making, and make judgmental adjustments for that. We pay perhaps a little more attention to what they tell us about the interest rate effects; and then we factor that into our own sense of where velocity is going and the projections of income growth that we get from the Greenbook. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0

198808	247	PARRY	" Don, both alternatives cover a relatively short II-RII or ""C,"" is most consistent with the policy assumptions in the Greenbook forecast? "	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	248	KOHN	 Well, for the next six weeks it hardly matters, but the Greenbook really didn't have an increase of interest rates in that very short period of time necessarily behind its forecast. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	249	PRELL	 Nominally, for the current quarter, we take the existing funds rate as given through the end of the-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	250	PARRY	 The quarter? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	251	KOHN	 Yes. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	252	PARRY	" So, it's really more consistent with ""B,"" you'd say? "	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	253	PRELL	" Yes, but basically for the GNP forecast, we are more interested in the drift over the next several quarters. period of time. Would you indicate which of the two alternatives, ""B  "	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	254	GREENSPAN	" I think it's consistent with ""B"" but going to ""C"" the next time. "	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	255	KOHN	 Firming some at some point in the fourth quarter. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	256	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions? Lee. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	257	HOSKINS	 Don, I took it that the last part of your discussion, with respect to operating procedures, was [a suggestion] that we might want to discuss them. So I guess I would like to make a statement about them in terms of my preferences. There were basically three options that were laid out: one is fed funds targeting; another is in between which is sort of half fed funds and half borrowings; and the last is straight borrowings target. In my view I would prefer straight borrowings target if, as you suggest, we can live with it in terms of allowing the funds rate to fluctuate a little bit more. I think there are disadvantages to doing what we are doing--that is, sort of half fed funds and half borrowing--because I do think it leads to some confusion in the marketplace. If I had to choose between the three options, I would choose the borrowings target because I think it's the cleanest and it's the one that leaves us with the best chance to get back to aggregates targeting, if we ever get confident with using the aggregates. But I would take explicit funds rate targeting over what we are currently doing, as long as we stay on what I would call an economic conditions kind of policy--that is, responding in the short term to changes in the numbers. It seems to me we are much better equipped to do that with an explicit federal funds rate target. But we have to be aggressive if we are going to move it and get around the concern that you had with that--that it gets too narrow on us. And it has been. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	49.0
198808	258	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	259	FORRESTAL	 Don, in connection with this issue of the deviation of the fed funds rate from the borrowing target, seasonal borrowing has been relatively high. How much of the deviation do you think is caused by that? And doesn't this high seasonal component suggest that we perhaps need a higher borrowing target than we otherwise would? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	39.0
198808	260	KOHN	 I'd say it goes the wrong way. The idea of seasonal borrowing is that it doesn't respond quite as much to interest rate pressures as regular adjustment borrowing. You have an autonomous seasonal factor influencing that borrowing that should tend to bias the funds rate down rather than up relative to our expectations. So I would say that for some time the seasonal borrowing hasn't had any effect. It might at very low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing targets, but we are not there any more. I think the most recent period is evidence of that. But you're right. If you thought that somehow it was having an influence, you'd raise the borrowing target at even higher federal funds rates. But I don't think it is. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	261	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	262	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think I share Lee's objective of getting back to the point, if we ever can do this, where we can really control this supply of reserves--somehow measured--so as to control  the rate of growth of the money supply. To put it I guess a bit unkindly, it seems to me that what we do now really is sort of a modern-day version of the real bills doctrine, in a sense. The market gets all the money it wants at some price or some borrowed reserve level. If it wants more, we pump out the reserves and we say the demand for money has increased. If it wants less, we sop up reserves and say the demand for money has declined. If we want to nudge it one way or another, through either the borrowed reserve target or through manipulating the federal funds rate, we change the price of money--in much the way the discount rate used to function under the old real bills doctrine. So I really don't see that it's much different from that. But, given the uncertainties that people feel exist in the aggregates at the present time, I think I would come out a little different from where Lee does on which of the various alternatives we should use. I would use the federal funds rate. I think we are confusing the public, we are confusing ourselves, and we are confusing the boards of directors by going through the borrowed reserve target. And in recent days, we've been resolving all doubts in favor of the federal funds rate, and I would prefer to just use that federal funds rate as long as we are on this kind of regime. But I think at some point the aggregates are going to behave in a more normal, predictable, way and we can reduce this degree of fine tuning that we've been following. And only then will I feel very comfortable with any policy decision. Now we have to pick out a level of interest rates somehow defined, and predict what will happen. The way I do that is to figure out what I think it is on an ail hoc basis and then I bear in mind that most of our mistakes I think have been on the side of being too easy, historically. So I put in a fudge factor and vote for something a little tighter than I think it probably ought to be on the ground that that's the way we usually miss. But I do hope our simulations suggest M2 is beginning to behave reasonably normally now; Don verified that to some degree. And I hope somewhere along the way we can get to the point that we are really controlling the supply of money rather than letting it be purely demand determined. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	263	GREENSPAN	 I think that's one of the most interest¬ ing events --which we haven't really focused on in the last six or nine months--how well behaved M2 has been. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	264	ANGELL	 M2. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	265	BLACK	 It has been very good really. Wayne said a while ago he was taking considerable comfort in M2; and I was taking a lot of comfort in that, too, until Don pointed out that it was the RPs and the Eurodollars that were weak. The consumer-type components of M2 were relatively strong, so that reduced my degree of comfort. Still, that's something that makes me feel better than I otherwise would because they've been-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	266	ANGELL	 But Don, you've got built back in some rebound in those. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	267	KOHN	 That's right. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	268	ANGELL	 And you've got weakening in the reserve balance, so that's still accounted for in the forecast.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	269	KOHN	 In that-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	270	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0

198808	272	BLACK	 He can do that to people. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	273	BOEHNE	 On the issue of whether we have this hybrid, or borrowings or a federal funds target, there is no right answer here. And at different times one will be better than the other. But there are some lessons I think to be learned by both the successes and the mistakes of the past. You laid it out, Don, as kind of three choices: a federal funds, borrowing, or hybrid. But really the choices are over a much broader kind of a continuum. If you think, for example, at one end of that continuum you have a pure reserve targeting and at the other you have a pure federal funds targeting, and you think of reserves as a 10 and federal funds as a 1, this borrowing approach that we have been using the last few years is probably a 3. It's pretty close to federal funds rate targeting. It is a compromise toward taking account of the federal funds rate. If we compromise it further along the lines that we've been doing, we really move very, very close to a federal funds rate target. And there are advantages, and there are disadvantages. But I think that if we look back over our history, if you have an approach that--as we had with the borrowing figure--has a wiggle factor, it does allow the market to tell you something. It does allow the market to tell you that there is a greater demand for reserves. It also avoids the trap of pegging a federal funds rate. Now, I know that there is no one around this table who would ever, ever get caught up in the problems of pegging the federal funds rate. However, that risk is there for lesser mortals and I think one has to keep that in mind. The other thing is that it's easy around this table to ease. There's no trouble for a central bank to ease; that's very easy. The hard part is what we've been doing the last few months, to tighten. We need all the help that we can get when we find ourselves in that situation. And I think that the give that the borrowing approach allows in that procedure has been very helpful in the snugging up that we've been doing since March. And I think the more we move over to a federal funds rate, the more difficult it would be to follow that kind of snugging up. It's true that the market has led us sometimes; sometimes it was good, sometimes bad. We ought to be making decisions, not the markets. Nonetheless, when you get to the practical side of it, I think this technique was helpful for us to get out in front of the inflation curve earlier than I ever recall doing it. And I think this procedure helped. The other thing is--and I think this is an issue that one can talk about--that this procedure does give the Chairman a little more leeway than a federal funds target. And I think that, when we meet every six to eight weeks, it is important for the Chairman to have some leeway in this. Maybe everybody around the table will not agree every time he uses that discretion. But the way the markets operate, the way they're fast changing, and timing issues and all that, I for one think that it's important for the Chairman to have a little leeway. So that's where I come out. Even though there are disadvantages to reserve targeting or borrowing or whatever, I would  not like us to move any more in the direction of the federal funds extreme. I would prefer to be pretty close to the borrowing rather than this hybrid that we've backed into the last six weeks. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	274	JOHNSON	 But, Ed, don't you think if you have asymmetric language that the Chairman could just as easily choose to move the funds rate as he could a borrowing number? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	275	BOEHNE	 I think, Manley, he could. I think he could in theory. I think in practice that this borrowing procedure gives him a little more flexibility and gives us a little more ability to move sooner than we might otherwise. I can't prove that's the case. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	276	GREENSPAN	 I think it proves that it is the case- that it's easier to move a borrowing target than it is to move fed funds. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	277	BOEHNE	 Right. That's my point. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	278	BLACK	 That's basically a political argument. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	279	BOEHNE	 If the Chairman calls up and says I've upped the borrowing $50 or $100 million that's one thing. If he calls up and he says I've upped the federal funds rate a quarter percentage point, there's a difference. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	280	ANGELL	 The political perspective is quite different. If someone said well, the Chairman moved the fed funds rate-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	281	BOEHNE	 Right. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	282	JOHNSON	 I just can't comprehend that, I'm sorry. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	283	HELLER	 Obfuscation. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	284	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	285	GREENSPAN	 I think there is a case-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	286	BLACK	 It's a political argument, though, and I think that's the strongest argument that Ed has made for the borrowing target. And I think that's why we stuck with it. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	287	BOEHNE	 I think if you're completely logical, Manley, you come out where you do. I just don't think human beings and human nature are completely logical. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	288	JOHNSON	 But you're saying the Chairman would somehow have illusions himself that a $50 million change in the borrowing is not moving the funds rate? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	289	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	290	BLACK	 I think [unintelligible] moves it, so be it. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	291	PARRY	 It seems to me that characterizing the recent period as being a hybrid is maybe a little bit too strong, because in the last statement periods we've really hit borrowings right on the  head. And some times and days, there may have been some attempts to resist the funds rate. But if you are getting your target, then you must be pretty well content with the interest rates that are resulting from it. I know there was a problem very early in July, but I don't know that it has been operating all that poorly in the last few weeks. Would you agree with that Don, or not? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	292	KOHN	 Well, I think we came out fine. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	293	PARRY	 Yes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	294	KOHN	 But we did engage in some operations at certain times that we wouldn't have done if we'd been just paying attention to borrowing. In the end, everything turned out terrific. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	295	PARRY	 That's right. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	296	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	297	GUFFEY	 Ed Boehne has said much of what I wanted to say I think, except that he came out the wrong place. I happen to view what has happened over the last few months--that is, the borrowing target as moderated, if you will, by the federal funds level--as providing the flexibility that I think serves this Committee fairly well, at least at this time. I must say that over the long haul I would move to the borrowing target. But for the near term--the rest of this year at least--I like what we've been doing. I agree with the proposition that moving the borrowing target is much easier, much more acceptable, and perhaps of some greater comfort to the Chairman, than moving the federal funds target. But I don't think we ought to be deluded. What we are doing when we are moving the borrowing target is targeting what we believe to be a federal funds level. But they work together; they have worked together over the recent past, although apparently there's some confusion in the market that I don't quite understand because of the Desk operations. I would not want to change at the moment; I'd like to do what we've been doing. I have a question I guess for Don, following onto Bob Forrestal's comment with regard to the seasonal borrowing level, which has peaked, and I think is at an historical high. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	298	KOHN	 That's correct. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	299	GUFFEY	 Roughly at $400 million. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	300	KOHN	 Right. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	301	GUFFEY	 Traditionally, that starts running off about mid-August on down to the end of the year. Given the fact that we might maintain, for example, a $600 million borrowing level, my question is, with that seasonal running off, does that imply that we have a built-in tightening if everything else remains the same? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	302	KOHN	 If you believe that the seasonal was having an effect on the funds rate it would--that's the direction it would go. I guess I would just reiterate that our work in the past has failed to uncover a significant effect of that sort. Your direction is right; I  don't disagree with your analysis. It just doesn't seem to show up in the data when we've tried to control for it. I think it would if we were at much lower levels of borrowings, perhaps. But particularly at this level, I guess I wouldn't expect it. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	303	GUFFEY	 But over the last two or three months we've been essentially at a frictional level of adjustment borrowing. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	304	KOHN	 Very close to it. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	305	GUFFEY	 If you give credence at all to seasonal borrowing [ unintelligible] some slightly different characteristic--. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	306	KOHN	 I would say a bit above there, but not that far above, 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	307	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	308	SEGER	 I can certainly accept targeting a borrowing figure. But it does concern me when the fed funds rate whips all over and then that confuses market participants. But I think the way to fix this--maybe we can discuss this issue at some future luncheon--is to release our minutes more promptly so people will know what we are up to. Then they wouldn't have to be going through all these little subtle signals trying to figure out what it is we are really doing. And, you know, if the fed funds rate goes to 9 this afternoon at 3:00, some people are going to suggest probably that it's there because we put it there. They won't know. I think that getting the information out more promptly about what our policy moves are would help to calm the markets down and would really eliminate some of this confusion. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	40.0
198808	309	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	310	MELZER	 I may be a little confused, but I think this is the third time we are discussing this, and it has already been resolved twice. So perhaps it's already-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198808	311	BLACK	 This is not the only issue that has ever been discussed three times. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	312	MELZER	 On the merits, I'll simply say I really feel strongly that it's in our interest to define our business as being in the business of reserves and not rates. I understand the linkage between the borrowings target and the funds rate, but the funds market has automatically been extended to other markets. And as soon as the public and politicians attribute to us having control over interest rates, I think we are on dangerous ground. They do enough of that anyway. So I think it's important how we define our business. Secondly, I'd say when policy is on the move there's going to be volatility in rates. There's more uncertainty, and that's going to be the case. I don't think it's a bad thing. And finally, even when the market gets ahead of us, it's not necessary to validate what gets built in. Now, I think it has made sense to do it where we've done it; and I've been in favor of that. But, for example, as we sit here today with a statement having been made with the discount rate, I think we have the flexibility not to validate what might be getting  built in now and not give up any ground at all in terms of where we think we need to get. Those are the thoughts I have. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
198808	313	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	314	HELLER	 I think the problem that a lot of people perceive--and that's why it's on the table for a third time I guess-- is precisely the problem that Joan was describing earlier, where the market was perceiving one thing and then the Federal Reserve was almost led along the path by the market. And unless we chose to do the opposite, in essence, we were caught. And that, I think, made some people uncomfortable. I think the other problem is that quite often you do have these technical problems. Recently, there haven't been any technical operating problems; but get a computer failure or encounter rainstorms in certain areas of the country, and borrowings are all over the map, and as a result, it gets difficult to really see what's going on. In addition, as Don Kohn was talking about, the reluctance of bankers to borrow or maybe a tighter administration of the window--which has not been suggested recently, but had been raised earlier--was perhaps influencing the amount that was actually being borrowed. I think overall I'd be in favor of moving closer, as President Melzer said just a minute ago, to the reserve targeting, because that's what we ultimately want to do. Obviously, there are problems [with that approach] too. So, if we can devise a procedure that gets us to a 5 or 6 on Ed Boehne's scale, I'm certainly willing to listen. But technically I haven't exactly figured out what that procedure would be. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	315	GREENSPAN	 I think we all would like, if we possibly could, to get back to some form of money supply targeting, reserve targeting, because in fact that's what a central bank does. I think if it weren't for the extraordinary breakdown of relationships, we would never be having the first, not to mention the third, conversation. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	316	HELLER	" But, Mr. Chairman, the one thing that you can't fail to wonder about is why the relationship is better again than it used to be. Maybe it is because we are doing something close to fed funds targeting. And in that environment, you may see the money supply and GNP relationship being reestablished. And [perhaps] as soon as you start controlling ""M"" again then that relationship will tend to break down the famous Goodhart's law. "	22	22	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	317	GREENSPAN	 Well, in an odd way. we are where we are controlling M. We all have been focusing on the-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	318	HELLER	 Yes, but in a short-term operational sense. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	319	GREENSPAN	 But, we are not doing it day-by-day. I think that there has been a fairly consistent awareness of the fact that M2 has in fact been well behaved. Were it otherwise, I would suspect you'd be hearing different sorts of reactions at certain different times around this table. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	320	ANGELL	 Absolutely.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	321	GREENSPAN	 Are there any other questions for Don? If not, let's get to the policy questions. Let me see if I can summarize what I think I'm hearing at the moment. There seems to be little change in the general view that the economy remains quite strong and that the underlying structure is firm. There are a few marginal weaknesses on the edge, but remarkably few relative to this stage of the business cycle expansion. In fact, I didn't even hear mention of weakness in the apparel-textile area, which is the only thing that I've been hearing in any context. Apparently it's not a big enough issue to be talked about. The thing that concerns me the most at this point, as I mentioned on our telephone conference the other day, is that inventories remain--as somebody put it--lean. That is reflected in low inventory-sales ratios and in remarkably contained lead times on the deliveries of materials and equipment. In fact, if anything in the last two or three months--leaving July out--lead times have actually softened some, suggesting that the usual underlying elements which generate demand for inventories have been largely absent. And yet it is very difficult to find a business cycle expansion that at its tail end does not begin to show some pickup in [inventory] accumulation. There is some accumulation going on in steel and some of the other materials, but in general it's not a big deal. It strikes me that our policy thrust ought to be in the area which cuts the top off of inventory accumulation, and if possible, capital goods accumulation. Real short-term rates are very crucial issues in inventory policy. We must be, I think, in a position where we feel comfortable that we are not financing a bulge in inventories that will eventually topple the whole system. And I think that we're not, but I'm not quite clear what to read into the July industrial production index which, looking at the detail, struck me as the type of distribution of output which is more suggestive of a backing up of materials production than shipments into the final sales area. In any event, whether one looks at it in terms of capital goods or inventory, there's just nothing out there which suggests that this is not continuing and will possibly even be moving at a rate in excess of the Greenbook [projection]. And what that tells me is that the odds are obviously strong that we will be having to tighten again in the future. As a consequence, I think there's no doubt that we should be continuing with asymmetrical language. At the moment I myself am content to sit tight, at least for the short run, largely because I think we shocked the market with the discount rate more than I thought we would. I was, I would say, uncomfortable with the Japanese markets and a little uncomfortable with our own. I think they're stabilizing now, but I do think that they still have adjustments coming from the discount rate for a while. I don't know whether or not it's several weeks, or longer, but I'd feel quite comfortable at this stage staying with the $600 million of borrowing requirement, but maintaining asymmetrical language, as a consequence of acute awareness that any forms of evident problems get met with tightening. Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	322	ANGELL	" I agree with you that the markets, particularly the equity markets and to some extent the bond markets, did react in such a way as to indicate that a discount rate change is more than a $200 million change in borrowings. It really shouldn't be, but it  does seem to be. I would favor the $600 million. I favor the increase in the fed funds trading range, that is 6 to 10 percent, to go with that. I would also be most appreciative if there was support here for moving the behavior of the monetary aggregates up in the order [of the factors listed] in the operational paragraph. I would prefer having it go to first place. I could certainly settle for it being in second place. In fact, if we said something like ""the behavior of the monetary aggregates consistent with reductions in the rate of inflation""--that combination would seem to be very appropriate for me. By that I don't mean that the growth rate of M2 in any one month ought to be a cause for a dramatic move. What I would mean would be that if the 26-week rate of change of M2, for example, were to get below 3 percent, I suppose that to me would be significant. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	323	GREENSPAN	 Do you accept asymmetric? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	324	ANGELL	 Asymmetric would be fine. I would prefer symmetric, but I'd accept asymmetric. If I can get monetary aggregates, I'll take it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	325	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	326	JOHNSON	 I think the Chairman said it; his statement is clearly consistent with mine. As I said before, I think that the risks are still on the upside. I think we need time to see how the market digests this discount rate change, but I think we should be prepared to move [on the basis of] the economy's performance-- especially if the inflation indicators continue to show pressure. But I think at this stage, the appropriate action is to support asymmetry in the language and maintain the $600 million borrowing with the discount rate where it is. Let's see how those winds blow. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	327	GREENSPAN	 Would you respond to Governor Angell? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	328	JOHNSON	 On Governor Angell's point, I wouldn't mind advancing the aggregates in the list a little bit if we all agree that they're behaving a little better. But inflation pressure I think is number one, the major issue. I'm sort of agnostic on whether the M2 demand is behaving that much better. I somewhat agree with the possibility of what Governor Heller suggested--that M2 velocity has something to do with the stability--, the prediction accuracy on T- bills and short-term interest rates, to some extent. So, I'm satisfied with where it is, but I can support moving it up; I'm sort of indifferent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198808	329	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	330	HELLER	" When I joined the Board somebody told me that alternative ""B"" was always the correct one. I'm grateful to the staff that there are alternatives ""B"" and ""C"", so ""B"" is still the correct one. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	331	KOHN	 We had a long debate in the Bluebook meeting about whether we should cut off the first letter of the alphabet. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	332	HELLER	" You've got to make it easy. I'm happy to support alternative ""B"". And I think the Ms are right in the middle of the target range; that's very good. I think we should avoid  adopting a stop-go policy so we are not overdoing it on the tight side and see that danger would be there. I think I'd go along with Governor Angell on giving the monetary aggregates a bit more prominence. I'm not sure I want to move it to the first spot, but somewhere in the middle is fine. I think that that would be very good in front of foreign exchange and domestic financial markets. Overall, I support $600 million borrowing and I'd prefer symmetric language but be happy to go along with asymmetric. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198808	333	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	334	PARRY	" I can support alternative ""B"" considering how recently we tightened and also the short time before the next FOMC meeting. However, it seems to me that further tightening will be needed soon, if it isn't needed now, and that alternative ""B"" can hardly be described as a policy that keeps us ahead of the curve with regard to the problems of excessive economic growth and intensified inflationary pressures. Therefore, I strongly recommend the asymmetric language. It would permit a tightening of policy in the intermeeting period if incoming data indicate no significant deceleration in economic activity. With regard to the ordering of the phrases in the second sentence of the operational paragraph, I would not be in favor of changing the position of the monetary aggregates because I know how quickly their behavior can change and we might regret moving them up to a more prominent place this early. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198808	335	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	336	MELZER	 I agree with what you outlined, Mr. Chairman, the $600 million and asymmetric language. I feel strongly also that we are going to have to move again. I'm particularly concerned about the very rapid growth in the last couple of months of the narrower aggregates. And picking up on what Bob Black said earlier, I think that the nature of our implementation of policy is such that if the demands are there in the market for reserves we'll fill that demand at the given borrowings level. So I think we can't be complacent that we've done enough, certainly. But I also agree with what you said: I think it's important to let the prior move get digested. And I don't feel strongly that the ordering in the language has to be changed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198808	337	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	338	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that every¬ thing that we've heard around the table this morning plus the incoming data suggest that if the economy continues to be very strong we are going to have to take another move fairly soon. But I don't think now is the time to do it. One of the concerns I would have about moving right now is not only the shock to the domestic market, but also the destabilizing effect that it might have abroad--in the sense that you might get a ratcheting of rates around the world if we were to move very quickly after the action we've just taken. So I come out that we should stay where we are with the $600 million of borrowing. But I feel very strongly that the language should be asymmetric. With respect to the ordering of the directive, I don't really see any compelling case to change the order. I don't think the relationship between the economy and the monetary aggregates has been established, and I think the order does suggest the way in which we look at things  for purposes of making policy. While I don't feel very strongly about it, I would rather keep it the way it is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198808	339	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	340	LAWARE	 I'm completely in agreement with the analysis of the strength of the economy. I feel a little bit like I was in a vehicle that was accelerating down the road and I have an instinctive desire to hit the brakes a little bit and snub it down. But the thing that worries me is that I think the road's a little slipperier than it looks in the sense that there's some fragility in the infrastructure of the economy. First of all, consumers have a heck of a lot of debt. And the most recent instruments of that debt--equity credit lines, as we call them--I think have been abused in the granting throughout a large part of the industry. I think there's a significant danger that if we got into any kind of a downturn in the economy we could have a lot of consumers in a considerable amount of trouble in that particular area, because they've converted other kinds of debt to equity credit lines. Probably more important, however, is the heavy debt structure in the corporate sector. If you were to look at as many of these leveraged buyouts and takeover schemes as I have, you would find that in a lot of these the cash flows that are designed to service the debt that's involved are very skinny indeed. And they depend on a relatively stable interest rate structure and the ability over a reasonably short period of time to liquidate assets in order to get debt down to manageable levels. Well, it seems to me that a significant increase in interest rates--even one as modest as the one described in the Greenbook--over the next 12 months or so could create some major problems, at least for some of the situations that I've seen. And that could have a very sobering effect, it seems to me, on the overall economy through the problems that would be incurred by some very large companies. Another one that I guess tends to slip out of our minds occasionally is the real estate situation. It has been getting better, not only in the banks--which have increased their capital in order to sustain the possible losses in this area--but also in the country generally. The country has been benefiting from lower interest rates and the ability to restructure some of that. It seems to me that a lot of that ground that has been gained could be lost if the cost of servicing that debt goes up significantly, as it would because much of it is denominated in variable rates. Finally, this thrift situation--an aspect of which we intend to discuss at the luncheon today--has not gone away. It's getting worse. And a significant increase in the cost of money to these troubled thrifts is just going to accelerate the rate of loss in that industry. When you take all of those in the aggregate, it seems to me if we snub the brakes too hard and too fast, or oversteer this vehicle, we have a risk of going into the ditch. All I'm suggesting is that, while I think snubbing the brakes and being prepared to do so is important, I think we have to keep a very close eye on what the effects of significantly higher interest rates could be and be ready to ease up quickly if that happens. I'm not sure I understand all of the terms like asymmetrical language and so forth, but I certainly  would support the $600 million target on borrowings. And I'd lean more toward the borrowings and reserve targets as opposed to either the funds rates or, with due respect to my friend Governor Angell, the aggregates. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198808	341	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	342	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, a while ago I commended Mike Prell and his associates for producing drought-adjusted figures on GNP. I would like, with equal vigor, to commend Don Kohn for producing an asymmetric Bluebook. I agree completely with what you said on policy, and a willingness to act further if the need should arise. I also agree with your statement that it might well happen that we will need ""C"" next month. [If that's the case,] I would hope we would have an intermeeting telephone conference like we've had. And finally, I would agree completely with Governor Angell's suggestion that we move the aggregates up to number one, which probably doesn't come as a great surprise to some in this room. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198808	343	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	344	STERN	" Well, I find it a close call between whether we tighten further now or whether we wait for a while. I think your suggestion about asymmetric language resolves that as far as I'm concerned, so that the specifications of ""B"" with asymmetric language look okay to me. I do think it probably pays here to take a little pause at least, and assess the results of our actions to date, given the uncertainties associated with any forecast and errors that go with these things as well. Along those same lines, I would admit that I take some comfort anyway in the slowing in M2 and the prospective slowing in M2 if Don's forecasts are in the ballpark. I would not be at all troubled if that in fact materializes, or even materializes a little more pronouncedly than Don envisions. I think that will help keep us on the right course.

198808	345	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	346	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I agree with the policy pre¬ scription as you outlined it. Going back over the past several months, I think the record's been good; we have been moving in the right way. And I think it is appropriate to see if at some point this doesn't begin to have an effect. But I do think it's clear from comments that we've got more to go, and the question is more of timing as opposed to the direction that we are going. So, I would be in favor of the asymmetric language and a borrowing level of $600 million. And I'd allow the fed funds rate to seek its own market level. But also I think if there are any other indicators, I'd move again on this, and I do think the phone call procedure has worked out very well as a way of dealing with these interim changes. Certainly, I would encourage continuation of that. With regard to the language, I do feel that the pressure now is on the inflationary side and we ought to maintain that focus. So I would leave the language in the paragraph just as it is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198808	347	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	348	BOEHNE	" [I favor] alternative ""B"" with an asymmetrical directive. I would keep the ordering on the language the same.  However, I think a legitimate point has been raised about M2 and I think we probably ought to take a look at it at the next meeting to see if the case for it has improved. If it has, then I think at that point it would make more sense to put it higher up on the list. But I think it would be premature at this point. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198808	349	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	350	HOSKINS	" I, too, was surprised at the asymmetry in Don's Bluebook. And I thought about it a little bit and I figured if he can get rid of ""A"" this month, he can get rid of ""B"" next month. I don't have any faith in this trend. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198808	351	KOHN	 It's not a trend! 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198808	352	HOSKINS	" I think that kind of reflects my views on what we ought to be doing. I think the surprises, just from six weeks ago, in terms of the staff forecast have been on the upside; we are very strong relative to where we thought we were. Now policy is on the move. I think the markets expect policy to stay on the move. And I think that leads me towards a preference for alternative ""C"". I would be much more comfortable if the economy had been growing at 2 percent and we were waiting to see the effect of our policy. I don't think then it would be so urgent to move. Jerry Corrigan made a point earlier that the inflation problem may already be there, in terms of rising. I think he was referring to compensation costs. So it seems to me important to try to keep the thing moving along. I am sensitive to the issue raised that we have made major moves; and certainly people can disagree on the timing. But as I listen to the concensus around here, at least to this point, very few have indicated that we don't need to move. And I guess my point is we've started; we probably should continue. So we could use ""C"" with asymmetric language going the other way which would require us to kind of gradually pull towards ""C"" and not go directly to that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198808	353	GREENSPAN	 I'm not sure what you mean by that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	354	HOSKINS	" What I mean is we would choose ""C"" but we wouldn't move agressively towards ""C"" until we got stronger, until we got more data in. In other words, we have a commitment to be at ""C"" by the time we are at the next meeting--to a gradual tightening. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198808	355	ANGELL	 Okay, so you mean you want to go to $700 million now and then to $800 million by the next meeting? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198808	356	HOSKINS	 Right. So let me just finish off by saying I would prefer to move M2 up in the ranking. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198808	357	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	358	MORRIS	 I find myself with Mr. Hoskins. I think we are moving too slowly. We've had in the past month evidence showing that the economy is much stronger than we thought a month ago. We've had this dazzling--more than 800,000--increase in payroll employment in two months. we are seeing the producer price index, excluding food and fuel, break out on the upside of the range that it has been in in recent years, we are seeing a rising trend in labor compensation.  Granted, most of that reflects medical costs and not necessarily all wages, but it still shows the beginning of a rising trend in labor costs in the United States. I view this present situation as being asymmetric in this sense: that given the powerful [unintelligible] in time, if we were to move to a policy that was too restrictive we would have plenty of time to correct it as we did in 1983, 1984, 1987. But if we make the opposite mistake and have a policy that's too accommodating, we may find ourselves way behind the curve and facing a situation in which we only have two choices--accommodating an accelerating inflation or pushing the economy into recession. And it seems to me that is the real danger of moving too slowly in the face of evidence that the economy is picking up very strongly. Steve McNees reminds me that the average forecasting error four quarters out is 1-1/2 percentage point, plus or minus. If the error is plus, meaning that our forecast is on the downside, I think four quarters from now we will have only that choice: Do we accommodate a further acceleration of inflation or do we push the economy into recession? And that is the kind of choice we ought to be trying to avoid at all costs. The cost of moving now, running the risk of following too tight a policy now, is a lot less than the cost of being forced into making one of these two bad choices. And the only way you can avoid making one of those two bad choices, as we learned in the 1970s, is by taking a risk early in the game. During the 197 0s we were doing exactly what we are doing here. We were moving policy in the right direction, but we were never moving it enough to stay ahead of what was going on in the system. I feel that we are making exactly the same kind of mistakes today. I would buy Hoskins' suggestion of moving initially to $700 million with the idea of closing up at an $800 million level. I think that sounds sensible rather than doing it all at once. But I have a very strong feeling that we are moving policy too slowly here. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198808	359	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	360	SEGER	" Well, I guess I'm a ""B"", $600 million today. It's not a new [unintelligible]. First of all, I think the discount rate hike did catch almost everybody in the markets by surprise. Everyone is on vacation, and I don't think that we've had the full impact, particularly in the stock market. Also, we've had several rounds of tightening so far this year and I'm not convinced that all of those have been felt in economic activity yet. Also, I think the foreign exchange markets are very, very important to this process. And I would want to be sure that we didn't get the dollar moving so rapidly north and get it so strong that it would impede our ability to fix our trade imbalances. I think it's important to get that done over the long term. I do believe money matters and I think the monetary aggregates--particularly M2--have been looking quite good, behaving very well. In connection with that, I would go along with Wayne Angell's idea that we move it up. I'm not sure that today I'm willing to put it in spot number one, but I am willing certainly to move it up [in the directive listing of factors]. Some of the indicators of inflation and inflationary expectations, I think, look better than they did a couple of months ago, particularly looking at prices of  such things as gold, oil, certain commodities. And I realize we have a weak producer price index and some of those, but I think the more sensitive price numbers are not looking necessarily worse. As I said, I would go for a $600 million borrowing target, and I guess I would prefer a symmetrical directive, but I can certainly live with an asymmetric one. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198808	361	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	362	BOYKIN	" Mr. Chairman, I also would go with ""B"", a $600 million borrowing assumption, and the asymmetric language because I do think the next move will have to be up. As for the placement of the aggregates, I'm rather ambivalent on that at the present time. Having tightened the position, which would lean towards moving to a little more restriction, I must confess I have a little discomfort. I share many of the concerns that Governor LaWare pointed out. Given the situation that we have in the Southwest, and having I guess the bulk of the thrift problem centered down there as well as other things, I'm a little uncomfortable as rates move up--as credit becomes a little more restrictive--about what the full implications are going to be. I think it's going to make it fairly difficult for us. However, since there can only be one monetary policy and it has to be a national policy, I fully support the direction of what we are doing. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198808	363	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	364	GUFFEY	" Mr. Chairman, I would also prefer your pre¬ scription, that is: ""B""; $600 million; asymmetric. It seems clear to me that the next move probably is up, but I have a feeling that we don't really know what the impact of our most recent moves has been. It's time to pause a bit and see what impact that has on the markets. The other issue--if it's true that the next move is up, and I think there's fairly strong agreement around the table--we are kind of in a box as far as I'm concerned, in the sense that you have this spread between the discount rate and the funds rate which many think does make a lot of difference. Over time as that broadens, I don't think we can lose sight of that spread. And as a result, after the move that's being talked about here in the intermeeting period, you may have to consider another discount rate increase. That has a market impact, an announcement impact, that I think has to be thought about long and hard. With respect to the outlook and moving it up, I'd just like to pause and see where we come out. With regard to the aggregate question, I have great faith in talking about the aggregates as an intermediate target for the long run, but I would prefer not to move it up from where it is now for intermeeting guidance for what policy should be. I think it's about in the right place, about number four. And we ought to keep it there until there's a bit more confidence that it means something for short- term policy guidance. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198808	365	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198808	366	CORRIGAN	 Like some others, there is at least a crisp debate in my own mind as to whether you could make a case that we should proceed promptly with a further move in the direction of tightening. But I am persuaded that the interest of orderly procedure, if nothing else, suggests that there is something to be  said for what I will call a short period of gestation here. So in that setting, I would support the formulation that you suggested Mr. Chairman. I don't want to muddy the waters, but I would myself at least prefer the form of asymmetry that eliminates any reference to lesser reserve restraint whatsoever in the directive. I am absolutely convinced at this juncture that we are going to have to firm up policy further and I think the sooner we get on with that test the better. That's because, fundamentally, I agree with much of what Frank Morris says. I am afraid that even as we speak the inflation problem may be on top of us. And I agree with much of what John LaWare said about the financial risks. But the other side of that is that the one thing we know will get us those killer interest rates is a killer inflation rate. So I am very sensitive to those financial risks, but I'm also, as I say, very sympathetic with what Frank said. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198808	367	GREENSPAN	" Okay. As I read all comments, it's clear that we have a strong central tendency for $600 million, asymmetric language, alternative ""B"". Amongst the members, there's marginal support for moving up the Ms, although little support for number one as yet. So I would suggest that what we do is to move the aggregates above foreign exchange, because it's hard to place that-- "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
