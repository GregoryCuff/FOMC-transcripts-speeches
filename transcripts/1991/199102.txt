199102	0	GREENSPAN	 Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome, Bob McTeer; it's nice to see you at the table. You're sitting between two formidable characters but I suspect you'll survive. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	1	SYRON	 What do mean by that? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	2	GREENSPAN	 The first item on my agenda is not on the [meeting] agenda but it's something I'd like to bring up because I know a number of you felt quite uncomfortable about the need [for the Board] to take the action that we took on Friday and the way we had to take it. The action, in my judgment, had to be done and I think in retrospect it clearly was right. I thought waiting until this meeting [would have] put policy behind formidably, which I think we have to avoid. As we discussed at that time, we moved under the directive de jure, which was still targeting borrowing and not the funds rate. And, obviously, under those conditions, there's an immediate basis point-for-basis point passthrough with the discount rate. De facto, it's very hard to believe that that is what we're doing. As a consequence, I think we have to resolve this question in a manner that is consistent with the rules of this Committee. Unless somebody has an objection, I would suggest that we form a small committee--and I'm recommending Messrs. Kohn. Sternlight, Mattingly, and a Federal Reserve Bank economist of their choice--to prepare a paper on this issue and how it should be handled for inclusion on the agenda of our March 26th meeting. We have so much ambiguity on this particular issue that I think we have to get some clarification so that the Board, the Desk, and the Committee know where we are under all conditions on this issue. If anyone has anything to add to that, I'd appreciate [hearing] it. If not, I'd just like to go forward and officially appoint that committee to prepare a paper and put this issue on the agenda next time. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	3	HOSKINS	 Just a clarification on the paper: The mandate is to look at the operating instruments as well as the relationship of the discount rate to the funds rate? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	4	GREENSPAN	 The mandate is basically to evaluate our procedures and give options on what the alternative actions are when the Federal Reserve Board chooses to move the discount rate. We are into the formal meeting. Since at the moment we have no chairman, I will turn [the meeting] over to Governor Seger, who is our senior [Board] member, to obtain a chairman and vice chairman for us. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	5	SEGER	 As Mr. Greenspan says--I shouldn't call him chairman at this point--we have to select a new chairman and vice chairman for this FOMC year. I would entertain a motion for chairman. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	6	ANGELL	 Oh, you want them separately. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	7	SEGER	 Yes. ﻿ 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	8	ANGELL	 I move Mr. Greenspan be chairman. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	9	SEGER	 Okay, thank you. May I have a second or some more nominations? 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	10	SPEAKER	 Second. 	3	3	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	11	SYRON	 Move the nominations closed. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	12	SEGER	 All in favor? 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	13	SPEAKERS	 Aye, aye. 	3	3	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	14	SEGER	 Thank you. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	15	KELLEY	 You were just in time, Dick! 	3	3	0.0	1.0	48.0
199102	16	SEGER	 Right. Now we need a nomination for vice chairman, please. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	17	ANGELL	 I move Mr. Corrigan. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	18	SEGER	 All right. Any additional nominations? 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	19	KELLEY	 I'll second Mr. Corrigan. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	48.0
199102	20	SEGER	 Thank you. All in favor? 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	21	SPEAKERS	 Aye, aye. 	3	3	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	22	SEGER	 Thank you. I guess we have our officers. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	23	GREENSPAN	 Congratulations, Mr. Vice Chairman. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	24	CORRIGAN	 Condolences. Mr. Chairman. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	25	GREENSPAN	 We now have to elect staff officers and I ask the Secretary, technically the Deputy Secretary--he's just been promoted--to read them. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	26	BERNARD	 Secretary and Economist, Donald Kohn Deputy Secretary, Normand Bernard Assistant Secretaries: Joseph Coyne and Gary Gillum General Counsel, Virgil Mattingly Deputy General Counsel, Ernest Patrikis Economists: Michael Prell and Edwin Truman Associate Economists from the Board: David Lindsey; Larry Promisel; Charles Siegman; Thomas Simpson; and Lawrence Slifman. Associate Economists from the Federal Reserve Banks: Alfred Broaddus, proposed by President Black; Richard Davis, proposed by President Corrigan; Karl Scheld, proposed by President Keehn; ﻿ Sheila Tschinkel, proposed by President Forrestal; and Jack Beebe, proposed by President Parry. That's the list, Mr. Chairman. 	3	3	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	27	GREENSPAN	 If there are no objections. I will consider the list to be approved. The next item on the agenda is to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account, and we recommend the New York Bank unless I hear any objections. Without objection, I assume that is approved. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	28	SEGER	 I was going to push Kansas City! 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	29	GREENSPAN	 I knew you were! That's the reason [I made a prompt recommendation.] We need to select the Manager for Domestic Operations and the Manager for Foreign Operations, System Open Market Account. The incumbents, of course, are Messrs. Sternlight and Cross. Unless I hear objections, I will assume that we approve their carrying on for the next year. I assume you have reviewed the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and again, without objection, I will assume that that is also approved. I'll now call on Mr. Cross for a series [of recommendations]. Mr. Cross. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	30	CROSS	 Mr. Chairman, this is the warehousing agreement proposal? 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	31	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	32	CROSS	 Mr. Truman circulated a memorandum on this matter to the Committee and I concurred in the memorandum. The Committee will recall that at its meeting last March it agreed to a proposal to increase the warehousing maximum by $5 billion, from $10 billion to $15 billion. This was made subject to a Treasury request. In the event, the additional amount of $5 billion was not needed during the year and was not used; there was no Treasury request to use it. Indeed, the Treasury has taken an initiative, with our aid and encouragement, to reduce the amount outstanding under the present warehousing agreement. As you know, the amount outstanding has been reduced in the past months from $9 billion, which is where it stood when the Committee approved the increase, to $4-1/2 billion. The Treasury in reversing these amounts and reducing the outstandings to $4-1/2 billion has always urged that a cushion of unused capacity be retained in case there is a requirement for it, even though [the need] has been going the other way. We have made the point that we don't think the warehousing facility should be in continuous use and we have been helping and encouraging them in bringing the amount down from $9 billion to $4-1/2 billion. Our view is that the correct approach at this point would be to drop the additional $5 billion that was added last year and to seek the renewal of the facility at the present time with the pre-existing maximum of $10 billion. And I so recommend, Mr. Chairman. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	33	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Cross? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	34	HOSKINS	 I have a couple, Sam. One is: What happens if we don't renew it? Does it automatically expire or is this a process that the FOMC has set up to review this annually? If so, I guess the idea is that the Committee is endorsing this kind of activity. ﻿ 	41	41	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	35	CROSS	 Well, there have been warehousing arrangements with the Treasury going back to the early 1960s. I would have to seek legal guidance on what would happen if at the time when there were outstandings the Committee did not authorize their continuance. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	36	KOHN	 I assume they would run off as they mature. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	37	CROSS	 I assume so, yes. The next ones that fall due are in May and June. Well, I don't know what the legal position would be. If there were no warehouse facility, I don't know whether that would mean that the whole $4-1/2 billion would have to be ended at this moment or-- 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	38	MATTINGLY	 They would go off according to the terms. Is there a term on them? 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	39	KOHN	 Yes. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	40	CROSS	 There are terms on them. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	41	MATTINGLY	 [Each] would roll off according to its terms; there would be no additional warehousing after the resolution. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	42	HOSKINS	 So. if we endorse the recommendation of $10 billion, would that essentially mean that the FOMC endorses the activity of warehousing? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	43	CROSS	 It means that the FOMC endorses the continuance of this facility up to a maximum of $10 billion, yes. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	44	KOHN	 The FOMC has been authorizing the warehousing on an annual basis when it votes on this. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	45	GUFFEY	 Sam, what's magic about $10 billion as opposed to $5 billion, for example? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	20.0
199102	46	CROSS	 Well, as I say, the Treasury has taken the initiative and has acted to bring down the amount outstanding quite substantially in this past period. They have always made the point very clearly that in doing so they urge and would expect that there would be a continuation of this [facility] so that if conditions should change--and they can change--it would be available to them quite promptly in order to continue further warehousing. At this point conditions are such that it certainly does not look like that's the way it's going; it's going the other way. We're in the process of reducing our foreign currency holdings. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	47	GUFFEY	 A follow-up question: If we were to authorize $10 billion, then it's up to them? We don't trigger it but they do? They could do this anytime they want to and we have to take it? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	20.0
199102	48	CROSS	 If we authorize the $10 billion, then typically we act on their request in providing the warehousing. Now, obviously, this is not an adversarial relationship, as far as I'm concerned. It's something that we talk to them about, work with them on, and deal with them on a daily basis. It has always worked satisfactorily on that basis. ﻿ 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	49	GREENSPAN	 Charlie Siegman, do you have anything you'd like to add? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	50	SIEGMAN	 No. I think the Treasury's need for some contingency or a cushion for reserve is appropriate, given the uncertainties. Otherwise, we'd have to review this on an emergency basis rather than-- 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	51	CROSS	 Any action to change this does get reported. If we leave it at $10 billion, that's outstanding until we choose to act otherwise or we look at it again next year. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	52	GREENSPAN	 I think we're still in the mode of trying to reduce our holdings [of foreign currencies] and that will continue. We have communicated that periodically to the Treasury, and I think we are just going to bring down gradually what we all think is an excessive position in this respect. It will take a while, but I think we're moving in the right direction. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	53	CROSS	 We've made clear to the Treasury many, many times that we don't visualize this as a facility that should be in continuous use. It's there when conditions are such that it's required and it should be drawn down, or reversed, at times when conditions warrant. That's the basis we've been working on and the basis on which it has been reduced to $4-1/2 billion in recent months. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	54	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	55	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, for two years I was rather uncomfortable with this position. I am not uncomfortable with this $10 billion request. I feel that the Treasury was rather generous in moving in this direction, [based on] the Federal Open Market Committee's objections. It seems to me that they gave heed to the VO.J--1-U. _Lli UHCl L. WC U.-LU. \_a.J-_L \-\J LilC atLCIiLi-Ull �J i. LUC O Wllk�J- CO o l -*- ■-> � *-*■ �- •-> J about the appropriations process. If the Congress feels comfortable with the arrangement, I'm certainly on board in this context. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	56	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions? Would somebody like to move approval of Sam's request? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	57	CORRIGAN	 I'll move it. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	58	GREENSPAN	 Is there a second? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	59	SYRON	 Second. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	60	GREENSPAN	 Without objection, it is approved. We have three additional foreign currency instruments, which have to be approved. Would somebody like to move them? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	61	CORRIGAN	 I would move that. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	62	GREENSPAN	 Second? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	63	SYRON	 Second. ﻿ 	41	41	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	64	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. The next item on the agenda is the memorandum from Mr. Mattingly, which is dated January 25th, on the Committee's Rules Regarding the Availability of Information. I specifically requested that individuals on the Committee be contacted to see what the general response to that draft memorandum was. There were several who had problems with it. My view is that if there isn't [virtual] unanimity on an issue such as this, it would be inappropriate for us to [approve] it or move on it. And I would suggest that it just be dropped at this stage. Hopefully we'll get our issues in this area resolved in a somewhat better manner. Nonetheless, we have to have a vote on the technical part of that memorandum before publication. Would somebody like to move that? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	65	SEGER	 I'll move it. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	66	SYRON	 Second. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	67	GREENSPAN	 Is there a second? Is there any discussion? Without objections. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	68	KEEHN	 Would it be appropriate to ask what the nature of the objections was? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	35.0
199102	69	KELLEY	 Yes, I'd be interested also. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	48.0
199102	70	GREENSPAN	 Don, why don't you comment? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	71	KOHN	 Several members of the Committee and other presidents questioned the need for it. Several expressed the view that, indeed, whoever was doing this leaking knew it was wrong, so why do we have to pass more rules? A couple members of the Committee were concerned that the language having to do with verbal or unwritten--as well as written--material was overly broad and might end up gagging their ability to discourse in public even in the normal course of business without [divulging] anything that could be used in that way. Let's see, those were two of the reasons. Really, it was: Why do we need this? It could be misinterpreted; it could be used against the Committee at some point. It seems unnecessary, so why go forward with it? That was, I think, the general nature of the objections. Norm, do you-- 	9	97	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	72	BERNARD	" Yes, in line with your comment, the observation was ""made that the rules already contained the prohibitions and the authority for the Chairman [on this matter], so there was really no need to be more specific and draw attention to this. "	9	97	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	73	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, I understand that it is your intent just to drop this now, but do you anticipate that this will be reexamined and revisited? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	74	GREENSPAN	 No, if there is concern in the Committee that in order to respond to a specific problem we are creating too [cumbersome] an instrument--which is what I infer, basically, from the comments--then I would recommend that we just drop it and live with the problem that we have and hope that it does not get worse. Maybe we'll be fortunate and it will disappear. ﻿ 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	75	SYRON	 I hope I'm not being gratuitous, but my own concern is that I think the problem that we have, if it continues, is a problem that threatens the viability of how we approach both the discussion and formulation of policy. So, if the problem were to continue, I think we would have to do something. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	76	GREENSPAN	 Well, unless somebody can find a means that is acceptable to the Committee on a virtually unanimous basis, I think we will have to live with this until we find some alternative. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	77	KEEHN	 I don't have a solution to that problem, but just to express my view: I thought a greater degree of specificity was appropriate, and given the problems that we've experienced, I understand that it could be contentious. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	35.0
199102	78	GREENSPAN	 If the issue comes up again and it is creating significant difficulties for deliberations in this organization, then it will be appropriate to [revisit] it. But somebody has to have an idea that is [unintelligible] formality. Okay, do we have to a motion? [Secretary's note: The motion was made, seconded, and approved.] Can we now have a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting for December 18? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	79	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	80	SYRON	 Second. 	9	97	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	81	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Sam Cross, would you now bring us up-to-date on your operations since December 18? 	9	97	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	82	CROSS	 The Gulf conflict dominated foreign exchange trading during much of the period since you last met. Nervousness over the conflict, about whether it would result in war and if so how long and broad the conflict might be, provided waves of support for the dollar through December and most of January. It was not until last week, when changes in Bundesbank and Federal Reserve discount rates underscored the divergent trends in interest rates in the two countries that market attention turned back to economic conditions here and abroad. When that occurred, the dollar fell to reach a new historic low against the mark yesterday morning. The dollar is now 1 to 2 percent below the levels prevailing at the time of your mid-December meeting. In the interim, however, there was considerable volatility, and the dollar came under two periods of strong upward pressure, both associated with political developments abroad. In the second of these episodes, the dollar moved up to Y138 and DM 1.55 as the first reports of war in the Gulf reached the market. From these levels, the dollar then reversed course and within hours tumbled a full 4 to 5 percent back down to its mid-December levels. Recognizing the potential for great volatility in financial markets, we had begun before January 15 to consult informally with the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan about how we might work together to deal with any shocks or unusual pressures in the exchange markets. We explored various possibilities. In the event, neither the Bundesbank nor the Bank of Japan wanted to agree to any precise program in advance, although both professed a willingness to cooperate if conditions warranted. The Japanese were more reluctant to consider operations in their currency than the Germans, reflecting the fact that the dollar was not nearly as close to its all-time low against the yen as it was against the mark and that the Japanese have been under considerable pressure from the Europeans to let their currency appreciate further. As it turned out, the dollar moved up with the increasing prospect of war in mid-January and the outbreak of allied bombing on January 16. However, the possibility of war had been well anticipated so that market operators were quick to take advantage of the run-up of rates to take profits on long dollar positions. Some of the longer-term position takers actually moved to establish short-dollar positions, believing that a quick and decisive war would allow the market to return its attention to underlying economic and interest rate trends. As a result, the dollar turned around abruptly as I have already mentioned and has tended to move irregularly lower since then. The G.7, at its meeting on January 21, said merely that they were ìprepared to respond as appropriate to maintain stability in international marketsî and had little market impact. In informal discussions, Treasury tested sentiment about a concept of more specific trading ranges but found both the Germans and the Japanese sceptical about any formal undertakings. Last week, sentiment toward the dollar weakened further as divergent economic trends in the United States, on the one hand, and Germany and Japan, on the other, became increasingly apparent and took their toll. A number of developments drew market attention away from the Gulf war. Most notably there were the German interest rate hikes on Thursday, followed on Friday by the release of United States employment data and the subsequent reduction in our discount and federal funds rates. Also, there were comments on the need for lower interest rates by the President, Secretary Brady and others, which reinforced expectations of continuing interest rate reductions. All of this tended to overwhelm the factors supporting the dollar and the dealing community's reluctance to go short dollars. In that environment, we contacted the Bundesbank and agreed that we would jointly act to resist further significant dollar declines. As events unfolded, the dollar broke through its previous historic low of DM 1.4625 yesterday, and hit a new low of about DM 1.4560 by 8:00 a.m. The Desk initiated two rounds of concerted intervention around the 9:00 a.m. opening in New York. We purchased a total of $100 million against marks, and were joined by 14 other central banks which together bought a total of $325 million, nearly all against marks. On the basis of the market reaction and the commentary we subsequently received from the other central banks, these operations were successful, at least initially. However, there have been further pressures today, and there are further operations. Market participants were impressed with the evidence of G-7 cohesion in the exchange area. But, it is clear that the current interest rate differentials against the dollar and the presumption of further declines in dollar interest rates weigh heavily against the dollar. On another matter, we have continued to sell, as customer operations, currencies received by Treasury from German and Japanese contributions to Desert Shield. During January, we sold under this arrangement. Mr. Chairman, I request the Committee's approval for the Federal Reserve's purchase of $50 million against marks yesterday, our only operation on behalf of the System during the period. This represents the Federal Reserve's half of the $100 million intervention yesterday. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	83	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Sam? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	84	HOSKINS	 I have a question on intervention activities with respect to the mark, since that's the only currency involved in the intervention we've been doing. I presume that is supposed to be a sterilized intervention. The question really is: If we're pegging a rate like the funds rate, how do we know we're sterilizing it? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	85	CROSS	 I think it happens automatically, but I defer-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	86	KOHN	 If we didn't sterilize it, the supply of reserves would be changed and the funds rate would be different. So, I think in order to peg the funds rate, we have to sterilize it. If I can see that the funds rate is being basically determined by supply and demand for reasons-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	87	HOSKINS	 Yes, but you're sterilizing around the funds rate and not around total reserves. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	88	KOHN	 Either way I think it's-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	89	HOSKINS	 Total reserves is what we think drives money and we're trying to get money to grow. So, if one is worried about the slowness of monetary growth, one might worry about this practice. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	90	KOHN	 If we didn't sterilize it, then it would show through presumably to total reserves, to interest rates, to borrowing, or whatever it is the Committee is targeting. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	91	GREENSPAN	 Other questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	92	KEEHN	 Sam, what is your sense of the outlook for the dollar? You say that, given the interest rate differential and other things that are putting pressure on the dollar, [downward pressure] is there. But is a precipitous fall likely here or just this continued downward pressure? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
199102	93	CROSS	 Well, it's very hard to predict because one never knows when something is likely to set off concerns about confidence in the [exchange] rate of the dollar, which could lead to a precipitous fall and spread to other markets and all the problems that that entails, since we obviously still have a large deficit that we still have to finance and have to attract the funds to do it. There has been downward pressure on the dollar and, as I say, it's at an all time low in terms of the mark. As to the prospects over the more medium term, there are some facts that tend to provide more encouragement about it. For example, the dollar at these very low levels is considered by many people to be quite competitive; and if this present period can be managed, then maybe that [sentiment] will begin to be reflected more in the exchange markets. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	94	SYRON	 Sam, and Peter also: With respect to what you in the market hear, do you hear much more in the way of concern about overseas purchases of United States debt securities? How much has this been an issue and how much do people anticipate it becoming more of an issue? Or do they? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	95	CROSS	 It is an ongoing saga. Every time we have a refunding the question arises: Will it this time be a party to which no one comes--a Stella Dallas party? But thus far, [unintelligible]. There continues to be foreign participation; it changes and at times has declined quite noticeably, but funds continue to come in. Peter, do you want [to comment]? 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	96	STERNLIGHT	 I don't think there's anything remarkably different about foreign participation. I'm hearing that there was good foreign participation in the three-year note that was just offered today. There is rather limited talk about what participation there might be in the longer maturities, but that's related more to the portfolio decisions of those foreign holders rather than about the particular [amount of] dollars at this point. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	97	CORRIGAN	 What we are seeing though, Dick, is foreigners backing away a little from private securities of all kinds, including bank paper--certainly anything over 5 years. Even if it's from Morgan Guaranty, it cannot be sold overseas. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	98	SYRON	 But this is a financial fragility risk question as well as a question about the dollar. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	99	CORRIGAN	 Right, it's both. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	100	CROSS	 Also, a lot of the activities in the foreign exchange markets reflects changes in hedge ratios. That [means that if] Japanese investors and these categories of large investors decide that they think the dollar's prospects are not good, they will change the hedge ratio without necessarily getting rid of the securities or anything like that. So, you can't detect this just by what is going on in the securities markets. There's an awful lot of hedging and dehedging and that is a very important factor. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	101	FORRESTAL	 Sam, are these funds that are flowing in in connection with Desert Storm detectable in terms of coming through the foreign exchange markets? Are they continuing to cushion the-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
199102	102	CROSS	 They pay us in marks and yen and we feed them out in a manner that is like our normal customer business. In other words, we just try to make clear that this is not an action by us [so as not] to appear to be influencing the rate. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	103	FORRESTAL	 So it's not affecting rates? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
199102	104	CROSS	 As far as we can tell, it has worked out quite well so far. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	105	BLACK	 You haven't used the BIS on this have you, Sam? We have done this ourselves? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	106	CROSS	 We have used the BIS for some portion of these sales of foreign currencies, so that we're not seen in the market to appear to be selling. Thus far, it seems to have worked out satisfactorily. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	107	GREENSPAN	 Anything further for Sam? If not, would somebody like to move approval of his transactions of yesterday? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	108	SPEAKER	 I move them. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	109	GREENSPAN	 Is there a second? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	110	SEGER	 Second. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	40.0
199102	111	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Mr. Sternlight. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	112	STERNLIGHT	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The past intermeeting period was marked by unprecedented turbulence in the market for bank reserves--the Federal funds market--as bank reserve managers and the System's Trading Desk coped with year-end pressures, the phase-down of reserve requirements that brought required reserve balances down to levels insufficient at times to meet clearing needs, and some large day-to-day projection errors. Amazingly, notwithstanding the turbulence, market participants were never in much doubt as to the thrust of policy and the Desk was able to communicate policy moves quite clearly to the market. The first such move was undertaken shortly after the Committee's December 18 meeting. The afternoon of that meeting, the Board approved a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the discount rate to 6 1/2 percent. Beginning the next day, the Desk aimed for reserve conditions associated with Federal funds trading around 7 percent--down 1/4 percentage point from the previously expected rate. The market got the message fairly readily, although actual funds rates showed considerable variation going into the year-end period and the phase-down of reserve requirements. The second move was made around January 9, in particular response to soft money growth, and also against the broad background of weakness in the economy and slackening inflation. The funds rate was now expected to vary around 6 3/4 percent. Once again, the market got the point quickly even though variations in the funds rate were so wide as to render the idea of a central tendency rather abstract. While year-end pressures, as such, had passed, we were still living with the aftermath of the huge provisions of reserves to cope with yearend, and at the same time with the constraints introduced by lower reserve requirements. Those reductions brought the need for balances at the Fed for reserve requirement purposes down to the point where the more critical factor was often the need to maintain sufficient balances for clearing purposes. The third move came near the end of the period, following the Board's further reduction of the discount rate by another 1/2 percentage point to 6 percent. This time, as noted at the Committee conference call last Friday morning, just before the discount rate move was announced, the decision was to have the full 50 basis point cut show through to the funds rate, reducing the expected rate to around 6 1/4 percent. Once again, even though funds were rather volatile over the day last Friday, the new 6 1/4 percent level was communicated fairly clearly. On average over reserve maintenance periods, funds were not vastly different from the expected central points, but the averages concealed some very wide variations, not just on settlement days--to which markets have been accustomed--but also on many other days. Funds averaged about 7 1/4 percent in the reserve period ended December 26, reflecting pre-year-end firmness--but with actual rates as low as 1/16 percent on December 24 and as high as 100 percent on December 26. In the January 9 period, when the objective was 7 percent until the final day, the average turned out around 6.80 percent, with some trading as low as zero on the year-end date and as high as 12 or 13 percent at other times. For a few days near the start of the January 23 period it appeared that greater stability had returned, with funds holding close to the 6 3/4 percent objective, but greater volatility soon returned and we saw rates as high as 30 and 90 percent on the last two days of that period. The period average was again around 6.80 percent, with benefit of luck. The current period has again seen much variability, averaging around 7 1/8 percent through yesterday with a range of roughly 1/4 to 15 percent. The particular reason for volatility in this current period seems to be that balances maintained at the Fed to meet reserve requirements are exceptionally low, as vault cash is seasonably high and requirements seasonally low (as well as having been reduced by the December action). This apparently meant that the binding constraint on balances was the need for balances for clearing purposes--a highly variable quantity that we are still learning to track. Projection misses added to the problem, and the effects of misses tended to be magnified as the smaller volume of maintained reserves provided less cushion to absorb day-to-day flows. In addition, my impression is that the funds market has ìthinned outî in the sense that participants are more name conscious about counterparties. There are some institutions that don't want to sell, or would sell only limited amounts to certain others. This has led to reported situations, especially in lateday activity, of trades going through at widely different rates at about the same time. While the path level of borrowing remained in the $100-125 million range, actual borrowing often exceeded this level, especially on tight funds days. For full reserve periods, average borrowing ranged from about $275 million to $850 million, though this current period is coming out somewhat under $200 million. Part of the borrowing reflected the needs of Bank of New England, but on average this was a small factor as they were able to leave the window once Treasury tax and loan account balances built up in mid-January. The highest daily borrowing came at the ends of the December 26 and January 23 periods, in each case about $5 billion. On both occasions there was a deceptively comfortable money market on the morning of those settlement days that precluded aggressive Desk action to provide for projected needs, lest the market be misled about policy; and then there were large projection misses to boot, though we would have been reluctant to add more reserves on those occasions even if our projections had been accurate! Demands for excess reserves were highly variable, as noted, reflecting year-end and the complications introduced by the reserve requirement cut along with the emerging need for clearing balances. Excess normally had ranged within a few hundred million of $1 billion. In the December 26 period, which saw the first part of the reserve requirement phase-down, excess bulged to about $2 billion. In the next period, which saw the rest of the reserve requirement cut as well as year-end, excess soared to around $3 1/2 billion--though this was evidently more than was really wanted and led to large carry-overs into the next period. In that interval, ended January 23, excess dropped to a currently estimated $900 million--and was probably less than was desired given the very tight close. In the current period, now drawing to an end, demands have bulged again, apparently to something around $3 billion. At the start of the intermeeting period, it appeared that there would be some reserve needs up through about year-end, but then huge needs to absorb reserves as the year-end factors faded, revealing the excess reserves released by the reserve requirement reduction and augmented by seasonal movements in currency and required reserves. The Desk's initial strategy was to meet reserve needs with repurchase agreements while at the same time gradually lightening outright holdings through run-offs of bills and sales to foreign accounts. As the Committee will recall, the need to absorb reserves by end of the period looked so large that we requested a substantial increase in the standard intermeeting leeway. Part way through the period, the reserve outlook changed dramatically as prospectively high Treasury balances after the mid-January tax date and large currency outflows apparently related to the Middle East substantially reduced the projected need to drain reserves. Thus after running off just $2 billion of bill holdings and selling $1.6 billion of bills to foreign accounts we discontinued the shrinkage of our outright portfolio--thereby not even using the normal leeway never mind the expanded amount. Meantime, heavy use was made of temporary transactions, especially repurchase agreements, with unusually large volumes employed just before year-end. Specifically to deal with yearend pressures, a new technique was used a few days before the year-end, in which we arranged forward RP's in heavy volume, to take effect on the year-end date. This seemed to be particularly helpful in relieving the somewhat paranoid market fears about getting financed on that day. On a few occasions, after our exceptionally heavy provisions of reserves had flooded the market and rates were very soft, we arranged matched sale-purchase transactions in the market to extract seemingly over-abundant reserves. The volatility and uncertainty were such, though, that on at least one occasion after extracting reserves with matched sales--a move that we felt virtually obliged to undertake lest the market falsely conclude we were easing--the funds market subsequently became excessively tight. The gyrating funds rate seemed to have little effect on other market interest rates. Rather, those rates responded to a variety of influences over the period, including news on the economy, prices, money growth, perceived policy moves, and of course Middle East developments. On net, the Treasury yield curve steepened appreciably as short term rates came down under the impact of policy easings. Key bill rates fell about 70-80 basis points--not far from matching the full percentage point decline in the System's expected funds rate. In last Monday's 3- and 6-month bill auctions the average rates were 5.97 and 5.94 percent, down from 6.78 and 6.77 percent just before the last meeting date. Net bill issuance was about unchanged over the period as increases in the regular weekly cycles were about offset by a December paydown of cash management bills. Meantime, increasing amounts of bills were absorbed by noncompetitive tenders, probably reflecting to some extent anxieties about the financial system. Rates on commercial paper and bank CDs dropped by roughly 100 to 175 basis points, with the larger declines in the shorter maturities where the passage of year-end was a prominent factor. Banks cut their prime rate a full percentage point, in two stages, to 9 percent. The first cut followed the mid- December discount rate reduction rather sluggishly as most banks waited for the passage of year-end before acting. The second came with greater alacrity in response to the latest discount rate cut and perceived reduction in the Fed's funds rate goal. For intermediate and longer maturities the rate declines were much less--about 20-50 basis points for Treasury issues due in 2 to 7 years and about 15-20 basis points for the longer term issues. Indeed, over much of the period, the yield on long Treasuries was higher than in mid-December, reflecting worries about the Middle East, and at times a view that the economy might not be as soft or inflation as subdued as it appeared at other times. Continuing additions to supply, actual or prospective, were also a factor in the intermediate and longer area. Counting the current quarterly financing, for which auctions are now being held, the Treasury will have raised nearly $38 billion in the coupon market since the December meeting, while Refcorp raised another $7 billion in January using up its authorized borrowing limit. After taking very negatively the news of the breakdown in the Baker-Aziz talks in early January, the market responded favorably to the early reports of Allied military successes just after hostilities began at mid-month. But that merely brought the 30-year yield back to around the 8.20 percent level prevailing in mid-December. A further yield decline after last Friday's weak employment report and discount rate cut led to the moderate net decline for the full period, with the long bond now yielding a bit over 8.00 percent. Throughout the period, there has been market expectation of further Fed easing to come, though with much variation of views about the timing and extent of specific moves. In general, the actual moves in the recent period seemed to come a bit sooner and more aggressively than most participants had anticipated. At the moment, in the wake of last Friday's policy steps it is not yet clear how much more the market looks for. My sense is that most participants anticipate nothing further for at least a few weeks, with the timing and extent of any subsequent moves dependent on information on the economy, credit and money growth, and Middle East developments. Many share the view that if the war ends quickly, this could give a big lift to business and consumer sentiment. The consequences of a longer conflict are far less certain. Finally, I should mention that another firm left primary dealer ranks in the recent period. Security Pacific, after a restructuring that dismantled its merchant bank had at first sought to keep the primary dealer going and perhaps place it in a joint venture with a foreign bank, but then decided to draw back to just a localized dealership. That shrank the number of primary dealers back to 40. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	113	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, sir. Questions for Peter? Tom. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	114	MELZER	 Peter, I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on the instability of the funds rate. Do you view the instability as a problem, which seems to be what you've implied, in terms of markets knowing where we are and other interest rates not being affected? Maybe it isn't a big problem, but I'm sure there are other problems in terms of overnight financing and that sort of thing. So my first question is: Is the instability a problem? Secondly, do you think it will persist as some of these seasonal factors affecting reserve balances, cash, and so forth pass? In other words, are the reserve ﻿ balances adequate to handle the clearings? And, finally, assuming they aren't, what do you think we can do about it? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	42.0
199102	115	STERNLIGHT	 I think it has been something of a problem. We've been somewhat lucky in that we've been able to communicate policy moves as well as we have without that process getting confused. So, I wouldn't say it was such a problem that it kept us from doing the essentials of the job, but it was something of a problem. As to whether it's a temporary or more lasting phenomenon, I think the severity should be ameliorated from what it has been as the players get used to the new factors and partly because we're just now coming through a reserve period where the need for maintaining balances at the Fed to satisfy reserve requirements is exceptionally low. It's a seasonal low point for balances at the Fed because cash is seasonally high and reserve requirements are seasonally low. Also, there has been a gradual build-up--rather modest so far, but ongoing--in these required clearing balances. More and more banks have looked at the possibility of [establishing] these required clearing balances to pay for Fed services and that has gone up about $500 or $600 million since mid-December. I know that's true of a number of large banks; and undoubtedly many small banks also are looking at it now. So, I expect to see something more there. But I don't know if that's going to be enough to erase the problem totally. I suspect there's going to be some lingering element of greater volatility looking ahead. As to what can be done about it, probably the best thing--if one could have a wish list on this--would be to be able to pay interest on required reserves. But that would take Congressional action. We've been considering, and some market people have suggested, the possibility of bigger reserve carryovers. I think that could be of a little help but rather limited; it takes more looking to decide just how much help it might be. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	116	KOHN	 Bigger and longer, too. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	117	STERNLIGHT	 Also, there has been a suggestion that the banks have more than one period in which to use excess that developed in a given period. The suggestion has been made to have the Desk enter the market later on the same day. I would see very little net gain from that just because we're physically limited in how late we can go in and still achieve delivery in the day. So much of the greater volatility has come after that point in the afternoon. But we really don't have much more information, let's say, at 1:00 p.m. than we have at 11:00 a.m. that would give us much gain from later entries. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	118	PARRY	 Do these developments suggest that the level of reserves that banks are required to hold is very close to what they would hold if there were no required reserves? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
199102	119	KOHN	 Yes, it suggests that they're close to what they would hold for clearing purposes alone. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	120	PARRY	 Isn't that sort of surprising? One would have thought that with a 12 percent requirement on transactions balances that would have [meant] much more [reserves] than a bank-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
199102	121	KOHN	 Transactions balances are a very small proportion of total deposits; they're less than 10 percent, or in that range. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	122	STERNLIGHT	 And a great majority of banks, of course, are not bound at all. They have been meeting their needs fully with all cash anyway. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	123	KOHN	 I think there is still a tax involved in this reserve requirement because if one were transacting with a private bank, one might hold these balances but at least receive compensating balance credits or earnings credit on them. They would serve double duty for you. We don't allow them to serve double duty, although that's part of what is going on. The banks are building up their clearing balances and those balances do serve double duty, but the required reserves [do not]. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	124	PARRY	 It is surprising that just that one change in reserve requirements, which didn't look like it was that much in terms of billions, just moved to the margin-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
199102	125	GREENSPAN	 Do you have any idea what proportion of the balances are literally dedicated to paying or offsetting fees? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	126	STERNLIGHT	 Well, required [clearing] balances are around $2.3-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	127	KOHN	 $2.6 billion, I think. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	128	GREENSPAN	 $2.6 billion? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	129	KOHN	 Right, but that's not included in our required reserves. We have about $16 billion of required reserves this week, which is the seasonal low, plus another $2.6 or $2.7 billion of required clearing balances. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	130	GREENSPAN	 So, it's still a small part? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	131	KOHN	 Yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	132	GREENSPAN	 So, even if those were eliminated, that is not going to-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	133	KOHN	 Well, I think that $2.6 or $2.7 billion will rise over time so that people feel more comfortable with the total level of their balances with the Federal Reserve. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	134	CORRIGAN	 But the rate at which the balances now are turning over, whether they're required clearing balances or required reserves, has grown exponentially and is still growing. So, I don't find it surprising, Bob, that that last change had as big an impact as it had. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	135	PARRY	 It's a fifty percent change. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
199102	136	CORRIGAN	 It's a very big percentage change. And if you look at the turnover as a proxy for transactions, it's still rising at a geometric rate. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	137	SYRON	 Peter, with respect to the relationship between the RP rate and the funds rate: Have you had to alter your stopouts ﻿ or other terms in an effort to get to a particular funds rate in this [intermeeting period]? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	138	STERNLIGHT	 We have noticed, of course, the relationship of RP rates and the funds rate. We have done some looking into what might have brought about the relatively higher RP rate. Traditionally that has been a little under the funds rate. It may have something to do with just the volume of securities being financed; it may have something to do with name problems, in terms of some of the parties getting their financing. I wouldn't say it has been that much of a problem in trying to get to the funds rate that we want. We generally have an idea of the amount of repurchase agreements we want to do and we stop where we have to in order to get that amount done. But we'll also be conscious of where the stopout rate is and where it might fit in relation to what we are hearing from the market as to their expectation of the stopout. That might be a small factor in our decision about just how much to do on occasion, but I think it's a pretty small factor. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	139	SYRON	 But there has been a meaningful change? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	140	STERNLIGHT	 I don't think so. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	141	CORRIGAN	 The other thing, too, that would make a difference that I don't think Peter touched on--but I guess Don will be discussing tomorrow--is the whole question of the use and administration of the discount window, particularly in terms of these end-of-day types of things. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	142	STERNLIGHT	 Making for a very high funds rate at times [unintelligible] to come to the window. Yes, I should have mentioned that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	143	GREENSPAN	 Bob Black. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	144	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I have been on the [morning] call thus far this year and I think Peter handled this exceptionally well under very difficult conditions. But it necessitated his resolving these frequent doubts between the borrowed reserve target and the expected federal funds rate always, it seemed to me, on the side of the expected federal funds rate. And that's how he kept the market apprised of what we really were aiming at. Peter, I just wanted to ask you if you could remember a period when the relationship between the borrowed reserve level and the federal funds rate was quite as tenuous as it seems to have been [recently]. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	145	STERNLIGHT	 No extended period. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	146	BLACK	 I hope there wasn't another because I know how you struggled with that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	147	GREENSPAN	 Si Keehn. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	148	KEEHN	 Peter, I agree with Bob's answer but as another operational alternative: What if you were in the market more frequently than once a day--frequently enough that you could deal with some of the volatility? ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
199102	149	STERNLIGHT	 Well, as I say, we go in at that hour when we have our reserve numbers assembled. On rare occasions we've gone in earlier because we had to be sure of being able to do the job or because we wanted to register at an earlier hour some viewpoint as to conditions that were ongoing. So, there's a limitation at one end involving when we would have reserve information in our hands and that sets [the timing] at around 11:00 to 11:30 a.m. At the other end, if we're going to get delivery and have our operations effective that day, it can't be much later than 1:30 p.m. or so. So there's not an awful lot we could do under present institutional arrangements about the volatility that comes in mid and late afternoon and on into the early evening, which is when we get some of the greatest extremes of variability. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	150	BLACK	 Si, one time during the week I was joking with members of the Board's staff [on the call], and Peter asked if we would mind stopping so he'd have time to get into the market. It looked like we were going to delay him unduly--which was unintentional by the way! 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	151	GREENSPAN	 Lee Hoskins. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	152	HOSKINS	 Well, this point has already been tortured by three other people, but the problem is not the market knowing where we want the funds rate; they know where that is. The problem is in the latter part of the day. What you said about having to have everything done by 1:30 p.m. sort of defuses my question; otherwise you could just stand ready to buy and sell at 6-1/4 percent as an alternative to what we're doing. That leads me to another question--really for you. Mr. Chairman. In this commission that you have just given to Don Kohn, are we going to consider alternative operating procedures? Was the mandate that broad? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199102	153	GREENSPAN	 No, we're restricting it to the very specific problem that was on the table. The other issue is so broad that the commission won't get back in time-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	154	PARRY	 We need another commission. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
199102	155	ANGELL	 It would be pretty radical for us to be willing to say what it is we're really doing! 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	156	GREENSPAN	 Bob McTeer. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	157	MCTEER	 Peter said that authority to pay interest on required reserve balances might be helpful. Usually when that's discussed in the context of proposed legislation, it is coupled with authority for banks to pay interest on demand deposits. I just wondered: If you got both of those as a legislative package, would the second part of that help or offset the benefit of the first part? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	53.0
199102	158	STERNLIGHT	 I don't see a direct problem in terms of implications for open market operations. I think there are broader issues to consider, which the System certainly would want to think through in a legislative way. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	159	MCTEER	 That would free up a lot of resources in the economy devoted to cash management and add a little efficiency I would think to the-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	53.0
199102	160	KOHN	 The last time the Board testified to the Congress on this, which was 5 or 6 or 7 years ago probably, we linked those two proposals partly because we were concerned about the politics of giving the banks money and enhancing their profits. We thought both of those were desirable for really very different reasons but [the proposed legislation] didn't go anywhere. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	161	BLACK	 It wouldn't appear to be as much of a giveaway program now with the banks so troubled. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	162	KOHN	 Yes, I think it probably would be welcomed. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	163	BLACK	 If you could ever sell it. this is the time you could sell it. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
199102	164	CORRIGAN	 One thought on this volatility in the funds rate in a context in which it has been stipulated that there has not been an enormous problem in terms of policy transparency: I must say that I'm not sure I consider the volatility all bad. If nothing else, it may ultimately be consistent with a little more discipline and a little more order in the way borrowings are managed. As I said, I don't think it's necessarily the end of the world. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	165	GREENSPAN	 Is there any evidence that the failure to use the discount window is pressing everything on open market operations? Do you sense that? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	166	KOHN	 Well, yes. I think that's part of what has been going on really for a couple of years now. I don't know that it's the shift of the borrowing function; the borrowing function has gotten down so close to the origin that it's hard to imagine further shifts. But I would guess, if anything, that in the last several months it has been worse. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	167	GREENSPAN	 If you do that in the context of lowering reserve requirements in general, it's double-hitting the System then. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	168	KOHN	 Yes, the safety valve. I will talk about this tomorrow, but in some sense the safety valve of the discount window doesn't seem to be there and so we get these 90 percent funds rates that banks feel they have to bid before they come into the window. As Peter said, there has been a lot more use of the window, partly because they were just about forced--they had to [borrow] in order to avoid overnight overdrafts. I'm not sure that's so bad; it creates a little background in borrowing here. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	169	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Peter? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	170	SEGER	 Can you open the [discount] window at night so they won't been seen going in? Would that help? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0

199102	173	CORRIGAN	 There is this other point, too, that Bob McTeer raised and Si raised. Virgil, I forgot the nature of the authorization, but in the 1980 law I remember we stuck in a provision where there is the authority to pay interest on these-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	174	MELZER	 Supplemental balances. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	42.0
199102	175	CORRIGAN	 --clearing balances or supplemental balances in a context in which the Board makes a determination of whether those supplemental balances are needed. I don't think it was just for monetary policy or even for clearing purposes. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	176	KOHN	 No, I think it was for monetary policy purposes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	177	MELZER	 We had our lawyers look at that and their view was that we can't use that escape hatch right now. I think somebody else ought to check it out, but our view is that it can't be used. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	42.0
199102	178	KOHN	 I think the other point was that we can't reduce the reserve requirements-- say, take them down to 8 percent and then put them back again and pay interest on the difference between 8 and 12 or 14 percent or something like that. There was some protection, I believe, in the [law]. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	179	MULLINS	 If we do see a legislative proposal for interest on required reserves, I'm afraid we'll have a [unintelligible] attached to the bank insurance fund. Peter, you mentioned the three-year auction. How did that go today? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	52.0

199102	185	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. We now move to the chart show, with Messrs. Prell, Promisel, and Slifman. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	186	PRELL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'll be utilizing the chart package that everyone should have. If you haven't found it. you may have another. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	187	PRELL	 We are going to depart today from our past approach. Rather than giving you a complete sector-by-sector recitation of our projection, we are going to try to zero in on some key questions that previous discussions led us to think might be on your minds. The first chart outlines our presentation. I'll start by summarizing the forecasts you gave us; then, I'll say a few words about the war and the budget, and about the credit crunch. Larry Promisel will take the floor next, examining the exchange rate outlook and also the prospects for the oil market. He'll then address the concern a number of you have expressed previously about the consequences for our exports if growth abroad is disappointing. Another question that you've asked previously, namely, what will propel our projected economic upturn, is partially addressed by looking at the external sector, but Larry Slifman will try to give you a more complete answer. He'll also examine the issue of whether we've turned the corner on the core rate of inflation and he'll address the question of how fast the economy can grow without invigorating inflation. I shall then conclude by exploring, through model simulation, the consequences of a substantial Fed easing; this seems even more germane now, given that our assumption that the fed funds rate would remain at 6-3/4 percent already has been violated. So let me get the ball rolling by turning to chart 2, where you'll find the familiar table summarizing your forecasts for 1991. Before I say anything more, I probably should give you a few seconds to look at the figures--and to discern where you stand relative to your colleagues. The central tendencies I've listed encompass the vast majority of you. In case you are curious, the median forecasts were one percent for real GNP, 3-3/4 percent for the CPI, and 6-3/4 percent for the yearend unemployment rate. On this basis, you shared the Administration's view of the real outlook but were more optimistic with respect to inflation. I should note that, despite comments by Administration officials about the scope for further Fed easing, their forecast involves a 3-month bill rate averaging 6.4 percent in 1991, about a half-point above today's level. The staff finds itself with precious little company in its optimism about growth prospects for the year; we're a shade above your median inflation forecast, with that difference being entirely consistent with our lower expected unemployment rate. The lower table summarizes the staff forecast. As you know, we have projected that the recession will end in the next few months and that growth thereafter will be sufficient to push unemployment back down to 6 percent in 1992. Consumer price inflation should slow markedly in the current quarter, owing to the drop in energy prices, but we also see a considerable deceleration in the CPI ex food and energy over the ne::t two years, as a result of the slack in the economy. I perhaps should say a word at this point about how news since last Wednesday's Greenbook publication would alter our expectations. In a nutshell, the latest data suggest to us that activity probably was a little weaker at the start of the year than we estimated. We said in the Greenbook that we thought GNP might decline ìsomewhere between...1 and 2 percentî in the current quarter, and we'd be inclined now to move to the 2 percent end of that range. On the other hand, the 1/2 percent further reduction in the funds rate and the accompanying easing of long rates would seem adequate to roughly offset that negative surprise by the end of the year, and, if maintained, perhaps to put us on a slightly higher path in 1992. All of this really is finer tuning than anyone's forecasting skills would warrant, however, and my basic message is that we still believe the odds favor an early and solid, though not spectacular, upturn in activity--given our conditioning assumptions. One of those assumptions is that fiscal policy will place less restraint on aggregate demand than we previously had anticipated, owing in part to the war. The top panel of chart 3 depicts the change in our projection for defense purchases since the December Greenbook. As you can see, purchases already considerably exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter. Moving the troops and equipment to the Gulf accounted for a good chunk of the outlay, but there are also indications that new supplies were purchased, a portion out of added current United States production. Once the war commenced, we had to make some assumption regarding its length and cost, and about the degree to which the future path of defense purchases would be affected. As indicated, the result was an elevation of the pace of defense purchases by roughly $20 billion, at an annual rate, through next year. As we said in the Greenbook, however, incremental expenditures of the magnitude we've assumed might well involve no expansion of the federal deficits for fiscal 1991 and '92, thanks to the contributions from other countries. Even so, we've raised our projections of the deficits, somewhat, based in part on new information about the costs of other programs, and as the first line of the table shows, we foresee deficits of around $275 billion, plus or minus several billion, this year and next. In economic terms, these deficits greatly overstate the government's absorption of national saving. If you strip out the transfers associated with the deposit insurance programs, the deficits drop under $200 billion, and if you take out other purely financial transactions and make a few more technical adjustments, you get a deficit on a national income accounts basis that moves down to $136 billion in fiscal 1992. That's just a little more than 2 percent of GNP, a low figure, by recent standards. Our fiscal impetus measure, charted in the bottom panel, suggests that, despite the recent additions to our spending projection, the federal government still will be imposing a modicum of restraint on growth in aggregate demand. I'd like to turn now to the question of the credit crunch. This is still a rather murky area, but the ne::t couple of charts contain a few relevant facts. The solid line in the top panel of chart 4 indicates that net funds raised by domestic nonfinancial sectors, measured relative to GNP, decreased substantially after the mid-1980s, but have changed little in the past year and a half. Although the current level of this ratio is low by the standards of the 1970s and the 1980s, it isn't by those of earlier years. There are a whole lot of things going on in this time series. However, it strikes me as interesting that, if one were to shift the date of the onset of the current recession back to sometime in 1989, the recent behavior of the funds-raised ratio would look more similar to previous cyclical patterns. Perhaps not just coincidentally, this would fit with the fact that interest rates peaked in mid-1989, after which there was a period of very slow economic growth. As you know, this recession differs from those in the past in that rates turned down well before the business cycle peak and growth was unusually weak prior to that peak. Even with this time-shift I've suggested, the behavior of depository credit in the current episode would stand out. As indicated by the dashed line, there is no recent precedent for the kind of deceleration in depository credit that we're experiencing. Moreover, in previous recessions sluggishness of depository credit often was clearly importantly related to weak aggregate credit demand or to voluntary shifts by corporate borrowers to the bond markets to fund-out short-term debts. You'll recall that, in our surveys early last year, weak credit demands were cited by bankers as damping loan growth. But with many banks and thrifts obviously capital-constrained, if not out of business entirely, one wonders whether the sharp decline in depository lending isn't signaling a supply-side pressure that is further depressing overall financing volumes and economic activity. There can be no doubt that the sudden loss of intermediation services from depositories--not to mention the problems of insurance companies and other institutions--has adversely affected the cost and availability of credit to ultimate users of funds. Just how seriously is the only real question. One may note, to begin with, that the bulk of the contraction of depository credit is accounted for by the shrinkage of the thrift industry, and the availability of the mortgage-backed securities market has permitted a fairly efficient rechanneling of flows to the home mortgage sector--the S&Ls' primary clientele. Of course, commercial banks did not take up the S&L slack and bank credit has decelerated recently, a swing that looks rather modest by historical standards, but nonetheless a source of concern, especially in terms of the supply of credit to businesses. The middle panel shows a couple of the traditional indexes of strains in the business credit market. The spreads of private short- and long-term rates over Treasuries have widened, but they remain well below previous cyclical peaks; indeed, they've exhibited nothing like the swings we've observed in the past. Of course, what isn't shown here is the junk bond spread, and the effective shut-down of that market clearly made a difference for a significant class of borrowers. But a greater focus of concern in discussions of the credit crunch is the plight of the smaller businesses, which always have been more dependent on loans from banks and other intermediaries. The results of the survey of the National Federation of Independent Business, charted in the lower panel, show a surprisingly mild increase in the past year in the net percent of respondents reporting credit harder to get versus those reporting it easier to obtain. Consistent with one's expectations, however, the swing is much more noticeable among firms in New England, where credit was comparatively easy to come by in the mid-'80s. Indeed, this morning, we got a revised fourth-quarter number and a January figure, which put the New England index around the 1982 peak of 26 percent. The national index for January was 14 percent, versus 13 percent in the fourth quarter. The bottom line would seem to be that, overall, small businesses are suffering, but perhaps not generally to the degree suggested by the outcry we're hearing--or perhaps even as much as they have in other business slumps. This conclusion seems to be supported by the fact that, although it has moved up on the NFIB members' ìsingle most important problemî poll, financing still ranks only sixth, vastly outdistanced by taxes, regulation and poor sales. Whatever the magnitude of the tightening in credit supply conditions to date, we expect that things will get worse before they get better. Some reasons for that conclusion are indicated in chart 5. As shown at the upper left, the rating services have been downgrading corporate securities at an unprecedented clip in the past year, and we see no abatement in the near term, in part because the recession is further eroding already slim interest-coverage ratios, reflected at the right. We expect quality spreads to widen further and, with firms moving down the rating spectrum, this means a double-whammy in their financing costs. Banks are likely to be cautious lenders, too, in this environment. The bottom left panel shows two household loan delinquency series. The message they, and other series, convey is that debt servicing performance among households has been better, but it doesn't look especially bad against the experience of the past 10 or 15 years-- despite the run-up in debt-servicing burdens depicted in the right-hand panel. The delinquency rates only go through the third quarter of last year, however, and we would expect to see some rise in subsequent quarters and some greater degree of caution, as a result, on the part of lenders. Our conclusion on the credit crunch, then, remains what it has been for some time: the strains in the financial sector have been a negative for aggregate demand, and credit quality problems are likely to intensify those strains in the near term; however, we don't think the credit crunch was so severe a negative as to explain the recession or that it will override the other forces that will work to produce an economic upturn. Let me now ask Larry Promisel to carry on the presentation. The final chart presents the results of a ìwhat ifî experiment that your action last week suggests may not be entirely fanciful. Anticipating that there might be considerable scepticism about our relatively rosy Greenbook projection for economic growth, we thought it would be useful to offer you some idea of what it might take to achieve a similar result if the economy were weaker, in terms of underlying demands for goods and services at given interest rates. In scenario 1, we've assumed that the economy, in this sense, is one percent weaker in 1991 and 1992, and that, as a consequence, you ease policy in the near term enough to overcome that greater weakness and to achieve the Greenbook output level by late next year. There are many interest rate paths that might achieve this result; the one we ran through our econometric model is shown in the bottom panel and has the funds rate reaching 5 percent in the next couple of months and then moving back up to 6-3/4 percent by the end of 1992, so as to avoid overshooting. Of course, there is, I hope, at least the possibility that the staff is correct in its more bullish view of aggregate demand. And so we have concocted Scenario 2. Here we assume that we are right about the underlying strength of the economy but that you either don't believe us or feel it appropriate to take out some insurance. You lower the funds rate to 5 percent, only to realize around midyear that the economy actually is as strong as we predicted and so you switch gears to restrain aggregate demand enough to hold real GNP in late 1992 to the Greenbook level. The last line in the bottom panel shows that our model says you would need to jack the funds rate up to around 8 percent by early ne::t year in order to achieve that outcome. Admittedly, these scenarios are quite arbitrary constructs, but they do seem relevant in light of the differences between the staff and FOMC forecasts that I presented earlier. I hope that, in combination with the model simulations presented in the Bluebook, they will at least give you some rough indication of the sensitivity of the economy to your policy decisions. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	188	PROMISEL	 An expectation that United States exports will grow strongly has been an important feature of the staff forecast for some time. Anecdotal evidence, including information reported from many districts in the Beige book, is consistent with a fairly strong outlook for exports; so is the Survey of Purchasing Managers released last Friday. However, as was suggested in Mike's list of questions, what happens with respect to the dollar, oil prices, and foreign demand will play a determining role in the actual outcome. Chart 6 provides some perspective on the dollar. As shown by the black line in the top panel, the price-adjusted exchange value of the dollar has declined significantly -- about 18 percent -- from a peak in mid-1989, with half of that decline coming in the past 6 months. The dollar is now trading around its historic lows, on a weighted-average basis. In broad terms, the dollar's depreciation has corresponded with relative movements in real long-term interest rates. Using one measure of expected inflation, foreign rates in real terms now are higher than they were a year and a half ago, though not as high as they were last fall. In contrast, real rates in the United States are little changed on balance over that whole period, so that the differential has moved against dollar assets by about 1 percentage point. As shown in the middle left panel, the dollar has declined more than 10 percent against European currencies and the yen since the previous chart show, but is little changed against the Canadian dollar and the currencies of Korea and Taiwan. Three-month interest rates -- the middle right panel -- have risen almost a percentage point in Germany and Japan since June, while United States rates have declined -- indeed, by a bit more than is shown in the chart because the full effect of Friday's easing is not reflected there. Long-term rates edged down abroad, though not as much as here. In our forecast, the dollar remains near its recent lows. This assumption is based in part on the view that monetary policy abroad will change little, on balance. If the dollar does follow something like its assumed path -- depicted by the black line in the bottom panel -- it will enhance the competitiveness of United States goods to a degree that is unusual in previous cyclical experience. On average in four previous cycles, beginning in 1969, the dollar had been fairly flat over the 4 quarters preceding the peak of the cycle and rose slightly in subsequent quarters. The extent to which the dollar fell prior to the peak of the present cycle, fell a bit further after the peak, and remains low in the forecast was matched only by the 1973-74 experience. Chart 7 addresses the oil market. I hesitate to say much about oil, given the uncertainties associated with it, but it obviously has the potential to affect significantly the outlook for world activity and inflation. Following the spike in spot prices for West Texas Intermediate -- the red line in the upper panel -- the United States import unit value for oil -- the black line -- rose sharply in the fourth quarter, but we assume it will decline in the current quarter and will settle at $21 per barrel over the remainder of the forecast horizon. This is above the price assumed in last July's chart show, prior to the Iraqi invasion, but is lower than in the December Greenbook. For reference, futures prices, also drawn in the panel, imply a price path somewhat below the staff forecast. A structure of OPEC production that we believe would be consistent with our price path is shown in the middle panel. Essentially, Saudi Arabia is assumed to be able to maintain production at its recent high rates of 8.5 mbd before letting it fall back as Iraqi production gradually, and Kuwaiti production even more gradually, come on stream. Obviously, one could come up with variations on this theme; the controlling premise is that once things settle down in 1992, OPEC, and Saudi Arabia in particular, will adjust production to achieve the $21 per barrel target price agreed upon in the OPEC Accord last July. As implied in the bottom panel, stocks, which were built up as production exceeded consumption in the first half of 1990, will be run down in 1991. With stocks expected to be in reasonable balance in 1992, production next year is set to equal consumption at volumes consistent with a price of $21 per barrel. The next chart addresses the question of foreign growth. Industrial production in the major foreign industrial countries (the G-6) is shown in the top panel. One aspect that is immediately apparent is the divergence of growth performances over the past year. Prominent in the upper left panel is the decline in production last year in Canada and the United Kingdom combined, with the decline starting earlier and extending deeper in Canada. The experience in Canada and the United Kingdom contrasts sharply with that in Japan, where industrial production increased rapidly during 1990. There is widespread expectation of a slowing of activity in Japan, partly in response to monetary tightening that began last spring and partly reflecting presumed effects of declines in prices of equities and land. Indeed, one can point already to some signs of slowing: weak auto sales and housing starts, and rising corporate bankruptcies. But labor markets remain tight and, on balance, the Japanese economy still seems to be strong. Activity in Western Germany -- the upper right panel -- has been boosted by demand associated with unification with Eastern Germany, coming on top of an already strong economy. A declining German trade surplus suggests some spillover of German demand to other countries, but such a spillover is not yet apparent significantly in data for Germany's principal European partners. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that the Bundesbank's actions to tighten policy, even though taken in response to strong demand, have not been welcome elsewhere in Europe. Germany continues to enjoy a good inflation performance, especially relative to the United Kingdom and Italy -- the two middle panels. This inflation differential exacerbates pressures on exchange rates within the European Monetary System; it makes it more difficult for France, Italy, and the United Kingdom to reduce their interest rates, which they might otherwise choose to do. Therefore, as noted in the bottom panel, we expect monetary policy abroad to remain cautious. German interest rates are still assumed to move a bit higher before coming back down later this year and next. Scope for interest rates to decline in other countries is assumed to arise only as inflation rates come down, suggesting little change in real interest rates. In nominal terms, declines in interest rates are likely to be especially large in the United Kingdom and Canada, where monetary policy tightened sooner to bring inflation rates down. We are anticipating that interest rates in Japan will fall gradually as both economic growth and inflation subside. We expect fiscal policy abroad to be essentially neutral on average. In Germany, spending associated with unification will add fiscal stimulus this year but, we think, less next year as other government spending is cut or as taxes are raised. The outlook for activity and prices abroad is shown in Chart 9. As shown by the red bars in the upper left panel, growth of real GNP in the rest of the world, which slowed last year, is forecast to pick up this year and further in 1992. As shown in the upper right panel, this is true both for the G-6 countries and for the rest of the world. With respect to G-6 countries, recoveries from the recessions in the United Kingdom and Canada starting in the second half of this year are an important element in our forecast. We expect that growth will slow somewhat in Germany and Japan but will remain in both countries in the 3.5 to 4 percent range. Inflation rates in major foreign industrial countries, which were boosted last year by the rise in oil prices -- the middle panels -- are forecast to decline. On a fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter basis, consumer prices are forecast to rise next year at about the same rate in G-6 countries as in the United States. We think our forecast for growth of real GNP in other major countries, shown again by the black line in the bottom panel, is reasonably balanced; it does not differ significantly from other forecasts. We see upside risks, including the possibility, which seems to be gaining some acceptance in financial markets, that the Bundesbank will not raise interest rates further and may even lower them, with a corresponding easing of policy constraints elsewhere. However, we recognize that there are downside risks, as well. Some of these are specific to individual countries. Other risks, like greater disruptions in the oil market, adverse effects from problems in real estate or financial markets, or weaker outcomes in Eastern Europe -- are common to many countries, albeit to varying degrees. To provide a feel for the sensitivity of United States exports to these downside risks, the dashed red line presents an alternative, more pessimistic, outlook for growth in major foreign countries. The level of real GNP at the end of the forecast period is about 2 percent lower on average in this alternative than in the Greenbook forecast, with some variation across countries. I will describe the simulated effects of lower foreign growth on United States exports in a moment. The Greenbook forecast for exports is shown in the upper panels of the next chart. The quantity of non-agricultural exports was flat in the middle quarters of last year, following a spurt early in the year. Nevertheless, strong growth again in the fourth quarter boosted growth over the year to 10 percent. We are forecasting that exports will continue to grow at a rate of about 10 percent over the next two years, supported by recent gains in United States price competitiveness and the projected pickup in growth abroad. Agricultural exports -- the middle panels -- also were weak in the middle quarters of 1990 and, indeed, for the year as a whole. We are forecasting that, after sales of grain to the Soviet Union and China boost shipments in the first half of this year, agricultural exports will change little over the remainder of the forecast horizon. The implications for exports of the alternative scenario for growth in major foreign countries are shown in the bottom panels. The difference in growth between the Greenbook and that alternative is especially great for Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, which together account for a 40 percent share of United States exports. We did not assume significantly different growth in countries other than the G-6, which purchase half of our exports. By the end of the forecast period -- shown at the bottom right -- the quantity of exports of goods and services combined would be about $15 billion (or 2 percent) lower with the alternative path than in the Greenbook. Some of the contractionary effect from lower exports would be absorbed by lower imports, so that net exports would be only $9 billion lower. In this simulation, we held United States money growth to the baseline path. While exports are seen as a crucial element in the overall outlook, imports obviously are important too. As shown in the top panel of Chart 11, the quantity of non-oil imports is forecast to rise only 2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 1991. We expect the decline in the dollar that has occurred to date to give a further boost to United States activity by shifting demand away from imports toward domestic production. The slow growth of imports also reflects the weakness of United States aggregate demand, and to that extent, of course, cannot be said to boost domestic activity. In 1992, as United States demand picks up and the effects of the decline in the dollar wear off, the quantity of non-oil imports is forecast to rise more rapidly. The quantity of oil imports, shown in the middle panel, fell in the fourth quarter of last year, because of the decline in activity, warm weather, and a shutdown of some refineries for maintenance. The value, of course, rose sharply with the jump in prices. A withdrawal from the strategic petroleum reserve will restrain imports in the current quarter, after which the quantity of oil imports is expected to grow over time as consumption increases and as domestic production continues to trend down. In nominal terms, as shown in the bottom left panel, United States external balances are forecast to continue to improve over the forecast period. The current account -- the black bars -- is forecast to improve more rapidly than the merchandise trade account, reaching a deficit of only $33 billion in 1992. The faster improvement in the current account reflects, in part, a further increase in net receipts for a variety of services. The relative improvement in the current account also reflects the cash transfers the United States expects to receive from other countries in connection with the financing of the war in the Persian Gulf, which are counted in the current account but not in GNP; these are assumed to equal $20 billion in both 1991 and 1992. In real terms -- the bottom right panel -- we are forecasting that exports of goods and services will grow more rapidly than imports. As a result, net exports (in 1982 dollars) will continue to improve, adding $29 billion to GNP (or nearly 3/4 percent) over the course of this year, and another $17 billion over the course of 1992. Larry Slifman will continue our presentation. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	189	SLIFMAN	 Let me continue with the staff GNP projection and the question: ìWhat will bring about an economic upturn?î Chart 12 highlights a key element in our assessment of the outlook--that is, the inventory situation and the balance between production and aggregate demand. The upper panel shows real GNP--the heavy line--and real final sales. The area between the two lines is inventory investment--with periods of liquidation indicated by the shaded portions. As can be seen, producers moved aggressively in the fourth quarter to hold inventories in check, cutting output while final sales were essentially flat. These pre-emptive production adjustments had the desired effect. As shown in the bottom panel, the inventory-sales ratio for all nonfarm businesses--already quite low by historical standards--is estimated to have fallen further in the fourth quarter. You can see from the insert panel that we expect final sales to fall at about a 1-1/4 percent pace in the first quarter. However, we think that producers will continue to cut output even faster, thereby pushing the inventory-sales ratio even lower. With inventories relatively lean, a firming in final sales beginning in the second quarter should be translated promptly into higher production. Indeed, for a few quarters, we expect output to grow faster than sales as producers swing from inventory liquidation to a modest rate of accumulation. Your ne::t chart highlights the sources of the upturn in final sales that we expect will begin in the spring. The lower portion of the table shows contributions to real GNP growth--measured in percentage points. We project that real final sales--line 2--will account for 1.7 percentage points of the growth in real GNP during the second quarter. As Larry just explained, foreign demand for United States goods should provide important support to domestic production. Among the components of private domestic final purchases, lines 7 through 9, we are projecting a resumption of consumption growth that is quite modest compared with previous cyclical recoveries, and a halt to the slide in residential construction activity. Because of the critical role of consumption and housing in our projected upturn, the next chart highlights some of the elements that went into our thinking about these two sectors. The sharp rise in oil prices and a heightened sense of uncertainty in the aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait, combined with rising joblessness and pervasive fears about recession and financial fragility, dealt a blow late last year to consumer sentiment--the upper left panel--and consumer spending, and likely will depress consumption in the current quarter as well. But consumer outlays, especially for big-ticket items, had been subdued for some time prior to the Iraqi invasion. As shown in the upper right panel, demand pent up during the long, deep 1982 recession led to an extraordinary surge in sales of autos and light trucks in the mid-1980s. Thus, as we have noted before, the slowdown in sales that began in the second half of 1989 probably represents, at least to an extent, a stock adjustment. As shown in the middle left panel, a similar pattern occurred for other types of durable goods--VCR's, household furnishings, jewelry, and so forth--as spending growth during the mid-1980s far exceeded real income gains (the middle right panel). Then, while consumers were catching their breath after the 1980s spending spree and increasing their saving, real income in the last part of 1990 took a hit from the oil price shock, further depressing demand. Looking forward, we expect a recovery in consumption to begin sometime this spring, although we think it will be quite moderate, with the saving rate remaining elevated. The pickup in spending reflects several factors. Perhaps most important, the drop in consumer energy prices since the November peak, which began to affect real income in December, will boost real DPI further in the first half of 1991, giving households the wherewithal to spend more. In addition, with the assumed ending of hostilities in the Gulf, we anticipate that some of the uncertainties currently depressing consumer sentiment will be eliminated, and household willingness to spend will rise. Finally, with spending having been depressed during 1990, we think households will have some pent up desire to spend. Another influence on the projected upturn is a bottoming out of the housing market. A key element in that projection is affordability. As shown in the bottom panel, the declines in mortgage rates over the past two years and the softness in house prices have combined to ease the cash-flow burden of homeownership since mid-1989. Although lower house prices are a two-edged sword, we think that their positive influence on affordability will outweigh their negative influence on investment motives for home-buying. In this regard, we view the recent rise in sales of existing homes as suggesting that prices may have reached levels acceptable to both potential buyers and sellers, which, if correct, might signal a bottoming out of the real estate slump. Nonetheless, housing clearly is a risky sector in our projection, especially in light of the possibility of continued constraints on builder financing. One encouraging note, however, is that--despite reports for more than a year now of cutbacks in loans for land acquisition and development--a recent survey by the homebuilders association suggests that builders still have an ample inventory of finished and unfinished lots. On balance, then, we expect the projected economic upturn in the second quarter to be brought about by relatively strong growth of exports, a resumption of growth in household spending, and an end to the housing slide, accompanied by a swing in inventory investment. Your next chart addresses the question, ìHave we turned the corner toward lower core inflation?î One key element, of course, is the behavior of wages--the subject of the upper panel. In this chart, we have split the employment cost index into two components--sales workers (the striped bars) and other private industry workers (the shaded bars). The reason is that commissions are an important part of the compensation of many sales workers. Thus, changes in the ECI for sales workers appear to be quite sensitive to changes in activity or unemployment, while changes in compensation for non-sales workers appear more sensitive to the level of activity or unemployment. This was quite clear in 1990, when the unemployment rate averaged 5-1/2 percent--about equal to our point estimate of the natural rate; for the year as a whole, compensation for non-sales workers rose at about the same pace as in 1988 and 1989, while the ECI for sales workers slowed sharply as real estate transactions were falling and other sales were sluggish. With the unemployment rate projected to peak at nearly 6-1/2 percent in the second quarter, and then level off at about 6 percent during 1992, we expect slack demand to put downward pressure on compensation of non-sales workers over the course of the next two years. During the first half of this year, compensation of sales workers is projected to hold down the overall ECI; but as the economy begins to recover, we expect rising commissions to restrain the deceleration in total employment costs a bit. The deceleration of wages, along with a relatively mild expansion of activity that is not expected to create any bottlenecks, shortages, or capacity constraints, leads us to project a slowing in the core inflation rate--proxied in the bottom panel by CPI's excluding food and energy. Much of the slowing is in the services component, the shaded bars, which had been accelerating through much of 1990. Prices of consumer commodities other than food and energy are projected to pick up in 1991, in part because of this January's hike in excise taxes as well as the pass-through of the lower value of the dollar to prices of imported goods. But an underlying deceleration becomes evident in the latter part of this year and throughout 1992. As I just indicated, the inflation projection depends critically on our expectation that the economy will continue to have some slack in resource utilization over the next two years. The staff report on the outlook for potential GNP that we sent to you last week addresses the supply side of this issue in detail. Chart 16 summarizes the results of the report in the context of the latest Greenbook GNP projection. Our analysis suggests that the growth rate of potential GNP averaged 2.6 percent during the 1980s, and that the pace probably has slowed a bit recently. Through the middle of the 1990s, we are projecting potential to rise 2.3 percent per year. As shown on line 3, part of the projected slowing between the 1980s and 1990s is simply a matter of demographics--there will be fewer people reaching the age of 16. More difficult to forecast is the behavior of the participation rate (line 4)--especially in light of the drop over the past year. Sorting out the trend, cycle, and random components of the recent numbers is hazardous at best, but it appears to us that most of the shortfall reflects cyclical or random elements, and we expect the underlying trend during the first half of the 1990s to slow only by a tenth of a percentage point. At the same time, we are projecting a small pickup in the growth of labor productivity (line 8). Given the wide swings over the past three decades in the residual component of productivity (line 15), our forecast of trend productivity also has a great deal of risk. The bottom panel shows our estimates of the levels of actual and potential GNP. As explained in the report, our central forecast of the projected level of potential is consistent with a 5.6 percent natural rate of unemployment. This, too, has a wide band of uncertainty. The shaded area takes into account some of our uncertainties about both the current level and the projected growth rate of potential. In any event, you can see that even using the lower bound of this uncertainty band, the level of real GNP is projected to remain slightly below potential at the end of 1992. This, of course, suggests the possibility for further progress in reducing inflation in 1993. Mike will now complete our presentation. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	190	GREENSPAN	 Questions for our colleagues? ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	191	PARRY	 First, I'd like to say that the presentation was very useful--particularly the last exercise, which was quite helpful. I'd like to press a bit more on this issue of the credit crunch. I think I understand how you characterized its impact but I wonder if you would do it somewhat differently. If you were to look at the causes of recession, such as higher oil prices, war, consumer confidence, or--as some outside this room might say--monetary policy, etc.. where would you in an ordinal sense put the credit crunch? How would you characterize it--as small, as the top cause, or as the bottom one? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199102	192	PRELL	 Well, I think the credit crunch was already at work prior to the downturn. As you know, we've discussed that over the course of the past year and we would characterize this in some nonquantitative way as a significant but not huge effect. If one could somehow embody this in GNP growth terms, it probably would be less than a percentage point--maybe much less than that. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	193	PARRY	 Some rather to these other-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199102	194	PRELL	 By our reckoning, the oil price shock--just the direct normal type of oil price change that we run through econometric models--would have had a larger effect as of the end of last year. We think during this recent period that [other factors had] a much larger effect than oil prices. Certainly at this point we ought to be seeing a turnaround in terms of the oil price effect and we'll be seeing what other things are in train. The even greater unknown in all of this is [what] psychological damage was done by the oil price change, which probably summoned up in people's minds recollections of a couple of earlier major shocks that were followed by recessions. I suspect that it created in many people's minds the specter of rising unemployment and so on. There also was the war aspect of the situation, which may not have been a very positive factor in people's thinking, though I must say historically--for example, in the Viet Nam war--it's not entirely clear that people become grossly negative in their expectations and their sentiment as there is an increase in military activity. But my sense is that that has not been a big plus for sentiment. And we had last fall this debacle over the budget. If we all think back to that period, we'll remember what an appalling spectacle that was; and it probably had at least in the short run a rather devastating effect on people's assessment of whether the government here in Washington really had a handle on economic affairs. I haven't seen any concrete evidence that this financial fragility and the failures of banks and so on stand out as factors in people's thinking; but I think it has to be a negative, too, for consumer sentiment. On top of all this, we've had fiscal restraint of a modest degree in train for a while. These things cumulate to a very considerable damping effect at least on economic growth. And with the oil price change and the war I think it put us into negative territory. That's my crude [analysis]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	195	GREENSPAN	 Bob Forrestal. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	196	FORRESTAL	 Well, I too, would like to compliment the staff on a very good chart show. They're always good, but this one was particularly helpful. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
199102	197	GREENSPAN	 It was really quite innovative, I think. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	198	FORRESTAL	 Very innovative, yes. I might ask a question about the alternative export forecast: If that turned out to be the case, how much would that shave off your real GNP forecast? Would it be a substantial decline? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
199102	199	PROMISEL	 Well, at $15 billion, if you take the $9 billion out of net exports it is something on the order of- - 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	200	PRELL	 It's something under 1/4 percent [on] real GNP. But, as Larry pointed out, that was on the assumption that you stick to a previously assumed monetary expansion path. If you wanted to offset that, you would raise money stock growth and let interest rates fall and you would have some offsets through exchange rates and effects on the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. So, it would not be such a large shock and not at all difficult to offset through a moderate policy adjustment if you saw it coming. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	201	GREENSPAN	 Other questions? Bob. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	202	MCTEER	 I guess the most striking thing about the real GNP forecast was the abrupt turnaround from the current quarter to the next quarter. I notice from your Chart 13 that over 1/3 of it is inventory investment and, since that happens again in the next quarter, I assume that's intended inventory investment rather than involuntary. What makes you think that inventory investment is going to be so strong in the next three quarters? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	53.0
199102	203	SLIFMAN	 First, it turns out that in the second quarter itself we still actually have some liquidation going on but the rate of liquidation is slower than in the first quarter, so in a GNP accounting sense it shows up as a positive number here. We do, however, start to get some accumulation beginning in the second half of the year. But the amounts of accumulation are very, very small in dollar terms. Again, it's because of these swings from rapid liquidation to slower liquidation to a small accumulation that in GNP terms that winds up adding to real GNP. That is really what I was trying to show on the preceding chart, Chart 12, where you can see that even during part of that projection period we still have GNP below final sales and then it rises just very gradually. We think it's a very modest amount of inventory accumulation that takes place; in fact, the inventory/sales ratio that's consistent with this actually falls for a while and then basically just flattens out at these historically low levels. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	204	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	205	CORRIGAN	 Mike, several people have commented on the chart show, which really was first-rate, but let me just add to that. I thought the paper that you circulated on potential GNP, etc., was absolutely marvelous. I don't know what your practices are about publishing those kinds of things but I would hope it would be published. It's really an excellent piece of work. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199102	206	PRELL	 Thank you. We haven't really thought about publication but we'll have to give it some thought. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	207	CORRIGAN	 It really is, as I said, an absolutely first-rate piece of work. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199102	208	GREENSPAN	 Dick Syron. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	209	SYRON	 Mike, just a question, going back to what Bob asked. Though it's not enormous, the swing in the impact of government [spending] in the second quarter is 0.3. How much of that is state and local and how much is federal? It may be reflecting what we see all the time but I'm becoming more and more bearish on the state and local [sector]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	210	SLIFMAN	 Actually, it's a very small amount, as you can see. In terms of our forecast we see it basically all coming from state and local purchases. But they're very small; they're growing 0.3 percent, which is a very small number. The federal net real purchases are falling. What we really have in terms of the state and local sector is some construction going on but not very much. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	211	SYRON	 But the 3/10ths might be just GNP? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	212	SLIFMAN	 Right. And it turns out that that also happens to be the growth rate as well. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	213	SYRON	 Okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	214	SLIFMAN	 They happen to match up in that one instance. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	215	PRELL	 Are you referring to the second quarter? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	216	SYRON	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	217	PRELL	 Well, in the second quarter there's actually a little uptick in federal spending, but it's only 2-1/2 percent. But your point on state and local [spending] is well taken. In fact, we've lowered our projection of state and local real purchases in this forecast and we only have a 1/2 percent increase this year, which assumes probably some decline in construction spending--an area that really had been surprisingly strong through last year. We've been surprised on the up side fairly frequently over the past year or so that this apparent fiscal problem has not shown through on spending. Obviously, on some of it there's a lag. They sold bonds earlier and are going to go ahead with some of these infrastructure investments. But we expect that there will be some crunch there; obviously, a number of you are familiar with rather dire situations in your locales. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	218	SYRON	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	219	GREENSPAN	 Bob Black. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	220	BLACK	 I have a question to which probably everybody except me knows the answer on Chart 3. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
199102	221	PRELL	 That's promising; that's my kind of question! 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	222	BLACK	 This is shown as a percent of real federal purchases. What is the fiscal impetus there? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
199102	223	PRELL	 I'd be happy to send you a descriptive memo, but it's a measure we developed that unlike the high [employment] budget ﻿ surplus--which you know is a measure of discretionary fiscal policy-- basically rates various components of the budget according to their impact on aggregate demand as revealed by econometric relations. It strips out some of the trend elements and gets rid of some of the one¬ time sorts of financial effects that at times distort the high employment budget. For example, in the high employment budget currently those contributions from foreign countries would show up in the normal calculation as additional revenues and greater fiscal restraint. And it's somewhat counter to [logic] to think that if somebody else pays for it instead of having to pay for it ourselves that that's additional restraint on aggregate demand. So, this measure doesn't include that sort of thing. And we think it's probably a better way of capturing things. We've run this in terms of horse races against other measures of fiscal policy in determining GNP and this seems to work better. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	224	BLACK	 Yes, I would be interested in seeing your memo. I'm sorry I was the only one who didn't understand. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
199102	225	PRELL	 I hesitate at times to use this because I know it's a more obscure measure, but I thought that under the circumstances - - 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	226	BLACK	 I was just curious. I was trying to figure out what it could be and I couldn't come up with anything. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
199102	227	MULLINS	 It's a way to characterize a $300 billion budget [deficit] as fiscal restraint. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	52.0
199102	228	PRELL	 Clearly, there was a package of cuts in expenditures and hikes in revenues enacted last year and that's the basic process that's going on here. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	229	GREENSPAN	 Lee Hoskins. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	230	HOSKINS	 I, too, want to compliment the staff on its professionalism and objectivity in presenting this very interesting report. I have one question with respect to the longer-term averages that you present here. A naive and uninitiated person--nobody at this table, of course-- could read this as saying that with the baseline [policy] we will average 2-1/4 percent [real growth] for 5 years and if we have an easier monetary policy, a pro-inflation policy, we will average 2.6 percent. So, over long periods of time it looks like if we have a pro-inflation policy or rapid money growth, we'll have higher rates of real growth. And that simply doesn't seem to [happen] over the longer periods of time. I presume your answer is that 5 years isn't [a long] enough time period. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	231	PRELL	 A different way to look at it is that there's an aggregate supply function out there and an aggregate demand function. If monetary policy keeps pushing the growth of aggregate demand out there faster than aggregate supply will support, we're going to end up with accelerating inflation. And that's the message that this is intended to convey. There will be a lot of dynamics over a period of time if we are right and you kept pressing against that. But that's, I think, the interpretation of this data. Obviously, there are significant uncertainties, and I think we underscored this in the report. Larry's reason for presenting the band on it was to suggest ﻿ that on a statistical basis 2.6 percent is almost as good an estimate as 2.3 percent. Where the issue arises is if you take the more optimistic view, say, of the Administration and you're talking about 3 percent plus [real growth]. That begins to press pretty hard against our confidence intervals here; that's stretching it. But there are lots of assumptions made about the future in this and this is just our best guesstimate--as careful an analysis as we could do. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	232	HOSKINS	 If you were to run your model with expectations of some degree of credibility or full credibility, would you expect to get the same results? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	233	PRELL	 I don't think credibility would be-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	234	KOHN	 Are you referencing the Bluebook? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	235	HOSKINS	 Yes, the one that has the five-year average. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	236	KOHN	 Right. It's our view, which we expressed in the Bluebook, that we could get either the [unintelligible]. However, if [the Federal Reserve] had some credibility, we think the tighter alternative would give you some combination of higher output and lower inflation than presented here. These simulations embodied entirely backward-looking expectations. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	237	HOSKINS	 Built on the 2.3 and 2.6 percent projections for- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	238	KOHN	 I think that's also noteworthy with respect to your observation about real GNP over this time. In some sense it helps that we've started above the assumed natural rate so that you can push the economy for a little while. It's a bit like Mike's alternative simulation. Inflation takes a while to begin picking up because we don't drop below the natural rate for a time. So, in some sense this was a favorable starting point for a more expansive policy. But you'll note that when we get out to 1995 finally, we do have lower growth in output; it's a little higher level of output and we do have a soaring inflation. At some point, presumably, the Fed would have to [rein that inflation] in. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	239	PRELL	 And the same point is made simply in our Greenbook forecast: in essence that over the next seven quarters after this one the economy is growing at a rate clearly above our estimate. But it's an environment of decelerating prices because we're above the natural rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199102	240	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions? If not, why don't we take a coffee break and come back and do the tour de table. [Coffee break] 	2	2	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	241	GREENSPAN	 Who would like to start the round table? Bob. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	242	PARRY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy continues to blend recessionary problems in California with robust growth in the rest of the region. The California economy continues to experience weakness similar to that of the rest of the ﻿ nation, although some data indicate that conditions may be improving. Employment in January registered a 1.1 percent decline from a year earlier, with weakness reported in durable goods manufacturing, construction, and retail. Agriculture has suffered at least $1 billion in crop losses because of the freeze and it looks as though there could be significantly greater damage if the water cuts actually take effect as a result of the very serious drought. The remainder of the District states continue to report relatively strong growth. Outside California, employment in the past year has grown 3.3 percent. Individual state growth rates range from a low of 2.3 percent in Hawaii to 6 percent in Nevada. But Hawaii is a very interesting situation. They're not growing because they don't have a growing labor force; they have an unemployment rate of only 2.8 percent. Despite relatively sluggish retail sales, trade employment still has grown 3.2 percent in the rest of the District. And employment in services has grown a solid 5 percent. I have two interesting vignettes about the effect of the war on the economy. who is a very large retailer with stores predominantly in the West but also on the East Coast. He said that they didn't have the best Christmas but that sales really started to pick up right after Christmas and then just went down the tank on the 16th of January. I called him last Friday and he said that sales have started to come back a bit, so apparently there must have been a very quick reaction, probably because people were watching their televisions. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0

199102	244	PARRY	 The other vignette is from He said that the Prime Minister of Japan made a speech about the inappropriateness of people vacationing if they are draft age males; it wouldn't look good to the rest of the world. And in the week after the speech there were 2,000 cancellations [by Japanese tourists] of reservations in Hawaii, each one of whom typically goes for 4 or 5 days and spends $500 per person as opposed to $125 spent by United States tourists. I just thought those stories were rather interesting. If I can turn to the national outlook, we are expecting a short recession and a moderately strong recovery, assuming that the war in the Gulf is over by spring and oil prices remain low. Our forecast, as it turns out, is very similar to that of the Greenbook. And we do expect the inflation rate to come down to about 4 percent or a little lower both this year and next. However, I'd like to add that to prevent a subsequent rise in inflation, it seems that we're going to have to respond to the economic recovery by tightening policy in a timely fashion, which of course is assumed in the Greenbook forecast, just as we've recently eased policy to prevent a deep recession. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199102	245	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	246	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, starting with a comment about the national economy: Our forecast is considerably more modest than Mike's rosy scenario. But I am pleased that our forecast is comfortably included within the central tendency. We have a couple of particular differences: First, and this really relates to the Greenbook, we expect a pretty significant reduction in consumer durables in the second quarter rather than a very large pickup. That ﻿ difference probably relates to the automotive sector, which seems to us to be very much on the optimistic side in the staff forecast. I'll make a comment or two about the automotive sector in just a moment. The second significant area of difference is on the export side. Our expectation for import growth is a bit more modest than the Board staff's, but the difference is more particularly on the export side; we just don't think that exports are likely to grow to quite the level that the Board staff shows in their forecast. And that really accounts for the differences in their forecast and ours. Turning now to the District: As I have been reporting, the District really is doing quite well compared to other parts of the country but we are now catching up. Clearly, a shift is taking place; certainly, more and more within the recent couple of weeks, our region is taking on the aspects of a fairly classic manufacturing recession. So far it's mainly auto-related. The Middle East events have resulted in an almost total shift in attitudes with regard to the outlook in that sector. At this point it's very hard for automakers to keep any semblance of a normal production schedule. Normally, they set their production schedules pretty far in advance. But now they are meeting frequently--about weekly--and the tendency is to reduce production week-in and week-out. As a result of significantly reduced retail sales, dealer inventory is building up in terms of the number of days stock on hand. And, therefore, the dealers' attitudes are just terrible and dealer orders have been cut back substantially. [Their sales] are running at about 50 percent of last fall's levels, and last fall was pretty weak to start with, particularly if you take out the fleet aspect of that. So, the dealer orders from the manufacturers are very, very low. Employment levels and production schedules have been reduced substantially and at least one company that I talked to would expect that production this quarter will be down 11 percent from last year, which was not in itself a strong period. They would further expect that the risks are on the down side with respect to incoming orders, and it's entirely possible that their production in the first quarter will come in 24 percent below last year. As they add their production and the production for the other manufacturers together they would expect that this would have a negative impact on the first quarter GNP by about 1 percentage point. It's far too early to tell what is going to happen to auto production in the second quarter, but certainly it's going to be down compared to last year. And as you would expect, [the impact of] autos is now moving into the supplier community and the suppliers are seeing very, very sharp curtailments of purchases. That's the bad news. There is some better news. The steel business--and I found this surprising--is quite good. The orders are continuing to come in at reasonably good levels and firms are operating currently at a level of about 83 percent of capacity. The current estimate for shipments this year is 81 million tons. That's down from 85 million tons last year but is still a pretty good year, at least as they see it now. And I think, encouragingly, they are exporting steel at pretty good levels even to Japan. I do think the steel industry is one where the competitive aspects have improved very substantially just in going through the last three or four years. Machine tool orders are surprisingly strong; some of that goes into the auto sector. There will be substantial retooling in the auto sector as they come up with some new models over the next year or two, so that has been strong. Agricultural equipment certainly is going to ﻿ be down; they have cut production substantially in this quarter but not nearly as much as the auto sector. The production plans for the remainder of the year are expected to be down about 12 percent. I end up with a comment--an anecdote really--on retail sales not unlike Bob Parry's. I talked with a guy who runs a specialty chain store that has operations all over the country. They had a good year last year and a good Christmas season. But as of January 15th there was just a complete shutdown of retail sales, unlike anything he had experienced in his life,. He mentioned one story about a conversation with one of their salesmen he had seen when he was in New England. The salesman had just completed the sale of a large couch to somebody. As they were completing the paperwork, the buyer was just filled with apologies that she was buying the couch. She made the point that she thought it was a bad time; she was embarrassed to be making a purchase at this particular time but the family desperately needed a couch to sit on and that's why they were doing it. He suggested this is symptomatic of the attitudes that people have; they are quite worked up about this [war in the Gulf]. And as a consequence, his retail stores are really quite void of people. He doesn't think this will be a continuing effect, but for now it has had a very significant impact on their sales. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0

199102	248	FORRESTAL	 Starting with the District, Mr. Chairman, conditions in the Sixth District remain weak, although it does seem that the earlier deterioration is ending. The unemployment rate is averaging higher than in the rest of the country and we think it's going to continue to be that way for some time. The export sector is doing fairly well, although we've noticed that we've lost exports from the Sixth District to the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf in recent months. That reflects some agricultural products, particularly rice. And I was very surprised to find that we're losing the sale of carpets to Saudi Arabia. I didn't realize we were selling carpets there, but apparently it has been a big factor. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0

199102	251	BLACK	 They're not Persian carpets, are they? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
199102	252	FORRESTAL	 Obviously not. The energy sector seems to have softened somewhat after it became pretty clear that increased OPEC production and heavy inventories would keep prices down. And the District's [energy] producers are still seeing quite a heavy shortage of skilled workers, as we have talked about before. The rig count in Louisiana was down 9 percent from a year earlier and the offshore count was 7 percent lower. Even though the data we have continue to be uniformly negative, I would say, based on the contacts that I've had personally and that our staff has had, that there seems to be a little less pessimism about the situation, even with the war in the Persian Gulf. People are convinced, I think, that the steady deterioration has slowed up if not stopped. And bankers are seeing a bit more light in terms of the demand for funds. As a result of all this, we are looking for a somewhat better situation in the District, ﻿ although in my view the recovery in the Southeast as well as in the nation is still pretty fragile. Looking at the national economy, our forecast is quite similar to the Greenbook forecast but it is weaker. We show a somewhat smaller decline in the present quarter but the rebound over the rest of the year is not quite as robust. One of the differences that we have--and this has been alluded to by someone else--is that we don't see as much of a contribution coming from the export sector. It seems to us that the improvements in net exports are not going to be quite as strong [as in the staff forecast]. As a result of this lower growth rate than the Greenbook, we obviously see a higher unemployment rate toward the end of 1991. But our estimate of inflation is somewhat better--in fact quite a bit better--than the Greenbook. We are anticipating inflation, measured by the CPI, of about 3 percent; looking at the chart, I think we're at the low end of the forecasts. These forecasts, of course--both the Greenbook, I assume, as well as ours--did not take into account the easing action of last Friday. So, if you look at those forecasts in that light, perhaps they represent a worst-case scenario. But I'm not convinced that that's the case. It seems to me that the recession could last somewhat longer and be a bit deeper than we're forecasting. Both our forecast and the Greenbook forecast seem to me to be quite reasonable. But I think the uncertainty surrounding the general economic situation and the situation of the Persian Gulf threatens any potential rebound in consumer confidence and consumer spending. The deterioration of public confidence or the lack of confidence in the banking system also is going to be a major factor. The credit crunch perhaps is not getting any worse, but the announcements that keep coming forth from the press and on the talk shows about weak bank earnings and the potential FDIC losses and a deficit in the FDIC are really quite adversely affecting sentiment and raising considerable concern about the public costs of dealing with these problems. And the rise of bankruptcies may be working in the same direction. My point is that even though I believe the Greenbook forecast is a reasonable one, although a bit rosy, I think the risk is still very much on the down side. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
199102	253	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	254	BOEHNE	 In the District, weakness is widespread. I suspect we have several more months of downturn, with the beginning of the recovery more a second-half phenomenon than a second-quarter one. Attitudes are really very, very cautious both among business people and individuals. And we see bank assets continuing to slide, with a couple of banks close to the edge. Real estate is probably several years away from recovery, especially on the commercial side. In the nation, I think the staff forecast, while well thought out, is on the rosy side. We can't be very sure of any forecast at this point. I think we just need to keep an open mind and stay alert to incoming information. I'd rather err on the side of too much stimulus at this point rather than too little because I think the costs of misjudging and having a prolonged and deep recession are very [high]. Having said that, I think we have to be prepared to offset it with some tightening at some point. But we simply can't afford to ﻿ have a prolonged, deep recession, given what is going on in the financial system. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
199102	255	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	256	SYRON	 Actually, Ed Boehne and others have said much of what I wanted to say. In terms of the situation in New England, unfortunately, I don't think one can characterize it any other way than as dismal, with pessimism on the edge of panic. At this point there really is no source of strength with the possible exception of Patriot missiles for which Raytheon is running three shifts a day, seven days a week. When people turn on CNN there is almost a perverse desire to see another one go up because it means more production! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199102	257	SEGER	 How many people do they employ? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
199102	258	SYRON	" About 2.000 in that particular facility. There is some export strength. As for employment, though we started at a substantially lower unemployment rate and a higher per capital income [unintelligible] the 1973-75 recession years, the decline in employment we're seeing in New England now is at a substantially faster rate than at any time in the postwar period. That also holds true for the change in growth in personal income. This is having the impact you'd expect. Retailing is extremely soft; we're seeing very widespread discounting of all merchandise. When we talk to retailers they say: ""Once this inventory is gone we are not building any inventories. We're tired of doing this."" Actually, that may be somewhat favorable in the longer term. We're seeing a change in the composition of the retail outlets, even in fairly affluent neighborhoods, more toward discount stores. Tonier places are closing and there are more vacancies. And we are seeing price improvements going along with this. As you have all read, we have an extraordinary degree of financial nervousness. It's to the extent that on the talk shows every morning as you're driving in you can dial up and get the Tracy Report and for $20, which you can charge to your Mastercharge, you will be sent a list of safe Swiss banks where they say you should be sure that you have some of your money. We've shipped out close to $400 million in the last several weeks in emergency cash payments [because of] runs in Rhode Island. People are calling in to question the safety of the FDIC. There are some real concerns about our larger institutions. and some other mutual funds and insurance companies are raising questions with us about how they can be sure that they'll be protected if they have a fail in a repo transaction during the day and it goes into overnight or if they send in funds in anticipation of funds in an ACH transfer and an institution is closed. In fact they have come with proposals to have that stuff essentially swept off the bank's books onto our books overnight. The surprising thing is that the banks are so panicked about it that large institutions have come to us and asked if we can do this. I think the only way to look at the economy is that we have a long way [to come] back. A friend of mine just did a real estate forecast which is being hailed as greatly optimistic because he shows the beginning of some bottoming out and a snapback in 1995. Compared to a lot of other people's forecasts, actually it is relatively optimistic. The recovery there is going to be quite slow. ﻿ As far as the national economy goes, it seems to me that an awful lot has to do with what happens to confidence. Mike I think pulled everyone's line and appropriately so by saying ""rosy scenario."" I have been inclined, as have others, to accuse the forecast of being somewhat rosy. But in particular I think the simulations that Mike showed at the end are very useful in dealing with that. So much depends on confidence. No one knows how long the war is going to last. My own naive view of this was that if we had a sort of Nintendo war that was over in a week, there might be some great exuberance and people would feel like they should go out and spend. But even if this war goes on for several more weeks or a couple of months, I don't see it leading to a great bounceback in consumer confidence. As far as the oil price impact on confidence, relatively recently we've seen some improvement in oil prices. And I do have to admit that I bought the credit crunch story late in New England and now have to eat crow with a lot of people and admit that they were right. I think the chart you showed was very useful but we're not at the high point nationally in terms of where we'd be [with respect to] a credit crunch number. All those things weigh a little on the down side, so I'm inclined to think that the forecast may be slightly or a little more than slightly optimistic. But if that's the situation, as I say, I think the simulations or the scenarios that were shown at the end [of the chart show] are the way to go. Because of my own, perhaps biased, concerns about financial fragility, I'd be prepared to take out some insurance now with the notion that we would, as Ed said, make a commitment that we'd be willing to turn quickly if we're wrong and we don't need it.

199102	259	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	260	STERN	 Well, I was hoping I wouldn't follow Dick because I don't have any colorful adjectives to use to describe the District economy! I guess I would have to say it's mixed. The rural areas, because of the importance of agriculture, continue to do reasonably well. One exception is the areas where wood products are important. It took a little longer to hit them than I might have thought, but clearly because of the weakness in housing that sector has deteriorated. On the other hand, in the Twin Cities there is a lot of concern about many of the issues we've already touched on this afternoon. And while the objective measures of economic activity are still reasonably good, there are lots of signs of at least imminent softness in the economy. With regard to the war, I haven't been able to judge what it has meant psychologically. There are a couple of objective things. Some of the large corporations have either eliminated or severely curtailed foreign travel as a consequence of the war. On the other hand, some of the firms that clearly have military business said their orders have just taken off. There is no question about that. The response has been large and very quick, and they, of course, are quite positive. With regard to the national economy, like many others. I guess I'm not as confident as the staff about the recovery occurring quite as quickly and quite as robustly as the Greenbook suggests. It seems to me that even if this turns out to be a garden variety recession, it could well last into the spring and maybe even into the summer. In that regard, I thought the latest employment report was ﻿ more or less consistent with that --suggesting that maybe this is a garden variety recession but that it has a way to go. I can't resist commenting a bit on the credit crunch and the real estate situation. I think maybe we are exaggerating the effects of the credit crunch, at least in that area. In a sense we do have an inventory problem in the economy. It's not in manufacturing; it's in real estate. We simply have too many office buildings, too much retail space and, in many parts of the country, too much residential space. We know that prices are going to decline in that environment and they have. I don't happen to think that additional credit availability would help the situation at all. I can't think of any responsible way of addressing this problem. We're really paying for the excesses of the 1980s both in the real estate market and in financial institutions. We have to work our way through those. We have to let the market deal with this because the excess supply is apparent. As I say, I don't see any responsible way out of that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
199102	261	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	262	MCTEER	 After only a couple of days on the job. I don't have a lot of firsthand knowledge of the economy in the Eleventh District except for the residential real estate market. I find myself buying into a rebounding market and selling into a market which is declining fairly rapidly. The Eleventh District, as I'm sure you are aware, ended 1990 out of sync with the rest of the country. It was either somewhat stronger or less weak, depending on what measure one looks at. Employment growth held up much better than it did in the national economy. In the fourth quarter there was employment growth not only in the government and private services sectors but even slight employment growth in the manufacturing sector and fairly substantial employment growth in nonresidential construction. Most of the growth occurred in the first two months of the fourth quarter and then the weakness started in December. Of the states in the Eleventh District, the strongest was New Mexico with total employment growing by 3.6 percent at an annual rate; in Texas and Louisiana growth was at annual rates of about 2.5 and 0.6 percent, respectively. Part of this had to do with the composition of the energy sector rather than primary oil or primary gas. Gas has been very weak and employment has been shrinking there. Oil drilling hasn't gone up very much in the Texas and New Mexico areas, but employment in that industry has grown somewhat as existing wells have been worked more intensively. Also, the additional profits and incomes that are resulting from the higher oil prices have added to the liquidity and spending power of the sector and have helped that part of the country do a bit better than the rest of the country. As for the national economy, I believe I would be describing the Dallas research staff's view accurately in saying that they really have no quarrel with the pattern of the Greenbook forecast. They just believe that the expected rebound is not likely to be as sharp as the Greenbook has it. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	53.0
199102	263	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	264	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The overall pace of economic growth in the District appears to be slowing somewhat, due mostly to weakness in manufacturing and construction. Automobile ﻿ manufacturing. for example, which we share with the St. Louis District, has weakened further. But the District aircraft manufacturers reported improvement in sales of business jet aircraft and as a result are showing a good deal of strength. Construction activity in the District remains weak overall but public works projects, such as a large public project in Kansas, continue to offset the weakness in both residential and nonresidential building activity. I might also say in reference to state and local spending that throughout several of our metropolitan areas there appears to be on the shelf--the bonds have been sold--infrastructure construction that will be commencing in 1991 and will hold up that sector somewhat. The oil price volatility and uncertainty about the outlook for oil prices is slowing activity in the District's oil patch. And sluggish export demand has led to weak prices in wheat, corn, and soybeans. On the other hand, the livestock prices continue to bolster farm income, and I would characterize the rural areas as being fairly optimistic. There is one vignette I'll add to Bob's: In talking with a restauranteur who has stores across the United States in the mid to upper range of restaurants, they also found that [their business] virtually closed down on January 16th, 17th, and 18th. But by the first of February they were back at a level that they found encouraging. They attributed it largely to CNN and people sitting in front of the TV to determine what was happening in the Gulf war. As to the Greenbook forecast, we also believe it to be rosy. That is, the pickup in the second quarter seems unlikely to us but we believe there will be the start of a pickup in the second half-- probably in the mid to late part of the third quarter. We have growth about a percentage point below the growth projected in the Greenbook for the year 1991 but a percentage point above that projected in the Greenbook for 1992. So, averaging it out, the staff forecast does not look unreasonable to us; it is simply the timing and the contour of the recovery that we believe may be different than in the Greenbook. I would say that if the war continues beyond midyear, then all bets are off as far as we can tell. As I understand it, the best guess is that it should be over by mid-April. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0

199102	269	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	270	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think the staff has done a very thorough job in putting together their economic forecast but, like so many of the other speakers, I believe that it may be a bit on the optimistic side and that the risk of error with respect to real GNP is at least moderately tilted toward the down side. I think the staff is probably about right on its guess that the war may end in the spring but my fear is that it will be the late spring rather than the early spring. In any event, while the war is going on there are going to be a lot of continuing uncertainties and periodic setbacks and it's going to damp both business and consumer confidence as well as sentiment in ﻿ the financial markets. Now, these negative impacts are going to be amplified, I think, by three big problems: the situation in the Northeast; the perceived fragility in the banking system; and the extreme weakness in commercial real estate in substantial parts of the country. So, we think there's a significant chance that the economy will recover later and probably less strongly than the staff is projecting. Our guess would be that the recovery might begin in the third quarter rather than in the second. And we expect only about 1 percent growth in real GNP on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, which does not put us comfortably within the central tendency, as Si was, but labels us as an outlier in that the staff is predicting about 2 percent growth over this period. We also are an outlier on the inflation side because we're more optimistic about inflation under the assumption that we can avoid a long and destructive war in the Gulf. In addition to the effects of the declining oil prices on the CPI. we think that the underlying trend rate of inflation is going to begin to respond in '91 to the considerable deceleration that we've had in the growth of the aggregates over the last several years. I think it's quite possible that our core inflation rate for the CPI may be down to around 3-1/2 percent or lower by the end of the year. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0

199102	272	MELZER	 On the national scene, we're very close to the median; I'm not sure that has ever happened before but there's some statistical probability of that and I guess it occurred. In the short run, not surprisingly, our staff would view the major risk as being whether the assumption with respect to money growth, something in the 4 to 5 percent area, is realized. I guess I'm a little schizophrenic about that because I'm worried that it may be realized and then some. And in that context I think Mike's scenario 2 here is very instructive because we could have some considerable challenges ahead of us. We have to get through the one we're in right now but, as we've discussed in the past and as Bob Parry mentioned, I hope we will be ready to respond in the other direction when we need to. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0

199102	275	MELZER	" In terms of our District. I don't have a lot to say. Our economy is stagnant, probably declining slightly. Perhaps with what is going on in autos and cancellation of the A-12, we'll have some further weakness showing up. Essentially, what has been going on is that manufacturing weakness, which is not as great as it is nationally, is being offset by strength in services--health services and business services, generally. Just one last comment on the banking sector: I would say that when the year-end numbers come out, some weakness probably will show up; but our banks are still in relatively good shape. I was at our Memphis branch a couple of weeks ago and one of the bankers said ""This kills me to do this, but I've got to tell you that I don't think additional stimulus from the Fed is really going to help. We're swimming in reserves; we don't know what to do with them. And the problem is that when we try to lay them off, eventually we get to the New York money center banks and we don't necessarily want to sell very ﻿ much!"" Another banker--these were both large bankers in that area-- said that they have cut their fed funds selling by 70 percent in the last year. I took that to mean in terms of approved names on the list. So, that's a pretty dramatic shift. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
199102	276	PRELL	 Mr. Chairman, if I might just inject a point that perhaps we should have made in talking about that last simulation: According to our model, the additional M2 in 1991 would be about 2-1/2 percent. So, to give you some-- 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0

But on a more serious note, the impression that I get from talking to businessmen and women and directors and others is that the statistics have basically caught up with their expectations, which had been distinctly sour for some time prior to the point when [the weakness] really showed through in the statistics. As I've said before. I do think that the real estate situation, at least in the greater New York metropolitan area--while not in the same category as it is in parts of New England--has not bottomed out. I think Gary's point is absolutely right: The excess inventory of real estate of all kinds is going to take a long time to work itself out. It's not just in the Northeast; I get the impression that this is pretty much a nationwide problem. Also, as several people have mentioned, one does get the impression that at least for a while in mid-January the so-called CNN effect was quite real in terms of retail operations and restaurants. They say it even showed through in the theaters in New York City. I have no independent evidence of that. But notwithstanding all of that--and this is where we come to the great dilemma--if you go through the exercise of looking at the economy sector by sector, regardless of whether you rely on a formal econometric model or rules of thumb that you may have acquired over time, it's not that hard to see a short recession. Based on my own purely subjective instincts, having spent a lot of time going through that kind of analysis, if I had to make a guess I would probably say that the chances of an outcome that is somewhere around the center of the central tendency are probably 50/50. Indeed, I would think there's at least some chance that we could get as robust a recovery as Mike has in his forecast. But, of course, if we do get that, then we ﻿ have an obvious problem of the second scenario on the last page of the chart show. On the other hand, I would say that the chances of an outcome that is weaker than the central tendency--again this is not scientific --are probably about 15 percent or 20 percent. But unfortunately, I can't rule out the possibility of an outcome that is very significantly weaker, either. Now, I don't think that's the likely outcome but if you asked me whether we could have a long and really deep recession I think I'd have to say there's at least' a 10. 15, or 20 percent possibility of that. Again, I don't think it's anywhere near the likely case, but I don't think one can rule it out. And the reasons it can't be ruled out in part get to the things that Gary was talking about: the overhangs of the excesses of the '80s. Some of Mike's charts on corporate cash flow positions and debt positions and things like that I don't think really capture how much of an overhang those things are. But on top of that I do think what we have is a recession that in the first instance is being driven by expectational factors, some of which are conditioned by those earlier excesses. But whatever the precise anatomy of the recession, the character of it, as I see it, is different enough that it is that much more difficult to judge how things will work their way through it, even in terms of this question of how much bang for the buck do we get from lower interest rates. I'm not sure. And because of some of these behavioral and expectational characteristics of current patterns of behavior it's very, very difficult to make that judgment. On the credit crunch issue, again, I essentially agree with Gary's point. But I think there's also a little more to it than that. One really does get the impression--it's more than an impression because I have been told point blank even by the best banks in the Second District, and at least one or two of them are among the best banks in the country--that the banks simply are not doing things on the credit extension side anything like the way they used to, even to those who would have been considered good customers 8 or 9 or 10 months ago. And the rate of foreclosures as opposed to restructurings or stretchouts, especially in the real estate sector, is another symptom of that phenomenon. So, while I think it's fair to say that the credit crunch is exaggerated, especially in political circles, I think it's entirely fair to say. as Gary did, that it tends to reflect these excesses of the past. I still think it is a very important consideration in the current setting, especially as it bears on this all important question of confidence and expectations. That is one of the many reasons why I find that I can be so ambivalent about what I think is going to happen. I sit down with Dick Davis and his guys and they convince me in two hours that Mike Prell is right, or more or less right, and not to worry. Then I start thinking about it and I say: ""I guess I am worried."" And that's about where I am, Mr. Chairman. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0

199102	286	HOSKINS	 The District's [economic] activity has softened since October but is still generally stronger than the nation's. The unemployment rate in Ohio is up about 1/2 point but employment is about the same; it hasn't changed much. In fact, if you look at [initial unemployment] claims, the peak seems to be in the first week of January at 44,000 and they declined gradually each week to around ﻿ 24,000. The hardest hit, of course, are autos and auto-related industries; that has impacted steel companies, which are operating at about 70 percent. [Unintelligible] cited a recent survey by a bank of its customers and 85 percent of respondents said that in terms of new projects they have no trouble getting credit; in terms of operating monies, 91 percent said they have no problem. As for straight-out anecdotal information, the international airline with which I'm familiar, since my wife works for it, has offered a month off without pay to anyone who wants not to work. That's clearly associated with the war and lack of travel. And you're probably all waiting for my stainless steel strip index, but I'm not going to give it to you because I've latched onto a new one: the Smuckers Index! I had a chance to talk with Paul Smucker, an elderly gentleman who has been through many business cycles and he told me that apple butter sales remain relatively soft and that's a good sign because during deep recessions apple butter sales soar. [Laughter] So, I'll be reporting to you on apple butter. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	287	GREENSPAN	 It sounds to me as though business is in a jam! [Laughter/hoots] 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	288	HOSKINS	 I'll make my comments on the national economy really short after that! As I look at it, I agree with the staff's view and also with what the Chairman has been saying. This is principally a situation where the downturn occurred as a result of the war and the consumer sentiment associated with that. With respect to problems in real estate, I think Gary Stern has it right: It's a long- term problem; there's no easy way out of it. And I don't think monetary policy can help either one of those situations. Now, I'm sitting here looking ahead at policy. There's a lag that we all know about, and we have a forecast that says the economy will be rebounding at about the time that the average lag says [current] policy is going to have an impact. So, I have some concerns about that, but I'll save those for Don Kohn. What I think we, from the point of view of a central bank, ought to be focusing on--[unintelligible] some of the concerns that people around the table have particularly from the areas that have been impacted hard--is what is happening to money. Perhaps some of you are interested in credit, but I would tend to focus on money. If we're going to worry about anything, I think we ought to worry about making sure that we don't permit a procyclical monetary policy at this point. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
199102	289	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	290	MULLINS	 My view of the economy is that the fourth quarter was not quite as bad as I expected; it looks like a contraction that is accounted for mostly by inventories, with much of it in the auto industry. The downturn still seems to be synchronized in the sense that inventories are in line with no serious imbalances, with the one exception of the commercial real estate inventories which are out of balance. But we have yet to see the imbalances. More recent data continue to have a sour cast to them, although the leading indicators were up in December; durable goods were also up but, of course, that [increase] was focused in certain areas. It bothers me a little that the purchasing managers index is still dropping and consumer confidence has yet to bottom out. Indeed, I agree with Jerry that the hard data are kind of catching up with the attitudes, and I ﻿ wish the attitudes would stop moving for a while. I noticed this afternoon during the break that the 10-day auto sales reported this afternoon were at a 5.2 million annual rate whereas people were expecting a 6.3 million rate or something of that nature. When I look at corporate finance, it doesn't lead me to forecast a vigorous rebound either. I think the Greenbook mentions that 1990 was a year of record defaults; that's really probably just the overhang of the junk bond market. But 1990 was also a year of record downgradings in bond ratings and almost a record in dividend cuts--probably the greatest number of dividend cuts and eliminations since the late 1950s. And that just suggests that corporations, like banks and consumers, may be in for a period of retrenchment--a period in which they will rebuild their capital structures and bond ratings before they're ready for aggressive growth again. Against this doom and gloom of recession and financial fragility, the stock market continues to charge ahead and [the DOW] will approach 3,000 if it continues another few weeks at the current pace. Why is this happening? Perhaps the most common indices we look at are more weighted toward multinational companies and reflect the prospects in some of the-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	52.0
199102	291	GREENSPAN	 But the stock prices of smaller companies have gone up even faster. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	292	MULLINS	 [Yes], the difficulty is the smaller companies have gone up even faster. It is an interesting scenario when our staff says we will have downgradings this year. I assume from watching the screen that the downgradings are continuing at a pretty rapid pace, yet their stock prices are going up. Now, of course, that can happen in a period of uncertainty; when you're a highly leveraged company your bond prices can go down but your stock prices can go up. Still, I think it's hard to escape the conclusion that the stock markets see better times ahead. And while it is true that a lot of publicly traded companies do have access to the public debt markets and commercial paper markets, when you get down to the broad equity markets this is not true and that includes some of the growth companies. So, I would say that the long bond rate, which is now approaching 8 percent, confirms that the recession is here and inflation is under control; but the stock market tends to suggest that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. I don't know how much confidence one would want to put in the stock market as a forecaster, but the stock market has a rosy forecast. So, overall I see the economy still contracting at a slow pace. There's real uncertainty about the war. What will happen when the ground war starts? What will really happen to consumer confidence in that case? I tend to agree that the prospects are good for a rebound this summer. I also tend to agree with what a lot of people have said: that it's not likely to be quite as robust as [the staff] forecast. I think this-- the war, the recession--has been a pretty sobering experience. People haven't experienced a recession in a long time. And with all the bad news about the financial system, it may take consumers and businesses a while to rebuild confidence. As for the banking system, the credit crunch has been discussed pretty thoroughly here. I think some progress has been made in the [banking] industry. They made it through the end-of-year financing pressures and now not only has the fed funds rate come down but the other money rates--the CD rates and commercial paper rates-- have come down pretty substantially, by [125] and 175 basis points. ﻿ This has really helped to open up the margins it seems to me; even bank stock prices have rebounded a little. And it has opened up a spread that might accelerate the process of financial healing in some of those institutions. We also have gotten through the fourth quarter and the results of another round of commercial real estate problems. The industry has absorbed another round of publicity about the bank insurance fund being broke; and also the public impact of the failure of Bank of New England is behind us. That was the most visible weak institution overhanging the market. Looking ahead, we may have another quarter or so of bad results to get through. And I'm afraid we will have a lot more publicity on the bank insurance fund that we'll have to put up with as well as a lot of publicity about the banking reform legislation, which will be accompanied by comments that the banking system is in trouble. I'm also concerned about the weak elements in the banking system and the need to get some of those weak components cleaned up rather than just waiting for them to fail into the bank insurance fund. I don't know exactly how to do that, but I think they could be a drag on the economy and on the psyche for a long time unless we can think of how to do that. So, overall on the banking system, I think we've had some progress, primarily in that the lower rates have helped the banking system; but there is a way to go in working through the bad news. I noticed noncompetitive bids in the three-year note auction were only $769 million, which is far below the $2 billion that people were expecting and the $2-1/2 billion that was the record. And what bothers me about the financial system is not only the direct impact on lending but also that the bad news about banks feeds directly into consumer confidence it seems to me. And then there's also the low probability but serious outcome of a crack in the financial system. As others have mentioned, I think we have a good dose of stimulus in the pipeline: the reduction in the dollar--even as we speak, probably. Oil prices have come down without a real rebound in consumer confidence yet, as Dick noted, which would suggest that it's the war that is affecting confidence and not just the oil prices. And the fed funds target has come down 200 basis points since the summer; [rates on] long bonds are down probably about 100 basis points. Most of this has taken place without disrupting markets. I know there is a lot of uncertainty left relating to the war, and I still have concerns about the financial system; a lot of these concerns are captured in the money and credit data and I continue to think we should focus on money and credit, which are ultimately and appropriately our responsibility. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	52.0
199102	293	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	294	LAWARE	" Mr. Chairman, there are three things that puzzle me about the staff outlook for the economy as reflected in the Greenbook. First, the projection is based on far from firm and certain assumptions that there will be a quick and decisive end to the Gulf War and no substantial damage to Saudi productive capacity that would interrupt supplies. These assumptions underlie the further assumptions that oil prices will stabilize in the low $20s and consumer confidence will rebound promptly and decisively at war's end. No ""what if"" alternative, or worst case scenario is offered against which to make judgments pertinent to the proper course for monetary policy. Second, the degree of fragility in the economy is not really addressed. There is no quick end in sight for commercial real estate ﻿ problems, and certain large segments of the banking industry are continuing to downsize and restrain loan growth. The current timidity of bank lenders is being compounded by depositor anxieties and deposit erosion to the perceived safer haven of government securities or money market funds. Third, it is not clear in my mind what role the banks are expected to play in the projected recovery. If fund flows are not to depository institutions but rather to Treasuries and to the money market funds, they won't be reflected in lending activity. In my view the economy is [experiencing] a paralysis of confidence which may not respond to the classic monetary policy moves to increase reserves and lower rates. Anxious consumers are loathe to spend or borrow. Businessmen are looking for clearer signs to invest, whether in inventories or plant. Governments plagued at the federal, state, and local level by unmanageable deficits are in a weak position to offer stimulus. And bankers, paranoid about overdiligent examiners, worried about capital levels, uncertain about the economy, and finding prospective borrowers weakened by recent economic trends, are refusing to lend. This spells out to me a recipe for economic stagnation. And I'm at a loss to understand how monetary policy can deal with it beyond sending signals that we hope the lookouts will see and interpret properly. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199102	295	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	296	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I would accept the staff's forecast or something close to it--maybe a bit less robust--as probably the most likely outcome. And, certainly, it's positive and desirable. But the concerns I have turn out to be ones that have run through this discussion over and over again. That is, I am struck in a way that I've never been struck since I've been here that the risk of war analysis is very, very heavily skewed on the side of caution. If we get a recession that is mild and ends soon and the rebound that follows it, that is going to present questions for monetary policy, without any doubt. But they will be happy kinds of questions, if you will, and they are going to be in a positive context. Again, that's probably the most likely scenario. But I think the positive consequences that would flow from that result are not nearly as significant as their mirror image on the down side--the negative consequences that could flow if we get the opposite scenario. If the situation turns out to be much more severe, along the lines that Jerry described a few minutes ago, that could have some very nasty consequences that are much larger in scope than their positive counterparts on the other side. They're broader in scope as far as their impact on our society goes, and I think they are far longer-lasting in the effect they could bring. That has some likelihood, whatever it is, and it's certainly greater than zero-- perhaps 15 percent. I don't know [the precise number], but there is certainly the statistical probability that we could get a much more severe result. If we do, and if we wind up with the seriously crippled banking system that John LaWare fears, for instance, it would be very difficult for that kind of a banking system to make it to the time when the economy was coming back around. I'm not sure where the financial contribution and support would come from if the banks have been crippled before that outcome started to take effect. Obviously, the process of watching the banking system become crippled, if that should evolve, would have a severe impact on ﻿ consumer and business confidence and would exacerbate the situation. We could have a very, very large deficit built up. which would have a very long tail as far as its consequences go: a much larger debt burden; the further fragility that would result from leveraging up the economy; and all those kinds of things that would follow from the leveraging up that we're all familiar with. I think it would foreclose--or at least for a very long time severely impinge upon--a variety of social and political options that we need to have available to us in this country as far as rebuilding our infrastructure goes, [ranging] from education needs to rebuilding bridges. It would have a very severe impact on business investment down the line and on various elements of our international position. And I would think that it would have to have severe inflation implications that really aren't necessary for us to have to undergo. Another point that I don't think is inconsiderable in the long-term scheme of things is that it would have a very severe impact on the possibility of constructive banking reform in the near future. We think that the time may have come for an effective reform movement. And if we got into a very severe recession right now, that would certainly doom the possibilities of the passage of a good package in the near term. So, we have a severe skewing that I haven't been conscious of in my thinking before, and I think it necessitates our looking at some things that sometimes we don't have to spend a lot of time on--a broader array of considerations and potential downside concerns as well as some very long-lived potential downside results that we would all hate to see ensue. All of which leaves me intrigued with the thought of investigating and considering further scenario 2 on the last exhibit. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
199102	297	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	298	ANGELL	 This event clearly is an event that doesn't happen very often. We really haven't seen [in a long time] such a switch in preference from wanting to be leveraged to wanting to have liquidity. We haven't seen such a period in which the creditors are not anxious to lend. This is a very significant event and it's an event that I don't think we've seen since the 1930s. This economy has a lot of factors that make for a very significant departure from the way we went through the events in the 1930s and the way we're going through them today. I agree with the staff's estimate in regard to the areas in which there are strengths. There are considerable strengths. And I tend to believe that of the factors on the export side particularly. It seems to me that this $20 billion per year payment from abroad--I don't care how you classify it--is really like an export of a military service. If you put that together with the other factors, our balance of payments certainly swings rather dramatically. But that swing in the balance of payments does mean that a saving rate move is going to go with it, and certainly the government sector is not going to be the source of that savings. And I doubt that the corporate sector is apt to add to that savings. So, I tend to think that there is somewhat less robust final demand in the consumer sector than I would expect. Frankly, if it occurs in the second quarter and it becomes evident that there are no more interest rate declines, then I would expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar to make a very significant turnaround. I would expect the foreign exchange value of the dollar to head back to the highs of 1989 in rapid order. That, of course, may then mean that later on we would get a slowdown on the export side. There is a significant downside risk that if monetary policy focuses on what I call a fairly weak ﻿ economic scenario, monetary policy will not be neutral but in fact could be quite damaging to the spot [dollar] prospects. That is the most dangerous event that we're looking at here: to have the foreign exchange value of the dollar move into a decided destabilized position, which I think could cause the bond markets and the stock markets to reverse rather rapidly. So, I'm looking at a scenario that I think is somewhat like [what was described by] some of the rest of you, but I tend to believe that monetary policy, if we're not careful, will make it worse rather than better. From June of 1989 we've decreased the fed funds rate by 365 basis points; that's a rather significant move. But it focuses upon the wrong rate in regard to what ails us. The right rate is the rate that the real estate market is facing, which is the long bond rate. And now for the first time in a long time we actually have long bond rates lower than they were a year [earlier]. And it seems to me that we are in a rather precarious [position] if we believe--and I guess I take this from Gary Stern and many others--that these corrections don't have to take place. If we believe that, I think we are mistaken. I think the correction with regard to household savings is underway and is going to take place and I think the use of monetary policy to deal with that has to be very, very carefully done so as not to make it worse rather than better. If we do not destabilize the situation, it seems to me that the rebound is going to occur. There are many factors [signaling] that. But if the dollar becomes progressively weaker. I don't think that will help us a bit on exports because in the mood of a war economy, with many countries in recession, that kind of environment could foster protectionist sentiment that could be very, very explosive. So, even though I'm not quite as optimistic on the real side as the staff, I do agree with the staff's [assessment of the] sources of strength; I think they are there. And I'm comfortable with that, if we do not harm this situation. I would admit that I am rather bullish in that if the Federal Reserve policy doesn't destabilize the situation--and I'm going to sound a little silly perhaps when I say this--I would not be surprised if my forecast of the CPI at 3.2 percent [is wrong] for 1992. The reason my CPI is so high is because of what the foreign exchange value of the dollar put us through; and once the dollar begins to rebound I can see CPI inflation doing very, very well. And then [we could] get the correction that we need, which is mortgage rates in the 7 percent range in order to bring this about where we need it. You see, real interest rates cannot be homogenized at this point; there are real interest rates in every market. And the real interest rate for houses right now is pretty darn high. In a falling real estate market--when one does not expect house prices to rise, and even expects them to fall--real interest rates even after taxes may be extremely high. So, I think the key is getting long-term bond rates down; and that's a lot harder than getting short-term rates down. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199102	299	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	300	SEGER	 I think most of my points have been made--12 times--but I will start off just by explaining an experience I had when I dug into my files to see what I had sent in this time last year for a forecast because I try to key off that when I do the next go- around. Last year I was the source of the low end of the range, in ﻿ case any of you have forgotten. I had 1 percent real growth fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter, which was off the bottom of the chart. And what is making me nervous is that that turned out to be too high; as you know, it came in at about .3 percent. Anyway, having said that, I love Mike's forecast and I hope it is realized. Even though I'm leaving, I certainly hope that this is what materializes. But I must say that I'm a little skeptical that it will. I'll just mention a couple of things. One relates to the assumed bottoming out of housing or the investment in residential structures. I realize I'm biased because I just met with a couple hundred homebuilders last month, but I really think there is a problem there. I think the credit crunch is still present in that industry, particularly on the side of builder financing. The United States is a big country and housing markets are local; there are zillions of them. They are not all like Boston or Denver or Dallas. There really is a housing shortage, especially in low and moderate income housing. We can use some more structures. So, I hate to dismiss this as something that we don't need to be concerned about. And I don't believe that we've seen the bottom yet on this; I don't think it's going to bottom out in the second quarter because of this credit situation. Also, on the consumer side: I would love to see the consumer come roaring back into the stores. It used to be VE day or VJ day--I'm aging myself; I don't know what this would be--[VS] or something. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
199102	301	PARRY	 VI. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199102	302	SEGER	 VI or VIQ. Anyhow, I would love to assume that [that will happen]. I have no idea when the war will end but, whenever it does, I just don't think that in and of itself is going to cure all the consumer confidence problems because I think part of the confidence problem involves the war but another big part involves this continuing flow of bad news about the financial system. It's like having cold water run down your back continually and a lot of people are reacting that way. That's part of it, but also consumers are still very overloaded with accumulated debts. I saw in one of the presentations the quality of consumer debt deteriorating, mortgage defaults growing, and that sort of thing. So, I just don't think consumers are in shape to run right out and go on a spending spree if they feel like it. Finally, on the assumption that exports are really going to carry a big part of the load: again, I would like to assume that. I'm impressed with how we have gotten our exports turned around. But as I hear about the conditions in other countries, such as Canada, that are our major trading partners and I think about their problems. I just wonder how strong those markets are going to be and, therefore, whether our exporters--no matter how good they are and how good their products are--in fact can achieve these kinds of results. Anyway, this certainly would be my preferred outcome; there's no doubt about it. But I just have a feeling that the timing is somewhat too optimistic and that whenever the bottom does occur the rebound from that low point will be more gradual and less sharp. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
199102	303	GREENSPAN	 Okay. Why don't we recess until tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. You may leave your papers here.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199102	304	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Kohn. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	305	KOHN	 Thank you. Mr. Chairman. The Committee today is asked to choose annual ranges for money and debt consistent with its objectives for the economy and prices. While the ranges are wide, and movements in the aggregates are only one factor taken into account in policy decisions, the choice of the ranges and the accompanying report to Congress do give the Committee a chance to address and explain its objectives and strategy. In this regard, last July the Committee chose on a provisional basis ranges for 1991 for M2 and debt that were a half point below those for 1990, as another step toward the lower money and credit growth thought likely to be needed to move toward price stability; the M3 range was left at its 1990 specification, which already had been reduced markedly to take account of the shrinkage of the thrift industry. The current economic situation, of course is somewhat different from what the Committee expected to confront when it established these provisional ranges in July. At this time the Committee is faced with balancing near-term concerns about the state of the economy, and longer-term desires to contain and reduce inflation. Both of these objectives may have particular implications for objectives for money and debt. The current state of the economy seems partly intertwined with credit conditions and associated money growth, while favorable long-term results on inflation will depend on the force with which the economy expands following recession, and satisfactory results in this regard may in turn be keyed by containing the associated rebound in growth of money and credit. Although the economic circumstances may be different from those envisioned seven months ago, it would appear that the ranges chosen provisionally in July still are consistent with a policy strategy that both allows for recovery and puts in place conditions that will produce modest deceleration in inflation. That is, we see these ranges as supporting the greenbook forecast of 6 percent growth in nominal GNP in 1991, given its judgement of the strength of underlying demands for goods and services. That consistency, however, also depends on the credit situation that prevails in 1991; both the volume and channels of credit flows in 1991 are expected to be influenced by many of the same forces that operated in 1990, imparting an added degree of uncertainty to the relationships of money and credit to spending. With credit market developments so central to financial forecasts, it might be useful to start with consideration of the debt measure. The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to increase 6-1/2 percent in 1991, about half a point below its growth in 1990, and in the middle of its provisional 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range. As in 1990, measured debt growth will be boosted relative to spending by the double counting involved with the Treasury's financing of the asset acquisitions of the RTC. Even aside from RTC borrowing, federal government debt growth is expected to accelerate this year, as the deficit is boosted by the effects of the weak economy. Credit supply restrictions as well as weak demand are apparent in the sluggish expansion of the debt of private domestic nonfederal sectors--at only 4-3/4 percent. Such slow private debt growth can support 6 percent nominal GNP growth not only because of the prominence of government spending, but also because net exports contribute importantly to that growth, and demands from abroad do not need to be supported by credit growth to domestic sectors. Nominal private domestic purchases are projected to increase a little less than 5 percent in 1991--a figure, I should note, that was incorrectly reported in the bluebook. What credit growth does occur is expected again to be concentrated outside of depositories. We are projecting thrift assets to drop substantially, on the assumption of additional funding for RTC and even greater activity in resolving dead thrifts than last year. Bank credit also is projected to be weaker than in 1990 as a whole, extending the basic trends of the second half of the year. Banks are presumed to be under continuing pressure to restrain asset growth as their capital is eroded by loan losses and the cost of capital and other wholesale funding sources remains elevated. Consequently, total funding needs of depositories are damped, and M3 growth is projected at only 2 percent, about in line with 1990, and in the lower half of its tentative range. The recent reduction in reserve requirements is not expected to have much effect on M3: In the context of higher FDIC premiums, lower reserve requirements are not anticipated to boost overall asset growth very much or to cause much substitution of CDs or other M3 sources for nondeposit sources, except possibly at United States branches and agencies of foreign banks, which need not pay FDIC premiums. The combined effects of sluggish domestic private demand and borrowing relative to income, and of the continued reluctance of banks and thrifts to fund that demand, produces an even larger increase in M3 velocity in 1991 than in 1990. As in 1990, sluggish depository credit also is expected to leave its imprint on M2, along witn continued depositor caution. M2 is projected to pick up a little under the influence of stronger income growth and the drop in interest rates in late 1990 and early 1991, including Friday's policy actions, but only to 4-1/2 percent--the middle of its provisional range. This growth is expected to be sufficient to support nominal income growth of 6 percent, producing a 1-1/2 percent rise in velocity. Relative to money demand model results, the staff forecast assumes a velocity shift of nearly the same dimensions as for 1990 as a whole, though at a slower rate than in the second half of the year. The forecast of the velocity shift in 1991 implies that policy should not seek M2 growth in line with historical relationships to the expansion of income. Looking back over last year, it seems clear that there were forces operating in financial markets that were damping both M2 and GNP, but with greater effect on M2. Weak M2 growth was partly a signal of unanticipated contemporaneous shortfalls in income, partly a leading indicator of future economic weakness to the extent it reflected the unwillingness or inability of banks to extend credit, but also partly a velocity shift that would not show through to GNP. It will be difficult again to sort out these effects as we go through 1991. We are in uncharted waters when we try to relate M2 to credit and spending under circumstances of an unprecedented restructuring of flows through depositories. Nonetheless, deviations of M2 from expected paths can be sufficiently large to swamp the uncertainties and justify a policy response because they would be seen as giving some information about the credit process or about concurrent spending. Such quite likely was the case for the flat pattern of M2 over the past four months. And we should not rule out the possibility that rapid M2 growth in a recovery also would require some attention. In such situations, validating unusually weak or strong money by holding interest rates unchanged will produce, respectively, a tighter or easier monetary policy than desired. As noted, M2 growth at the middle of the range is consistent with the staff greenbook forecast, so that the provisional range would leave some room on either side for surprises in spending propensities or money demand. However, as Mike showed, your projections are for somewhat less growth and inflation, and on average about 1-1/2 percentage points less nominal GNP growth. Assuming first, that your projections did not embody major interest rate movements and second, that last Friday's events would have roughly offsetting effects on your forecasts, it would appear that your outlook is more consistent with M2 growth in the lower half of the provisional range. Thus, the provisional ranges would seem to imply considerable scope for a somewhat easier policy than you had assumed, which might be welcome if you were concerned about the sluggish real economy projected. Indeed, if you were concerned that the provisional ranges themselves did not seem to call for sufficiently vigorous action to move against the economic downturn, consideration might be given to raising the ranges. One option would be to retain the M2 and debt ranges used in 1990. In effect, the long-term downtrend in monetary ranges would be suspended in the interests of fighting recession. On the other hand, your forecasts do have somewhat less inflation on average than the staff forecast and, with a higher employment rate at the end of 1991, have in place conditions for a more rapid deceleration in the future. If the Committee wished to emphasize an objective of emerging from the current recession with greater progress toward price stability and then to build on that progress in the subsequent expansion, a further reduction in the ranges might be appropriate. In the current cyclical context, the requirement for achieving substantial, lasting reductions in inflation will be first, to avoid exerting too much stimulus in the recession, and second, to tighten in a timely manner in the recovery. A lower floor on money ranges will help with the first requirement, since it implies that the Federal Reserve is willing to tolerate slow money growth in the interval between easing in reserves markets and response in money and later economic activity. Timely tightening may be the more difficult requirement to meet, since it may imply a firming of money market conditions while there is still an appreciable margin of slack and perhaps few, if any, visible signs of accelerating inflation. A lower ceiling on money growth would help to meet this challenge because a pickup in money would approach the upper limit of the range sooner, contributing to consideration of a prompter response in terms of tightening money market conditions.

199102	306	GREENSPAN	 Thanks. We're open for discussion on this issue. Let's do questions first. Any questions? Dick Syron. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	307	SYRON	 Don, I find myself in great sympathy with what you said. I have a technical question having to do with this issue of V2 and the credit crunch--not the New England credit crunch, but the national credit crunch. The chart we saw yesterday in the chart show indicated that, in terms of this particular measure of the credit crunch, we are not in a much different place than we usually are at this stage in the cycle. But part of your velocity forecast assigns some weight to the credit crunch, doesn't it? It may be consistent with the earlier data; that's what I'm trying to get a hint on. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	308	KOHN	 My interpretation of the charts--and I think Mike had the same interpretation--was that something unusual did seem to be happening in the depository sector. It was hard to see it reflected-- in his charts, anyhow--in total credit or total borrowing really. The flow of credit relative to GNP didn't look all that different from past recessions--although it was consistent with a recession, which we weren't anticipating at the beginning of the year. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	309	SYRON	 But the smaller business borrowing would be mostly from banks. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	310	KOHN	 Right. The banking depository credit was extraordinarily weak, and we think that's what is being reflected in M2. Now, part of the reason we have a velocity shift is because some part of that weakness in depository credit doesn't matter. As Mike pointed out, to the extent that it just reflects easily securitized consumer credit or mortgage credit that flows through different channels, the final borrowers --for example, households in this case-- don't even know who is holding their credit. It doesn't matter to them whether it's a bank or someone else. But when it seems to cut a little further into small businesses, where information is important and where the cost of rechanneling the credit may be rather high, then [it does]. So, to the extent that it's easily rechanneled, we could get an increase in velocity because the banks wouldn't need to issue time deposits. GNP would be whatever it was anyhow and M2 would be weak relative to GNP. But to the extent that it cut into not so easily rechanneled credit, it would have an effect both on M2 and on GNP. That's why I say I think some of the weakness we saw in M2 was reflected in GNP over the year and some of it was this velocity shift. But the velocity shift persists. To the extent that it does persist. we don't need to worry about that amount of shortfall in M2 relative to GNP. And I think that is the part that's easily rechanneled in our depository institutions. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	311	KOHN	 Further questions for Don? Governor Angell. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	312	ANGELL	" Don, I really have a two-part question. I want to precede the question, though, by the comment that I thought this ﻿ section in the Bluebook on page 8 and the following pages on long-run strategy was most helpful. I thought you put it in the context that is just right for decisionmaking. And I'm not trying to set you up for the question. You mention on page 10 in that paragraph about in the middle of the page--this is about strategy II--that ""nominal interest rates, while higher than in the baseline in the first two years, thereafter move below those in the baseline as inflation comes down more."" I didn't see those interest rates in the chart. Did I miss that somewhere? "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	313	KOHN	 That's because in the past we haven't shown those interest rates in here. In the baseline forecast, for example, we would have interest rates averaging about 5-3/4 percent by the end of 1995--just to give the end point. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	314	ANGELL	 Okay. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	315	KOHN	 We have a 5-3/4 percent funds rate in the baseline and about 5-1/8 percent in the slower M2 [growth scenario]. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	316	ANGELL	 Okay. Could you give me those numbers for 1993 also? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	317	KOHN	 Sure. In the fourth quarter of '93 it's 6-1/2 percent, rounded, in the baseline and it's about the same actually [in the slower M2 growth scenario]. The fourth quarter of '93 is about where the crossover occurs. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	318	ANGELL	 I presume these rates are short-term interest rates? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	319	KOHN	 That is the funds rate. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	320	ANGELL	 Now, Don, the tough question, which I've set you up for: Could you tell me about the pattern of long rates with those two scenarios? And to make it really tough, I'd like to know the pattern of long rates without credibility and the pattern with, you might say, enough extra effort to bring on credibility. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	321	KOHN	 Governor Angell, I can give you the deviation from the baseline. I don't have the charts showing the actual rates in the baseline, but I can tell you for the corporate bond rate that by the end 'of 1995 it is lower in the tighter alternative than in the baseline by about 15 basis points. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	322	ANGELL	 Yes, but what I really want to know about is the second half of '91. Would the long bond rate be higher or lower if you add credibility? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	323	KOHN	 Certainly, without credibility it would be higher. The way this works is that in the slower growth scenario--in order to damp money growth even more than the staff forecast, given the momentum of GNP--you have to raise interest rates. You have higher nominal and real interest rates that damp spending gradually. That then feeds through to inflation. How fast it feeds through might depend on credibility effects; in the model there aren't any credibility effects. And then the [lower] inflation will bring down nominal rates, although you'd still have higher real rates, at least ﻿ with a backward-looking expectations [model], and a higher unemployment rate at the end of this period under the tighter alternative, as you see from the table. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	324	ANGELL	 So, in other words, you're saying that the first part of any tightening would give [rise to] expectations of further tightening which alters the opportunity cost of holding bonds, and thereby bond prices would be somewhat lower than they otherwise would be until the improved inflation effect overcomes it? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	325	KOHN	 Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	326	ANGELL	 And that's where credibility would be so important? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	327	KOHN	 Right. If there were credibility effects, obviously, that would feed through faster and bond [prices] would probably rise; but [the markets] have to believe us. In my mind, the credibility comes mostly from our actions rather than from our words. So, it would take a while for that credibility to build. But once it did, then I believe that bond yields certainly would come down faster than we've captured in here. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199102	328	ANGELL	 Thank you. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
199102	329	GREENSPAN	 Other questions for Don? If not, let me start off with general comments on this issue. I have been puzzled, as I think everyone has been, by the extent to which our equations forecasting M2 and the various interest rate assumptions became progressively worse through the fourth quarter and kept a fairly large gap in the first quarter. That's suggestive, obviously, of two possibilities: that there has been a shift in the function and that we're now on a different slope, or that it's going to snap back. And if it snaps back, that implies a dramatically different outcome than if the existing divergence continues. My impression of the difference is that it is really quite substantial. In short, at this stage we really do not have a feel for how this is going to come out--not in a way that would make us feel rather comfortable about it. I would suspect. I conclude from this that we have very little basis on which to move from our preliminary position. I would say we pretty much have to make a fairly strong judgment in order to move one way or the other from alternative I, because I am fearful that if we choose either of the other two alternatives we probably would be setting ourselves up for things to go in the wrong direction. I think there is just as much of a probability that we soon will be engendering double-digit M2 as zero; if we could somehow hedge that until we get a much better fix on what is going on in the numbers, I must say I would do that. So, I prefer to stay basically with the preliminary ranges of alternative I. Dick Syron. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	330	SYRON	 I fully support what you suggest. I think we're in a time when the course of the economy is uncertain the course of ﻿ 2/5-6/9l -42- Sense in 1-k Vould D:athe world * the throws of the agonies of the unemPloyment rate and reduced output, we have the potential to run [over on] the other side And we re going to need the excuse to come back. And I think a b P�cent ceiling gives us the excuse to come back and raise interest rates quicker than the 6-1/2 percent ceiling. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	51.0
199102	331	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	332	CORRIGAN	 I would maintain the ranges that you recommended. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
199102	333	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	334	SEGER	 I agree with the argument that stability is good and that there is great uncertainty. But I was just looking at Appendix B [in the Bluebook]--I realize this is ancient history but i do pay attention to the monetary aggregates and the targets we set-- and I just thought I'd remind you about M2 growth, looking back: in 1988 we missed the midpoint on the low side; in 1989 we missed the midpoint on the low side; and last year we missed the midpoint on the low side. And to me. at some point anyway, there ought to be an effort to think about at least a modest catching up. I guess that is the main reason, along with the desire for some stability, that I would prefer to carry forward the targets that we had for last year� rather than use the tentative ranges that were set last July for this year. I think we've been assuming our targets were half-way appropriate but we've been low-balling it right along. I remember a few years ago, when Beryl Sprinkel was at the CEA, he made some pass at that idea in one of the Economic Reports to the President. Anyhow. I just feel more comfortable not drawing a line at the end of each calendar year and acting as if January 1 isn't related to December 31. So, I would go with a mix, using alternative III for M2 and alternative I for M3. That would just carry last year's ranges forward, which is a nonexistent alternative. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0

199102	337	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I support alternative I, as you suggest. I think we've been talking about two sets of effects that the ranges have: the signal effect and the guidance for actual policy. Looking back at Appendix B, I note that over a period of years actual experience does track along with our intent in the sense that both the ranges and actual growth have been coming down gradually--since 1983 in the case of M2. But in any one year [growth] varies substantially inside the range. So, actually, any of these three ranges would give us ample room to conduct policy as we might need to in order to accommodate the events over the course of the year. But in the case of the signal effect, I think we're rather locked in to alternative I. If we were to raise the ranges, it would send a bad sign to the market relative to our inflation [credibility]; if, on the other hand, we were to lower them, it would send a bad sign to the economy relative to our desire to help check this recession. Therefore, I feel comfortable with the actual policy guidance effect of any of the three, but the signal effect leads me to alternative I. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
199102	338	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	339	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think Wayne Angell has probably made my comments --rather well, as a matter of fact. It seems to me that there are only two real and important aspects to the range for M2--and that's the only aggregate I'd be concerned about. One is the midpoint, which gives us ample opportunity to achieve the staff's forecast for the year, and the other is the top of the range. The real test if we do get the bounceback [in the economy], which implies vigorous growth of M2. is going to be whether or not we have the courage to do what I think we should do fairly quickly. The second part of that is that we only have 5 months, or 6 months maybe, before we take a look at these ranges again. I think the message that would be received well by the markets is that we are indeed still concerned about inflation. All the rhetoric about the short recession I think plays well with the longer-term view that inflation is our major target. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
199102	340	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	341	MULLINS	 I support your proposal, Mr. Chairman, and your rationale. We have seen an extended period of low money growth rates, [with growth for 1990] the lowest shown in Appendix B [for any year since at least 1979], and also falling growth rates in recent years. I'm comfortable with the existing ranges. In the last 10 months M2 growth has been at the low end of its range; I don't think it's a good idea in the current environment to reduce the range. I think we would appear to be lowering the target so we'd have a greater chance of hitting it. I also think it's not a good idea to raise the range; we're unlikely to achieve it and it's not a good idea to reverse the trend of reducing the range gradually through time. And even the 2- 1/2 percent low end of the current range is roughly consistent with the long-term real growth potential of the economy. I think this is an important decision, given the heightened public perception that we're interested in M2 and the aggregates in general. I think any decision other than alternative I risks confusion. We should focus on achieving actual money and credit growth within the ranges and leave the ranges pretty much alone. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	52.0
199102	342	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	343	MELZER	 Let me just comment first on the strategies that Don laid out. I strongly favor strategy II. Given our role as a central bank, I can't see associating myself with any other strategy. The only thing we can affect in the long run is inflation; that's the only one that really shows any progress. That does not lead me. however, to alternative II in terms of the ranges; I would support alternative I. As Bob Parry already acknowledged, there's already a reduction in the ranges implicit in the tentative ones, so in my mind that's consistent with strategy II. My own view is that a further reduction in the ranges, given the environment we're in right now, really wouldn't be seen as particularly credible. I don't think we would buy any credibility by ratcheting them down any further. What is credible and what we need to do in this environment is to make sure that we acknowledge that the one thing we affect in the long run is prices and that we're still committed to price stability. [I mean that] not in a saber rattling short-term context, but we have made so much progress over the last four years in bringing down the growth rate in money that, as I've said before, I think we have a tremendous opportunity here to make a permanent impact on inflation. And I want to make sure we don't lose sight of that. I'm sure we won't as a Committee, but in terms of what we're conveying to the public we need to convey that we have some short-term problems to work through now but we still have our eye on the right ball. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
199102	344	GREENSPAN	 I think not moving the ranges up in the face of this recession gives that signal. It's cyclically adjusted! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	345	MELZER	 What I'm suggesting is that we can't rely on that alone to convey the message. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
199102	346	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	347	HOSKINS	 Well, I'm pretty much in the same mode as Wayne and Roger and Tom. Our job is to reduce inflation over time. I think all of these ranges allow us to do that, as Mike Kelley pointed out. Midpoints are important and I would hate to have us think that if we do come out for your suggestion, we have to hit the midpoint because that's above where growth has been averaging. I think that was Wayne's point. So, I'm for strategy II, a tighter [M2], because that's the one that makes inflation disappear on this piece of paper in front of us. I'm not sure it will, in fact. But I'm not troubled by marching the ranges down slowly over time because there's a consistency in that that does lend itself to credibility. And we are moving down a notch. So. while I would prefer to be more aggressive, I can understand your arguments and would support them. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0

199102	351	MCTEER	 I would associate myself pretty much with Tom Melzer's statement. I could buy the economic case for alternative II, but I don't think I'd want to put you in a position of having to ﻿ announce a reduction in the targets in the middle of a recession. So, I would support alternative I. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	53.0
199102	352	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199102	353	BOEHNE	 We're sending a rather powerful signal these days with our short-run policy movements, and I think it's important that we not confuse that signal. I think staying where we are with alternative I is least likely to do that. We already have lowered the ranges one notch and by not going back [up] we send a signal that we haven't given up on inflation. To go to alternative II in the current environment of bringing interest rates down would send some mixed messages, which I don't think we want to send. In terms of operating room, I think all of these ranges give us operating room. And if we get a shift in the function, these ranges aren't going to be terribly relevant. So, I come down for alternative I on both counts: the signal effect and the operating room. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	33.0

199102	365	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With regard to the coming intermeeting period, the key issue facing the Committee clearly is how aggressive to be in undertaking any further easing moves. The question has two dimensions in so far as the directive under consideration--first, whether to ease further at this time, and second, how to frame the instructions to the Desk about responses to incoming data, that is, the tilt in the language governing policy actions between meetings. Most of the arguments on both sides have already been voiced by various Committee members, but I thought it might be useful as background for the discussion to review the bidding. An aggressive posture would be characterized by a further easing at this time, or at least by retaining the current asymmetrical language in the directive so that appreciable further weakness in the economy or in money and credit elicit prompt policy response. The case for such a posture is built on the sense that the risks and costs of a long and deep contraction are greater than those of a strong rebound. Both the risks and costs are seen as closely related to the health of the financial system and its effect in the price and availability of credit, as well as to the persistently gloomy attitudes of consumers and businesses, both of which may continue to affect spending propensities. In this environment, an unusually aggressive easing of policy could be needed to improve confidence and to stimulate sufficient spending through channels that do not require the immediate participation of depository institutions; these latter would include net exports induced by a lower dollar and financed outside the country, and demand from sectors that have access, directly or indirectly, to credit available at the lower interest rates in securities markets. Concerns about a tepid response to previous easings are accentuated by the behavior of the monetary aggregates, whose persistent weakness, despite persistent staff forecasts of a pickup just around the corner, suggests continued shortfalls spending and a lack of credit at depository intermediaries. If, in fact, the economy does rebound with considerable vigor, policy can be tightened at that time to head off any greater inflationary pressures. A less aggressive policy stance might be characterized by no change in policy at this meeting and symmetrical language for the intermeeting adjustments; such language would not foreclose the possibility of policy actions to change money market conditions, only require stronger evidence than under an asymmetrical directive. The case for such a directive rests on concerns about the lags in the effects of the substantial policy easings already undertaken and about the timeliness of any subsequent tightening should it be needed. In terms of short-term interest rates, the system has eased quite sharply in the last few months, and the effects would not be expected to show up in money for a little while, and in activity for a considerable period. The dollar is at a low level, and under downward pressure. Both bond and stock markets seem to be anticipating an upturn; the failure of bond yields to decline much on balance since the last FOMC meeting, and the consequent sizable steepening of the yield curve, is as striking as the upswing in the stock market--especially since volatility measures suggest a lessening of perceived risk over this interval. The staff, once again, is predicting a strengthening of M2 growth--to 4 percent in February and 5 percent in March--but this time there are even a few weeks of sizable increases in data already in hand for the second half of January to support such a projection. From this perspective, there is significant risk of overreacting to incoming data, which even under the greenbook's rosy scenario would continue to show weakness before the effects of the recent easing and lower oil prices take hold. Problems in interpreting such data will be particularly acute over coming months, if in accord with yesterday's reports of CNN effects the data are distorted by the impacts of temporary disruptions to demand from the events of the Persian Gulf. While an insurance policy against a shortfall in the economy can in theory be resold if necessary through a subsequent tightening of policy, such moves are always difficult, and will be made even more so this time by the poor condition of financial institutions, which is likely to persist for a time even in a rebounding economy. If the Committee had concerns on both sides of this issue, one way to encompass them would be to refrain from further easing at this time, retain the asymmetrical language, but still temper to an extent the response to incoming data. No change in reserve pressures at this meeting would recognize the extent of the policy actions over the last intermeeting period and a desire to let them filter a bit more through financial markets and get a better fix on the trajectory of the economy and prices; asymmetrical language would acknowledge that the risks were still seen on the downside, that the Committee wished to remain especially alert to evidence that a steep slide in activity was continuing, and that as a consequence, if an action were taken before the next meeting, the Committee would expect it to be an easing move; but in light of the size of the recent actions and the difficulty of sorting through incoming data, the Committee might want to allow evidence of unexpected weakness in the economy or shortfall in money to build for a time before reacting. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	366	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Don? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	367	HOSKINS	 Don, what does your model tell you for M2 for the first half, given the [policy] moves that have been made? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	49.0
199102	368	KOHN	 If we build in the error that seems to be in train for the first quarter--that is, if we put in the 4 percent and the 5 percent that we had for February and March--that would give us 2-1/2 percent for the first quarter. Now, the model has something like 6 percent for the second quarter but we wouldn't expect anything like that. We'd be looking probably at something more in the 4 to 5 percent area as a judgmental forecast. We're looking at a 1-3/4 percent approximate shortfall from the model for the year; we have a substantial part of that in the first quarter but not entirely. I don't have a projection for the first half that really goes with alternative B, but I would guess off the top of my head that it implies something like 5 percent, which would be about a 1-point shortfall from the model; the latter was saying 6 percent. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	369	HOSKINS	 But our confidence in the model has fallen? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	49.0
199102	370	KOHN	 It never was very high. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	371	GREENSPAN	 Other questions for Don? If not, let me start off with my appraisal. First of all, to me the most fascinating aspect of the last several weeks is the stock market, which I think essentially is clueing in to the fact that the war will be either significantly contained or short. Now, I'm not sure it makes all that much difference. If, for example, we cauterize the major [enemy] forces around Kuwait and wait for their supply of food and water to run down, which could take months, and it appears as though their offensive capabilities in the area--scuds, aircraft, and so forth--are pretty much eliminated, I'm not sure it matters whether the war is over at that point or not. But I think the market essentially reads it that way. What is really important about the stock market is not so much whether it is forecasting correctly or not but that the very mood of the market itself has economic implications in the context of ﻿ what I would call an add-factor economy in which most of our equations don't work and what really moves the forecast is how one fiddles with the add-factors. In that sort of environment, confidence is the problem, essentially. I would think at this particular stage that the news is possibly better than we feared, if I may put it that way. And while we've all taken pot shots at the Greenbook forecast, it is not a zero probability forecast by any means. [Laughter] 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	372	PRELL	 [Damning with] faint praise! 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	373	GREENSPAN	 I'm willing to go at least 15 percent! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	374	PRELL	 Can I get you to 60? 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	375	GREENSPAN	" With all seriousness, I'm a little concerned that we may be looking at the January data with a longer- term view of what it all means than it may in fact mean, especially if one realizes that it [reflects] the climate going into the war or the uncertainty it raised. One thing I found fascinating yesterday was how many people around here are getting feedback around the country on the CNN effect. Usually we only hear it anecdotally in one place; we heard it virtually all around this table. I hope it doesn't get out; it's terrific for CNN business! In any event, I do think that in the context of our success in bringing down money supply growth, we're beginning to see the benefits on the inflation side. That's one area where I actually don't quite agree with the Greenbook because I think the inflation forecast is too high. From what I can sense, looking at the internal price structure of a lot of companies and talking to a lot of people about market resistance [to higher prices], it may turn out to be doing better than we know. I think it's showing up very specifically in the obviously crucial wage area. I think this has given us room to lower the interest rate structure, which we have done, without engendering inflationary effects. And I think the way in which it has been done to date, with a rather slight lag probably, has been very helpful in preventing inflationary pressures from moving up over the longer run. Ideally, I would suspect that we would like to have the rate structure, to the extent that it is relevant, come down and just stabilize as we go into the expansion phase. But trying to ease into the equilibrium in that manner strikes me as really quite unrealistic. I have come to the conclusion that we may have to move it down further as insurance but be prepared to back right up when and if that becomes necessary. Unless we seriously believe that we have the capability of bringing rates down to a point, including where we are now, and then flattening them out at that point, we have to be [operating] under the presumption that we are going to move them down and then we are going to move them up. I think we have to be prepared to do both, but hopefully in a less volatile manner than has been the case for monetary policy in the past. I would say certainly that in recent years we've been able to do that and I hope we can continue. What this leads me to, granted all of what we were discussing yesterday, is that it seems extremely unlikely that this economy will start to move up, or more importantly that the money supply will start to move up. at a pace that would induce us to be moving in a direction of tightening rather than easing prior to our next meeting. I can conceive of our easing further--not immediately, but certainly in ﻿ response to additional events. I would conclude, therefore, that the appropriate policy at this stage would be ""B"" asymmetrical toward ease. Governor Angell. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	376	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I'm in agreement with everything you have said. I think you put it exactly right, so I'm not going to repeat any of that because I think you hit it right on the mark. I'd also like to say, Mr. Chairman, that I could detect in Don Kohn's statement not just a pure analysis, but I thought he also was leaning in exactly the same direction that you have indicated. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	377	GREENSPAN	 Are you suggesting that I influenced Don Kohn? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	378	ANGELL	 Yes, I am; he's easily influenceable! In going with your outline. I would like to mention that the one thing I disagree with you on is that I think the probability of this scenario is more like 45 percent rather than 15 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	379	GREENSPAN	" I said ""at least""! "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	380	ANGELL	 Oh, at least 15 percent! I'm going to go to 45 percent even though I tend to think the recession is going to be a little longer and the recovery a little shallower. But the fact of the matter is that I think we do have ahead of us some more disheartening news on the first quarter. Not only do we have the CNN effect, which I think really is there--people have been watching TV more than shopping--but there's also the travel factor. I have been at the airport in Zurich and at Heathrow and JFK, and there just isn't anybody there. There is a real impact. Harrod's runs a beautiful store at Heathrow and they had about 30 sales people and I think 2 customers. So, it does seem to me that travel is going to be down sharply; that along with the CNN effect means that the first quarter will be down sharply. So, I think we do have some bad news ahead of us and we need to steel ourselves for that. Now, if the staff is correct regarding the bounceback, one thing I do believe is that once the capital markets recognize that the United States economy is in a recovery phase, there'll be no more cuts--and possibly increases--in short-term interest rates. And I do believe the dollar could have a very sharp bounceback effect once we get past a period of stability. So, I did a little calculation. We have what --about $56 billion of deutschemarks? Is that close? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	381	CROSS	 That's close. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	382	ANGELL	 I was thinking that we may have a window of, say, 90 days to get rid of 2/3rds of that. If we want to get rid of 2/3rds of the deutschemarks we hold--I'm not counting the interest because so far this year the $50 million we've done is only l/5th of the interest we've earned--we're going to have to sell quite a bit. I calculate $620 million per working day over the 90-day period. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	383	GREENSPAN	 That will get their attention! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	384	ANGELL	 It really is a very substantial item, and I would suggest that the budget deficit for 1991 does not need to have a huge foreign currency exposure because we've marked the gains up in ﻿ 1990 on a mark-to-market basis for our payments to the Treasury. So, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much that you have gotten done the $50 million and just would suggest that you carry on with more enthusiasm! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	385	SIEGMAN	 Governor Angell, we have $33.9 billion in DM, in recent values. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0

199102	388	ANGELL	 Oh, I was looking at the totals. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	389	GREENSPAN	 Including Treasury holdings. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	390	ANGELL	 I was including the Treasury too, but I thought the Treasury probably would want to do the same as we would. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0

199102	392	SIEGMAN	 No, this is dollar values. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	393	GREENSPAN	 Bob Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	394	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I would agree that alternative B is the best. We have just taken a fairly significant, strong, and dramatic policy action and any further move now would appear to me to be sending the signal that we had pushed the panic button. The staff may be right in saying that we won't have to ease further in this cycle; I certainly hope that that's true because it's in that area and the failure to tighten up promptly that we've usually made our mistakes. But in my own forecast I see it somewhat weaker than the staff does. So, I think it's possible that we may have to do a bit more [easing] before we start upward, though I hope not. But because of that possibility, I would go with your asymmetric directive tilted toward ease. Lest anyone think that a hawk has become a dove, I think I will be among those who will argue the strongest quite early for an increase in the federal funds rate, if the economy does turn around. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
199102	395	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	396	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation of alternative B since it appears that the economy will be recovering at a satisfactory rate 6 to 9 months from now, especially in light of the policy moves that were taken recently. However, I do have a strong preference for a policy directive that is symmetrical. If new developments in the next several weeks suggest greater weakness, I believe there should be a full discussion of the implications of those developments for the outlook 6 to 9 months from now before policy is changed. It seems to me that that kind of discussion runs the greatest chance of avoiding the error of going too far in the direction of ease in response to weakness in the statistics that are conveying information about the performance of the economy in the recent past. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199102	397	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	398	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, we have done a lot over the past several months and the most recent action is just behind us; for that reason I would support your prescription. I do think, as I said yesterday, that the risk continues to be on the down side and that we may get some bad economic news over the next several weeks. And for that reason I would support also your prescription for an asymmetric directive. I'm glad you said what you did about our moving on the up side when that becomes necessary because I think it's important for us to remember that we're not on automatic pilot with monetary policy and that we have to adjust to conditions. I might say, going back to the asymmetric directive, that we have a long interval between this meeting and the next one and I think it's important to be able to move promptly if the information is negative. On the CNN effect, I might just say too that Jane Fonda is very happy with that! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199102	399	GREENSPAN	 Si Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	400	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation. It seems to me that we've done quite a bit and we ought to sit back and pause here. Having said that, I think the chances are that we are more likely to ease than to tighten before the next meeting and, therefore, I think the asymmetric language would be appropriate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199102	401	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	402	HOSKINS	 Mr. Chairman. I support your recommendation. I was particularly encouraged--and you have said it all the way along, so it should be no surprise--[by your] preparing this group for having to tighten if things start to grow. However, on the asymmetric language, I'm comfortable for different reasons. I hope we will be emphasizing slowness in money growth as the reason for moving rather than weakness in the economy. The errors in our ability to predict the economy one quarter out by anybody's forecast evaluation are really quite large. I think our best chance of getting to where we want to be in the long term is to continue progress on relatively steady money growth over time. So, I would hope that the asymmetric language would be exercised if we get bad news--that is, slower growth in money than we anticipate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
199102	403	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	404	CORRIGAN	 I certainly would support the suggestion you put on the table, but I would just elaborate a little on one or two aspects of policy beyond that. Everybody has put his or her own probabilities on outcomes of various forecasts and, as I said yesterday, my own sense of it is that there's at least a 50 percent chance that we'll get something along the lines of the central tendency of the Federal Open Market Committee members' forecasts. And we certainly can't rule out the kind of [outcome] that Mike talked about. But if we're going to get either of those--a modest recovery beginning sometime around midyear or even a fairly bouncy one as in Mike's forecast--it seems to me that either outcome is already baked in the cake in policy terms. There is enough there, if policy is working, to produce that result. On the other hand, there is a 10, 15 percent chance--again, pick your number--of it being a lot weaker. Now, especially if it turns out to be a lot weaker, then we're looking at a very deep ﻿ recession with all of the [attendant] financial problems. That, by the way, I think would blow the stock market right out of the water. Then we really would have a terrible situation not only in terms of what it implies for the economy and unemployment and all the rest, but in those circumstances I think policy would be judged universally as the culprit. Moreover, the risk of the whipsaw effect sometime out in the future, which is embodied in Mike's second scenario on the last page of yesterday's handout--even in the case of a steep recession-- gets much greater under any scenario like that. Now, I think the problem for policy and the appearances of policy is a bit further complicated by this credit crunch issue. There are two schools of thought about the credit crunch. One school of thought is that it's very real and that the Fed in particular isn't doing much about it. I don't happen to agree with that school of thought. Gary's analysis yesterday comes much closer to the mark as far as I'm concerned. But there is that other school of thought: that the Fed itself is overstating the credit crunch because that rather suits its purpose. And the argument that grows out of that essentially says that the weakness in money is really due to policy, not a credit crunch--that the credit crunch is a smokescreen and the Fed is hiding behind that smokescreen. Indeed, that argument goes one step further and says that the Fed is targeting the funds rate, that reserves are strictly demand determined, and that it's the policy process itself that is producing the weak growth in money supply and/or the credit crunch, or even worse for the Machiavellian types that the Fed is hiding behind the credit crunch. The reason I bring that up is again in the context of what happens--regardless of whether you think the risks are 10 percent or 20 percent--if it turns out that the economy goes down the tank. That leaves me in this quandary of desperately searching for what I like to think of as a low-cost insurance policy. To me, a low-cost insurance policy is something that either in substance or in form tries to defuse some of those arguments without bringing with it the necessary result that we go too far in underlying policy terms and set ourselves up in the kind of conundrum that Mike so graphically described yesterday. So, I ask: Is there a low-cost insurance policy? That is somewhat of a contradiction in terms, of course; there really cannot be. While I don't think it's germane to the Committee's discussion this morning, I have this rather crazy idea that runs around in my head that might deserve consideration as a low-cost insurance policy. Essentially, what is running through my mind is going a good deal further than we have been thinking to date about trying to bring the discount window to bear in this process. The concept that rolls around in my head--and I understand it can be shot to pieces, but maybe Don and Mike and the staff could think about it a little anyway--is a 6-month period, for example, within which we would have a highly advertised program of more liberal discount window accommodation, including term discount window loans. The program would be structured to say that its purpose is to ensure liquidity to individual institutions to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers. We might have more liberal collateral requirements, but we'd haircut the devil out of them so there would be no risk to the Federal Reserve. But the thought would be that people could have easier access and more generous collateral requirements --in terms of what is put up [as collateral], not in terms of how it is haircutted. It would have a market rate of some kind or other. The way I think about ﻿ it is that if it's used. I don't see that it has to have any material impact on the broad thrust of policy, at least if one thinks of policy in terms of interest rates or exchange rates. I think we could engineer those effects out through Mr. Sternlight's operations. So, if it's used, fine; I don't think it has to compromise the basic thrust of policy. And there would be no risk to the Federal Reserve. On the other hand, if it's not used, I'm not sure that that's the end of the world either. Indeed, if it's not used, it seems to me that it goes at least a little in the direction of helping us to defuse the argument that our unwillingness to provide liquidity either through open market operations or otherwise is the cause of the credit crunch and all these other things that go with it. Now, as I said, there really is at the end of the day, of course, no such thing as a low-cost insurance policy. This has smoke and mirrors to it. But I am worried about the danger that is inherent in an outcome in which [the economy] really goes south on us. I ask myself what other alternatives there are that do not involve the risk of compromising the basic thrust of monetary policy, and I look with Bill Taylor and others at some of the things they are talking about on the supervisory side. Now, the problem there is that the ones that might do something by their very nature are going to raise the specter of forbearance on the thrift situation and all the rest, and I think in a global setting relaxing capital standards or something like that would be crazy. On the other hand, the kinds of accounting things that are being talked about I don't think are going to do anything. As a matter of fact, I think they will be viewed transparently as not doing much at all. Again, maybe we don't need a low-cost insurance policy; but that, I think, is your judgment. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	405	GREENSPAN	 Well. no. On the contrary, that is not my judgment. I think we may need it; I'm not saying that we don't; we may and I think we should consider it. But it might be useful to continue on and get some comments on that issue at the luncheon, okay? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	406	CORRIGAN	 Right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	407	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	408	SYRON	 Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation with asymmetry. Many of the reasons have been given before; one is that there's a long interval before the next meeting. I think we may have to do something before the next meeting, and [it makes] sense to take out insurance on the fundamental policy side. I do agree very strongly with the comments that Wayne made--and it's reassuring that everyone has made them--on the importance of recognizing the scenarios that were shown. [I'm pleased] that we're willing to pay the premiums involved in this insurance policy if we do have to [ease] in the intermediate period rather than being tighter and I think we all should realize that there may be a difficult period coming out of this one. The only comment I would make is--and again this may be more appropriate for the [non-FOMC] lunch discussion--that we may well have to do something more on the discount rate before doing more on the funds rate because with a 6-1/4 percent funds rate and a 6 percent discount rate, given people's aversion to borrowing, effectively, we have a penalty discount rate right now. I think it's equally likely that the next move may well be a cut in the discount rate without a further change in the funds rate. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199102	409	GREENSPAN	 Without the funds rate showing through and with the spread opening up again? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	410	SYRON	 That's right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199102	411	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	412	LAWARE	 I support your recommendation with the asymmetry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
199102	413	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	414	MULLINS	 I also support the proposal. I do think that we will have to get through another bout of unsettledness when we confront the possibility of a ground war, which could give us another CNN effect for a week or two--although it may be less popular because it may look less like a video game. I agree that there are risks on the down side and I think that's understandable, given the 6 to 9 months of very slow growth in money and credit we have had. I would think that we'd be facing a pretty tough period, although looking beyond that we have a good dose of stimulus in the pipeline already. But I still think, given the uncertainties, that it's wise to be asymmetric toward ease and watch events. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	52.0
199102	415	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	416	MCTEER	" Mr. Chairman, when I read the Bluebook, I wrote in the margins ""I like the interest rate implications of alternative A but that alternative puts us on too steep a growth path for money in the out years."" So, I would recommend alternative B. And the asymmetric language toward ease sounds good to me, although I like Lee Hoskins caveat about that being focused largely on the growth of the aggregates. I can just confirm the CNN effect. In anticipation of moving, we had our cable disconnected last week and I've been suffering withdrawal but I haven't gone to the mall yet! "	23	23	2.0	1.0	53.0
199102	417	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	418	BOEHNE	 I agree with your recommendation and your comments surrounding it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
199102	419	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	420	STERN	 I certainly support alternative B. With regard to the question of the language: Looking to the future, if all we want to consider is asymmetric language toward ease, that certainly makes sense because I find it very hard to believe that between now and March we will get enough coincidence of events to suggest that we would want to raise the borrowings target and the funds rate. However, we have moved a lot recently, and I think we do have to consider the lags in all this. In light of that, I would have a preference for symmetric language just because I think we run the risk of not allowing the actions that we've taken to date to have an effect on both the aggregates and ultimately on the economy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199102	421	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	422	MELZER	 I support alternative B also. Let me just pick up on some things Jerry said. I was writing some notes here and when he started talking I thought he was going to say the same thing I am. But when you hear what I have to say, you'll realize that that was virtually impossible. Basically I agree with this focus on slow money versus weak current economic numbers. I think that's what we ought to focus on; that's what we have influence on. But I'm also sympathetic to the uncertainties with respect to the short-term behavior of money, particularly the broader aggregates. Don has talked about it--the restructuring that's going on in depository institutions and so forth. And I guess we also know that the base is distorted by currency flows overseas. So, if it were up to me, I would pay some attention to reserves. That's what we affect directly. And over the last year there has been virtually no growth in reserves. Now, I'm not being critical here, because I think we've tried to respond to that to some extent by bringing rates down; and we have recognized in this Committee the perils of funds rate targeting and we've been trying to respond to that. But we shouldn't sit around and be surprised that we're not getting any money growth if we're not providing any reserves. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	423	GREENSPAN	 But we are. Supposing reserve balances stretched across not only transaction balances but across the whole spectrum of various depository obligations. Required reserves under those conditions obviously would have been going up a great deal more. How would money in that environment have moved differently from the way it has? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	424	MELZER	 I'm not sure. My only point is that I don't think we can expect money to grow if we don't provide the basic fuel that's necessary; we're demand driven. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	425	GREENSPAN	 What I'm trying to get at is that it is really an excess required reserves problem and we've locked our required reserves into an instrument that has become increasingly obsolete. I think you may raise the question on excess or free reserves or something like that, but I'm uncomfortable with total reserves as an issue. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	426	MELZER	 Well, I'm not proposing a specific approach here. I'm just saying that I would pay some attention to what is going on there. We have some uncertainty about how the aggregates are behaving; that's what we can influence. And I think we should pay some attention to it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	427	GREENSPAN	 That would be influencing by increasing reserves. I don't know any other way of doing it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	428	MELZER	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	429	GREENSPAN	 What I'm trying to get at is this: Is there additional information here other than the money supply data themselves that you feel we ought to be targeting? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	430	MELZER	 I guess what I'm suggesting, picking up on Jerry's point that we're vulnerable, is that where we're vulnerable is that somebody may look at it and say basically that by targeting the funds rate we haven't provided any reserves to permit an expansion in ﻿ the aggregates. And my answer to that is not smoke and mirrors; our best defense against somebody taking a shot at us is trying to do the right thing. And I think we have been-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	431	ANGELL	 But Tom, if we focused on reserves, don't you think that we could end up with a 2 percent fed funds rate rather easily? Are you willing to pay that price? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	432	MELZER	 I'm not suggesting that we target reserves. I'm just saying that in this uncertain environment it could be helpful because if we're sitting here pegging the funds rate at the wrong level and we're shrinking the supply of reserves, we are not going to see the money growth that we are going to need. I think that could just be helpful to us in this process. I think you all know what I've advocated over time; I'm not one who would be inclined to go nuts on the easing side, but I think this could be helpful in the other direction as well. My main point is that our best insurance policy is just to assure ourselves that we are doing the right thing. And that's going to be the best defense. We are going to be vulnerable if the record shows on a continuing basis that we're still not providing adequate reserves. And I'd be the first one to say on the other side that it's a problem, too, if those [monetary growth] rates shoot up to double-digit rates over a sustained period of time, as they very likely could with what has already been done. Anyhow, I support the Chairman's proposal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	433	GREENSPAN	 Bob Black, do you have a comment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	434	BLACK	 Yes. I was just going to say that I have a lot of sympathy for what Tom said. I think that reserve measures can be refined, though. There are several things that are reservable that are not part of M2. The whole [reserve structure] is set up with the idea of controlling Ml but we know ahead of time, because requirements against interbank deposits and government deposits are lagged, what volume of reserves we need for that. And we could put those in at the beginning of the period. Those against the M2 portion are not lagged quite as much. So anything we put out over and above that, which would be something of a refined measure of total reserves, would be available for supporting M2 and nothing else. I think we could get to something like that. Another thing I'd like to see us do is to try to make some estimates of the amount of currency that is going abroad because that [outflow means the] currency component is badly distorted and if we think that's part of our domestic money supply, we're being badly mislead. But I really think the rate of growth in the aggregates is demand-determined now, and I think as Tom does that it ought to be supply-determined to some degree and that's not easy because of the reserve structure we have. Also, I think financial innovation would create a number of instruments that would not be reservable; indeed, a lot of them in M2 are not reservable now. But I think we can get something better by moving in general in that direction. And I would support-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
199102	435	MELZER	 I forgot one other point I was going to make, which is that I think we can best defend ourselves by sticking to promising things we can control and we can affect. We cannot solve an intermediation problem in the economy, and I think that creates false expectations. But what we can do is make sure that we're providing ﻿ adequate reserves to the System so that the financial intermediaries can do with those what they will. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	436	CORRIGAN	 But no matter how you measure reserves or anything else, in the kind of situation we're in right now the only way that we can deal with this conundrum would be to run a policy, in effect deliberately, that is prepared to accept the risks of very large amounts of free reserves or excess reserves in the System. And by definition if there is something real to this so- called credit crunch, that approach to policy--no matter how you define the base or how you define reserves--carries with it the risks of a 2 percent federal funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	437	MELZER	 Which, of course, we haven't seen. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	438	CORRIGAN	 We haven't seen it because [of how] we're conducting policy. But the only fail-safe experiment --and that's what it would be--that would resolve that issue, no matter how you define the base and no matter how you measure reserves, would be the willingness of this Committee to run a policy that carries with it the risks of a 2 percent federal funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	439	MELZER	 I'm not suggesting that we use it as an operating target. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	440	CORRIGAN	 I know you're not. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	441	MELZER	 I'm just saying that if it were up to me, in this environment where we're worried about getting the money growth path, I'd hate to be sitting here three months from now with a slope on that line of total reserves that was still totally flat as it has been over the last year. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199102	442	CORRIGAN	 That's part of the reason why I made the suggestion about trying to get some reserves out through the discount window in a way in which Peter could do a pretty good job of protecting against-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	443	SPEAKER	 Sterilizing! 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	444	CORRIGAN	 Protecting against --well, sterilizing them! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199102	445	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	446	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation for all the reasons that have been articulated here. I would like at an appropriate time, now or later, to suggest a change in the order of the priorities of our considerations in the operational paragraph. I don't know whether you'd like to pursue that now or do it as a separate item. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	447	GREENSPAN	 Let's do it separately. Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	448	SEGER	 I support your view, Mr. Chairman, but I would say that the risk is definitely on the low side if for no other reason than the auto industry situation. As you know, it's responsible for the biggest chunk of the decline in the fourth quarter. Both auto ﻿ sales and production in my judgment are going to be a disaster in this quarter and right now I can't think what is going to bring them off the floor in the next quarter. That is simply one reason. In addition, there is the confidence factor. I think that is partially related to CNN and the Gulf War but I think there's another big chunk coming just from this nervousness over the financial system. I wish that weren't the case but I think it is. Certainly, a lot of easing has been done. But in order to compensate for the credit crunch, which in my judgment is definitely out there, there will be a need to do still more to offset that. I think it would be good to look at Jerry's idea, too; it strikes me as sort of extraordinary to accommodate a special challenge of this nature, which I haven't seen since the 1930s. So, I would go with [alternative B], asymmetric toward ease. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	449	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	450	GUFFEY	 Alternative B. I would prefer a symmetric directive, given the background of the easing that already has taken place and the closeness of the easing just last Friday. A symmetric directive does not imply that you do not have the flexibility to take a cut at easing between now and the next meeting on your own. And that is the insurance that I would feel comfortable with rather than the asymmetric directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
199102	451	GREENSPAN	 President McTeer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	452	MCTEER	 At the risk of getting in over my head prematurely, I want to raise a point in connection with Tom's concern about reserves and in connection with the comment about excess reserves and free reserves. I wonder if we might have some parallel now to the situation in the late 1930s when the Federal Reserve perceived [the existence of] a lot of excess reserves in the System and took action to raise reserve requirements to mop them up only to find later that the bankers didn't necessarily regard them as excess. They were excess in the legal sense, but not necessarily excess in their own minds in view of the uncertainties in the economy. I wonder if we might have a situation now where there's a difference between what bankers themselves perceive to be excess reserves and what are excess in a legal sense. If that's the case, then I think there may be some room to be concerned about the flatness of the reserve aggregates. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	53.0
199102	453	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's the reason I raised that; because Peter has that problem every day as to what the demand for excess is and it doesn't mean it's going [unintelligible]. We're going to move now to the directive and vote on alternative B, with asymmetric language toward ease. But prior to doing that, Governor Kelley has the floor--with a proposal I would presume? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	454	KELLEY	" Yes sir, if I may. As it appears in lines 72 and 73 of the operational paragraph we have stated for some time that our order of priority was ""price stability"" followed by ""trends in economic activity."" My suggestion is that, to the extent we'd like to be forthcoming in this document, it might be an appropriate time to reverse the order of those first two priorities. That would be ﻿ consistent with the reasons for our recent actions and I think it would be consistent with the Committee discussion that I've heard here yesterday and today. We have an awful lot at stake in this economy and that is what we've been discussing. But I don't think that a reversal of that magnitude would in any way indicate a downgrading of our consideration of inflation. It's certainly going to continue to be vitally important to this Committee, and it shouldn't and won't be forgotten. But at this time I think, for the record, it would be a more accurate reflection of the reality of the Committee's concerns to reverse the order of those first two priorities. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	455	SEGER	 Shouldn't we also move up monetary aggregates then. Mike? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	456	KELLEY	 Well, I don't know where-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	457	SEGER	 As I've sat and listened here today, that has received a lot of discussion. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	458	KELLEY	 Somehow I'd like to have everything be first. but that's difficult. My suggestion would be simply to reverse the first two. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	459	GREENSPAN	 You'd like to comment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	460	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I'm only going to talk about a question of the way that we conduct our business. I feel so strongly about this issue that, if we're going to do it, I'd really want to have a recorded vote on this. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	461	GREENSPAN	 On this? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	462	ANGELL	 On this. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	463	GREENSPAN	 Indeed, that we will. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	464	ANGELL	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	465	GREENSPAN	 This is an important issue. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	466	ANGELL	 Okay. In other words, a recorded vote on the amendment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	467	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	468	PARRY	 So, what is your view? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199102	469	ANGELL	 My view is that price stability needs to be there first and that it really does help the long bond market to get long rates down to have price stability as the first priority. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	470	LAWARE	 I don't often argue with my colleague on my left, [Mr. Kelley], but it seems to me that price stability and the progress toward price stability is the thing that has enabled us to make the recent moves toward ease, or one of the things that has supported that. I wouldn't want to lose sight of that as a primary target. I'd be more comfortable leaving it where it is. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
199102	471	PARRY	 I would agree with Governors Angell and LaWare; in fact, I'm a little concerned that recent trends in economic activity may be a bad basis for current policy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199102	472	GREENSPAN	 Bob Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	473	BLACK	 I agree with what Governor Angell suggested. I'd also like to move monetary aggregates up [in the list]. I'd rather have them before trends in economic activity, but that's raising an issue I don't think you want to get into. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
199102	474	BOEHNE	 I think there are times when you don't want to kick sleeping dogs and this is probably one. I know that Governor Angell feels very strongly about this issue but, frankly, I would hope that we could resolve this informally one way or the other. We have a great deal of unanimity in the Committee now, and I think that's important given all the problems out there in the economy. I think to have a separate vote on word ordering is not in the best interests of the big issues that we face. I would urge that we - - 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
199102	475	GREENSPAN	 We may not need it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	476	BOEHNE	 Well, I would hope so. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
199102	477	KELLEY	 It doesn't look like we do. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	478	HOSKINS	 I probably don't need to comment. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
199102	479	MULLINS	 My preference also would be not to change the order and not to appear to be responding to the current economic conditions, but rather to respond with policy actions. And I would agree with [unintelligible]. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	52.0
199102	480	KEEHN	 I agree with Mike's thought; but having said that, changing the order at this point I think would imply more than we want to. So, I'd be inclined to leave it as it is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199102	481	FORRESTAL	 I would feel the same way. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199102	482	GREENSPAN	 Mike, you probably want to withdraw it at this stage and resurrect it at a later time. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	483	KELLEY	 Consider it withdrawn for lack of a second! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
199102	484	BERNARD	" ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Depending upon progress toward price stability, trends in economic activity, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 3-1/2--"" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	485	KOHN	 Can we say 3 to 4 percent, using round numbers, rather than 3-3/4 and 3-1/2 percent? ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	486	BERNARD	" So it would be ""growth of both M2 and M3 over the period from December through March at annual rates of about 3 to 4 percent."" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	487	GREENSPAN	 We're changing the 3-3/4 percent? Is that it? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	488	BERNARD	 We seldom use quarters. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	489	GREENSPAN	 I'm thinking of 3-1/2 to 4 percent as more capturing what the Committee discussed because we're not going to get up to our range if we don't stipulate that kind of range. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	490	ANGELL	 The reason is that the current lags keep us from getting up there within this period, but it does get us to the range later. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199102	491	KOHN	 We have it projected up there by March. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	492	GREENSPAN	 But is 3-3/4 percent what you're projecting? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	493	KOHN	 3-3/4 percent for M3 and 3-1/2 percent for M2 . 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
199102	494	GREENSPAN	 Let's make it 3-1/2 to 4 percent; I think that may capture the point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	495	SEGER	 May I just ask one question? Has there ever been a directive put out that just went one way? In other words, do we really think that in the next six weeks or so greater reserve restraint might be pursued? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	496	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	497	SEGER	 I'm just asking if that is true; that's all I'm saying. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	498	GREENSPAN	 It's conceivable, in the spirit of President Boehne's remarks. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	499	SEGER	 This isn't a criticism. I'm just asking if that has ever been done. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199102	500	GREENSPAN	 No, I know that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199102	501	BERNARD	 Governor Seger, this is ancient history, but going back to the late 1960s the directive was quite different in form but in essence at times it was one way. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
