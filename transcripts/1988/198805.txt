198805	0	GREENSPAN	" We have a little problem with the Brazilian negotiations, which has diverted Jerry Corrigan for a short while. He'll be back, but he asks for us to get started in any event. I was listening rather closely to the discussion we have had, and it strikes me that there is fairly general uniformity of views as to what is happening to the economy. And I think that Governor Heller's view that what we are looking at is the elimination of the negatives as distinct from accumulation of the positives is exactly right. The one thing we have to be a little careful about is that we recognize that at some point, whenever you get a situation which is as uniformly positive as this, it turns. It's only a question of when it turns. The thing that's bothering me slightly about the outlook as I look at it--not in the negative sense but in the confirmation sense--is that, at this particular stage in the cycle, if we are running into the type of acceleration and inflationary process which is at the forefront of our concerns, I think we should now begin to get some significant inventory accumulation. We have all the forces in place for it: namely, intermediate prices beginning to move and general awareness of aggregate demand. Yet we are not seeing either; nor is there an acceleration of the types of commodity prices which tend to be reflective of imbalance in supply and demand. I'm not arguing for the commodity price explanation on the inflation side--where Governor Angell is coming from--but we have not had yet the secondary follow- through on metals prices and other prices, which have since stabilized, not as an indicator of inflation but, I think, as an indicator of the fact that this thing is not yet accumulating. My guess is it probably will, but I don't think the evidence is here as yet that it has. And the data we have on lead times, while higher, don't yet suggest the type of tightness that we see in a lot of individual industries. This is a process that I fear is going to create a fairly substantial acceleration at some time, but it isn't at the moment--or at least it hasn't. I'd be very curious--for those of you who have very specific insights on this, I would appreciate your addressing this issue very specifically, if you would, during the monetary discussion. I don't think there is any question that the next move that we have to make is on the upside. And the only question, basically, is whether we do it now or we do it before the next FOMC meeting on the basis of certain contingencies. The thing I feel a little uncomfortable with is the answer to this question: If we weren't meeting today, on this particular date, would we be moving or would we be waiting a couple of weeks or so? The reason I raise the question is that there is a market expectation which extrapolates itself from what we do. In other words, if we start to move sharply, then the expectation jumps very quickly. I'm a little concerned that if we move too fast, we can get significantly ahead of the curve, as has been said. And there is a stock market out there that I think could get pretty shabby. We could get confidence reversed. So, where I come out at the moment is basically for either: alternative B with asymmetrical language toward tightening, with a  fairly explicit expectation that at the appropriate point we would move up; or going up $100 million now on borrowing, also with that asymmetrical language, because I think the question really gets to an issue of whether we go up $100 million or $200 million before the next FOMC meeting. My own preference would be for ""B"" with asymmetrical language implying almost certainly moving sometime during the intermeeting period. But I don't think there are any particular dangers if we were to raise borrowing $100 million now. Frankly, I think going $200 million now, on top of what we have done already, is getting to the edge of being a little risky on the rapidity of the movement implicit in that and the extent to which there can be market extrapolations which occur as a consequence. Governor Johnson. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	1	JOHNSON	" I'm sort of following up where I left off on the tail end of the last discussion. I'd like to throw my hat in the ring and concur with what the Chairman just said. When I came into this meeting, I guess my feeling was even a little more moderate than that; although I generally tend to be--. When I walked into the last meeting I was for no change and the discussion convinced me that we needed to move. This time, I came into the meeting basically feeling that we just had voted for a $100 million increase in the borrowing average at the last FOMC meeting and we have made another $100 million increase in the borrowing average, which has just occurred. And the markets have really just absorbed this move, I think. It would be unusual, and probably a little risky, to immediately hit the market again here at this meeting with another $100 million or more, or something like alternative C, just as the market has absorbed--and I think favorably absorbed--our last move. So, I guess where I was prepared to come out was something like no change, with asymmetric language that provides the flexibility to move toward a tighter policy of maybe another $100 million increase in the borrowing average during this next intermeeting period, which I think would probably be likely. The important issue would be the timing. I still tend to favor that approach, although I guess I could actually support a $100 million move now. But I still think that it would be important to have the discretion about the timing on filtering that into the market rather than moving immediately at this meeting since we've just now absorbed a $100 million move on borrowing. I would be strongly against going for alternative C for a couple of reasons. One, I think this would be a shock to the markets; they are not prepared to absorb that, and I think they would even wonder what they're missing that we know. I think we have better information, but I don't see the kind of evidence that supports that kind of move. Secondly, I think it would raise immediately in the markets an anticipation of an imminent discount rate move. Going up $200 million on the borrowing from this point-- taking borrowings up to a $600 million average, which would take the funds rate up probably into the range of 7-1/2 percent plus, maybe 7-3/4 percent--would immediately raise expectations of a move on the discount rate. That's something I would like to avoid. I'm not against ultimately moving on the discount rate if we have to, but I think the discount rate ought to be used mainly as an extra piece of ammunition, as an important symbol for an even more serious situation, if it arises. I would prefer that it not be simply a technical adjustment to what has already taken place in the markets. Then we lose the effectiveness of what we might want to do with a discount rate move later. So, I would prefer not to create those expectations of an imminent move in the market. We have leeway to do that still, but I think that we have to be very cautious.  So my preference, once again, would be no change, with asymmetric language and the understanding that there probably would be an imminent move timed sometime within this next intermeeting period. But I'd leave it up to the Chairman and the Desk to determine that. A $100 million move now would be reasonable, but I would still prefer that the Desk remain very sensitive to how that was filtered into the markets, given the fact that they've just now absorbed a $100 million increase in borrowings in the last few days. I don't know exactly where that puts me in terms of ""A"", ""B"", and ""C""; maybe I should say that it's probably somewhere around ""B"". Although I guess my preference is ""B"" with asymmetric language, I could live with a ""B"" that would involve a $100 million borrowing move, with some sensitivity on the Desk's part.

198805	2	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	3	MORRIS	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I think in about 95 percent of the meetings I've attended in the last 20 years it would have been perfectly appropriate to make a proposal for no change in the existing policy, in the light of uncertainties that existed at the time. And I think that's one reason why we've always tended to lag. I'm particularly concerned, given our present structure of meetings. We went to this eight-meeting system back at the time when we were supposedly controlling Ml and, therefore, there was less need for frequent consultation. I think that ought to be reconsidered if we are really on an interest rate control system, even though there was a lot of sentiment against it expressed at the last meeting. To have our next meeting at the end of June involves a long intermeeting interval in this kind of situation. That doesn't mean that I disagree with your recommendation that we sort of hedge our position here--go half way, with the idea that we'll look at the incoming data in the next couple of weeks, and perhaps decide to go whole hog. I would suggest that the proper time would be to have a meeting after the new orders figures are out. If my thesis is right--that we have a head of steam building in the manufacturing sector--then that ought to be reflected in pretty strong orders figures. And if they're not strong, that would be a signal for-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	4	GREENSPAN	 We should pick that up in the purchasing managers' survey; it's probably more sensitive than most published figures. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0

198805	7	MORRIS	 In terms of approaching it this way and hedging our position--moving half way and reconsidering in a couple of weeks-- that makes good sense to me. But, if we weren't going to reconsider, I would prefer to go whole hog right now. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0

198805	10	GREENSPAN	 President Parry.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	11	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, you asked us to comment specifically about inventories. I think that there probably is some indication of accumulated inventories that are imported goods, and that's in response to higher prices. With regard to other goods, my recollection of that period in the late '70s when that occurred is that that is a bit of a lagging factor. What usually happens is that we get some pickup in the price indexes and that begins to fuel expectations; and we don't get the really rapid accumulation of inventories until somewhat later. And if that, in fact, is correct, I think maybe waiting for that as an indicator might be a little � dangerous. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	45.0
198805	12	GREENSPAN	 But this is the later; we are there now. We have already had this. Of course, we're in May and about to get into June. We just haven't seen what has been happening in the data. Historically, it would be happening just about now. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	13	PARRY	 Is that right? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	45.0
198805	14	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	15	PARRY	 Well, I thought there was more of a delay. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	45.0
198805	16	GREENSPAN	 I don't think so. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	17	PARRY	 In any case, as I see the developments, particularly the ones we've mentioned--unemployment, capacity utilization, M2, the positioning in the aggregates--it seems to me that there is a very strong case to support Bluebook alternative C. In fact, I can't imagine a more convincing case being put before us than the one that was put before us by the staff. There was general agreement with the staff's forecast; some questioning about it. But it seems to me that it is explicit in the staff's forecast that if we delay in taking action, we're going to pay a price later--conceivably, based upon what we know, in terms of having to move even more aggressively. I know it has been mentioned that we've moved twice recently. Those two moves of 1/4 of a percentage point just don't do much. And I remember earlier times when, to get any significant impacts on the economy, one would have had to move a lot more than a 1/4 of a point. So, my clear recommendation would be Bluebook alternative C. I could see as something of a compromise that we move borrowings up maybe a $100 million now. But I would hope that we would have specific plans to talk or reconvene in a couple of weeks to see what the intervening two weeks or so bring in terms of data, because I think that, unless they show weakness, we should then move again. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	45.0
198805	18	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	19	STERN	 With regard to policy, I think the timing question is a very difficult one, as you suggested. The markets-- certainly the stock market and maybe the bond market as well--probably are vulnerable if we move too far too fast. On the other hand, they're vulnerable if we delay too long. I don't know what the precise, perfect timing for this kind of action is. What I think about is our longer-term goal and the point I tried to make earlier: that whatever is likely to happen on the wage and price side, it doesn't seem to me that there's going to be any deceleration next year  unless we act. I think it is time for some further action, and I would be in favor of your second alternative, which is to go $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive, and expect that that probably will not be a big shock to the markets. In fact, depending on circumstances, it could be welcomed. And then what happens after that depends on the data that come in. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	41.0
198805	20	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	21	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, everything we've talked about this morning--the forecast, the employment and unemployment numbers, and the potential wage and price pressures --clearly and pretty uniformly indicates, I think, that the risk is on the upside and that we are worried about inflation. But, I don't interpret the last two actions we took recently as being unsubstantial. So, my preference would be to wait before we take any further action and let those two actions work their way through the economy. After all, the latest action was just a little while ago. Now, if we hadn't taken those actions, I'd be of a different mind. But, at the moment, my strong preference is to wait--perhaps not very long--maybe three or four weeks, or something like that. So, I would like to stay where we are with $400 million in borrowing, but with an asymmetrical directive. I would be prepared to support an alternative which would move it up $100 million, to $500 million, with a symmetrical directive. But I would have a real problem with moving all the way to alternative C at this point. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	39.0
198805	22	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	23	HOSKINS	 I'd like to start by sort of recapping what I see in worldwide inflation rates. I think we are looking at a situation where, for one reason or another, the inflation rates of two of the major economies out there are moving up toward ours, instead of ours moving down toward theirs. And that seems to me to be a real loss in ground. There are reasons for that; they have exceeded their monetary growth rate targets, partly in defense of the dollar. Those monetary growth rates seem to be giving the kind of impetus to spending in those economies that we would expect. And I don't see that going away any time very soon. So, worldwide, we have a potential trend that is discouraging. In terms of our own inflation rate--just to reiterate what I said earlier--we have been stalled at a rate that I think is too high for most of us, at least as stated in terms of our objective, which is price stability. Even if the staff forecast is in error, in the sense that it's too strong on the economy, it seems to me we're still faced with the prospect of inflation staying at current levels or rising. And if our objective is price stability, then we ought to begin to pursue that objective aggressively. With respect to movements, and the size of movements in policy actions, I think there are several issues that surround this discussion. One is the credibility of policy. Policy credibility means that markets believe you're going to do what you say you'll do. I find it difficult to believe that markets believe our rhetoric about price stability when the long bond rate is over 9 percent. I don't know what happened to it this morning, but I suspect that if I were advising people in the market, as I did a year or so ago, I'd say that the economy looks stronger than I thought, and that we would see a  rise in inflation and, therefore, a rise in interest rates. And I would expect the bond market to be selling off. Back on the credibility issue: if we move now, and convincingly, it seems to me that we will have a peak in interest rates that is lower than if we wait and go forward in incremental steps. A second point about credibility is the issue of confusion in the public and, perhaps, in our own minds. If we react with small moves to noisy data that come out monthly, then I think the public doesn't understand fully what we're trying to do. More importantly, I think it convinces us that we have more ability to control economic activity than we really do. I think monetary policy is a long-run policy, not a short-run policy. So, I think the markets are not as unsure about us. We have gained some credibility; and I think we ought to retain that credibility. And last, I guess I ought to say, given the strength of my statement, that I prefer alternative D. I think I'll end there. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	24	GREENSPAN	" I'll record you as ""C"" because I don't have [unintelligible] on the other end! President Boehne. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	25	BOEHNE	" I think we have to balance the notion of where we have to go, which I think is some tightening, without being disruptive to the markets. The best balancing, from my point of view, would be to raise borrowing $100 million now. When I say now, I don't mean tomorrow; I would think that we would have to give the Desk some discretion to work it in over the next week or 10 days. I would have an asymmetrical directive that would stack the deck some in the direction of tightening, but still wait to see incoming information. I guess that puts me at kind of ""B"", ""C+"", with an asymmetric directive. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	26	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	27	HELLER	 I'd like to get back to the middle of the target range for the monetary aggregates--not do it instantly, but gradually. I fully agree with the Chairman's views: alternative B with asymmetric language and $100 million on borrowing. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	28	GREENSPAN	 Do you mean $100 million at some point between- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	29	HELLER	 At some point--you feed it in slowly. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	30	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	31	GUFFEY	 Mr. Chairman, I too would join those who have a concern about upward interest rate movement. However, it seems to me that the risk is on the upside, and there's enough room to take another cut at some restraint without disrupting the markets. As a result, I would like to associate with those who would opt for a B-C alternative, which is the $500 million on borrowing; but I'd also include in that asymmetrical language toward further restraint. When I focus on moving from the $400 million to $500 million, I would just note that seasonal credit has taken its normal track and has increased rather dramatically since our last meeting from something less than $100 million to--I don't know what it was at the close of this period, but at times it was over $200 million. If you have a $400 million objective for borrowing, and over $200 million of that is seasonal, you really are depending upon how you view the seasonal--whether it's  sensitive to interest rate levels or not. I really believe that moving to $500 million rather promptly is not a major move, given the makeup of the borrowing level of $500 million. As a result, going to $500 million then, with asymmetrical language, would permit us to move on toward the C alternative depending upon what incoming information we may have in two weeks. That would be my prescription. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	20.0
198805	32	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	33	ANGELL	" I think the question that was asked for those who want to wait is: What are you waiting to see? I think it is a good question. I'm very sympathetic with the notion that we can give misleading signals in regard to what it is that it appears we are focusing on when we make the move. It does seem to me that if the staff forecast is accurate, at some point in time the discount rate change would be a part of such a move. And I point out that if that were to take place, of course, it could take place at any point in time between Open Market Committee meetings. If there are factors that would make us think that we would need that much of a change, it seems to me we ought not rule that out. So, I don't see that today is necessarily the time to move. But I would have a strong preference as to what kind of signals we use. I happen to like something in alternative C very, very well. And what I like in alternative C are the M2 growth paths. Frankly, I would like for us to look at those very carefully, and, if I thought we could wait, do nothing now in regard to a borrowing target move. That would be acceptable to me because I don't think we know at this stage what has happened on the money growth that would be anticipated from the moves we have made. Certainly, April was a month we knew wasn't going to give us very clear readings on the monetary aggregates; May looks like it might be consistent with ""C""; and if June doesn't follow that path, frankly, I'd like to have that be the factor that would cause us to make a move. I say that in keeping with my view that we will be able to achieve our movement to price level stability if we do not allow the exchange value of the dollar to fall further. I believe that an alternative C growth path of the monetary aggregates would be consistent with a stable dollar in the short-term horizon, and I'd like to have that kind of restraint. But I certainly feel comfortable in having the Chairman--he has shown already that he is responsive to these forces and that we could make this move as we see some more alternatives. So, it's okay with me to have a strong tilt in the directive and to have no change today in the borrowing target, provided there is some assurance that we will be ready to act if those monetary growth rates do not return to what I thought was the very good path that we had in 1987. Hindsight says that wasn't too bad. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	34	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	35	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I feel a little ambivalent, certainly not regarding the direction, but regarding the question of timing. We have talked about that a lot. Ed Boehne phrased it much the way I would. I would not move on the borrowing today, because I think it would be pretty quick after the last move and might perhaps signal a little more to the markets than we would intend. And we want to do this in an orderly way. So, I would bring the level up by $100 million as soon as we think the markets can accommodate that; I don't know whether that's a week or two weeks, something like that. Certainly, I'd be in favor of asymmetric language with an upward bias  in the policy directive. And I think it's not only possible, but very likely, that we will move on the second $100 million before the next meeting of the Committee. Whether we do that at a conference call or leave that entirely to you, I'm indifferent. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	35.0
198805	36	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	37	SEGER	" I'm in favor of ""B"", including the idea of adding $100 million to the borrowing target eventually, for many of the reasons that the Chairman mentioned. The main reason is, again, that we have had these two tightening moves in very recent weeks and I'm not sure that the markets have fully digested those moves. I'd be very surprised if the real economy has taken them into account or if the monetary aggregates have begun to reflect them. Also, as I mentioned before, I think we ought to pay some attention to the stock market. I think there is a lot of nervousness still there, at least among a lot of institutions. In many cases, institutions and small investors have taken a walk. I haven't heard anyone mention the thrift industry, but I think that that's a disaster area, and something we have to pay attention to. Bob Boykin, I'm sure, can speak to that, as can a number of us; and too much tightening too soon, I think, would make it a greater disaster. I can't imagine that the LDC debt situation would improve dramatically if we tighten too much. Also, as I read that table on the growth of the monetary aggregates, it seems to me that those aggregates are expected to slow whether we go with ""B"" or ""C"". And I still think that some inventory correction is in the cards. I don't know when it will be--I'm not that smart; but I think there is some excess there that is going to be worked off. In fact, when interest rates get higher, it just gives business people stronger incentive to run with less inventory. I could live with the asymmetric language as well. I think that summarizes it.

198805	39	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I think the staff has made an excellent case in its forecast for an early move. It's true we have made a couple of moves recently, and I think they have been timely and very appropriate. But I remember so many times sitting around this table when this was the apparent stage of a business cycle where traditionally we have made our largest mistakes. So I think we ought to move now. I think you've given us wise counsel in suggesting we hold that $100 million increase in the borrowed reserve figure; and I would buy that, with an asymmetric directive. I'd like to get rid of that language about the unusual flexibility. I think that's unduly fuzzy and just confuses people. And I'd like to keep open that option that we would go the other $100 million if, after two or three weeks, it looks as if we need to. In short, ""B"". "	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0

198805	41	KELLEY	" Mr. Chairman, when Bob Forrestal spoke a few minutes ago I wish that I had been the next one on the list and I could have simply said ""me too."" I think that it's a time to wait, given the evidence to date and the two recent moves, which I agree were not insignificant. I would be in favor of ""B"" and keeping the same borrowing for now, with asymmetrical language. But, as Bob  suggested, I'd be comfortable with going an additional $100 million now with symmetrical language. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	42	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	43	BOYKIN	" I agree with the position that has been stated by you, Mr. Chairman, and others. I'm a ""B-"", ""C+"", however you characterize it, with the $100 million increase in borrowing. I guess I would be inclined to move sooner rather than later on the $100 million. If I had the real courage of my convictions, as Lee Hoskins does, I would really like to line up with him. I guess I just don't have that much courage, given the situation I have down there in the Southwest. But, I think he makes a very, very good point that policy, and what it is that we can do, has to be viewed in the longer run. And I think when we temporize and rationalize some of the short-run problems we think would result from taking actions, that's not really communicated and tends to compound the problems over the longer range.

198805	44	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	45	CORRIGAN	" Well, my instincts probably are the same, but I think that for financial market reasons, if nothing else, I'd be willing to sneak up on it. To me, that would mean do the $100 million now with asymmetric language, although I could live with an arrangement in which you and Peter have some flexibility in terms of edging that $100 million in. But, certainly, I feel very strongly that we should get that first $100 million in promptly. I think that the two changes in policy that have been made in the last several weeks or so clearly have been viewed favorably by the markets as an indication that we are indeed prepared to respond to these conditions. But I agree with Bob Parry that, insofar as the economy is concerned, I doubt that they've done much of anything. I think that Don Kohn made that point in a way, earlier on, when he pointed out that nominal and real interest rates--even after those moves--are precious little different from what they were a year ago. And in the intervening year, the economy has grown at a rate that simply won't work prospectively. I also have a nagging fear here--I don't know what the staff's views on this are--that because of these highly mobile money and capital markets on a worldwide basis, that it may take a higher level of interest rates to achieve a given degree of restraint in the real world. And if that were the case, our problems that lie ahead, especially in the context of Governor Seger's comments about thrifts and a lot of other things, would be all the more difficult and all the more damaging. It is precisely for that reason that I feel so strongly that moving now is the right thing to do. I agree with comments made by Governor Johnson, I think before the coffee break, and by Lee Hoskins a few minutes ago: that we've got to avoid fine tuning here; the broad thrust of developments over the next six or seven quarters is what we have to keep in mind. And that, too, says to me that we ought to move now. I also agree with Governor Johnson on the discount rate question. In the situation that we have right now--where we're on the upside of the cycle and where we don't have to worry about frictional levels of borrowings--I don't see that there is the same kind of prejudice for a discount rate [increase] that there was on the downside, where we run into that frictional borrowings problem. So, I don't see that there is any presumption whatsoever, at least in my judgment, that if we moved--perhaps even as far as a full¬ blown ""C""--that that would create a strong bias toward having to move  the discount rate. Indeed, at the phase of things that we're in, like Governor Johnson, I personally--not that I have a final say on the discount rate--would try to keep our powder dry on the discount rate and work through the market as much as possible. I think that does two things: One, it minimizes the dangers of market disruptions; and secondly, it leaves us in a stronger position if something really adverse develops in the next month or two, or whatever. To summarize, Mr. Chairman, I would do the $100 million now, with an asymmetric directive. That's it. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	46	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	47	MELZER	" I've followed the moves that have been taken, but my sense is that, in effect, they are rather small following moves. I think at some point we're going to have to step out in front of this situation if everything we've heard today is correct. And that's going to take something more on the order of alternative C. The timing issue has been talked about. I would guess--and again, Mr. Chairman, I think you did the right thing by moving within your latitude--that if you had the benefit of all this discussion you might have moved it a full 5 0 basis points, and we wouldn't get into two increments of 25 basis points. Because of this view that I think we have to get in front and make a strong statement, I would favor ""C""; but I could certainly accept a ""B"" with asymmetrical language--$100 million now and $100 million later. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	48	GREENSPAN	 As I tabulate the results, everyone here believes, as best I can judge, that the next moves are higher. The only thing that basically differs here is whether we move now or move in a short period. What I would like to suggest is that, if I've written down correctly what I heard from everybody, there seems to be a consensus for alternative B and asymmetrical language, with a fairly strong willingness--desire, if I can put it that way--to give instructions to the Chairman and the Desk to move before the next period. I would interpret that to mean that, unless we see events which clearly are contrary to the general consensus of the outlook as one hears it today, it's almost an automatic increase. There is a strong, and I think convincing, case that is being made that we should not, under any conditions, allow ourselves to get behind the power curve on this question. And I would say further--in line with the issue Frank raised about the frequency of meetings--that should anything of moment arise that suggests the need to have a telephone meeting, I think we should. That would substitute for having to come to grips with this rescheduling question. I don't think there's any doubt that we are in a very sensitive policy period; and I think that close discussion and judgments are probably going to be needed at intervals shorter than our scheduled FOMC meetings. So, what I'd like to suggest, and I hope that Norm would find the appropriate language-- I'm sorry, there's one thing I did forget. Unfortunately, I only got from President Black his judgment about that sentence; we did not get any other appraisals on leaving that sentence in or dropping it out. I think we'll go around on that question before we take our vote. Normand, why don't you just-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	49	BERNARD	 Vice Chairman Corrigan Out  	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	50	JOHNSON	 Before we do, [please read the sentence]. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	51	BERNARD	 The Committee agrees that the current more normal approach to open market operations remains appropriate; still sensitive conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for some flexibility in operations. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	52	HOSKINS	 What about the 5 to 9 percent or 4 to 8 percent? Do you want to do that at the same time or not? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	53	GREENSPAN	 Well, no. In a certain sense-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	54	ANGELL	 It seems to me that 5 to 9 percent would be more appropriate. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	55	GREENSPAN	 5 to 9 percent is clearly-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	56	HOSKINS	 I just wanted to bring it up and make sure we didn't-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	57	GREENSPAN	" Yes, but 5 to 9 percent is in both ""B"" and ""C""; so it's automatic. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	58	BERNARD	 Governor Angell Out President Forrestal Out Governor Heller Out President Hoskins Out Governor Johnson In Governor Kelley Out President Parry Out Governor Seger In 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	59	GREENSPAN	 It's clearly [the preference of] the majority for it to be out. Anyhow, what I'd like to do is have a vote. Why don't you-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	60	BERNARD	 Do you want me to try to read this? 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	61	GREENSPAN	 I can't; I've never been able to read his writing so-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	62	BERNARD	 I'll give it a try. Unless maybe it would be better-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	63	KOHN	 Or do you want me to? Sometimes I can't read my writing either. By the way, Mr. Chairman, I think it could be handled, if you wanted to, by just having the maintain and then the tilt in the sentence. But it would be understood, and made clear in the policy record, that the Committee expected to move. But if you wanted to state something more clearly in the operational paragraph, my suggestion is as follows: Taking account of conditions in financial markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates, the Committee expected that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead. Depending on  further developments in these factors, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might--and then you'd have to be clear with the end of that tilt--be acceptable later in the intermeeting period. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	64	GREENSPAN	 I'm sorry, I think you're putting the-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	65	KOHN	 So, the first sentence has maintain in it; and then, taking out the sentence in brackets, the second sentence says taking account of all those things the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions will be appropriate in the weeks ahead. So, I presume that that means if those things don't come in the way we expect, it wouldn't be [appropriate]. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	66	GREENSPAN	 Yes. In other words, it's a fairly strong asymmetrical statement? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	67	KOHN	 Well, no; it's a statement actually stronger than that. It says we expect that a firmer-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	68	HELLER	 It's drifting up. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	69	GREENSPAN	 The timing. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	70	STERNLIGHT	 And the maintain would only be initially. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	71	KOHN	" Right; it says ""in the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions."" "	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	72	BLACK	 Initially; maintain initially. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	73	KOHN	 Initially, okay. And then, taking account of all these things, the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions will be appropriate in the weeks ahead. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	74	GREENSPAN	 Not will be, would be. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	75	KOHN	 Would be, okay. I had would originally. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	76	GREENSPAN	 Because there is, in effect, a contingency here. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	77	JOHNSON	 We could be surprised. The subjunctive is right; that's correct. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	78	KOHN	 And then I have depending on further developments in these factors--[that's not] the right word, I'll think of another word--somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might also be acceptable later in the intermeeting period. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	79	ANGELL	 So you have a preponderance of a move and a tilt also?  	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	80	KOHN	 A strong supposition of a move unless things were surprising, and then the possibility of [a further move], but there's a tilt in the possibility. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	81	GREENSPAN	 Anybody object strongly to that language? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	82	CORRIGAN	 I have trouble with it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	83	GREENSPAN	 How would you rephrase it? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	84	CORRIGAN	 I would have the first sentence say the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserves. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	85	GREENSPAN	 But that's not what the majority is. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	86	ANGELL	 Majority. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	87	CORRIGAN	 I understand that, but you asked me what I would prefer. That's what I prefer. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	88	GREENSPAN	 Oh, okay. I'm asking the question of whether I've captured the sense of the majority. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	89	HELLER	 Yes, that's good. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	90	JOHNSON	 It did mine. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	91	ANGELL	 It seems to me that that's a very appropriate response. And as I understand it then, that almost means that we would expect maybe a telephone conference call if we don't do it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	92	GREENSPAN	 No, I would not say expect; I would say if we don't, that would require one. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	93	ANGELL	 There would be a telephone conference. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	94	GREENSPAN	 It requires a telephone conference. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	95	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, could I ask for some estimate of the length of time before we move? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	96	GREENSPAN	 Two weeks. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	97	BLACK	 At the most? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	98	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	99	BOEHNE	 Mr. Chairman, I guess it all depends on how one listens to things, but I had the sense that there was a majority of people who wanted some tightening, say, in the next couple of weeks. And it would seem to me one way to do that would be to say in the implementation of policy etc., the Committee seeks to increase slightly the degree of pressure on reserve positions in the immediate weeks ahead.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	100	ANGELL	 But, Ed, the count was four people who favored an immediate tightening. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	101	BOEHNE	 But it's not immediate; it's spread over the next couple of weeks. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	102	ANGELL	 No, no. I'm just talking about a count of the voting members. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	103	BOEHNE	 Oh. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	104	ANGELL	 There were four members. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	105	BOEHNE	 But I think if you counted the people who wanted a tightening immediately, plus those who are willing to have some flexibility over the next week or two, you would have a majority. And, therefore, if you are a little vague about whether you do it right away or within the next-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	106	HELLER	 Are you talking about the Committee or the whole group? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	107	GREENSPAN	 He's talking about all the participants. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	108	BOEHNE	 Well, I didn't keep that accurate a score. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	109	GREENSPAN	 I think you're correct on the total Committee [participants]. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	110	BOEHNE	 I see. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	111	GREENSPAN	 I don't think it comes out that way [for the voting members]. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	112	BOEHNE	 All right. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	113	KELLEY	 Six; and six are voters. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	114	GREENSPAN	 Unless I'm mistaken. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	115	HOSKINS	 Can we poll for a $100 million over the next two weeks and then-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	116	ANGELL	 Sure. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	117	HOSKINS	 Of the voting members? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	118	JOHNSON	 We can certainly clarify that. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	119	GREENSPAN	 Yes. We might as well because we are very explicit on exactly what the difference is. We can do that. So, let me tell you what the language is and what the actual difference is. The question basically is the issue of $100 million now or $100 million in, say, two weeks, unless some event occurs. That's what the difference basically is in this particular group. Would that be the view? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	120	BLACK	 That's right.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	121	GREENSPAN	 In either event, there is asymmetric language in the directive over and above this. Okay, why don't you poll on that very specific question. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	122	BERNARD	 Okay. $100 million now versus $100 million in two weeks. Chairman Greenspan Two weeks. Vice Chairman Corrigan Now, but I could live with two weeks. Governor Angell Two weeks. President Black Now, but I can also live with two weeks. President Forrestal Two weeks. Governor Heller Two weeks. President Hoskins Now, but $100 million is not enough. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	123	JOHNSON	 $100 million is not enough? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	124	HELLER	 Two weeks ago. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	125	BLACK	 You haven't ruled out the $200 million, have you? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	126	ANGELL	 No, no. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	127	GREENSPAN	 No, we haven't, because we don't have enough votes for that to have-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	128	BLACK	 No, but I mean over time, after you've moved the $100 million, if these contingencies-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	129	GREENSPAN	 Well, we still have asymmetric language. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	130	ANGELL	 That's right, so it could be $100 million now and $100 million [more] before the next meeting. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	131	JOHNSON	 It's possible to have $200 million within the intermeeting period. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	132	BLACK	 That's the point I was making. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	133	GREENSPAN	 Yes; that's correct. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	134	BERNARD	 Governor Johnson Two weeks. Governor Kelley Two weeks. President Parry Now. Governor Seger Two weeks. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	135	GREENSPAN	 That's the same vote that I got before. So, unless I'm mistaken, that is captured by Don Kohn's language. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	136	BOEHNE	 Oh, it is captured; it just makes it a little stronger. It puts it right up front that you intend to tighten within two weeks.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	137	JOHNSON	 But that's with [unintelligible] any contingency. And we want to keep in some contingency; it's not very likely, but there is a contingency. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	138	GREENSPAN	 You know, there's a difference. I think we're pretty clear on what the consensus is. That language is not in the public domain, in any event, for six weeks; and I don't think that there are ambiguities on what the instructions to the Desk and Chairman are in this respect. Why don't you read the directive as we now have it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	139	BERNARD	 Mr. Kohn just suggested one additional word at the start: In the initial implementation of policy, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of conditions in financial markets, the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates, the Committee expects that a slight increase in the degree of pressure on reserve positions would be appropriate in the weeks ahead. Depending on further developments in these factors somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the- - 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	140	KOHN	 Thereafter. Mike Prell just suggested-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	141	BERNARD	 Later weeks of the period? 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	142	KOHN	 Yes, I said later in the intermeeting period. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	143	BERNARD	 Later in the intermeeting period. And then I guess we need some numbers on the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from March through June at annual rates of-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	144	ANGELL	" Let's take the ""C"" numbers. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	145	JOHNSON	 There's not enough difference between any of them to matter much. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	146	ANGELL	 I know, but that's-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	147	GREENSPAN	 6 to 7 is right; that stays in. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	148	ANGELL	 March to June? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	149	BERNARD	 March through June at annual rates of about 6 to 7 percent. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	150	ANGELL	 Why do we use March to June rather than May to June? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	151	CORRIGAN	 You don't know what May is yet. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	152	BERNARD	 That's the usual way it has been done.  	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	153	ANGELL	 Well, I know; but it seems to me that what you already have behind you, you can't alter. I thought maybe-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	154	GREENSPAN	 That period. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	155	ANGELL	 How about May to July? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	156	GREENSPAN	 You know, really it shouldn't-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	157	ANGELL	 Really. Because otherwise you convey a mistaken impression. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	158	GREENSPAN	 Don, is there any reason why? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	159	ANGELL	 Why not May to July? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	160	KOHN	 May to July? 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	161	ANGELL	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	162	KOHN	 Well, generally we focus on a quarter at a time. We'll be meeting again at the end of June, so I'm not clear why you'd want to specify-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	163	ANGELL	 I know. But what we do in June-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	164	KOHN	 The July growth rate won't-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	165	ANGELL	 But what we do in June can't affect June's growth rate or even July's growth rate. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	166	KELLEY	 Just say the intermeeting period. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	167	KOHN	 But there's very little information that will come in between now and then that will tell us very much about July's movement. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	168	ANGELL	 So I'd prefer to say 4 to 6 percent from May to July. That would give some indication here of what we're-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0

198805	190	MELZER	" [Unintelligible] because I think it tends to support [the view] that there is a desirability of having such a constraint. Now, one argument you can make is one that was in the follow-up memo I sent around, and I think we've just witnessed it in our discussion. And that is the difficulty of coming to grips with, in effect, targeting interest rates; it is difficult to deal with that process without some tool that enables you to take a longer-term view,  which I think the constraint does. Don, having complimented you on your memo, let me just say--I'm not going to criticize--but I can't really say any better than it was said in that memo why I think this type of constraint would be desirable. This is on page 10: ""Generally, periods of rapid growth in the base in recent years have been followed, with a lag, by a tightening of monetary policy. In some cases (1983, 1986) these have been periods in which the Federal Reserve had been easing. Greater attention to the base might have tempered the degree to which policy was previously eased, reducing the need for subsequent tightening, and damping the cyclical variations in interest rates, albeit at the expense of somewhat greater short-term interest rate volatility."" I think that in a nut shell makes the case right there. Again, I'd say that just the short experience I've had here on the Committee would tend to support that. With respect to the question of targets versus a constraint, I personally would be much less inclined to adopt a base target. Now, I think you could say that the base might have an advantage in that it is more directly controllable than any of the other aggregates that we presently target. Its relationship to our ultimate goals of policy is not better. And I guess I fear, and it's implied in Don's memo, that if we just decide here today, let's say, to set target ranges for the base instead of Ml, we're actually going to hurt ourselves in the process. If it is treated as the other aggregates have been--in effect, that we set the target but then we're willing to violate it--I think that could do more harm than good, frankly, to the credibility of this process. So, I'm not saying there aren't any circumstances under which I would ever favor a base target, but I don't think this is the right time. I don't think the econometric analysis could support that being the desirable thing to do. With respect to the constraint itself, there's a suggestion of a four-quarter moving average, which troubles me in this sense: I think it basically defeats the purpose of what the constraint does, which is to put some real limits on how fast or slowly the base can grow in any one quarter. Technically, with the 5 to 9 percent that has been used for demonstration purposes, if you will, with a four- quarter moving average you could have base growth rates of 20 percent, 20 percent, -2 percent, -2 percent, and back to 20 percent. In effect, you could have the same kind of volatility and still meet the constraint and, I think, suffer the adverse economic consequences that that kind of volatility in base growth occasions. Also, I think this four-quarter moving average would have some of the same potential problems as an annual target--namely, that if the base grew very slowly for two or three quarters, or very rapidly for two or three quarters, and you were approaching the end of the four-quarter moving average period, you'd be faced with a decision of whether to adjust the growth abruptly in the base to stay within this constraint, or to ignore it. I think our experience has shown us that, typically, that's a hard decision to make. And I think that, too, could undermine the credibility of this [procedure]. I guess there are two points I'd like to make in connection with this. When I suggest this 5 to 9 percent range, or whatever, I'm not saying that it should never be ignored. I think, in practice, it probably would be observed most of the time. But there could be situations where we choose to ignore it and, as has been pointed out, those situations very likely would be associated with the behavior of  currency. But that's something we can observe. Our analysis on currency has indicated that where there have been aberrations in the growth rate, they have tended to be reversed within a quarter or two. But if we had a situation like that, I think it would be related to broad economic circumstances that we would generally understand and could explain; and we could very easily justify violating the constraint. But, in general, I don't think it would be violated. The final point I would like to make is that I agree with the work that Don and the others did in terms of the nonborrowed base--that from the controllability point of view it would have an advantage. I guess what I'm not so sure about is whether we lose something in a conceptual sense, because the base is something people are familiar with. Do we lose something in the conceptual sense to go to a more esoteric concept like a nonborrowed base? I could live with either one, but I prefer the base and not the nonborrowed base; I'd live with the short-term controllability problem as, over time, I think it can be controlled. I think that's all I would care to say right now, Mr. Chairman. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0

198805	192	KOHN	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Overall, dollar exchange rates have traded within a  relatively narrow range for most of the time since your last  meeting. An abrupt movement occurred in mid-April when dollar  rates dropped lower in response to the release of disappointing  United States trade and price figures. But the dollar steadied quickly  after concerted intervention by the United States and several foreign  monetary authorities. After that it tended to trade stably but  did jump up by about one percent after the unexpectedly good  trade figures were announced this morning.  Throughout most of this period, the dollar exchange rate has  been held in rough balance by offsetting impulses.  Favoring the dollar, there is a widely held market view that  the G-7 authorities will firmly resist any substantial dollar  slippage, and that has given the dollar some support. The  successive G-7 statements, most recently after the April 13th  meeting affirming official commitment to exchange rate stability,  have gained greater conviction and credibility, particularly  since we haven't seen in recent months the public bickering among  senior financial officials that was so prevalent last year. Also  the market was impressed by the forcefulness and effectiveness of  the coordinated intervention operation in early January and again  in mid-April. In addition, now that United States economic growth is  looking more robust and recession is not in the picture, the United States  policy stance needed for domestic stability is seen to be  compatible with that needed for external adjustment, and United States  policymakers are regarded as facing less of a dilemma. Indeed,  the exchange market seems to have been reassured by signs that  the Federal Reserve adopted a less accommodative stance. The  rise in the Fed funds rates in early April, and the further rise  last week, both added to support for the dollar, as short-term  interest differentials favorable to the dollar widened.  Counterbalancing these favorable factors, concerns about the  progress of adjustment and the financing of the current account  deficit are tending to hold the dollar down. The adjustment  process appears at best to be operating very slowly and unevenly.  With domestic demand in the United States continuing to show  strength, much of the commentary from the press and from the  market focuses on the risks that the adjustment process is  getting off track. The danger is that domestic demand will  continue to suck in more imports while capacity constraints limit  the growth in exports. Today's trade figures will be seen as  more reassuring, but of course there have been other occasions  when we've seen good trade figures for a single month.  The market is also uncertain about how the United States deficit will  be financed this year. With the central banks having financed  the bulk of the United States current account deficit last year, foreign  dollar reserves are very high. These foreign central banks may  lose their taste for buying so many dollars in the exchange  market, and indeed there is talk in some quarters of the need to  diversify reserves into other currencies. So far this year, with  the dollar stable and much less official intervention, it appears  that private flows are financing a much larger share of the  deficit. Through April, dollar purchases of the G-10 plus the  rest of Europe have been equal to about 30 percent of our  estimated deficit whereas last year they equalled 75 percent. So  private flows seem to be covering a good share of the financing.  Even so, some private investors express concern about the level  of their dollar-denominated holdings and seem to be looking for  alternative investments, for example in the United Kingdom,  Canada, and Australia.  With these counteracting forces, the dollar has traded in a  relatively narrower range than earlier, but market participants  are watching carefully to see whether the dollar will be kept  attractive enough to bring in the necessary amounts.  I would like to ask your approval for the FOMC operations  undertaken since your last meeting. The Desk's operations for  the FOMC were conducted on two days, April 14 and 15, in response  to downward pressures coming from worse-than-expected figures on  United States trade and producer prices. These purchases of $240 million  against marks were financed by the Federal Reserve through the  sale of mark balances. The Desk also operated on behalf of the  United States Treasury on three days. On March 29th, the day of your last  meeting, the Desk bought $50 million against the sale of yen,  financed out of ESF balances. At the same time that the Desk was  intervening for the FOMC on April 14 and 15, it bought $2 60  million against yen, financed by the sale of SDR's under  agreement with Japan. In addition, to replenish reserves, the  System bought $9.4 million equivalent of yen from customers. The Domestic Trading Desk undertook two small  restraining moves during the past intermeeting period. The first  was an immediate outgrowth of the March 29 Committee meeting,  entailing a $100 million increase in the path allowance for  seasonal and adjustment borrowing to a level of $3 00 million.  This was expected to be associated with a rise in typical Federal  funds rates from the area of 6-1/2 percent to about 6-3/4  percent. The second tug on the reins came in early May, in  response to a sense that recent economic data have been showing  appreciable strength, with possible inflationary implications,  while broad money measures have grown in the upper parts of their  ranges. Following consultation with the Chairman, the path  borrowing allowance was raised by a further $100 million to $4 00  million with an associated expectation that Fed funds would  trade in the area of about 7 percent.  Another path change during the period was the use of a  modestly higher standard allowance for excess reserves   $950  million rather than $850 million, in recognition of further  increases in typical levels of excess reserve demand. This  change had little practical impact on reserve pressures, since we  tend to make allowances in each reserve period for the likelihood  that excess reserve demands may run somewhat over or under the  standard path provision. Using $950 million, there should be  fewer occasions when we would allow for ""higher than normal""  excess reserves demands, and some additional times when we would  allow for lower demands.  Borrowing ran a little over the path level in the April  6 and April 20 reserve periods, averaging about $330 million.  There was a further rise to about $440 million in the May 4  period, when the objective was still $300 million, as the Desk  coped with the post-tax-date bulge in Treasury balances and  firmer than desired money market conditions. So far in the  current reserve period, which ends tomorrow, borrowing has  averaged about $375 million. Part of the pick-up in borrowing  since March has been in the seasonal component, which tends to  rise in the spring even in the absence of added money market  pressure. In this sense, the increase in pressure since late  March may be a bit less than might be associated with a $200  million rise in path levels of borrowing. However, I am not  aware of a simple mechanical adjustment to be made for this so-  called ""seasonal borrowing"" seems to be product both of reserve  pressures and of strictly seasonal factors.  Funds rates tracked fairly close to expected levels,  though with some upward pressures surrounding the tax date.  Average rates hovered in the 6-3/4 - 6-7/8 percent area through  April and the first few days of May, with occasionally higher  rates that elicited fairly aggressive Desk action to help keep  reserve conditions in line with Committee intentions at the time.  Following the early May decision to foster a shade more firmness,  the Desk dragged its feet in meeting reserve needs, and this soon  led to a range of trading around 7 percent or a little above.  As this second move was being undertaken very shortly  before the Treasury began to action its quarterly refunding  issues, a particular effort was made to let the modified System  stance be perceived and digested by the market. At the same time  it was a delicate undertaking since we wanted to avoid giving an  impression that the move was any greater than the small intended  step noted above. Uncertain reserve estimates in the wake of  heavy Treasury tax flows added to the complexities. Briefly,  funds traded up to the 7-1/4-3/8 percent area, but further  reserve injections then brought the trading range back to around  7 or a shade over. We did see higher rates yesterday, though, as  the Treasury's large quarterly financing was being settled. This  morning, funds are back at 7-1/16. Through yesterday, the  average fund rate in this period is 7.08 percent.  The tax flows, with their hard-to-predict daily  patterns, directly complicated the forecasting of Treasury  balances at the Fed though the problems were much less than a  year ago. Operations were also complicated by some other, partly  related, developments. One was changes in required reserves  which stemmed to some extent from build-ups and then run-downs in  transaction accounts to pay taxes. Another was the varying  volume of extended credit, which partly changed in response to  the ebb and flow of Treasury tax and loan account balances.  However, good communications with the institutions involved  enabled us to cope pretty well with variations in extended  credit.  The increase in outright System holdings over the  period came to a net of about $7.55 billion, the bulk of it  comprising two large purchases of coupon issues in the market  totaling nearly $6.6 billion. The rest reflected purchases of  bills and notes from foreign accounts, partly offset by some  small redemptions of agency issues. The concentration on coupon  issues continued to reflect the relative scarcity of bills, as  the Treasury paid down bills while issuing more notes and bonds.  The outright purchases were somewhat less than was  contemplated when we asked for a temporary enlargement of the  leeway to $10 billion. In part this was because Treasury  balances did not climb quite as high as had been anticipated  earlier. In addition, since the last part of the run-up in  Treasury balances was expected to be reversed quickly, it seemed  more prudent to meet a sizable part of the need with self-  reversing repurchase agreements and thereby lessen the need for  big reductions in outright holdings as the Treasury's balances  worked down. Thus in the latter part of the period we made  active use of repurchase agreements, both customer-related and  for the Fed's own account. Repos provided particular flexibility  in the period when we were seeking to convey the extent of the  System's recent slight firming move.  Market yields generally rose about 4 0 to 50 basis  points over the intermeeting period, through last night. The  lower trade deficit reported this morning has shaved a few basis  points off that rise. Underlying the rise was a sense that the  economy is continuing to show solid growth not very rapid, but  at a pace that is narrowing appreciably the margins of slack in  human and physical capacity resources. Current price news  remained mixed, but a number of anecdotal reports suggested that  producers have been able to put through increases and make them  stick, while many analysts have tended to raise their estimates  of the pace of likely price pressures in coming quarters. In  part, rates moved up because of perceived or anticipated steps to  firm monetary policy but we have also heard comments to the  effect that the markets, especially longer term markets, welcomed  signs of Federal Reserve resistance to inflation, and might have  reacted more negatively to an absence of policy response. There  was particular market discouragement with the February trade  figures, reported just a month ago, given their indication of  continued strength in imports. There seems to be a growing  realization that domestic demands must be held to a slow growth  track if the trade deficit is to be overcome. The markets did  take some heart last Friday with the report of a modest rise in  April producer prices (except food and energy), especially as  this coincided with the conclusion of bidding on the Treasury  quarterly refunding package, but the underlying mood remains  quite cautious, with participants tending to interpret incoming  information on the side that would lead to higher rates. Thus a  large part of last Friday's price gains eroded on Monday as the  popular CRB commodity index pushed higher. This morning bond  prices gapped up about a point on the trade deficit number but  then gave back about half the gain.  In the Treasury market, yields on most short to  intermediate issues were up by about 45-50 basis points over the  period, while long-term issues were up a slightly more modest 40  basis points or so. The Treasury raised about $14 billion in the  coupon market, mostly in the mid quarter refunding package of 3,  10, and 30-year issues that settled yesterday. Those issues were  pretty well bid for, especially the two longer ones where  Japanese interest was very substantial. Possibly adding to  interest in the 3 0-year bond is the prospect that the Treasury  may have to skip this maturity in the next refunding as it has  now almost exhausted its authority to sell bonds at rates above  4-1/4 percent and sees only slim likelihood of getting new  authority in the next few months. It is not yet clear how well  the new refunding issues are distributed. At present they are  trading above issue price but there has been no real test of the  market since they were sold last week. A particularly intriguing  question is the solidity of placement with Japanese buyers.  These were once considered good solid ""going away"" sales, but  there is more question nowadays as to whether these buyers may  not have acquired more of the ""trading mentality"" now typical of  many United States buyers.  In the bill market, rates rose about 45-50 basis  points, following along with higher Fed funds and financing  costs, even though the Treasury was continuing to pay down bills-  -by about $9 billion during the interval, including a chunk of  cash management bills repaid after the April tax date. In  yesterday's auctions, 3- and 6-month bills went at average rates  of 6.28 and 6.50 respectively, compared with 5.69 and 6.00  percent just before the last meeting.  Various private short-term market rates, such as on  commercial paper and bank CDs, also rose on the order of 1/2  percentage point over the period, and in response major banks  raised their prime lending rates by 1/2 point to 9 percent.  In the Federal agency sector, I should mention that the  market perception of FICO issues improved perceptibly over the  period. This is not because market participants have felt any  better about the underlying situation of thrifts, which is still  seen as very grim indeed, but because of some innovative  financing in which a dealer took down a sizable block of FICO  bonds, separated the coupons from the corpus and placed the  stripped issues with investors who seemed to find the separate  pieces more appealing than the whole. This relieved the imminent  overhang of new FICO issues and caused the spreads on earlier  whole issues to narrow from about 115 basis points to something  just under 100. One has to wonder how durable this improvement  will be, but for the moment that market feels better.  As to the market's outlook more generally, it seems to  me that most observers have now folded in the System's latest  slight firming fairly completely. They seem to anticipate funds  trading around 7 percent or a shade higher. Most participants  look for little further change immediately but do seem to expect  further firming moves as the year progresses. Fewer participants  now seem to look for rate declines than was the case a month or  two ago, though the increases expected by many others are of  rather moderate size. This morning's trade data are the last major piece in the  first-quarter GNP puzzle. Ted will be saying a few words about them  later. Combined with the other items that have become available  recently, they suggest that the Commerce Department next week may well  be doubling its initial Ql growth estimate of 2-1/4 percent. Such a  number would be more in line with the labor market data, the continuing  strength of which, as you know, was the main factor leading us to raise  our projection of GNP growth in the second quarter to 3-1/2 percent.  The staff has consistently been above the average of private  forecasters in our expectations of growth since last fall, but we, too,  have been surprised by the pace of expansion thus far this year, and by  the size of the drop in the unemployment rate. The reduced slack in the  economy has been reflected in a slightly higher projected rate of wage  and price increase in coming months. However, we have not carried that  higher inflation rate through 1989; instead, on the basis of the  sentiment expressed by Committee members at the March meeting, we have  assumed that monetary policy imposes greater restraint on aggregate  demand. In this forecast, the federal funds rate moves into the 8-1/2  to 9 percent range by early 1989, and the long Treasury bond edges above  10 percent; the rise in short rates is a percentage point more than  contemplated in the last Greenbook, so that it is now more discernibly  an increase in real as well as nominal terms.  Whether such a rise in rates will be needed to contain  inflation is, of course, far from certain. Basically, our projection  raises two separate questions: first, how much slowing in output growth  is needed to prevent a pickup in inflation, and, second, is that slowing  likely to occur in the absence of greater monetary restraint?  In addressing these issues, let me begin by noting that, until  recently, indications of significant pressure on resources and of  consequent price acceleration were limited largely to crude and  intermediate materials. Compensation trends were fairly stable, even  though rising living costs were eroding real wages. It is the staff's  assessment, however, that we have entered a new phase in which the labor  markets have reached a degree of tautness that is likely to be  associated with a fuller pass-through of price increases into wages and  thus with an appreciable acceleration of labor costs.  To be sure, the available evidence on this score is still not  clearcut. The most notable piece of information, we think, is the  marked rise in the Employment Cost Index in the first quarter. This put  the increase in compensation over the year ended March at about 4  percent 1/2 to 3/4 of a point more than the twelve-month changes had  been running. Because the first-quarter number was affected by a jump  in employers' contributions for social security, one must look beneath  the totals to determine whether there are signs of more general market-  related pressure. We went through the dissection in the Greenbook. In  a nutshell, our sense from all the statistical and anecdotal information  is that there has been an overall firming, with the pickup in  manufacturing activity showing through in some convergence of the  compensation increases in the goods-producing and service sectors.  Admittedly, the step-up in pay has been surprisingly mild to  date. But, given the lags in the process, we have yet to see the full  consequences of the drop in the jobless rate that has occurred since  last fall. It is with this in mind that we have put together a forecast  that implies a need to move the unemployment rate back up if wage  pressures are to be held in check. You will note that we do project  some further rise in wage inflation, with compensation accelerating into  the 4-1/2 percent neighborhood, even though the unemployment rate rises  to 6 percent by the end of 1989. This is because consumer price  inflation is expected to run in the 5 percent range for a while, as a  result of continued increases in import prices, a rise in energy prices,  and some pass-through of higher materials costs.  If, then, it is necessary to restore somewhat greater slack to  the labor markets in order to contain inflation, the next question is  what growth rate of output is consistent with that objective. We  believe the answer is: less than 2-1/2 percent. The steepness of the  drop of the unemployment rate over the past year and a half would  suggest that the number might even be lower than that. A pattern of  outsized declines in unemployment relative to GNP growth could be  symptomatic of a deterioration in productivity as less skilled workers  are put on payrolls in a tight labor market. But we believe that GNP  growth actually has been stronger than estimated, and that later  revisions of the data will tend to move things into closer alignment  with the previous Okun's Law relationship.  Moving now to the second issue I raised earlier, what are the  chances that the required moderation of output growth would occur  without restrictive policy action? There are, after all, respected  analysts who are projecting that this expansion will slow soon of  natural causes, so to speak although I might note that some of them are  nonetheless pessimistic about the chances of avoiding a pickup in  inflation. The focus of the endogenous slowdown argument most often is  the rapid growth of nonauto inventories since the latter part of 1987.  We believe there is something to this view, but not enough.  Although the recent pace of inventory accumulation is  unsustainable over the longer haul, the undesired portion of the stock-  building seems to have been small to date, and pretty much limited to  some segments of retail trade. In the manufacturing and wholesale  sectors, the accumulation that has occurred appears to have been mainly  intentional, and related in large part to the rising demand for capital  equipment and other traded goods. With the prices of materials and  components rising rapidly, and delivery times lengthening, there  probably has been a good deal of precautionary or speculative stock-  building going on, and some firms would be happy with even more  inventory than they have. Especially in manufacturing, the current  stock-to-sales ratio is low.  In our forecast, there is a gradual slowing in inventory  investment. It is led initially by retailers, who may have to cut  prices and trim their ordering plans because consumer demand is unlikely  to be strong enough to clear up all of their problems. By the latter  part of the year, manufacturers are expected to moderate their  accumulation, when slower growth of final sales becomes evident and the  pressures on materials supplies begin to ease.  The keys to the strength of final demand still appear to be  exports and business fixed investment. As I noted earlier, Ted will be  addressing the trade picture. As regards plant and equipment spending,  we have raised our projection of 1988 real outlay growth by a couple of  percentage points. This change is almost entirely accounted for by the  great-than-anticipated surge in spending in the first quarter. If our  forecast is realized, nominal spending for the year will exceed somewhat  the increases indicated by the winter McGraw-Hill and Commerce surveys.  One would have to assign a wide range of uncertainty to our  forecast at this point. The first-quarter strength in BFI reflected in  good part an extraordinary spurt in computer shipments, which may have  been a fluke, or may have been a precursor of another wave of computer  acquisitions, perhaps stimulated by the attractiveness of new products.  More generally, there is a growing view that businesses are scaling up  investment plans and that we may be seeing the kind of capital spending  boom that has come at the mature phases of other cyclical expansions.  At the same time, though, there are continued reports of companies being  hesitant to make major commitments, in light of their fears that there  will be a recession in the next year or so, or that the dollar might  rebound.  Our capital spending forecast is, as best one can define it, in  the middle of this road. If a boom is under way, however, inflationary  pressures could well be more intense in the near term than we have  forecast and interest rates could have to rise even more than we have  indicated, given that investment activity historically has proven to be  very interest-inelastic in the short run.  As it is, in our forecast, the higher interest rates damp the  demand for housing most noticeably in the near term, and then leave  their imprint more broadly on domestic demand, in part through some  negative effect on wealth as well as on financing costs. But besides  simply limiting pressures on labor and capital resources, the rise in  interest rates is assumed to reduce the tendencies toward dollar  depreciation, and consequently import prices rise less in 1989 than in  our previous forecast. Weaker output growth and less dollar weakness  also should help damp oil price increases. It is because of these less  direct effects that we get a fairly substantial inflation-reducing  effect from a modest alteration in the growth path of GNP and only a  slight increase in unemployment relative to our last forecast. This morning, as has already been reported, the Commerce  Department released its report on United States merchandise trade in March on a  not-seasonally adjusted, c.i.f. basis. The deficit was $9-3/4 billion. The staff had expected a deficit of just under $12 billion. Exports,  which are seasonally strong in March, were at a record of almost $30  billion, somewhat higher than the staff had expected. An unanticipated  part of the increase was a surge in exports of non-monetary gold.  Imports were about $39 billion, about in line with our expectations. Oil  imports declined in both quantity and price, generally consistent with  our preliminary estimate. Non-oil imports increased further in March,  though less than implied by seasonal factors. Today's data together with  an anticipated upward revision in the deflator for non-oil imports in the  first quarter (based on the BLS price information released in late April)  suggest, as we have already discussed, a substantial upward revision in  real net exports of goods and services in the GNP accounts in the first  quarter.  However, the March trade data do not suggest a substantial  revision in the May Greenbook's outlook for balance of the forecast  period, except to reinforce our view about the underlying strength of  non-agricultural exports. That outlook is not significantly different  from the one presented in the March Greenbook, but it incorporates the  net effect of several different factors.  First, the higher path of United States interest rates now assumed in the  forecast would normally be expected to increase slightly the current  account deficit because our portfolio liabilities exceed our portfolio  assets. However, the effects in the forecast of the higher interest  rates were more than offset by other changes in our analysis of portfolio  receipts and payments that were produced by a closer examination of this  increasingly sensitive aspect of our accounts.  Second, the assumed higher path of United States interest rates real and  nominal caused us to reduce somewhat our projection of the rate of  depreciation of the dollar in terms of other G-10 countries' currencies  over the forecast period. The adjustment, which amounts to about 3  percent on the average level of the dollar by the end of 1989, depresses  real net exports a bit, but the muted J-curve implies a limited net  effect on the nominal current account balance during the forecast period.  I would note that the staff's projection for the dollar is based  primarily on a longer-term view of what is likely to be involved before  equilibrium is restored to our external accounts rather than a firmly  held view about developments over the next 6-8 quarters.  Third, the lower level of United States econcmic activity now projected  for 1989 tends to improve the outlook for our external accounts,  partially offseting the effects of the smaller depreciation of the dollar  over the projection period.  Fourth, economic expansion in the foreign industrial countries  appears to have been somewhat stronger in the first quarter than we had  earlier anticipated, with output growing on average at an annual rate of  about 2-1/2 percent. However, the pace of expansion in some countries   in particular, in Canada, the United Kingdom, and to a lesser extent  Japan along with rapid money growth in most of these countries have  added to concerns of foreign officials about inflation. Higher interest  rates in this country and the reduced downward pressure on the dollar  that we are now projecting increase the likelihood that these concerns  will give rise to somewhat tighter monetary conditions abroad. Along  with slower growth in the United States next year, the net result is  expected to be slightly less growth on average in the other industrial  countries over the balance of the forecast period averaging a bit under  2 percent at an annual rate.  Finally, as Mike mentioned, we have incorporated into the  forecast a slightly lower price of imported oil in 1989 in recognition of  weaker demand and the higher level of the dollar and of dollar interest  rates. Largely as a consequence, United States oil imports are projected to be  about $4 billion lower in 1989 than in the last Greenbook.  On balance, however, the basic contour of our forecast has not  changed significantly from that contained in the March Greenbook.  Propelled in large part by rising exports, we expect a marginally  improving trade balance in nominal terms over the remaining quarters of  this year and a larger improvement next year. Because of the  deterioration in non-trade current account transactions largely  reflecting lower capital gains due to the dollar's projected much slower  rate of depreciation the current account is expected to show little  improvement this year but greater improvement next year, declining to a  deficit of about $130 billion at an annual rate by the fourth quarter.  Meanwhile, net exports of goods and services in real terms should improve  substantially in both years; much of the improvement in nominal terms  continues to be masked by the projected faster rise in prices of imports  than in prices of exports.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As background for the Committee's consideration of its policy  options today, I thought it might be useful to review possible interpretations of financial developments since the last FOMC meeting in terms of  their implications for the thrust of monetary policy, to look at certain  key financial variables in a longer-term perspective, and to relate this  perspective to the monetary policy assumptions behind the Greenbook outlook  as already outlined by Mike and Ted.  In terms of developments since the last meeting, increases in  reserve pressures or at least the market's perception of them and in the  federal funds rate generally were preceded by upward movements in other  market interest rates, and the actual tightening moves had little market  effect. This, by itself, has little import, except to suggest that we were  doing about what the market thought we would do, given the incoming data on  the economy and prices. Whether the firming of policy represents, or was  seen as representing, increased real restraint on the economy is an open  question. The slight firming of the dollar on foreign exchange markets and  small decline in many broad measures of stock prices suggest that real  interest rates may have risen a bit over the intermeeting period. However, with long-term rates increasing about in line with short-term rates,  the firming undertaken since the last meeting seems only to have kept pace  with changing market perceptions of the strength of demands on the economy  and the potential for greater inflation. Judging from the still fairly  steep slope of the yield curve, markets apparently continue to expect  substantial further upward movements in short-term rates over coming  quarters.  The markets' expectations in this regard, as well as the staff  forecast, seem to be supported by the behavior of interest rates and other  key financial variables over the past year or so and their apparent relation to the economy. Nominal interest rates have fluctuated over a fairly  wide range over the past year, but on balance are now 1/4 to 1/2 percentage  point above their levels of a year ago. Real interest rates are far more  difficult to judge, given the problems of discerning inflation expectations. But surveys from both the University of Michigan and Richard Hoey  indicate that movements in these expectations have broadly tracked variations in nominal rates over the last year or even longer. Inflation expectations had risen substantially in April and May of 1987, dropped a bit  following the stock market crash, but by April of this year had rebounded  to levels of about last May. The pattern of expectations tracking with  nominal rates also can be seen in the tendency of long-term rates to move  up and down with short-term rates; over the past year the slope of the  yield curve has changed very little on balance. On balance, comparing one-  year ahead inflation expectations to one-year bill rates, real interest  rates appear to be a little over 2 percent or so, perhaps slightly above  their levels of one year ago, which in turn were not much different from  real rates over the previous several quarters.  The significance of this observation is that these levels and  movements in real rates were consistent with growth in the economy over  recent quarters at a pace that is not likely to be sustainable without  leading to accelerating inflation. Whether the, at most, modest increase  in real rates over the last year has been enough to contain price pressures  depends not only on the potential strength of those pressures, but also on  the influence of other key financial variables that affect spending  decisions. In this regard, the evidence is mixed. The dollar has fallen  about 7 percent over the last year against other G-10 currencies, but stock  prices also have moved lower. The slow money growth of 1987 does not seem  to have been reflected in subsequent weakness in demand, and following its  pickup early this year M2 by April was about 5 percent above its level of  a year ago. With considerable support for expansion coming from the  external sector, relatively tight monetary policy involving high real  interest rates may be necessary to get the required restraint on domestic  demand, in the context of little additional help on the fiscal side. In  the staff forecast, rates are not yet at the requisite levels, and as a  consequence, nominal and real rates are projected to rise further.  The specific course of rates over the near-term is not crucial to  the staff's forecast, as Mike indicated, but alternative C might be considered broadly consistent with something like this process of rising rates  envisioned in that forecast. All the alternatives are expected to involve  some deceleration of money growth from recent rates, given the ebbing of  tax effects and the impact of the recent turnaround opportunity costs. But  that deceleration would be greatest under C, and the firming of reserve  pressures under that alternative would establish conditions for damped  money growth in the third quarter. The monetary restraint embodied in the  staff forecast implies a marked slowing of money growth over the balance of  the year. For the year as a whole, M2 growth would be expected to be  around the middle of its range, but given its growth rate thus far this  year, this will require expansion at only a 4-3/4 percent rate from April  through December. Our econometric models actually suggest that growth a  little below the midpoint for the year could be consistent with the staff's  GNP and interest rate paths. Given its greater interest elasticity, Ml  would be expected to decelerate even more than M2 over the balance of 1987.  In fact, the narrow aggregate might show little net growth on balance from  the second to the fourth quarters of this year.  Alternative B would be consistent with delaying further action  until the tightening of recent weeks has had a chance to have some effect  on the economy and prices, or at least until incoming data suggest that  other forces already at work aren't themselves moderating the pace of  expansion. The current structure of rates does not suggest the markets  expect much if any immediate further tightening, though that could change  if incoming data continue to show strength in the economy or prices. If  there were concerns that the risks lay more on the side of strength in the  economy and greater price pressures, the Desk could be instructed, using  the usual collection of mights and woulds, to be especially alert to  indications that a tighter policy was appropriate.  With respect to other language in the directive, the Committee  may again want to consider whether it wants to retain the sentence on  additional flexibility in operations shown in brackets in the draft  directive. While operations have been sensitive to the level of the  federal funds rate at times over the recent intermeeting period, this was  mostly in the context of conveying as clearly and promptly as possible the  sense of a change in policy stance, rather than to deal with concerns about  market fragility. Interest rates and even stock prices in recent months  have not been substantially more volatile than before the October crash,  and risk premia in credit markets are comparable to earlier in 1987. Moreover, the economic outlook probably is no more uncertain than at many other  times in recent history. Even so, one has a sense that there is a  potential for large, disruptive market reactions to small events. Even  without special instructions, the Desk probably has scope in its operations  to deal with such circumstances, but if the Committee wished to stress  the possibility of a flexible approach to policy implementation, the  sentence might be retained. President Melzer makes a good case for some limit or binding  constraint on the Federal Reserve's provision of liquidity to the  economy under conditions when, judged by historic relations, that  provision is deviating very substantially from what would be considered  consistent with steady, noninflationary growth. In effect he has  proposed a policy regime that would have elements of both rules and  discretion. Discretion would be exercised so long as growth of the  nominal anchor was within a fairly wide band. But when growth got to  one side of the band, a rule would be followed to keep the anchor within  or return it to the band. The objective is to prevent very large,  cumulative errors in policy in either direction.  The key question is whether the monetary base, his proposed  nominal anchor, is sufficiently reliable to play the role of constraint  in that regime. Because his plan involves relinquishing discretion in  adjusting reserve positions under some circumstances, the Committee  ought to be reasonably confident that a growth band for the base,  however wide, generally would become binding only when the response  triggered would be stabilizing for the economy.  As a general proposition, the various statistical tests done on  the base suggest that it is no worse a guide to policy than the other  money and debt aggregates, and probably a little better. The errors in  its demand relationships are considerably less than for Ml-A and Ml, and  about in line with M2. Like all the aggregates it has undergone some  change in the 1980s, reflecting in particular deregulation of deposit  rates, which affects the demand for the base through its impact on the  derived demand for reserves. As a consequence, its demand relationship  probably has become a bit more interest sensitive since 1980. However,  the empirical tests also are consistent with a reasonably stable demand  once these changes are taken into account. And, because of the high  weight of its currency component, it remains considerably less interest  sensitive than Ml or M2, probably making it a better guide to policy  than either over the intermediate term, when disturbances to spending  are likely to be more important than disturbances to its demand.  At the least, these considerations may argue for including the  base among the aggregates for which we announce annual ranges. There  is a sense in which the base is not a very satisfying concept; it does  not coincide even theoretically with the public's transaction balances,  or a reasonably comprehensive collection of its savings instruments.  Moreover, we do not know who is holding a significant part of its  currency component. But its statistical properties may make a range for  it an attractive substitute for Ml as a narrow aggregate. Its range  could be treated like the current ranges for M2 and M3 reset each year,  and open to being violated, for example in response to unanticipated  shifts in demands for currency or reserves relative to GNP.  Whether the base is sufficiently immune to major disturbances  in its demand to serve as the trigger for the giving up of discretion  under some circumstances is a more difficult question. The relatively  small errors in its demand equation predictions give some comfort in  this regard. These result to some extent from the tendency of errors in  currency and deposit equations to be offsetting. For example, despite a  major miss in the currency equation in 1987, base growth was only 1.7  percent above what was predicted by the combined currency and deposit  equations. Thus demand side shocks, by themselves, are unlikely to  cause the base to breach a 4 or 5 percentage point band. On balance,  even making allowance for some unexplainable perturbations to demands  for currency or reserves, very strong growth in the base probably would  be associated with at least some strength in the economy. Similarly,  substantial weakness in the base would usually signal some softness in  the economy.  However, there is some irreducible risk that considerable  strength or weakness in the base would occur in circumstances in which a  response would not necessarily be appropriate. It is tempting to make  such judgments on the basis of past growth in the base relative to  President Melzer's or some other ranges. In a sense this is not a  legitimate test, since as soon as the base triggered a different  monetary policy, the subsequent paths of the base as well as the economy  would have been altered. Even so, Chart 3 following p. 11 in the Board  staff memo or the chart enclosed with President Melzer's memo provides  the raw material for such an exercise. In recent years, the base  bounds suggested by President Melzer raise the question of whether the  Federal Reserve should have reduced the degree to which it was  tightening in 1981 or easing in 1983 or 1986. In fact, each of these  episodes was followed, with some lag, by a policy reversal. But a base  constraint would have had policy responding sooner, assuming the  situation would have developed in any case.  And once the bounds were hit, the response likely would have  been quite strong, at least in interest rate terms, potentially  involving sharp reversals of previous rate movements. This results from  the interest inelasticity of the base, which implies that rate movements  might have to be substantial if the base were to be contained within the  range in the face of strong impulses to move outside. In some cases  such a response might be appropriate that is, stabilizing for the  economy. But in other cases the implied response may seem to involve  inappropriate movements in interest rates at least in terms of degree.  If the Committee wanted to adopt something like President Melzer's  proposal, at some point it would need to consider a number of subsidiary  issues. One, should it use quarterly growth rates as in his proposal,  or a moving average over several quarters? The latter might avoid  reacting to transitory shocks to the economy or base demand, but it  would risk delaying response to an emerging trend. Two, exactly how  should policy react to a potential or actual breach of the ranges? The  total base is not directly controllable, and some sort of reaction would  have to be decided on for example holding nonborrowed reserves constant  or even adjusting them depending on the size of the deviation in the  total base from its range. A nonborrowed base objective would obviate  the need for such a decision, since it could be directly controlled and  kept within the limits. The nonborrowed base also is a little more  interest sensitive, implying that rate movements at the limits might be  a little smaller than if the Committee tried to keep the total base from  moving outside its range in the short run. Three, what should the range  be; and assuming the range was initially set around recent base growth  rates, should there be a plan to reduce the range over several years by  a preset formula to something more consistent with price stability?

198805	193	HOSKINS	 Well, I think the proposal deserves serious consideration. I'm not wedded to the base itself. Given the objections that some of the Board's staff have raised, I think the nonborrowed base would do the same thing that we're trying to accomplish. I think what we're trying to accomplish with this kind of a proposal is to tie our hands, to some extent; and in doing so, I think we would give some assurance to the markets that, in fact, we will react in a certain way over time. Another thing we need to address is that we would also have to make it public--if it's to work appropriately--to get the markets to do our work for us, as the market did when we had a nonborrowed reserve targeting procedure. If we used the quarterly average approach, and it looked like the month or two coming in were going to push the quarter above that constraint, the market would perceive that and begin to push interest rates up itself. So, [this approach] would allow us to curb the base growth. I think we'd have an override of the FOMC, if conditions warranted. We'd have to take an explicit vote and that has an advantage too. If you wanted to make that tougher, you could require a two-thirds majority, or something of that nature, so that it would be a real constraint on us, a more difficult constraint. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	194	GREENSPAN	 If you can get a majority for the whole procedure. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	195	HOSKINS	 I would suggest, if we have some agreement on it, that we at least look at doing a monitoring of it, if not a range. I know Tom didn't want to put a cone out there, but the market will very quickly draw parallel lines and also draw a cone. You have parallel lines, which is basically what you're projecting as a range, and people will start in the middle of those parallel lines and begin to figure when the base is going to bump against either the ceiling or the bottom end. So, I don't think it is going to be a real issue, whether we put a range in there or not. I think the markets are going to interpret it correctly as a governor, if we announce it as such and  if we react that way. So, I think there is some reason for us to consider this, and maybe even set up the monitoring approach as early as the next Humphrey-Hawkins [meeting]. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	196	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	197	MORRIS	 Well, I have a contrary opinion. I think what we have learned in our adventures with Ml is that, if a monetary aggregate is not predictably related to nominal GNP, it is not a useful indicator for monetary policy. We went through a number of years with Ml in which the Committee had to set aside Ml as a target, then later reinstate it, hoping that it would again become a predictable indicator of nominal GNP. And then we finally removed it entirely. I think if you look at Tom's chart at the back of his memo, it's pretty clear to me that, if we had had a monetary base target in 1980, we would have had to get rid of the monetary base for the precise reasons we had to get rid of Ml as a target. If you look at the growth rate of the monetary base in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983, you'll see that it was running around 12 percent--3 percentage points above the top of the limit. Given the fact that the ratio of currency to reserves is about 2-1/2 to 1, it would have taken an extremely tight monetary policy to push that rate of growth back within the 9 percent ceiling. And I would point out that the fourth quarter of 1982 was the bottom of the worst recession we've had in this country since the 1930s. It's inconceivable to me that this FOMC, or any other FOMC, would have thought it sensible to have followed a much more restrictive policy in the fourth quarter of 1982 and the first quarter of 1983. We already had classically high interest rates. I don't know what federal funds rate would have been required to push the monetary base growth back to 9 percent, but it obviously would have been a lot higher than 20 percent, because 20 percent was not doing it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	198	MELZER	 Frank, to some extent, though, there would have been reaction to the very slow growth of the base that took place all the way through 1981 and a good deal of 1982. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	199	MORRIS	 All right; but your system would require us to react at this particular time. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	200	MELZER	 Well, I know; but you can't just pick up on some- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	201	KOHN	 If [there had been] some reaction in 1981, you might not have had the reaction-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	202	MELZER	 That's all I'm saying. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	203	KOHN	 Yes, but we can't play with what's-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	204	MORRIS	 Well, let's take a look at 1986 then. In the years immediately preceding it, we were within the band; we weren't way below except for one point in 1984. So, you can't argue in the case of 1986 that we would have been making up for a big shortfall, because there wasn't a shortfall. Yet, here again, this constraint would have required us in 1986 to have followed a substantially more restrictive monetary policy. Now, 1986 was the year in which the average unemployment rate was 7 percent; the rate of growth of nominal  GNP was 2.2 percent; the rate of growth of the GNP deflator was 2.2 percent. I submit that anything that indicates that we should have followed a severely more restrictive monetary policy in 1986 does not meet my requirements for a common sense monetary policy. And I think the Committee would have abandoned it again in 1986. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	205	MELZER	 Frank, do you know what reserves would have grown at in 1986 to meet the constraint on a quarterly basis? The answer is: 9 percent, 14 percent, 13-1/2 percent, and 12 percent. And that would have brought us inside the constraint. To me, that is very healthy reserve growth, taking into account what currency did. And it may well have necessitated much less of a reaction in the other direction in 1987. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	206	GREENSPAN	 What was the actual reserve growth? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	207	MELZER	 It was 16 percent for 1986: 9.1 percent in the first quarter; 16.6 percent; 19.3 percent; and 19.4 percent. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	208	MORRIS	 And that is because Ml was growing very rapidly. These two are closely related indicators and they have the same components. You have currency plus the reserves against transactions deposits as against currency plus transactions deposits. And they're going to tend to move in a fairly similar fashion. The weight of currency is different. But, as you argue, where the base departs is typically where you have unusual growth in deposits. So, you can't expect Ml to be something we had to get rid of as a target, and the monetary base, which is so closely related, to be something that would have given us a good guide to monetary policy during this period. It's hard for me to conceive that we would have gone through this period and not have been faced with a situation of either discounting the base as an indicator, or following a policy which, given the economic conditions, would have been a policy that was much too restrictive for the situation. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	209	MELZER	 Again, Frank, one thing I would point out is this difference between a constraint and a target. If you were targeting the base, I don't know that you'd be setting a 4 or, as Don even mentioned, a 5 percentage point range. And in my mind, there is a big difference. If you widen that range out and you're only trying to pick up the excesses at the peak, that's a lot different than relying on a target. The second thing I would-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	210	MORRIS	 But doesn't your system require that you try to get below 9 percent once you get above it? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	211	MELZER	 That's correct. Well--or you wouldn't allow it to get above it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	212	MORRIS	 Well, I just think your own evidence suggests that it's not a workable guide to monetary policy. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	213	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	214	HELLER	 I found both papers very interesting and really helpful. I think it would be very confusing to the public at large, and especially to Congress, if we had two different types of monetary control procedures--one a target and the other one a constraint. If  we ask ourselves why monetary targets were introduced in the first place, they were certainly not introduced or requested by Congress because they thought those were just some guidelines that we could flop over and under. There was clearly the intent that they be some kind of constraint, however binding. And if we suddenly introduce a second set of numbers--one set a constraint and one set a target--I think the public legitimately will ask what we are doing. Which one do you really take seriously? So the confusion that would result, I think, would be great. I think it would be useful, however, to include the monetary base among the other monetary targets, but I'd treat it on the same level as the existing targets. And one thing that's important, too, is what Don Kohn was saying--namely, that the behavior is likely to change once you introduce it as a target. For certain, once you introduce it as a constraint, the old statistical relationships probably won't hold anymore. In any case, that's where I would come out: I'd treat the two the same. I'd be in favor of having something on the short end, and because Ml probably misbehaves a little more than the base, the base is the better candidate at the short end of the spectrum. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	215	MELZER	 Well, the only problem I have with that is that it just puts it in a category of things that don't really impact our policy decisions at all. I don't think the targets have a heck of a lot of credibility either within this room or outside this room. And I think what is proposed has the ability really to influence policy actions, at the extremes, in a very constructive way. And I don't know that you get that with what you're suggesting. It would be easier to explain; there's no doubt about it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	216	HELLER	 Well then, let's rename all the targets; let's call them all constraints or something like that. You know, I take the range seriously as [the growth rates] get closer to the borders, it influences the way I vote on the current monetary targets. But I don't take them as an absolute, if all other things would indicate going the opposite way. As President Morris was saying earlier: Would you go voluntarily into a recession that would otherwise not be necessary only to stick to that constraint? And the answer would be no. Immediately, you already set up these escape clauses too. So, I think they are very much the same as the monetary targets; and if they're not the same, then we should take the monetary targets as seriously as we take the constraint. I'm in favor of looking at it; among the various options that you have there, I would be strongly inclined not to call them two different things. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	217	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	218	PARRY	 I found both papers very interesting, but I have some analytic questions that I think are relevant, as far as whether or not the base should be considered as either a target or a constraint. The work done by the Board staff suggests that the statistical properties of the monetary base are superior to those of other aggregates. The work we have done suggests just the opposite. As a matter of fact, the statistical properties of the base are inferior to those of M2. We have a much larger interest rate elasticity on the monetary base and our income elasticity of M2 is significantly less than that [for the base]. The difference appears to be a function of the period of estimation. The period of estimation in the Board's forecast goes back to the very early 1960s  and goes through the entire period. We think that the interest rate elasticity has probably increased in recent years and on the basis of our estimates, which run from 1978 through 1987, we find that the base actually has inferior statistical properties to M2. In any case, it appears as though there are significant amounts of shifts in the statistical properties that occur and I'm not sure we've paid enough attention to those kinds of shifts. They certainly could affect how reliable the monetary base could be as either a current constraint or a target in the period ahead. I guess I'd say that even though there has been a lot of analytical work done, maybe we ought to do a little more. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	45.0

198805	220	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of sympathy with what Tom is trying to do because I think his ultimate objective is to achieve price stability. I don't know how this Committee would vote on that, but I remember several years ago Chairman Volcker asked us what we thought the objective was and half of us voted for price stability alone; half voted the other way; and he didn't vote and didn't break the tie. But I think that is the ultimate objective, and I hear more and more people around here saying that. And I think Tom is trying to create a constraint that will make us really work toward that objective and not lose sight of it. But my problem with it is that even though he thinks this is a constraint, I believe, in practice, that it really might end up being used like a target. And our analysis, like Bob Parry's, suggests that M2 is really better for this in the sense of predicting the level of long-run inflation. And that, I think, is the thing we really ought to look at, rather than how well it predicts nominal GNP, since I don't think we can peg real variables over the long run. All we can do is affect the price level. So, what I would like to do is to carry the thing a step further than Tom has, and suggest we think about using total reserves and nonborrowed reserves, or something of that sort, as an operating instrument. What we have now is very akin to using free reserves, which has been fraught with problems the whole time. I know that there are some institutional changes that will improve this--you could get rid of the reserve requirements against interbank deposits, [unintelligible] deposits, nonpersonal deposits, all those things. You could have a penalty discount rate. All those things could be done, assuming you can get the legislation for some of them. In any event, if we could work in that direction, then I think we'd have something that would really be very useful to us. Of course, one of the things we would want to analyze is what this might do to short- term market rates, and I don't think we have a good handle on that. Most people think they would fluctuate a lot more; my instincts tell me that the private market would take care of that. And, even if they fluctuated more, I don't believe that would be transmitted to long- term rates to the extent that most people seem to be assuming. In any case, if we could use this as an operating variable instead of borrowed reserves, or the federal funds rate, or whatever people think it is we're using, I think it would be a very efficient way to try to achieve the very thing that Tom is advocating. Now, if it came down to a vote as to whether to do what he suggested or not do it, I would say do what he has suggested. I'd like to take it further than that, but I think it's better than what we now have, because it is a constraint. And we really don't have many constraints now, given our willingness to violate our target ranges on an bA hoc. judgmental,  basis. And I'd like a little more of a rule in there, a little more of a road map than we have, to the extent we can do it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	221	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	222	ANGELL	 I'm very appreciative of the fact that there are so many members of this Committee who place price level stability in such high regard that they want to find some way to accomplish that [objective]. This proposal, it seems to me, is somewhat deficient in that regard in that it does not have within it a proposal that, in a sense, gets you to price level stability. I guess I see it as a way to live with 5 percent or 4 percent inflation, because 4 percent inflation can occur while maintaining this kind of constraint, so-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	223	MELZER	 Wayne, those numbers are simply for the sake of example. What I've laid out is a framework. I think it would be up to the Committee to set the bands, so that's quite-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	224	ANGELL	 Yes. Second, even though I call myself a monetarist, I've always been a discretionary monetarist. And I believe that there are some circumstances--anyone who has read Irving Fisher, I think, would be aware of the fact that once you begin targeting money, and you cause money to be more scarce than it otherwise would be, you can alter the expected rate of inflation. And when you do, you get a shift in the demand for money. Now, it seems to me, that's exactly what occurred in 1986, with the worldwide deflation in commodity prices led by the plunging price of oil. Certainly, many of us were mindful of the fact that during that period of time we were getting some extreme numbers. And I remember in July, August, and September of that year looking very carefully at the commodity prices, which had turned around, and saying that we ought to put more restraint in place. And yet there were some who felt--and I think quite rightly so--that those countries with balance of trade surpluses were not engaging in action that was sufficient in regard to the survivability of the third world. And we thought it was essential, in some ways, to push the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank to more expansionary programs. And we did this, with some risk, which made it necessary for us to follow a very different course of monetary policy in 1987. And there were those who were the strict rulemakers who told us at that point in time how disastrous it was going to be. Now, as it turns out, it wasn't disastrous for us to follow a very low growth path for the monetary base during 1987. It turns out that that seems to have been exactly the right thing to have done. So, I really can't find myself in a rulemaking camp versus a discretion camp. If you want to be discretionary, then you have to ask yourself what you want to use for discretion. And I've made it very clear that commodity prices are very good signals in regard to money growth rates. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	225	GREENSPAN	 You have indeed. Mr. Vice Chairman. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	226	CORRIGAN	 Well, I probably have more sympathy for this, at this point, than I did the last time we talked but-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	227	STERN	 That's not saying a lot! 	9	92	0.0	1.0	41.0
198805	228	CORRIGAN	" [Unintelligible] a storm going on here because my thinking is probably conditioned by my worries that we  could be making a horrible mistake in monetary policy here. I do have trouble, as I said before, with the base on a kind of intellectual level. A number of comments have been made on technical issues. But leaving those somewhat technical issues aside, I think what Tom is suggesting here is that there ought to be something--whether or not it has to be precisely this--something that makes us say ""Hey, wait a minute"" in a very, very deliberate, aggressive, forceful way. And that's what I have more and more sympathy with, even though I must confess I can't really warm up to this particular proposal, for somewhat technical reasons. There are two systematic periods, using the numbers that Tom has picked, in which this thing went astray. One was in the early 1980s, and the other one, which Governor Angell was just talking about, was in 1986. Now, as Frank Morris pointed out, the Committee was aware that everything, including the base, was in the one case growing very slowly, and in the other case, growing very rapidly. But the Committee made a conscious decision--not focusing on the base itself, but on other things that in some sense are symptomatic of the base--to ignore those. Why did they make that decision? I think the answer is, in a sense, quite simple. In the early 1980s, despite the fact that we were in what turns out to have been a hell of a recession, we also still had very high inflation rates. In other words, the adjustment in the inflation process, while underway, was by no means finished and by no means locked in. There was still some concern that the inflationary momentum of the late 1970s, 1980 and 1981, was still a demon that didn't have to just be wounded, but had to be stomped out. And so there was, I think, a conscious decision to be tolerant of those shortfalls. The same was more or less true in 1986, in that the very rapid growth in the base and the other aggregates was in some sense tolerated because, among other things, the inflation rate, while certainly not zero, was low, partly for oil price reasons, and certainly not rising. And that leads me to the view that if a procedure like this were to have some functional utility, that utility might arise in a context in which there was some kind of a relationship between it and what, in fact, was going on with regard to inflation. Now, I don't want to get into the rules game, either way. But it's clearly one thing if the monetary base, or some other monetary measure, is outside of some range and the inflation rate is high and/or rising, as opposed to a situation where it's outside and the inflation rate is low and/or falling. At least in my mind's eye, if something like this were to have some utility in a policy framework, either implicitly or otherwise, somehow or other you would need to take it one step further. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	31.0
198805	229	MELZER	 Jerry, on those situations you commented on, I would just observe that those clearly would be situations, under the way this has been articulated, where the Committee could decide to violate it, and simply be obligated to explain it. And I think in both cases-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	230	ANGELL	 But what would be the money market response if the money market knows that we have these guidelines and then we decide to violate them? Don't you think there would be an expectational impact upon the money market? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	231	MELZER	 I think there could be, Wayne. But I think we're talking about a fairly extraordinary period --only two situations in eight years that might require that.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	232	ANGELL	 Yes, but you see, by March or April of 1986, or by May at least, I presume we already were running up against that constraint. And if the marketplace had seen that out there, then the path of interest rates in April and May would have been affected by market expectations of the fact that that was there. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	233	MELZER	 Well, in a sense, I think that's good. It would cause the Committee to think very carefully about whether or not we ought to be violating it. If we do, consciously, then we explain it. Right now when we violate a monetary growth range, we get into explanations of velocity. I just don't think that that is something that is bought by the public on a broad basis. It just sounds like you are talking your way around the issue with technical phrases and so forth. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	234	ANGELL	 Well, not to the target range; I think that's right 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	235	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	236	JOHNSON	 Well, as others have said, I sympathize with the goal that Tom's seeking. If we had a vote today on the price stability goal, we'd probably get a much larger consensus. I'm not sure if anybody wants to take that, but I think it's critical that-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	237	MORRIS	 We would have voted differently today. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	238	JOHNSON	 Well, what I was going to follow up with is that there's a much more difficult technical issue. Even if you agree on the goal--if we had 100 percent consensus that price stability is what we all wanted, and I think probably almost everybody would say that today--you'd still have a whole lot of disagreement about what that means. Agreeing on the goal is an important first step, but then you'd run into all kinds of problems, like: Does that mean that we should jump with both feet on every big relative price swing? If there's an oil price shock, which is one big relative price in the economy obviously as it flows through, it's going to have some temporary effects. But what do we mean by temporary? It might have a two-year effect on the price level as it works its way through. What are we going to do about that? Does that mean every time one big relative price shocks the general price level on a temporary basis that we run out there and stomp it to death? We would get into all kinds of discussions about timing, about what price stability means, and what we would accept in the form of relative price effects that could affect the general price level for a while. But if you run out and try to deal with every relative price effect--like import prices, which we've obviously agreed to absorb to some extent--what are you going to do? If you deal with every one of those, you're going to be chasing your tail, I think. If you tighten up against a relative price shock, then you're going to potentially overshoot; as that filters through the economy, then it's going to create an overreaction on the downside at some point, and then you're going to be trying to work it back up. So, to me, price stability means a long-run concept. And that may mean that you're never actually experiencing a perfect level of price stability where prices are hovering around zero. It has to mean that the mean is somewhat around zero; but even then you'd have  to admit that you want to accept periods of deflation. And I guess we could debate whether people think we ought to go through periods of deflation in order to keep the mean around zero. You can get into all kinds of difficult debates about what the proper measure of price stability is. Is it a broad index such as the CPI, PPI, the deflator? What is it? It's a difficult problem. But I still think that a goal of price stability, rather than, say, trying to improve the unemployment rate or maximize real output growth, is a step in the right direction. I think there was a time, probably, when that wasn't clear; some people would have said there was a Phillip's curve trade off and some acceptance of permanent inflation was worthwhile. I don't think that's true anymore, but I still think there is a difficult problem. Before I get too hung up on the goals, I do want to say on this specific proposal, though, that I think it would succeed in damping the volatility of the base. Having upper and lower bounds or constraints, I think, would cause monetary policy to adjust early as you're approaching the bounds rather than deal with big roller coaster effects, and would probably damp the volatility of the base growth. You'd have a much more stable growth in the base; I think it would succeed in that. But the question would be whether that gets you anything. I think the ultimate issue as to whether this specific proposal would be worthwhile rests on whether the base is a better instrument of intermediate policy than any other aggregate or anything else we have. Don had indicated that the statistical properties of the base make it somewhat equivalent to M2, although Bob Parry's people debate that. My view is that even if you look at M2, you have serious money demand problems associated with M2. My big problem is that I am not convinced that money demand is stable, even in the long run. Look at what we have experienced over the 1980s. And there have been statistical studies in the past that have found long-run breaks in the trend in the money demand in the postwar period. All you have to do is look back earlier than the postwar period; there were decades when monetary velocity was actually on a declining trend. It only turned up in the postwar period. And there have been several detected structural breaks in it even since the postwar era. Nobody can predict when those breaks will occur, and that's the difficult problem. You can feel very satisfied about the statistical properties of the base and all of a sudden there could be some structural adjustment--a long-term adjustment in the trend rate. Even though it may stabilize around this new trend rate, you might go two years trying to detect it. So, I think there is this fundamental problem with monetary aggregates. But, in saying that, I think the goal of people who want to target the monetary aggregates is a highly desirable one. That's why my preference has been to try and look at indicators like the interest spread, in conjunction with commodity prices and exchange rates. These are financial market indicators but they provide a similar type of goal to what people wanting to target the aggregates would want. I'm interested in the interest rate spread because I think that, especially under our operating procedure, that's how money is created and that's how liquidity is provided to the system. It's basically the spread between the funds rate and other rates that creates the lending incentives that take place, and of course, that determines, to some extent, the expansionary effects of money. It creates additional credit in the markers and that feeds back on the base. The way we do it now, we change the funds rate through the borrowing target, which changes the interest rate spread,  which creates new loans and feeds back on the base through reserves. And, you know, I think that that gives you some idea about the thrust of policy. I think that approach-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	239	HOSKINS	 But don't you think that if you had a constraint you'd get a different shape in the yield curve? Do you think the yield curve would look the same as it does now if the markets were operating with this constraint in mind? I think that's the point. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	240	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	241	HOSKINS	 And that's clear information. The market is going to behave differently if it knows that constraint is there in terms of long-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	242	JOHNSON	 Sure. I guess all I would say is that, yes, the yield curve might change. Obviously, as you got close to the constraint, long-term rate movements would probably be damped. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	243	GREENSPAN	 I think Lee is raising the point that if the market believed what we were doing, the long-term rates would be lower; hence, the yield spread would tend to be tilted differently from what it would otherwise be, to say the least. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	244	HOSKINS	 If they believed that the base was a real constraint. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	245	JOHNSON	 It could, but I think still the question is going to be whether that aggregate--. You know, you can get all kinds of yield curve relationships associated with that. You might get much better behavior on the long end of the market. But it's not hard to get long bonds to behave well. We could run the fed funds rate up to 20 percent today and I can assure you we'd get very good performance on the long end of the market. I think it's pretty predictable; if you create expectations of a recession, you can invert the yield curve quite nicely. But I don't think that's the ultimate goal, unless what you want is a level of expansion consistent with price stability-- whatever that is, exactly. I don't know exactly what yield curve determines that, but it's not a negative slope. It might be close to flat but who knows exactly. I don't know where that leaves me, except that it requires a lot of discretion at the moment. It really requires filtering a lot of information. I think getting the goal right, and maybe even having further debate on fleshing out these goals, would allow this process to work even better. You're always going to have differing opinions when you have 19 people sitting around a table. But I've been amazed at how well this process sort of filters all that information into a pretty good consensus. So where do we need to go? If we could get the goals down a little better, we would probably do all right. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	246	MELZER	 One thing I'd say, Manley, is that there's no way around it: our business is money--whether we like it or not and no matter how difficult it is. And I think people would generally agree that inflation is a monetary phenomenon. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	247	JOHNSON	 I don't disagree with that either.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	248	MELZER	 And, finally, I think in our discussion at the last meeting, people who have had a lot of experience around this table kind of spelled out the difficulties we have if we view our business as being one of interest rates and don't have some kind of a counterbalance based in money and reserves. To do that just because of the inherent opportunities-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	249	JOHNSON	 What I'm saying is that it's a proxy; that's always been the intermediate target to get to price stability, or whatever the goal was. Money growth isn't an end in itself; it's only an intermediate step toward what your ultimate goal is. I'm just saying that there are a lot of potential intermediate approaches to use to achieve the same end result. If we all have the same end result, we could have a slightly different view about what the intermediate steps ought to be but still reach a consensus on policy that would probably make us all happy. The base would probably perform better; my own indicators would perform better; Wayne's commodity prices would perform better. I think we would all generally be happier. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	250	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	251	BOEHNE	 I think most of the useful things that can be said about this really quite excellent paper have been said. My bottom line is that I'd like to find a rule that would keep us on track in terms of good policy. I don't know what that rule is. I don't think the base is it, largely for the same reasons that I think Ml is not it. That doesn't mean we shouldn't keep working at it. But I don't have enough confidence in this to give up much discretion at all in terms of policy. So, whatever we would like, I think it simply isn't a reality; so I think we have to continue much as we have been. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	33.0
198805	252	BLACK	 Even if you could find a perfect rule, I doubt the Committee would vote for it, because it's so much more fun making ad hoc decisions every time. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	253	MELZER	 And that hurts again. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	254	KELLEY	 It means you recognize what you saw. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	255	BLACK	 I mean I'm assuming away that problem; I still think we would vote for discretion. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	256	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	257	KELLEY	 Tom, let me ask you to comment on something a bit more mundane and workaday. I think how we employ a device such as this has a lot to do with whether or not it's useful in the first place. And I wonder how we could reliably use it without so diluting it that it becomes punchless. As I look back four quarters, and also include the current quarter, I notice that the first month in four out of the five quarters grossly exceeds the parameters on the upside. Then are those-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	258	MELZER	 Where are you looking? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	259	KELLEY	 Well, I have a chart here that the Board's staff puts out on annualized growth rates on a month-by-month basis; it  doesn't go back very far but it does go back a year; and it includes April, so I'm taking the liberty of including this quarter. For some reason--and maybe there is a reason--[monetary growth in] the first month of each quarter, four out of the five times, is way over the parameter. On both sides of the first months, there are much lower figures. And I ask myself what we would do if we [were operating under] your proposal. It says that no quarter would be permitted either to exceed the upper limit or fall below the lower limit. Well, in four of the last five quarters --taking the liberty of including this one--you have a huge number in the first month, which kind of comes out of the blue, because it follows two much lower months, and then in turn, is followed by two much lower months. And I ask myself what would we be liable to do if we sat down at this table when we just got a brand new figure that was way over [the upper limit] in the light of the pattern we have seen here in the last year or so. How could we protect ourselves against that phenomenon? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	260	MELZER	 What the proposal envisions is the average growth rate for the next quarter from the prior quarter's average. Are you looking at growth rates, Mike? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	261	KELLEY	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	262	MELZER	 Okay. So, first of all, what would the first month in one of those quarters you were talking about imply in terms of level for the average of the quarter? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	263	HELLER	 Yes, Mike is saying you look at the first month, but then you're really-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	264	MELZER	 Well, let me put it in the context of where we are right now. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	265	KELLEY	 If you look at the first month, it's like the kind of thing that Peter deals with every day, with regard to the maintenance period. For instance, let's take October: the October number was 11 percent on an annualized basis. It was followed by November at 6.9 percent and December at 3.1 percent; it averages out fine. But if we had sat down here and looked at that 11 percent in October we might have been moved to do something precipitous. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	266	MELZER	 Well, first of all, I think the staff would have some ability to project what they expected to happen in terms of the growth [vis-a-vis] what we were trying to hit as an average for the quarter. There could be a circumstance where it would require some response reasonably early in the quarter. If you look at where we are right now in this quarter, we are probably right at, or preciously close to, the level that would be permitted by a 9 percent upward bound. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	267	KELLEY	 April was 12.3 percent. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	268	MELZER	 Okay. But you just can't look at the monthly growth rates; I think you have to look at the level. And, if I looked at these correctly--I'm looking at the St. Louis base--we are roughly at where I think a 9 percent constraint would be, or a little below it. So, you would have to be asking yourself at a meeting like this: Should I be taking a step now to slow that thing down?  	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	269	GREENSPAN	 Then what happens on July 1st? In other words, suppose you take a specific action that drives it down. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	270	MELZER	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	271	GREENSPAN	 All constraints legally come off as of the beginning of the next quarter? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	272	MELZER	 Right. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	273	GREENSPAN	 Wouldn't you really want more of a rolling three-month average rather than an actual quarterly system? A quarterly system works very much like the maintenance period, where you could end up at the end of the period with some crazy stuff going on. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	274	MELZER	 I guess to the extent I thought about that part of it, I've just been looking at the average for one quarter in relation to the average for the next. I would think you could do it well. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	275	KELLEY	 That wasn't meant as a criticism, just as a problem you have to work through if it's going to be useful. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	48.0
198805	276	MELZER	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	277	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	278	STERN	 I have some considerable sympathy for this proposal, but I don't think we ought to ask too much of it, in the sense that I don't think it's going to accomplish something that is always going to have us do the right thing. But the merit I see in it, relative to current procedures, is that it does put the monetary aggregates back into the policy process--in my judgment, in a more meaningful way. I think it adds some automaticity to our response relative to the current process, at least at the extremes, and I think that's important. Maybe that's the same thing. The third point I would make is that, under some circumstances, I think it will make us less reactive and more anticipatory. And for those reasons, I think that this, at the least, merits a more serious consideration. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	41.0
198805	279	GREENSPAN	 Anyone else who wishes to make a comment who hasn't yet? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	280	SEGER	 I just have one question. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	281	GREENSPAN	 Sure. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	282	SEGER	 I read these papers with great interest. Would it be possible to run something like this off the shelf? In other words, not publicly announce that we're going to change, but act internally here as if we were trying it for six months, and just sort of simulate what the decision-making process would be? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	283	MELZER	 Sure. I would think that would be quite possible, wouldn't you Don? Not to make decisions--  	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	284	SEGER	 [We could try it] between now and, say, the end of the year or something like that; and if it did turn out to have real working potential, then put it in the Humphrey-Hawkins [report] next February. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	285	JOHNSON	 The problem is you would never get the market's response to the changes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	286	GREENSPAN	 That's what makes it tough to do. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	287	JOHNSON	 The behavioral adjustments that would take place are not there that way. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	288	HOSKINS	 I think Martha raises a good point. It would give us a chance to take a peek at it when-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	289	SEGER	 It's better than looking backwards, which is what you're doing statistically 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	290	HOSKINS	 You're right. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	291	JOHNSON	 You could at least see when you would be faced with a decision. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	292	SEGER	 Yes. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	293	HOSKINS	 You would be losing half the power. The power is the market's response to this rule, or this constraint, or governor, or band, or whatever you want to call it. That's the power of it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	294	FORRESTAL	 Well, wouldn't we be better off to test it just for a while, before locking ourselves into a statutory requirement or market expectation? I think that makes a lot of sense. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	39.0
198805	295	SEGER	 Well, it's just an idea. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	296	BLACK	 But, at a minimum, you have to tell the [Congressional] Committee next time in the Humphrey-Hawkins [testimony] that we have either rejected it, or we are looking at it and have not yet decided whether to accept it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	297	GREENSPAN	 I was sitting here keeping score. Tom did marginally better than the Orioles, but not much. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	298	HOSKINS	 But he did a lot better than when he first brought it up! 	9	92	0.0	1.0	49.0
198805	299	GREENSPAN	 However, I also kept score on the general sympathy for what it is you're trying to do. And I get the impression that what we're looking for here is more something to keep us off the path of an inadvertent acceleration of inflation. If that's the case, then what we haven't done yet is to evaluate some particular vehicles that would give us that sort of indication; that's the issue Jerry really was raising. Can I suggest that at this particular stage we rephrase the problem, not as a Tom Melzer issue, but as an FOMC issue. Let's see whether or not we can look not at the usual targeting characteristics, but strictly at the inflation  question. To give you an example: if the long-term income velocity of M2 doesn't show any significant secular trends, it means, effectively, that the GNP price level, the implicit deflator, is a close function of unit money supply defined in M2. If you go further and substitute capacity for real GNP, and cyclically adjust the price--if you can actually get that--what you're basically trying to do is to get a relationship between, say, M2 divided by capacity on the one hand--or a bit more exactly, that as a long-term indicator of price, and the inflation rate being the first difference. But, if we could get some general notion--it doesn't have to be on a monthly basis, but just as a basic thrust--I think it would capture some of the issues that we're grasping for. Heaven knows, I think we are all acutely aware that chasing interest rates, ultimately, is going to throw us off the cliff at the end. And, while there is no real strong support for Tom on this issue, I think starting from where he started and expanding from there may get us something that we might find particularly useful. Now, I just suggest that. Does anybody have any notions as to where we go from here, granting that we don't like this specific proposal? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	300	BLACK	 I think you're right, Mr. Chairman; that's the way I viewed it. I tried to take it a little farther in the direction that I thought it ought to go, which nobody else will agree with except maybe Tom Melzer and Lee Hoskins. I think that can be very productive. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	301	MELZER	 I think there's an advantage to having something in that type of equation that relates to what we do day-to-day in carrying out monetary policy. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	42.0
198805	302	GREENSPAN	 Well, yes; but remember if we have M2 in that equation, which is what would be in the one I was using, for example, that's really suggesting the nature of the noninflationary M2 target. It's a target which basically diverts itself from nominal GNP and gets away from the business cycle. It's basically looking at the long-term targets of policy which we view as noninflationary. I think we all know from our analytical work that the relationship between price and money has been a very tough one to grab. In fact, we have created such huge lags between money and prices that it gets you to wondering whether you're leading the next cycle or lagging the previous one. And I think that creates difficulties. If we have some longer-term thrust, at least we know where we're going out of line for two years. I don't think we can target any less than that. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	303	BLACK	 I would like to see us use multiple-year targets, if we can ever get to the point that we could agree on that. I think it's an exciting step. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	304	GREENSPAN	 Well, does anyone have any objection to asking Don to see whether or not he can put his people to work? If anyone has any other thoughts to throw in the hopper, it might be useful. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	305	ANGELL	 Well, Tom, would you object to paying more precise attention to M2 right now? Is there anyone here who believes that 8 percent growth of M2 is consistent with our price level stability goals? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	306	JOHNSON	 Yes, I do; I think it might be.  	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	307	BLACK	 I don't--not in the long run. I think it's the best predictor of inflation of any of the aggregates we have now. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	308	JOHNSON	 I don't know. I mean, you have to tell me what's happening on the demand side. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	309	ANGELL	 I cannot tell you. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	310	GREENSPAN	 The question is if M2 velocity secularly is flat, then you're-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	311	JOHNSON	" If you make that assumption, I agree with you completely. But I'm saying that's one hell of a big ""if"", because that's not what it has been doing the last few years. "	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	312	BLACK	 It hasn't been too far from that. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	313	JOHNSON	 Well, it has been a long way from zero. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	314	KOHN	 You have to go over a long period of time and you still get zero but-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	315	JOHNSON	 Yes, if you go back-- 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	316	KOHN	 Over a period of eight years it has been substantial-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	317	MORRIS	 But the problem is that the character of M2 has changed quite dramatically in recent years. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	318	JOHNSON	 No doubt about it. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	319	MORRIS	 It used to be that M2 paid a below-market rate. Now it pays a market rate. And there is no way that you can take the old data on M2 and come up with any conclusions that will permit you to forecast the M2/GNP relationship in the future. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	320	GREENSPAN	 Regrettably, that is a legitimate criticism. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	321	KOHN	 Except that our equations on M2 aren't doing that badly once we take into account the opportunity cost changes. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	322	GREENSPAN	 Well, why don't we take a shot at it; and we will report back to you and see where we go from there. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	323	KOHN	 Any and all inputs from Reserve Banks-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	324	BLACK	 You want to implicate us! 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	325	JOHNSON	 Don, since when has it been doing better? It's been what--a few quarters, right? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	326	KOHN	 No, no. 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	327	HELLER	 But the demand for money has gone through--  	9	92	0.0	1.0	46.0
198805	328	KOHN	 The demand equation, once it takes account of the interest rate changes, hasn't been that far off over the last several years. But the velocity changes-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	329	JOHNSON	 Can you predict the interest rate movements? Because if you can't, you're in big trouble. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	330	KOHN	 That's the problem, which is what we said-- 	9	92	0.0	0.0	999.0
198805	331	JOHNSON	 It just gets you into interest rate forecasting. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	332	BLACK	 If you can predict the prices, do you need to predict the interest rates? 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	333	JOHNSON	 No. That's my whole point. That's why I'm saying I've been looking at these other indicators that seem to do a better job than prices. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	334	BLACK	 I don't always understand these things, but weakly I'd suggest that it is a pretty darn good predictor of the price level. 	9	92	0.0	1.0	7.0
198805	335	GREENSPAN	 Well, can I terminate this conversation now, and just suggest that we will report back? If we don't, we're going to break all records on the length of an FOMC meeting. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198805	336	MORRIS	 I'd say we won't break 1979, Mr. Chairman. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	1.0
198805	337	ANGELL	 October 6th. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198805	338	JOHNSON	 How long did that one last? 	1	1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198805	339	SEGER	 Probably three days. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198805	340	GREENSPAN	 Do we have some lunch? We can now go into our luncheon session. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
