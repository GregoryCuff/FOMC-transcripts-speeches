198812	5	CROSS	 Negative sentiment towards the dollar was intense  during most of the intermeeting period. Last week, however, the dollar recovered partially from its lows of late November and its  decline for the period was pared back to about 2 percent. The  Desk intervened in substantial amounts during the period, with  all operations split equally between the Federal Reserve and the  Treasury.  Selling pressures against the dollar broke through  around the beginning of November. Although questions about United States  economic policies existed before that, and there were widespread  concerns that the international adjustment process was slowing  down, the markets generally believed that the United States authorities  would defend the dollar through the election so that market  pressures would not emerge as an issue in the Presidential  campaign. As election day approached, however, the foreign  exchange markets began to test the dollar and by the time of your  last meeting on November 1, we had already started to intervene  to support the dollar. Immediately after the election, dollar  selling intensified, much of it apparently speculative. Market  participants were questioning whether adjustment was still  proceeding, and feared that the new Administration might not be  able to deal promptly and effectively with the twin deficit  problems, in the environment of a Congress controlled more  strongly than before by the opposition party.  From our first operations on October 31 through the  first two weeks of November, we intervened on 5 occasions to buy  about $1 billion, all against Japanese yen. The market was aware  of our operations but not greatly impressed, with many believing  them aimed more at smoothing the dollar's decline so as to  prevent adverse effects on other financial markets rather than  reflecting a determination to halt the dollar's fall. Despite  official statements to the contrary, market participants thought  that there may have been a shift in the United States view towards the  exchange rate. For several months, some market observers had  suspected that any incoming Administration might tolerate or even  welcome a lower dollar, and took every opportunity to interpret  any actions or comments   such as Martin Feldstein's statement  ~ in that light.  The dollar continued to come under selling pressure  during much of the rest of November. On November 17 and 18,  there was concerted intervention in both marks and yen that did  seem to give the market the impression, at least for a while,  that the Group of Seven (G-7) remained firmly committed to  maintaining stability in the exchange markets. Selling pressures  against the dollar abated briefly after these coordinated  operations. But when pressures reemerged, and we attempted to  counter them through intervention not coordinated with European  central banks, traders again began to express the belief that the  United States authorities might tolerate a gradual decline in the dollar.  On November 25, the dollar hit its lows of the intermeeting  period of Y 120.65 against the yen and DM 1.7085 against the  mark.  For the next ten days, in late November and early  December, market sentiment toward the dollar ebbed and flowed,  depending on evidence either that economic growth was moderating and the Fed might not be ready to change its policy stance (a  conclusion drawn from the Beige Book) or that the economy was  really stronger than generally appreciated (a conclusion drawn  from employment data). Also the cumulative effect of all the  dollar intervention support during the month was beginning to  leave a more favorable impression. The sense of central bank  support was strengthened when, after the market saw the strong  labor market statistics and noted that they were not followed by  an immediate discount rate increase, the desk came into the  market visibly and aggressively to resist a renewed drop in the  exchange rate by buying dollars against both marks and yen. In  addition, the efforts of President-elect Bush to put together a  team of pragmatic advisors, to reconcile differences with members  of Congress, and to attach priority to dealing with the deficit  problem gave some of the more pessimistic market observers reason  to pause. In these circumstances, the dollar traded tentatively,  though above its lows of the period.  But confidence in the dollar remained uncertain, and  the market was still quite short of dollars when Gorbachev's  speech at the UN briefly tantalized market participants with  dreams of an early and significant cut in United States military  expenditures. What was important about this latest episode was  not that, in the euphoria of the moment, the dollar briefly  rallied to DM 1.7730 or Y 124.25. It was, rather, that the  market was reminded that speculators shorting the dollar could  get hurt. Therefore, the period ended with the dollar still shaky but on a somewhat better footing, bolstered by expectations of higher interest rates, and with some renewed sense of two-way risk in the market, a sense which we hope the major central banks  can preserve despite some differences in opinion about near-term strategies for exchange rates and interest rates. For the period as a whole, we sold far more yen    $1.77 billion equivalent   than marks   $630 million  equivalent. Yet mark operations seem to have relatively greater  market impact. The difference may reflect, partly, that the  mark, more than the yen, tends to be the speculative vehicle of  choice for foreign exchange market speculators worldwide. In  addition, the market appears to hold different attitudes about  the fundamental strengths and prospects of the two currencies.  As for the yen, market participants have long been  impressed by the agility with which Japan has responded to its  currency's appreciation. Recent economic reports from Japan  support the picture of strong domestic demand and continued  export growth, with market projections showing increases in both  Japan's trade and current account surpluses through 1990. This  strong performance has continued without a pick-up in inflation,  suggesting to many that the yen should move even higher. Also,  with so much of the global imbalance reflected directly in the  bilateral trade between the United States and Japan, there is a widespread  view that a large share of the total exchange rate adjustment  must come in the dollar/yen relationship. Thus, the market still  sees a considerable upside potential for the yen over time.  For the mark, the picture was seen differently.  Although the market view of German economic performance has  improved recently, prospects for investment in Germany were less  than encouraging for much of the year, and both long-term and  short-term capital flowed out of mark assets on a large scale.  The Bundesbank is concerned that the mark appears relatively weak  at a time when Germany has a strong and growing current account  surplus and may feel the need to demonstrate its commitment to  sound economic management when setting its monetary targets for  1989 next Thursday.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to recommend that the  Committee approve the Federal Reserve's share of the Desk's  dollar purchases during the period. In other operations during  the period the Desk purchased a total of $25.2 million equivalent  of Japanese yen on behalf of the United States Treasury to augment  balances. The Central Bank of the Argentine Republic, on  November 22, drew $79.5 million on a previously existing United States  Treasury short-term financing facility and subsequently repaid  $31.8 million on November 23. The United States Treasury's short-term  financing facilities for Brazil and Yugoslavia matured on  November 30. The Central Bank of Brazil had repaid their $232.5  million drawing on a $250.0 million facility on August 26. The  remaining $17.5 million was not drawn. The National Bank of  Yugoslavia had repaid the outstanding balance on its $50.0  million swap facility on September 30. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	6	GREENSPAN	 Any questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	7	BOEHNE	 Could you elaborate on your comments about the German mark--the view that the mark is too weak? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198812	8	CROSS	 I didn't say that I thought it was too weak. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	9	BOEHNE	 I know. The Chairman thinks it's too weak, but it's at the top of the snake, is it not? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198812	10	CROSS	 The mark has weakened some during the course of this year on a weighted-average basis. At the same time, the German current account balance has been strengthening, their trade balance has been strengthening. Now with us, our trade balance has been improving, Mr. Chairman. There is a European entry factor or element to this, and the Germans have been increasing their trade balance with a number of their European partners, both in the EMS and outside the EMS. So, their concern has been that the mark not appear to be too weak during the period when they see the trade balance strengthening. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	11	FORRESTAL	 Sam, it was reported this morning that perhaps the market is looking for a trade number of around $10 to $11 billion. Is that your assessment of what they are looking for? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
198812	12	CROSS	 Well, we have heard numbers anywhere from $8-1/2 to $12-1/2 billion. Now, it gets a little confusing because there are two bases for calculating it these days, and we are not always sure people are talking in the same terms. The general view seems to be that the trade deficit will be around $10 billion this time. But there are some-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	13	GREENSPAN	 That's with seasonal adjustment? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	14	CROSS	 That's CIF, yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	15	GREENSPAN	 CIF, with seasonal adjustment? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	16	CROSS	 Yes, CIF and seasonally adjusted.  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	17	FORRESTAL	 So, with anything above $10 billion, you'd expect some pressures on the dollar? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
198812	18	CROSS	 Well, I wouldn't jump to any big conclusions because we've had other occasions when the number came in very well and the dollar moved down. I believe the market has seen that it's possible to get hurt by shorting the dollar too much. And I think the trade figures are certainly hanging over the market in an important way. So I think a lot of participants are not anxious to do too much until then. It could be that a good trade figure would provide a little more support, but it's not a sure thing. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	19	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	20	SEGER	" If this is too silly a question, tell me and I will retract it. How do you decide, when you intervene, whether to really come in like ""gangbusters"" or to make sort of an anemic effort? In your comments, it sounded to me as if you said that earlier in the month market participants were disappointed with our intervention--I'm paraphrasing--because it looked as if we were just trying to let the dollar down easily and we weren't really trying to hold it up. Did we really intend that? "	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	21	CROSS	 That was not our intention and indeed when I got asked, at the press conference when we released this quarterly report, whether we were just trying to smooth the dollar, I said we weren't. We are trying to do more than that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	22	SEGER	 So, why didn't we go in and really hit it then? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	23	CROSS	 Well, for one thing, unless you're really going to intervene in very, very large amounts it's not always crystal clear just what the reaction is going to be to an expenditure of 'X' amount of dollars. But also we have to work this out very closely with our colleagues in the Treasury who may or may not feel that it is a good idea to intervene very strongly at a particular time. And, also, not in the precise amounts always, but we do try to coordinate our efforts with the other central banks so that we all give the same kind of message. There were occasions in this period when a number of people in the market thought that our efforts were not big enough really to smack the exchange rate in a decisive way. I do think that over a period of several weeks as we continued to do this that the cumulative effect of this became more noticeable and more important. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	24	SEGER	 Thank you. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	25	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions for Mr. Cross? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the transactions since the November meeting? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	26	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	27	SEGER	 Second. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	28	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Mr. Sternlight. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	29	STERNLIGHT	" Domestic open market operations since the last  Committee meeting have been complicated by an uncertain and elusive relationship between discount window borrowings and money  market rates, and by several wire system mishaps that led to  spikes in borrowing unrelated to general market pressures. In  hindsight, the relationship of borrowing and funds rates was  already coming unglued in October or even earlier, but it seemed  plausible as the new period began to expect things to ""return to  normal."" They didn't. Thus after starting the period with a  planned borrowing gap of $600 million, we found ourselves  continually battling to keep funds from rising appreciably above  the anticipated 8 to 8-1/4 percent range even while borrowing ran  noticeably below its planned level. In effect, to avoid having  funds persistently trade well above the range envisioned by the  Committee, we provided some additional nonborrowed reserves.  This situation was drawn to the Committee's attention  in a conference call on November 22, and following that call we  used a $400 million path level of borrowing, anticipating   though still with considerable uncertainty that funds might  range around 8-3/8 percent. Primarily, this recognized an  apparent shift in the borrowing-Fed funds relationship, but it  was also noted at that call that recent news on the economy had  suggested continuing strength, with overtones of potential inflationary pressure. In this context, a funds rate around  8-3/8 percent was considered acceptable where earlier in the period this level had been resisted. Actual funds rates didn't change all that much averaging about 8.30 percent in the  November 16 maintenance period and 8.38 in the November 30  period, but the more discerning market participants noticed the  difference.  Following the strong November employment report  released on December 2, market anticipation of System firming  tended to pull the funds rate still higher. Without a deliberate  Desk change, funds edged up to around 8-1/2 - 8-5/8 percent, with  many market participants imminently expecting a discount rate  move. Meantime, the Desk sought at least to keep pace with  projected reserve needs, especially when funds rates traded  significantly above the expected. In this setting, funds have  averaged about 8.57 percent so far in the current reserve period  through yesterday; today, it's been a shade softer   8-7/16.  Several separate incidents involving computers and  funds transmission systems played hob with actual borrowing  levels during the period. In the November 16 period, a problem  at a large midwest bank caused that institution to pile up  massive excess reserves, which it couldn't work off over the rest  of the period, while some other banks that had expected to  receive funds had to use the discount window. In response, we  allowed for higher excess reserves while borrowing averaged  higher than it would otherwise   though still not above the path  level then in use. In the November 30 period, a large New York  bank had technical problems that caused it to borrow in size on a  Friday, leading the Desk to make some allowance for special  situation borrowing rather than over-provide reserves. And  finally, early in the current reserve period, a problem at a  Reserve Bank produced a massive one-day reserve deficiency that  forced several money center banks to borrow even though there  were later ""as-of"" reserve adjustments. Once again it was deemed  appropriate to treat the special borrowing as more akin to  nonborrowed reserves.  On days free of these special problems, adjustment and  seasonal borrowing during the intermeeting period averaged about  $315 million, while inclusion of the problem days would produce  an average of about $535 million.  Money growth behaved reasonably well in the recent  period. M2 increased at just under 4 percent in the 2 months  ended in November, somewhat ahead of the slow 2-1/2 percent  September-December pace contemplated at the last meeting, leaving  November M2 modestly below the mid-point of its annual growth  cone. M3 growth of 5-1/2 percent for the 2 months ended November  tracked close to the indicated 6 percent September-December path,  leaving M3 somewhat over its annual cone mid-point. Ml barely  grew over the most recent two months edging up at just over a  1 percent rate, which placed November at a modest 4 percent  growth rate since the fourth quarter last year.  To meet seasonal reserve needs over the intermeeting  period, the Desk bought over $7-1/2 billion of Treasury issues, making use of the temporarily enlarged leeway. Market purchases included $3 billion of bills at the start of the period and  $3.5 billion of Treasury coupon issues in late November, While  about $1.2 billion of bills and notes were purchased from foreign accounts over the course of the interval. On most days the Desk  arranged either System or customer repurchase agreements.  Incidentally, so far in 1988, with just a few weeks  remaining, our net outright purchases of Treasury issues come to  a little over $14 billion, including $5 billion in bills and  somewhat over $9 billion in coupon issues. This year's rise, to  date, is well short of last year's $21 billion portfolio  increase. Part of the reason for a lesser rise this year can be  traced to changes in foreign currency holdings this year and  last, and the meeting of some reserve needs this year through  extended credit borrowing.  Yields on Treasury issues generally rose during the  intermeeting period, but by widely varying amounts in a range of  about 25 to 95 basis points. The smaller increases were posted  for longer maturities so that the yield curve flattened and even  inverted slightly. The major force pushing yields higher was the  market's perception that the economy remains strong, or perhaps  has regained some strength after a summer lull. Major price  moves came in the wake of the unexpectedly strong employment  reports for October and November. A softening dollar and rising oil prices also encouraged higher yields, though these factors were erratic over the period.  Many market participants assumed that monetary policy  was already beginning to firm up a bit further after holding  steady in September and October, or soon would do so in response to the inflationary potential implied by the economy's continuing  strength and absorption of available resources. As the period  began, market observers seemed to expect that funds rates would  soon return to the 8-1/4 percent area prevalent earlier in the  fall. By late November, most participants were reconciled to a  funds range around 8-3/8 percent, and this gave way in early  December, after another strong employment report, to anticipation  of 8-1/2 or 8-5/8 percent, quite likely to be followed by a  discount rate rise.  The largest rate increases in the Treasury list were in  the 1 to 2-year maturity range, sending 2-year yields somewhat  above the 30-year yield. The peak in Treasury yields if one can  so dignify the modest differentials in an essentially flat  curve now seems to be in the 2 to 10-year range. It may be  reading too much into the recent rate trends, but one view is  that the modest size of increases at the long end has reflected  market confidence that, while the economy is strong and inflation  a threat, the central bank will take appropriate action to keep  the situation in hand. There could also be technical factors at  work, such as investor switching from corporate to Treasury bonds and active stripping of long Treasury issues which reduces  available supplies.  The Treasury raised roughly $37 billion, net, over the  period, divided about evenly between bills and coupon issues. Coupon issues included $9 billion of new 30-year bonds, the first in 6 months, offered after the President signed legislation  removing the 4-1/4 percent ceiling on bonds that has long been a thorn in the side of Treasury debt managers. The new bonds were  auctioned at 9.10 percent on November 17 and with some net price  gains in the longer end over the latter part of the interval,  they closed to yield a little under 9 percent. As the period  began the active long bond yielded about 8.72 percent.  Key bill rates rose about 75-90 basis points over the  interval, propelled by anticipations of policy firming, supply increases, and some actual rise in funds and financing costs.  The latest 3-and 6-month issues were auctioned yesterday at 7.98  and 8.21 percent, respectively, up from 7.37 and 7.48 percent at  the end of October.  Private short-term rates also rose substantially over  the period by 80-90 basis points or so in the 3-month area and  even more for shorter maturities. In addition to policy firming  concerns, year-end factors and possibly preparations to fund  upcoming corporate buy-outs may have played a role in the rate rise. Banks raised their prime rates 1/2 percentage point to  10-1/2 percent in a widely anticipated move.  In the Federal agency market, FICO sold two issues,  each for $700 million, through competitive syndicate bidding for  the first time. The yield spreads against Treasury bonds  narrowed despite the gloomy thrift industry outlook as it is widely assumed that massive Federal help will be forthcoming for  this industry.  The corporate market, especially industrial issues,  remained under somewhat of a cloud in the wake of the RJR-Nabisco  buy-out plans, but light issuance actually permitted some  measures of yield spreads over Treasuries to narrow a bit. A few corporate issues have come to market with special features to protect against downgradings in the event of take-overs. High- yield bonds fared relatively well vis-a-vis Treasury issues  despite prospective substantial enlargements to supply.  Meantime, a threat continues to hang over the Drexel  Burnham firm a major financial market participant. There should  be news quite soon either of a settlement with the Justice  Department, with admission to some serious charges, or of a  criminal indictment of the firm. In either case the firm could  face rough going.  Finally, on a housekeeping note, the Desk has begun a  trading relationship with two additional firms in recent days   S.G. Warburg and Wertheim Schroeder. Both firms had been primary  dealers since last June. We now trade with all but 5 of the 46  primary dealers.  "	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	30	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Sternlight? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	31	MELZER	 Peter, what's in the market in terms of the confusion over borrowings? How are people interpreting policy right now, and how importantly do borrowings figure into that? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	42.0
198812	32	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I think there was a realization as we went through November that we must have made some allowance for what the market also perceived as a change in the relationship between federal funds and borrowings. In fact, on the very day the Committee was having that conference call--November 22--I happened to read one of the market letters, and the writer assumed that we were probably using something like $400 million rather than $600 million, so that particular analyst happened to hit it right on the head. The further source of confusion or uncertainty was the spikes in borrowing from some of these technical problems. The market has an idea that those have been a factor. I don't think they know the precise dimensions of it, but they generally have become aware of the problems in the wire mechanisms and in fact are aware that a particular bank was unable to move its funds out, and the ones who were supposed to get funds know very well that there were problems and hangups from that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	33	HOSKINS	 Peter, I'm unclear how you decide how much to adjust in terms of borrowings versus how much to accept in terms of the rise in the federal funds rate on a daily basis . One thing we could do is maybe have Don Kohn arrange for borrowings to hold a range for the funds rate. But it's not clear to me when you decide to accept a funds rate and when you decide not to accept it. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198812	34	STERNLIGHT	 Well, we generally speak of an expectation of a funds rate that would prevail given a certain level of borrowing. And I think right along we've felt that there is some degree of flexibility of--oh, I don't know--at least l/8th percentage point on either side of whatever is the central point. And certainly for a given day it's even more room than that. It's more the persistent deviations that would be a problem. As the deviations build up to be greater than l/8th or l/4th percentage point and more persistent, then I think it creates the kind of problem that led to the discussion held on November 22 where it was felt that maybe a discrete adjustment of the borrowing level was in order. I don't know if I have the precise formula. It is something that's talked about daily and in discussions that people at the Desk would have with Don {Kohn] and his associates. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	35	BLACK	 Peter, is it fair to say that most differences have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	36	STERNLIGHT	 Well, we came through periods in this recent intermeeting interval where the deviations got to be sufficient so that the concern about the funds rate moving too far did become a constraint. I think I can say that in the period just since the November conference call, there was a fair amount of flexibility given to letting the funds rate move. We started out saying at that November call that we expected funds to be around 8-3/8 percent, and it seems to me it was largely market expectations that brought the rate up to 8-1/2 and 8-5/8 percent on a number of days. We were putting in reserves at that time, but we were doing it mainly with an eye to the reserve needs and not with such extraordinary intensity that getting funds back down to 8-3/8 percent was an overriding  objective. I think we were allowing some flexibility in the funds rate that emerged in that period in the context of the information that had come along in the market and given the asymmetric directive and all. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	37	BLACK	 Yes, I was on the [morning conference] call this time, and I think that's an excellent description of what you did. I was really referring to the longer run. It seems to me that in the past most of them have been resolved in favor of the federal funds rate. Not all certainly, but I think that's what it has usually yielded. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	38	KEEHN	 Peter, you commented on the 30-year [unintelligible]. Is there an expectation that we will do more, or [what] is the market reaction to what we've done so far? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
198812	39	STERNLIGHT	 I think the market expects that probably we'll be exercising more restraint over the near term. Many people would expect to see by year-end, [unintelligible] or maybe going into early next year, that funds would push higher, that there would be additional restraint exercised against the strength of the economy. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	40	GREENSPAN	 That's an interesting question of whether you combine the premium on the [forward] markets of the federal funds rate with the shape of the yield [curve for] bonds. And I think that the markets certainly are looking at (1) the forward market and the funds rate, and (2) the spreads between the funds rate and the bill rate and CD rates. I think you can clearly see that implicit in the short end of the market is the expectation that the funds rate will be higher over the next 30, 60 days. Any further questions for Peter? If not, would somebody move to ratify his actions since the last meeting? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	41	SPEAKER	 So moved. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	42	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	43	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Before we get involved with the borrowing and funds rate relationship and its--, I guess this naturally brings us to Don Kohn and the most recent [unintelligible]. The larger [unintelligible] the less we know. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	44	KOHN	 That's probably right. Actually they were overwrought, right? 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	45	GREENSPAN	 They were thrilled. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	46	KOHN	 [Unintelligible]. We are not Mozart, we recognize that. I have only a little to add to the memos we've already seen and to the comments Peter already has made in today's discussion. I have only a little to add to the- memos the FOMC has received  on this subject. In summary, a substantial decrease in borrowing at the  discount window at given spreads of the funds rate over the discount rate  developed this fall. It was widespread by size of institution, with a  considerable amount accounted for by smaller Institutions. We have not  identified any convincing rationale for the shift. It does not seem to  involve a change in the way the window is administered. As for the behavior of borrowing institutions, we have a number of hypotheses, but  have not been able to confirm empirically any reasons for depository  institutions to draw back from the use of discount window credit when  they did. The ongoing dimensions of the shift also are not clear; to  date, there have been few signs of reversal. In the bluebook, we posit  some increase in the willingness of large banks to come to the window  early next year. These institutions may be trying to reduce discount  window usage at this time In anticipation of more profitable opportunities later owing to rising money market pressures associated with year-  end, financing of large corporate restructurings, or tighter monetary  policy. In this respect, similar behavior was evident right before year-  end last year, and was partly reversed in January, though some permanent  shift still remained as an aftermath of the financial turmoil of the  stock market collapse.  Givea the emerging size of the disturbance to the borrowing  relation, open market operations were carried out with some extra flexibility over the intermeeting period, as Mr. Sternlight has already commented. Initially, the Desk tolerated both some upward pressure on funds  relative to the Committee's expectations, and a shortfall in borrowing  relative to path. Even after the formal adjustment to path, while  reserve provision has-been fully consistent with making-the borrowing  objective a bit more attention than previously has been paid to the  federal funds rate. This shift in emphasis has reflected both lingering  uncertainties about the new borrowing relation, and concerns about misleading market participants in a period of greater-than-usual speculation  about possible shifts in monetary policy.  The Committee has gone over the arguments for and against using  borrowing as an operating objective on several occasions. The principal  arguments in favor involve the flexibility in the federal funds rate that  comes from avoiding a narrow focus on this rate in policy implementation.  A borrowing objective allows some limited scope for market forces, including expectations, to show through, and in the process, may facilitate  needed policy adjustments. The argument against is that the overnight  rate is the proximate variable through which policy actions affect the  economy, and adhering to a borrowing target can allow that rate to deviate for a time from the level consistent with the Coonlttee's desired  policy. Such deviations are all the more likely when the borrowing  function shifts permanently, given that it may take some time to  recognize and compensate for such shifts.  In that regard, the recent experience certainly does not  strengthen the case for a borrowing objective. Even so, despite the  massive size of the current disturbance to the function, the outcome in  money markets probably did not differ very substantially or for very long  from interest rate levels consistent with the Committee's discussion and  understanding, given the slight finning deliberately sought on the basis  of incoming data. This result was largely-a consequence of the flexibility exercised by the Desk, in consultation with the Chairman, the Reserve  Bank President on the call, and the Committee. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198812	48	JOHNSON	 I think you're right. I mean, that was a well done explanation. And as you pointed out, what resulted was probably not much different, but I think that's because of the flexibility that was pursued by the Desk. I really would hate to think of what the  result would have been if you had actually tried systematically to produce that borrowing target. This is just more evidence in my opinion of the need for flexibility and sensitivity toward the funds rate in situations like this. Since I've been here, there have been, in my opinion, more periods of instability in the borrowing function than of stability. And so I'm not at all against this procedure as long as it's flexible. But trying to blindly pursue that problem target is very hazardous. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	49	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	50	HELLER	 Well, on previous occasions I've said that I was always amazed that $100 million changes could move the economy around like a [unintelligible]. I think the current [unintelligible] shows that it is very difficult to have a stable relationship between something that small and something that large. It's sort of like having a big pyramid standing exactly on its tip. Making minute adjustments at the bottom can balance the pyramid, but it's not at all clear that that will always avoid major movement of the pyramid either. In any case, like Mr. Johnson said, as soon as we see some instability there, we are ready to abandon the operating procedures that we have, and we immediately go back to federal funds targeting. I sent around a paper from the OECD and last week [at the OECD meeting] there was a topic of discussion indicating that virtually every single country represented around the table had an operating procedure that was focusing on a federal funds rate equivalent. On the other hand, a number of the countries typically used a monetary growth range for various aggregates as medium-term targets. And, on balance, I think that is probably as good a combination as one can get. You know, use the fed funds operating target itself and then have a medium range monetary growth objective in mind and steer the federal funds rate in order to attain that target. That allows for deviations like those specified in Don Kohn's paper. That's a very good paper, a very thorough discussion. These velocity changes that we can assess and predict with pretty good accuracy [unintelligible] might be amazed in that respect [unintelligible] take that into account. As a result, I think we could have a very consistent package that would allow us to attain the targets with a higher degree of precision than the borrowing target procedure allows us. What I would do with borrowings is use it as an indicator variable, a variable to watch along with the others. Then you would get the market signals, the market feedback, that you could still take into account and incorporate along with the other things that we are watching, but you would do so in a systematic and explicit fashion. Thank you. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0

198812	52	SEGER	 I just have a question. How bad does the relationship have to get, or how unreliable, before we should drop this approach? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	53	KOHN	 I don't know. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	54	SEGER	 So, as Manley Johnson indicates, it seems that the rule has been that the relationship hasn't been super terrific rather than that being the exception over the last four years or so.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198812	55	KOHN	 That's a question the Committee has to answer. I would say that we tend to focus on the shifts; that's when the issue is brought to the attention of the Committee and when the discussions occur. It's not clear to me that we don't have long periods in which the relationship is sufficiently on track to get approximately the money market conditions that the Committee thought it was getting when it specified the borrowing objective. There have been periodic shifts to be sure. I can't answer for the Committee what its range of tolerance is. I think I tried to indicate in my closing remarks that I thought that by treating both the money market conditions and the borrowing flexibly, we had gotten through what could have been a very difficult period without having to key very firmly on specific federal funds rates and getting locked into narrow federal funds targeting so that we retain the basic borrowing objective. But at the same time, Mr. Sternlight was sensitive to the potential for the funds rate getting way out of whack with what the Committee expected. So, some sort of compromise was worked out that in my view worked out pretty well in the end. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198812	62	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	63	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, as I've indicated a lot of times, what I hope we are going to move to eventually is some kind of reserve targets and make the necessary institutional changes so they'll work. I think it's important in the interim that we recognize that this borrowed reserve target is not a reserve target in the usual sense. The real instrument under current procedures, as I perceive it, is the federal funds rate because this is what determines the demand for money and consequently the rate of growth in the aggregates. And the borrowing is simply the device that we use to try to control the federal funds rate. I think it has confused us, and it has confused the markets on occasion. I remember that Manley and I were arguing this back at the March meeting I think it was. I would favor adopting, if we could get a consensus, a wider range for the federal funds rate and dropping the borrowing target. I would then give the Desk, in consultation with you [Chairman Greenspan], enough freedom to move anywhere within this half percentage point limit [for the federal funds rate] that seems consistent with the directive. I still favor that. I think this [recent intermeeting] period illustrated that. I think Peter Sternlight handled it beautifully the way he jumped back  from one and then the other. I do think most of the time we have resolved it in favor of the federal funds rate where there were differences. And I think that's the more important of the two. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	64	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	65	HOSKINS	 The disturbances or shifts seem to be larger in terms of magnitude more recently, which naturally raises concern about what do I look for going forward. And during the time period in which we were setting policy, I think my concerns were the same as President Black's--that we were confusing the public as to what we were about, and certainly if we were to keep talking about reserve restraint as opposed to fed funds rates. Somehow, I think it might be clearer if we did one or the other. The flexibility, it seems to me, simply gives a perception, at least in my mind and perhaps for some others, that we are doing nothing but following market rates up and not making policy directly. That is, we simply support whatever the market believes rates ought to be. So, I guess in that sense I'd be happy to cut it one way or the other or to have a more formal agreement on what we are doing with a range for borrowings. But if it turns out that the funds rate is what we ought to use, and if it has a wider band, I can support that position. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198812	66	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	67	BOEHNE	 Well, I think we need to step back from just the narrow issue of this procedure or that procedure and ask the broader question about policy itself. And I think in the last several years that policy has generally been good. If you compare what has happened in the last several years and went back over the last 20 years or so, I think in general we have done most of what should have been done in this particular cycle. And I think that that is borne out by the life of the cycle and the fairly good control we've had over inflation. Now, the issue is, has this procedure been helpful to us in achieving that goal? Have we achieved good policy in spite of this procedure? My own sense is that this procedure has been helpful in guiding us toward better policy. No procedure is perfect. And I think we've found that, whatever procedure we've used, there are always times when you have to override it. And Manley Johnson's point is correct that at some point we have to override it so much that maybe we ought to look around. But on the whole, looking at the broad picture, I think that this procedure has served us well and has made for better policy. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198812	68	JOHNSON	 Actually, I'm not suggesting that I would disapprove of the way the Desk has managed lately. I think it was handled with sensitivity--with a sensitivity that I wouldn't mind seeing [in the future]. I mean, my concern has always been with a strict borrowing target. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	69	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	70	MELZER	" I also think that operations were handled very well in this period. But I have the general sense that we are moving closer to a funds rate targeting regime, and I agree with the comments about the confusion that that can create internally and externally. I think in general--and I believe for reasons that Ed Boehne was implying without saying--that it has helped us to define our business, if you will, as being reserves and not interest rates [even though we]  characterize changes in policy as changes in the degree of reserve restraint as opposed to changes in a target for a market interest rate. I think that's helpful in deflecting political pressures and so forth, but if we continue to move closer in a sense to a funds rate target I feel we ought to be explicit about that. But if we did, I personally would feel very strongly about having a different proviso than we have right now. In effect, the borrowed reserves regime is targeting the funds rate, and then we have a proviso based on the funds rate that really can never be operative. So, were we to go explicitly to that, I'd like to see, if we had had at times in the past some kind of proviso based on the reserve base, whether that would have given us the kind of balance I think we are looking for in the directive. I guess, finally, I might ask just a rhetorical question, and this is part of the confusion: How are we going to describe what's happened in this intermeeting period where in my mind the degree of reserve restraint has been measured by the borrowings target that has been set? In effect, we are saying we really increased the degree of reserve restraint at the same time that the borrowings target has come down. I think that puts the confusion in perspective. If you describe the degree of reserve restraint in terms of what balances the funds rate, that's one thing. But in my mind that's not really what ""degree of reserve restraint"" meant. Why don't I just leave it at that? I'm not sure that's easily answerable, and I think I know how we can do it. "	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198812	71	KOHN	 We, of course, added or suggested the addition of a paragraph to the policy record describing the November 22 meeting, which attempts to reconcile those two things. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	72	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	73	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me this was a very good and a very enlightening paper and one of the things that it sought to do is to uncover reasons for the lack of borrowing and I think all of those given were very plausible. One other occurred to me and that is that we have not changed the discount rate very often recently and there may be a perception in the market that our failure to move very often on the discount rate will in effect increase the spread between the discount rate and the federal funds rate as we go forward and therefore produce a greater hesitancy on the part of banks to borrow at the discount window. Whatever the reason, we have this shortfall. As I've thought about this, it strikes me that we are in effect targeting the federal funds rate; we are really doing that. And I think I understand all of the reasons why we don't want to admit that we are targeting the funds rate. But since the periods of instability seem to be greater than the periods of stability, I wonder if the time hasn't come to really examine this procedure and perhaps just confirm what we are really doing and that is targeting that rate. I wouldn't do it now because I think we are in a period where we had some confusion in the market due to computer failures and we are at the end of the year. So, I think we need to have a little more evidence as to whether or not this relationship will come back to a more acceptable level. But I think the time really has come for us perhaps to think very seriously about going to a pure funds targeting, not the 1/8 percentage point degree of precision that was attempted before but some range of federal funds rate targeting. Now, I agree  with what's been said about our policy having been pretty good over the last couple of years following the current procedure, but I think the policy results have been obtained basically because of the flexibility exercised by the Desk rather than because of the procedure itself. So, rather than continue to produce memos about this, talk about it all the time, I think maybe the time has come to examine it very carefully and make a decision in the early part of 1989. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	39.0
198812	74	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	75	ANGELL	 Well, it's been an interesting discussion over the years, and I've always said that you are analytically correct and it's good to have you and Don agreeing on that. But there's a very important point that I think we have to keep in mind, and there's a very important reason that we do not want to target the federal funds rate explicitly. The discount rate is now an announcement instrument. And if we explicitly choose a federal funds target and we change that by 25 basis points, or change it by 12-1/2 basis points or 50 basis points, then that part of open market operations becomes an announcement target just like the discount rate is. And I believe it's [unintelligible] to have two kinds of instruments, one instrument that we use that's subtle, that's not quickly understood and has the camouflage of market forces at work, and another policy instrument that's very clear and has an announcement effect. So, I would never favor going to explicit federal funds targeting even though that is a way to accomplish exactly what we wish to accomplish. It carries an announcement effect with it that I would not prefer. What I would prefer doing, Don, is to examine quite a few options other than the existing options to accomplish the same kind of program and maybe some that might be able to accomplish it with some more regularity. I've talked from time to time with you about a total reserves [target] and a scheduled total reserves which could give you whatever elasticity you choose. A variant that we sometimes refer to as the [unintelligible] would in a sense give you a total reserve [target] with a cap on it on both sides. But I think there are other ways we might explore without going to explicit federal funds targeting. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	76	BLACK	 Wayne, wouldn't a lot of that announcement effect be lost since this wouldn't be released until Friday following the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	77	ANGELL	 Well, if we were to give the Desk, let's say, an explicit 8-5/8 percent funds rate to shoot for within a specified range, once you change that rate it's going to be known immediately in the market--as it was previously when explicit funds rate targeting was used. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	78	GREENSPAN	 Well, one fact I want to throw on the table with respect to this is that with very rare exceptions I don't recall the Desk operating on both sides of the market during one maintenance period. In other words, if you're going to focus on an explicit funds rate with an announcement effect, you're going to have to be in there generally not just once a day on one side throughout the whole maintenance period but you're going to have play it on both sides. And I think that gives a different statistic than 8-5/8. I think that if you're forced to stay on one side you can't, even if you wanted to, calibrate a funds rate target exactly.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	79	ANGELL	 Are you suggesting you can have an explicit federal funds target--and nothing else--and that's the instruction in the directive, and not have the market perceive precisely that we have a fed funds target, and the market wouldn't know when we have a 25 basis point change? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	80	GREENSPAN	 I think it makes a difference how the Desk endeavors to calibrate that particular fed funds rate. Am I correct that we used to be in the market more than once a day and we used to be in on both sides? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	81	KOHN	 On occasion. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	82	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I don't know that we were in on both sides in a single day, but certainly we had multiple entries on given days when we were targeting the funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	83	SPEAKER	 Well, in the same week. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198812	85	GREENSPAN	 So, I think even though it's certainly the case that we are moving toward a federal funds target, we are still quite a long way from that procedure because most of the actual activity is determined by the borrowing requirement. I grant you that you could get the effect you're talking about but I'm not sure that it-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	86	ANGELL	 Well, I'm saying that I prefer to have some arrangement to keep us from having explicit fed funds targets become apparent to the market and having some announcement effect whenever we change a fed funds target. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	87	BLACK	 I certainly wouldn't favor targeting a particular federal funds rate. I might want a band for the reason that Wayne has indicated. But I would just note that the band associated with the borrowing target did not necessitate a borrowing target as long as we had the band. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	88	ANGELL	 What I'd like to see are some alternatives. I'd like to have Don present us with some alternatives that give us means of accomplishing what we wish to accomplish in ways that might to some extent be more explainable between meetings without having to use exceptions quite as much. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	89	BLACK	 You know, when we were under the borrowed-- nonborrowed reserve targeting procedure, we made banks borrow half of any shortfall. There was an automatic corrective mechanism there, and we made ad hoc adjustments every now and then as needed, and I'd like to preserve that right. That's the kind of direction I would like. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0

198812	93	BLACK	 Yes, if the money supply spurted, we made banks in effect borrow half of the additional reserves that they needed. And that was an automatic brake on that. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	94	ANGELL	 Yes, and we could have whatever elasticity in that function we choose to have. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0

198812	97	PARRY	 If we want to abandon the current operating procedures it shouldn't be on the basis that you're confusing the market because I think the market has pretty well got it straight. Analytically, we are on a modified or flexible federal funds rate approach, and the market knows that. So, it seems to me that the discussion ought to revolve around what is the best procedure; that is, whether or not something more rigid as far as fed funds targeting is appropriate--which I wouldn't be very happy about or support--or whether it should be a reserves target. But I think confusion is not the issue. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198812	98	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	99	JOHNSON	 This might be too technical as an option, but what I always thought was a possibility would be--. You know, we have an estimated borrowing function; we go through quite a sophisticated analysis to know the econometric equation that estimates the long-term relationship between the funds rate and borrowings, and it seems to me that could be the basis for establishing some sort of expected funds rate range. It seems to me that we could still set a borrowing target; however, if the funds rate were to start to vary outside the range predicted by this estimated long-term relationship, and we didn't really know why, then we ought to be more sensitive to the funds rate versus trying to hit some borrowing number. That would allow us to pursue a borrowing procedure but be more sensitive to the funds rate when we get outside that expected band. I mean, that's not money we are putting in--what Bob Black was saying--but at least there's some scientific reasoning, or rhyme, as to how we were to set the expected range. And I think that actually that's about what we've been doing. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	100	PARRY	 I was going to say, isn't that what we did? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198812	101	JOHNSON	 And I think that's okay; I'm not opposed to it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	102	HELLER	 But if you wanted to formalize that--I mean all your targets--in the directive, wouldn't you squeeze the fed funds rate clause down to 50 basis points or something like that? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198812	103	JOHNSON	 Well, I don't know what the variants are.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	104	KOHN	 I was going to say, in terms of the standard deviation of the borrowing equation, the federal funds band is much larger than we've been tolerating. It's more like 3/8ths of a percentage point. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	105	JOHNSON	 Plus or minus? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	106	KOHN	 [$100 million], plus or minus in terms of standard deviations. Is that right, Dave? 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	107	LINDSEY	 Yes, that's $500 [million]. Judgmentally, the Desk can come closer than that, but that doesn't [unintelligible] the equation. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	108	JOHNSON	 Well, something like that; we ought to at least look at what the standard deviation is and see if that's within our tolerance. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	109	BLACK	 One thing we probably can agree on is that we've been doing a pretty darn good job with what we've had; it's just a question of whether we can continue to do it with this procedure. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	110	STERN	 Well, I agree with those who've observed that we are some significant distance away even now from pure federal funds rate targeting and I guess I would prefer to keep my distance from such targeting. I see a couple of reasons for that. One is to some extent the grass is always greener phenomenon. Every time a problem crops up we'd like to find a better way and I would too. I have a hunch that search is going to turn out to be long and arduous. Equally important, as you know we were pretty much committed to the federal funds rate in the 1970s. I wouldn't attribute all the problems with policy in the 1970s to the federal funds rate target, but I wouldn't say that it was helpful either. Based on that historical experience, I'd be very cautious about going back to something like that. Now, we may find a different way of implementing closer control of the funds rate if that's what we want to do. But again I think despite the problems with the current procedure, the history of the 1970s doesn't make me sanguine about tighter control of the federal funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	41.0
198812	111	PARRY	 But, Gary, isn't that because you had a rigid fed funds target? What we now have is something that is more flexible, and it seems to have worked at least over this period. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198812	112	STERN	 I'm not complaining about current procedures, but as I said, it's a long way away from pure targeting of the funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	41.0
198812	113	BLACK	 What I was advocating here is not what we had before but a much wider band. I would be totally opposed to going back to what we had before. That and the market-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	114	STERN	 I guess what I wonder about in that setting is how to adjust the band, not where we are day-to-day within it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	41.0
198812	115	HOSKINS	 But isn't a risk of what we are doing now that the band implicitly is getting narrower and that we are heading back toward the 1970s? If you did something like what Bob Black wants to do, and maybe Tom Melzer who would tie it probably to the base--  	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198812	116	JOHNSON	 But you know the reality is a point, as long as you move that point enough--that's what Bob is saying. You could have an explicit funds rate target, but if you moved it often enough to deal with the problem--. The whole issue really is whether you're willing to move the funds rate. And I guess Gary is saying that in the 1970s when this body had explicit funds rate targeting, for some reason it wasn't willing to move the funds rate enough. It was always behind. I think the question is, if we went back to that, would we be willing to move the funds rate more often? The only issue really is whether we would or not. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	117	BOEHNE	 Well, there's a little more than just the willingness of people to do it. It goes to Wayne's point, and that is that a movement in the funds rate has much more than an announcement effect. And our current procedure does allow some flexibility absent an announcement effect. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198812	118	JOHNSON	 True, but I tend to agree with Bob Parry: The market knows exactly; they scrutinize the funds rate hourly. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	119	BOEHNE	 That's true, except if the market were totally logical about it, a half point increase in the discount rate ought to be just equal to a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate, and it isn't. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198812	120	JOHNSON	 I can see that there are certain announcement effects that are similar to the announcement effects of a change in the discount rate. I think that's only because a discount rate change is viewed as an intention by the Fed to lock in the funds rate at that level and put a floor under it. So, I think that's why it has that effect--of being considered a Fed decision to make that funds rate a permanent rate and it's not going to be flexible down. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	121	GREENSPAN	 Temporarily. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	122	JOHNSON	 Temporarily. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	123	HOSKINS	 Well, it's not clear to me that the markets know where we are. I think the markets pick out the rate that they think we are at, and then we allow ourselves to move to that rate; that's the way I read what's going on. We figure out where they are; they keep trading the rate in a certain way; and if we don't protest it sufficiently, we finally decide, if nothing bad happens, to let the rate go to where the market sets it. That seems to me to be the way we've been operating, and I don't find that exactly a comfortable way to be setting policy. I think you ought to react to the markets, and you ought to understand what they are trying to tell you. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198812	124	PARRY	 Well, you can turn that around a little. You go through an intermeeting period, and if things look like they are firming up for good analytic reasons, and if you allow it to firm up a little bit, what's wrong with that? If you didn't, you'd be going back to what we had in the 1970s that Gary referred to. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198812	125	HOSKINS	 I don't understand it. We have a conditional directive, and if conditions work out that rates go up, and if the market does it before we do it, so what?  	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198812	126	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	127	CORRIGAN	 Well, I hesitate to put this in these terms, Wayne, but every time I listen to this discussion I think it does to come down to how many angels can we put on the head of a pin. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	128	GREENSPAN	 How many can we? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	129	SPEAKER	 Not very many. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	130	CORRIGAN	 But it is a little more complicated than that. Bob Heller, taking your point regarding problems in other countries--I just glanced at this paper--my sense of it is that virtually every central bank in a major country in one way or another is having exactly the same kind of discussions we are having here, because the fact of the matter is that for a variety of reasons there is no mechanism that is wholly satisfactory from all points of view. We see what's happened in other countries in recent years just in terms of disparities and money growth rates versus money targets and so on. I think we are all frustrated and searching for the brass ring, and I don't think it's there. Two or so months ago Ed Boehne put this is a useful context. If I remember, Ed, you suggested that if we thought of a scale of 1 to 10 and on that 10 was a pure money target or reserve target and 1 was a firm, even more firm perhaps than the 1970's version, federal funds rate target, I think that you were suggesting at the time that you thought we were somewhere around 3 on that scale, and I think that's about right as to where we are. Frankly, I too am rather comfortable with that. I continue to have very grave reservations about going from 3 to 2 to 1 on that scale. And I say that from several points of view. There has been some discussion here about the inertia factor; it is simply the inability of this Committee or any committee to move the interest rate target enough. I think there's more to it than that because I at least think there are some major league questions in the economics of the relationship between an interest rate target and money target and other things. And again, I think Gary made a good point; there's a tendency to think, gee, we'll try that and all our problems are going to go away; quite the contrary, they won't. We will have a whole new bushel basket full of problems. And I guess it's partly in that spirit [that we find ourselves] today. Going back to Ed Boehne's comments, I actually think that this procedure has worked pretty darn well. I think it was Governor Johnson who made the point that if anything we probably have gotten a bit more flexible, maybe a lot more flexible, and that's all right with me, too. But the great advantage over and above those that have been cited by Governor Angell, and Ed, and Gary and others about the current procedures is that it has a valuable form of give to it; it breathes; it's not rigid. I think that that character of it is awfully good from a market point of view, and I think it's awfully good from our point of view. I think that in some ways that is what distinguishes it from the extreme form of a federal funds rate target. It's the extreme form only that involves the question of inertia, but I think it inevitably can put you on a slippery slope into a regime of fine tuning that I would find very, very difficult to support. So, I kind of like what we are doing and I think we've got to be flexible  when we need to be. I think there is a demonstrated capacity for that flexibility to be brought to bear either with small things, where Peter and Don and Chairman Greenspan do it, or for big things done through the Committee. But I sure wouldn't want to change it very much. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	131	GREENSPAN	 Let me suggest a couple of other things that I think have been involved in the last year which we haven't really raised today. One is the question that I think is implicit in whether we move in incremental fashion or in discontinuous jumps. The other is: How do we know our degree of pressure is right or wrong, and how do we know whether we are moving fast enough? I think that implicitly in coming to grips with those questions--granted that our fundamental purpose is on the inflation front and granted that we have felt inadequate with respect to the money supply targets--we really have been looking essentially at the slope of interest rates. One of the reasons why I guess most members of this Committee have felt comfortable with the degree of incremental tightening that we have been involved with is that essentially we have been stabilizing inflation expectations around a rather narrow range. And there is a very extraordinary value in having that if our basic purpose is to prevent a breakout of inflation on the upside. And I think the fact that we have been looking at a stable long-term interest rate has given us a policy anchor which I suspect is not going to exist indefinitely either into this or the next cycle because I think it is a very special case which has turned out to be exceptionally helpful. I think that has been useful in that it has enabled us to function in a rather systematic way. The thing which concerns me is that in the next cycle that's unlikely to exist. I don't think there's anything involved here other than in part pure luck. I remember that prior to the discount rate increase in 1987, in the summer of that year we did a historical appraisal of the extent to which short-term tightening either moved long-term rates up or down and the pretty convincing historical result was that when short-term rates moved up as a result of Federal Reserve tightening, long-term rates moved up. Now, one can argue that that may well have been largely the expectational factor; that is, if you're moving up incrementally, the next expectation is we will move up more and create a much higher long-term interest rate. But I do think that, in evaluating the current theory, it has turned out rather well; and, I think also our procedure has worked well but I suspect it's more because of the fact that we've had the long-term interest rate anchor. I'm a little concerned that we may overread the usefulness as a generic tool for all times and all places. And I would be inclined to come out more on the side that unless and until we can feel comfortable with the specific procedures that would be involved in reserve targeting or money supply targeting, that we probably are best suited to develop in each cycle and each period something which the concensus of the Committee feels comfortable with as an operational vehicle without taking all that seriously that there's something sacrosanct about the particular function itself. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	132	CORRIGAN	 That is kind of what happened, of course, if you look at it over a sweep of 30 years. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	133	GREENSPAN	 Yes, and I'm not sure that that's wrong. President Guffey.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	134	GUFFEY	" I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said other than to state my own position. I would oppose moving back to a rigid federal funds rate target. I think that what has happened over the last two intermeeting periods particularly has proven the worth of the procedures we've been following. And I'd also note that there is nothing new apparently in that world because this idea of broadening the federal funds range and letting the market move it within that range rather than us was a regime that we followed some 10 or so years ago when we called that area in which the federal funds rate could move on its own a ""zone of indifference."" I don't know whether that was a published term or not, but it was certainly featured in discussions around this table. That zone of indifference would have been set within a federal funds rate range of 2 to 3 percentage points, and no action would be taken so long as the fed funds rate moved within that zone. My recollection, Bob Black may remember, is that the zone of indifference was about one full percentage point. The point is that it has been done before. It wasn't successful then I might add, and that is one of the reasons I would hate to go back to a rigid federal funds target even with that type of caveat. "	9	96	0.0	1.0	20.0
198812	135	JOHNSON	 I'd say we are more rigid than that right now, even with the full borrowing target, even if we'd be within that. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198812	136	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	137	MELZER	 I just had a couple of comments I wanted to add. Jerry said one of them, and that is that the econometrics aren't really there to tie the funds rate to our goals, which I think is a very important point. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198812	138	CORRIGAN	 It's not just the econometrics; the economics worry me. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198812	139	MELZER	 And secondly, nobody's really said this explicitly, I think Gary alluded to it, but the funds rate is a procyclical target; and that's why I feel rather strongly that if we explicitly use that target, we need some kind of a proviso that is reserve-based. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198812	140	GREENSPAN	 I think we've always had multiple provisos. I just can't see us ever functioning [unintelligible]. President Keehn. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	141	KEEHN	 Well, while I completely agree with the procedure as you describe it, the only question I would have is how do we explain to the markets what we are doing. I have in mind your February Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Are we doing something different that you're going to have to explain in your testimony? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198812	142	GREENSPAN	 What we are doing is what we've been doing, whether we defined it or not, for at least as long as I've been here. I don't know what difference we have to explain. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	143	KEEHN	 Well, I would think in your testimony the aggregate discussion tends to be on the heavy side in terms of ranges and performance relative to the ranges, etc.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198812	144	GREENSPAN	 Not in that sense. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	145	KEEHN	 I think what we are talking about is a quite different procedure with which I agree. I think we may have a responsibility to explain both to the Congress as well as to the markets that we are doing something a little bit different here. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198812	146	GREENSPAN	 On the other hand, we've stayed within our [monetary] target ranges which we have defined to the Congress-- right in the middle--and it's likely that we don't have anything to explain. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	147	SPEAKER	 Of course, the explanation isn't difficult. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	148	SPEAKER	 We are here by accident, Mr. Chairman. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198812	149	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	150	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I'm afraid I have misstated my position pretty badly. I think the excellent memo we had last time demonstrates pretty clearly that there is a good relationship in the long run between M2 and the price level. And I think the price level ought to be our ultimate target. I think that's all we really ought to be targeting on. If we do that, then I think these other things will fall into place about as well as they can. That suggests to me that somehow or other we have to control the supply of money. In the short run, which is what we are talking about here now, our procedures regardless of whether we use a borrowed reserve target or a federal funds rate [range that is] narrower or wider--and I had in mind a wider one--necessitate our being able to estimate the short-run demand for money. I think that's very difficult to do. All I was attempting to say is that I think if you leave out the borrowed reserves stuff and work with the federal funds rate, we'll probably do better in the short run in doing that. But I will not be satisfied until we get to the point that we really pay a lot more attention over the long run to what's happening to M2, or if some other variable is a better predictor of the rate of inflation then that's the way I want to move. I certainly don't have in mind any rigid pegging of the federal funds rate. That to me would be nothing but a modern day version of the real bills doctrine where the market would get everything it wanted in the way of money at the particular rate we chose and all we could do to change that would be to raise the rate or lower it--which means we'll end up with a real bills doctrine, and I'm violently opposed to that. I think that doctrine has long since been discredited. And so the question really is what kind of mechanism in the short run can get us to what I think should be our long-run target or some control over prices over the long run through controlling the rate of growth in some aggregate or some reserve measure. I don't know what the answer is in the short run. We had a memo on that and it doesn't suggest the answer is very easy. But there is the sense in which I offered this recommendation of mine. And I'm afraid I didn't make that very clear. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	151	GREENSPAN	 This has been a very unusual and very useful discussion. Does anyone want to add anything or correct anything? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	152	ANGELL	 Well, it seems to me that we should leave our present procedure in place until we decide on a better one.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	153	GREENSPAN	" Well, I was about to say that. What struck me about this discussion is something I had not been aware of previously. That is the sense that even though we all have different views of the way the monetary system functions and have various preferences, there is not a strong feeling of unease within the Committee about current procedures. And I guess, ""if it ain't broke don't fix it."" What that means I guess is that we will proceed as best we can and in the spirit of this conversation define our targets and our goals hopefully in the way we have. "	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198812	154	HELLER	 Mr. Chairman, with due respect, I think the better way to describe it is that it was broke, it is broke, and we are continually fixing it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198812	155	ANGELL	 But we have a system for fixing it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198812	156	BLACK	 It's not quite complete yet. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198812	157	GREENSPAN	 I'm not sure it [unintelligible]. What I was saying [unintelligible] broke. If there is no further discussion on this, I think we can move on to Mike Prell's report on the economic situation. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	158	PRELL	 As you know, with the current Greenbook the staff has taken its  first stab at portraying how 1990 might look. The picture we've  presented isn't very pretty. We have suggested that, if it is the aim  of the Committee not merely to hold the line on inflation but, rather,  to restore a downward trend by 1990, then it may be necessary to run the  risk of some financial stress and economic weakness.  There are three key premises behind this conclusion: First,  that oil and food supply conditions will provide only a little help in  damping overall Inflation in the next couple of years; second, that  current levels of resource utilization are not compatible with slowing  wage and price inflation; and third, that additional macropolicy  restraint will be needed to slow economic growth enough to reduce  utilization rates to disinflationary levels.  As we see it, the incoming information since the November  meeting is on balance supportive of these assertions.  Starting with the oil market, we believe that OPEC showed a bit  more resolution than might have been expected in reaching its accord on  production limits. The adroit handling of the Iraq-Iran quota dispute  and the seeming Intensification of pressures on the Arab Emirates to  stop their egregious violations lead us to think that OPEC output is  likely to be lower than we had assumed previously. Consequently, we've  assumed a $2-1/2 per barrel increase in oil import prices over the next  yeaz, from a low $12.50 in the current quarter. Translating this into  consumer energy prices, we are looking for a 2 percent increase next  year, rather than the 1 percent decline in our last forecast.  On the food price front, we've seen a fairly rapid reversal of  the earlier run-up in fruit and vegetable prices, and meat supplies have  been ample of late. Over the next year, we're likely to see some  softening of grain and oilseed prices if harvests are normal, but with  beef supplies falling and labor costs rising, we are projecting consumer  food price inflation of about 3-1/2 percent.  In our projection, these comparatively moderate increases in  food and energy prices prevent a discernible deterioration in overall  price inflation next year. But the underlying tendency is still there,  perhaps most notably in compensation. This brings me to the second  assertion I mentioned earlier namely, that the pressures on resources  are excessive. While the recent evidence on this point is not  absolutely clearcut, we think it suggests that the risks are skewed  rather markedly in one direction. Apart from signs of softening in a  few materials markets, the picture anecdotally and statistically is  one of stable or rising wage- and price-inflation trends.  On the statistical side, the readings on wages have been  sparse. The.hourly earnings index for production and non-supervisory  workers jumped 0.7 percent in October and then was unchanged in  November; these movements, on net, left intact the general uptrend in  the year-on-year increases that began in the middle of 1987. Meanwhile,  recent monthly changes in the consumer and producer price indexes have  not indicated a clear ongoing acceleration or deceleration.  Given that there was no sign of a diminution in pressures prior  to the recent drop in the dollar and further increase in resource  utilization, we see no reason to expect that the underlying trend of  Inflation will improve in the near term. Indeed, in putting together  our forecast of wages and prices, we have continued to discount the  predictions .of a.variety of econometric models,-which point to a  substantial.acceleration. Perhaps I should say a variety of non-  monetarist models. A monetarist formulation would suggest that  inflation should moderate before long, in light of the slower money  expansion path we've been on; but, in most cases, the models also would  look for a weakening in real activity.  This brings me to the third and final premise of the  projection namely, that, in the absence of additional policy  restraint, economic activity will be too strong to restore a downtrend  in wage and price increases within the next two years. Under the  assumptions we've made about legislative action on the 1990 federal  budget, fiscal policy probably will be supplying some of this restraint.  But we still believe an appreciable burden will fall on the Fed, and  we've built into our forecast a rise in short-term interest rates of  about 2 percentage points over the next year to 18 months. There is no  question that this is considerably more than the markets are  anticipating, and we would expect that it would put a noticeable dent in  stock and bond prices. Perhaps, though, the policy issue today is not  so much how great a tightening of money market conditions may ultimately  be needed but simply whether any appreciable further rise in rates is  required, given the increase that has already occurred.  Obviously, the staff's answer to that question is yes, .and we  perceive support for that proposition in the recent economic data. The  most noteworthy news was contained in the employment reports for October  and November. The payroll gain of 700,000 and the lower jobless rate  argue for expecting that real GNP growth in the current quarter will  roughly match the 3-1/2 percent drought-adjusted pace of the first nine  months of this year. With factory jobs increasing another 70,000 last  month, we'll be publishing tomorrow morning a one-half percent increase  in November industrial production; the quarterly-average rise appears  likely to exceed 4 percent. In manufacturing, the quarterly gain  probably will be around 5-1/2 percent.  At the time the Greenbook was completed, indicators on the  spending side of the ledger were quite skimpy. We noted that, to that  point, they seemed a bit softer than the production side. Implicitly,  we were looking for some stronger expenditure data in subsequent  releases. This morning we received the advance reading on November  retail sales. Total sales are estimated to have risen 1.1 percent last  month, and the increase for October was revised upward, from 0.9 percent  to 1.6 percent. These are big numbers, but because we were anticipating  strength, they would cause us to raise the projection of real consumer  spending growth in the fourth quarter only marginally from the 2-1/2  percent rate in the Greenbook.  Indicators of other sectors of demand present a mixed picture.  The housing market has, if anything, been firmer than we expected in our  previous forecast. Starts surged in November to a 1.55 million unit  annual rate the highest since the spring and sales of new homes have  remained strong. With mortgage rates having turned up in the past  month, we're not projecting that the recent strength in demand will be  sustained; however, we have raised the near-term forecast of residential  investment somewhat.  In contrast, nonresidential fixed investment has appeared  surprisingly weak of late. Again, I must emphasize that we are working  here only with October data and they are extremely volatile ones at  that. Both shipments of nondefense capital goods and construction put-  in-place were sluggish in October, and weak car sales indicate softness  in that category of business spending, too. As a result, we've  projected essentially no change in real business fixed investment for  the quarter as a whole.  Clearly, one of the key factors in our assessment that a  further rise in interest rates is needed is the judgment that the  underlying tendencies in capital spending are stronger than the recent  spending data suggest. To be sure, orders at domestic equipment  manufacturers were weak in the early fall, and construction contracts  are unimpressive. On the other hand, though, we've seen continued  growth in backlogs, as well as rising employment in the machinery  industries. There are still many anecdotal reports of increasing  capital outlays, and two private surveys of 1989 plans for plant and  equipment spending indicate nominal increases of between 5 and 6  percent. We therefore expect that equipment outlays will revive in the  next few months, more than offsetting what we anticipate will be a  downward drift in commercial construction.  The other component of business spending, inventories, provides no  hint of an emerging overhang that would be a major drag on output  growth. Apart from auto dealers, firms mostly report comfortable  stocks, and as with fixed investment, the chances of a recessionary  miscalculation seem to be minimized by the lack of ebullience in  business expectations. In the auto sector, there has been some buildup  of stocks in the past couple of months, but a combination of enhanced  incentives and some trimming of assembly schedules should be able to  deal with that fairly quickly. The slowing in nonfarm output growth  we've projected for the first quarter can be attributed arithmetically  to the anticipated decline in auto production.  In sum, as we see the situation, the rise in interest rates  this year has not been enough to severely depress domestic final demand.  At the same time, we believe that the tradable goods sector is still  benefiting from rising export demand. The underlying improvement in  real net exports may be obscured in the current quarter by an influx of  cheap imported oil. However, the trend should reemerge next year,  accentuated initially by a drop-back in the oil flow. The recent  depreciation of the dollar should help sustain the gains in trade, and  we've assumed a further moderate nominal depreciation as well running  about 6 percent per annum. In fact, it seems to us likely that, if the  trade adjustment is perceived to lag, the downward pressures on the  dollar will intensify albeit with potentially discomforting  implications for domestic interest rates and inflation.  I have focused my remarks on the near-term outlook. We did  attempt to lay out the fundamental logic of the projection through 1990  in the Greenbook, however, and we shall be discussing that forecast and  the implications of alternative monetary and fiscal policies in the  February chart show. Given what we've reported previously, I suppose  that you can already predict the broad outlines of those implications:  in shorty all other things equal, a lesser degree of monetary restraint  would produce greater inflation in 1990, while a more forceful effort to  reduce the federal budget deficit could substantially ease the domestic  financial pressures foreseen in the present projection. But we shall  attempt to refine and quantify this at the next meeting. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0

198812	161	GREENSPAN	 I don't know; let's get a Committee vote. If no one has a problem with it, why don't we reconvene at 9:00 a.m. here tomorrow morning. [Meeting recessed]  December 14, 1988--Morning Session 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	162	GREENSPAN	 Ted Truman? 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	163	TRUMAN	 Yes, sir. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	164	GREENSPAN	 Do I understand that Larry Promisel's going to do-- 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	165	TRUMAN	 No, I'll do it, for whatever it's worth. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	166	GREENSPAN	 But you do have it? 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	167	TRUMAN	 Yes, I do have something to read from. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	168	GREENSPAN	 Well, why don't you start us off on that? 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	169	TRUMAN	 This morning the Commerce Department issued its latest release  on United States trade data. For October, on a seasonally adjusted customs  valuation basis -  that is, excluding the cost of insurance and freight    the trade deficit narrowed slightly to a preliminary level of $8.9  billion, from a upward revised level of $9.2 billion in September; before  revision, the September deficit had been reported as $9.0 billion. On a  cif basis, the deficit in October was $10.35 billion. As was indicated  at the meeting yesterday afternoon, exchange market participants  reportedly expected a deficit of about $10 billion on a cif basis. In  exchange markets this morning, the dollar edged off against major  currencies following the release of the trade data.  The value of total imports, fell 1.7 percent in October. Imports  of oil fell slightly in value terms, as an unchanged volume was offset by  a decline in price. Non-oil imports fell 1-1/2 percent with declines  recorded in imports of capital goods and consumer goods.  The value of non-oil imports was up only slightly from the  average monthly level in the third quarter. We expect the value of non-  oil imports to rise moderately over the forecast period, although the  Quantity of imports, other than computers, should be pretty flat.  Exports declined 1.1 percent in October. Agricultural exports  were somewhat lower. Boosted by higher aircraft shipments, non-  agricultural exports apparently were unchanged from their September  level; they were up slightly (about 1-1/2 percent) from the average for  the third quarter and were about 23 percent above their level in October  of 1987. The decline in nonagricultural exports was principally in  industrial supplies and materials; exports of capital goods were  essentially unchanged from the September level. The staff expects a  somewhat slower rate of increase of nonagricultural exports over the  forecast horizon--about 13 percent in value terms  reflecting.for awhile  the continuing effects of the strength of the dollar through much of 1988  and the slowing of foreign growth from the rapid rates seen this year.  The data released this morning were marginally worse than the  staff's expectations. However, given the volatility of these data, we  would not be inclined to alter our basic view of the outlook, described  in the current Greenbook, either for the current quarter or for the  next two years. However, today's data are likely to provide some support  for the view that the expansion of United States exports has stalled. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	170	GREENSPAN	 We have had some softening in new orders for exports, but my recollection is that when we measure the unfilled orders that exports were rising quite substantially, which raises an interesting question as to whether this is just a temporary slowdown followed by a negative acceleration or whether our data are quite wrong. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	171	TRUMAN	 Well, as you may remember the way we construct the export orders from those series is to use the staff forecast. So if the staff forecast is wrong, then export orders are wrong. Essentially, the division between domestic orders and exports orders is derived from the staff forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	172	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's quite true, but the backlog is in fact independent, and at least the export orders series--which is fully constructed from the National Association of Purchasing Managers survey--is not inconsistent with the pattern of new orders, which sort of suggests that they still have got to be of significant value. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	173	TRUMAN	 That's why I said that it seems to me that although these data may well be used by those who think there's going to be a stalling--if you want to put it that way--in the adjustment process, it seems to me that it's a little premature to argue that case. I might add that shipments of large aircraft in October were about double last year's, and that is one factor that we are expecting through the forecast horizon to give us some boost to the overall level of exports; that's one area where orders have been strong and they have long delivery-lead times and so in looking out it looks like you're going to have a continued boost to exports as a whole from that source. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	174	BLACK	 Ted, were the September figures on CIF basis revised? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	175	TRUMAN	 No, they were both revised by about the same amount.  -20- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	176	BLACK	 What is it for September? I didn't get that somehow. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	177	TRUMAN	 Well, revised from-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	178	JOHNSON	 $10.5 to $10.6 billion. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	179	BLACK	 $10.6 billion, is what it is now? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	180	JOHNSON	 $10.67 billion, something like that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	181	TRUMAN	 $10.67 from $10.46 billion. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	182	BLACK	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	183	TRUMAN	 $10.6 billion. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	184	GREENSPAN	 Perhaps it would be best if we first directed questions to Mr. Truman and then go back to the domestic market issues and Mr. Prell. So why don't we just stay with the international side and question Mr. Truman at this stage. Let me raise one question. In the forecast, there is an implication of a fairly significant slowing down in the adjustment process. It's of a dimension which suggests to me that it's got to be a month or two of very poor numbers, which is going to create the usual concerns. I would assume that in that type of an environment that the market will probably be moving the exchange rates down to your forecast. I don't know whether or not that's sort of implicitly assumed in your forecast process, or whether or not your forecasts on the exchange rate have essentially been straight lined down and you calculate it from there, whether you try to get a little more dynamic into it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	185	TRUMAN	" The answer to the last part of your question is we find it hard enough to try and come up with ""forecasts"" of an exchange rate that we don't try to put a dynamic in. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	186	GREENSPAN	 I don't know why you have difficulty. No one else seems to! 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	187	TRUMAN	 I think there is a risk in that, since in the staff forecast the trade balance improvement essentially levels off in 1989. That is to some extent exaggerated by the impact of the somewhat higher oil prices that come in. So, there's a little bit more improvement ex-oil in the forecast. The market presumably will look through that part of the forecast that we have in the total numbers. But as I think we mentioned in the Greenbook, it does strike me that if you wanted to fine tune things you might feel that this stalling, if you want to put it that way, or partial stalling in process could lead to pressures on the exchange markets in the short run as the markets adjust to that. Factors behind this essentially are two. One is the strength of the dollar this year and the other is the fact that, at least in our forecast, we have a slowing of growth abroad in 1989 which should give us less [impetus?] from that standpoint. In 1990, the forecast gains from essentially the cumulative effects of the relatively small appreciation of the dollar that's in the forecast and a slowdown in United States demand.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	188	GREENSPAN	 The reason I raised the issue is that I was looking for some [potential] shock to what is a remarkably smooth econometric forecast in the Greenbook, which of course of necessity has always been good. This strikes me as an area where you can get some destabilization from something cracking in the seams. And I was just curious to get a sense of the order of magnitude at which it would be a problem. In other words, I assume that if anything were to happen, we are looking at, say, a 10 yen adjustment as distinct from the 25 yen. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	189	TRUMAN	 Well, if I were to guess, I would guess that way. I think it would also depend on what else is going on at the same time. If you have a slowdown in the trade adjustment but progress--whatever that means--or perceptible progress on the budget deficit, that might strengthen the dollar. If the United States economy seems to be slowing down a bit, that might also tend to offset some of the effects of an adjustment to somewhat disappointing trade numbers. But I think a lot depends on what else is going on at the same time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	190	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	191	JOHNSON	 One thing that bothered me a little about the forecast when combining the international side with the domestic side is that--I understand the point about the slowing of the trade adjustment and the expectation of some dollar depreciation--but I'm having a little trouble understanding how that's consistent with our interest rate projections in the forecast. We've gotten into this before, but we are talking about a fairly substantial increase in short-term interest rates over the next year or year and a half, and yet there is dollar depreciation. My question would be that I don't see those as quite consistent, unless you're arguing that our foreign counterparts move their interest rates in a parallel fashion. So, I just wonder what kind of assumption you've got in there. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	192	TRUMAN	 On that particular point, we have an increase in rates abroad, but not on the same order of magnitude--maybe half or a little bit less than half of the increase we have for the United States So you do have interest rate differentials moving in favor of the dollar. And as you know, there is I think in this area [a question of?] how much is enough, if you want to put it that way. I think it's a matter on which science doesn't provide us much guidance. One reason why we tended in this forecast to slow the rate of depreciation of the dollar relative to the overall contour that we had in the previous Greenbook was in fact the recognition that somewhat higher rates of interest that occur in this forecast, at least in the short end and the same kind of stuff for the long end, tend to damp the tendency for the dollar to depreciate; the depreciation we would argue would be much larger in the absence of that. We have the effect in the forecast. The question is whether we have it calibrated right. Some would argue, as you know, that a forecast like this for interest rates would bring about even more in the way of stability of the dollar than we have. [unintelligible] 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	193	JOHNSON	 I can understand that scenario if foreign rates were keeping up with United States rates, but I guess my next question would be that if that's not the case, then I have some doubts about the exchange rate scenario in the Greenbook. But if it is the case, then I was going to ask what we have built in for foreign demand?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	194	TRUMAN	 We have a fairly sharp decline in the rate of increase in demand abroad--down to something like 2-1/2 percent from the somewhat over 3 percent rate on average for the G-10 countries this year. That is one factor affecting things the other way. Now, I think you have two scenarios. You have the scenario of 1988 where you had a relative increase in United States interest rates on balance through the year and approximate dollar stability. On the other hand, you also had 1987, where you had a relative increase in United States interest rates and a fairly sharp dollar decline over the period. So, I don't think science, if I can put it that way, [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	195	JOHNSON	 But I think part of the reason for the 1987 decline was that rates were moving more sharply abroad than they were here. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	196	TRUMAN	 No, there was a relative increase in United States interest rates over that period. But the issue I think really is where the market in some sense expects the equilibrium for the external accounts is, looking out to the long run. I don't think there's a strong--; you have views all over the map, from some saying the current account has to go to zero to ones who say we can live with a current account of $100 billion or so. I guess what has driven the staff forecast for exchange rates for a number of years now has been the view that it's not going to have to be one way or the other--that the current account while not necessarily having to go to zero is not going to be a deficit of $100 billion, which strikes us as a fairly big number to finance, and so forth and so on. And I think then the issue is the tradeoff between how much of that comes through price effects and how much comes through income effects, and to what extent somewhat higher interest rates in this country will work against the sort of underlying forces which are tending to drive some of this adjustment through price effects. The best we can do is to provide some rough thinking on the matter without a lot of precision, because I don't think there's a lot of precision here. Now, what we basically have built into this forecast is a 6 percent decline of the dollar from roughly where it is today at an annual rate. That translates to somewhat less than 4 percent in real terms. That's a relatively modest decline by the standards of recent years. The rationale for the modest decline is the fact that we do have United States interest rates moving higher. And it may be that you'll get another 1988 in 1989 as a result of this kind of forecast. At least on our modest equations, or whatever you want to call them, you're going to get a somewhat different outcome on the external account, and that is in fact where the [uncertainty?] is; you might as well call it that, too. I mean there are some forces in the economy also coming from the decline of the dollar; perhaps you would have less impetus in 1989 and also in 1990. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	197	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	198	MELZER	 Ted, when you talked about sluggish exports, you didn't mention anything about capacity constraints. My impression from some work one of our people did is that in key export sectors we are still in pretty good shape on the capacity side--electrical machinery, non-electrical. Is that your impression? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198812	199	TRUMAN	 Yes, that's certainly our impression of what we have seen. There have been some stories at some point in some areas,  but the few areas where there seem to have been capacity constraints seem to have eased off a touch since last spring. I confess we haven't been systematic in collecting information on that, but I've seen some. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	200	GREENSPAN	 I think the steel industry is the only sort of [unintelligible]. I assume that they could ask for a lot more if they had the capacity and orders, real or imagined. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	201	SEGER	 Keep their import protection. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	202	GREENSPAN	 Yes. President Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	203	PARRY	 Ted, it seems to me that the export numbers really are quite strikingly strong--$65 billion I believe in 1989 and $56 billion in 1990. My impression is that relative to what one would get in a model forecast like the MPS, it's a very strong number; and I was just wondering what kind of things would enter your judgmental forecast to get that kind of strength, particularly given the slowdown in GNP that you're expecting among industrialized nations in 1990. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198812	204	TRUMAN	 Well, as I've said, 13 percent rates of growth in value terms are not anything to sneeze about. We don't actually use the MPS model for this kind of relationship, so I'm not quite sure I can articulate--. And that model has for quite a long time tended to give a different picture for the external accounts than used directly in this process. One big issue has to do with how you treat computers, and whether you sort out computers from your equations. We have recently found it necessary in our forecasting to do that and then we sort of independently have to estimate what we think can happen to computers. That is one area where we have trimmed back the forecast relative to where it was a couple of Greenbooks ago. Excluding computers from our model, given the kind of equations that we have, we would have in fact slightly stronger volumes of computer exports [implied] from equations that we are currently using. I mean, that difference--between 8, 8-1/2, or 9--that's the sort of thing, looking at the fourth-quarter changes. We are roughly consistent with that. Some of the slowdown does come from the total-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	205	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	206	ANGELL	 I think your response to Governor Johnson's question is really a most interesting one. But as I understood your response to the Chairman earlier, you did not indicate the dynamic of the exchange rate adjustment. And so I presume you believe that if the interest rate increases were to come somewhat earlier and if possibly the economic slowdown that you have in 1990 thereby might occur, that the exchange rate adjustment might possibly be more inclined to occur during the period of slowdown than in a period in which we might have a disinflation or some commodity price deflation scenario. Would you agree that that's one possibility? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	207	TRUMAN	 That certainly is also a defensible scenario: that you will get less exchange rate adjustment in 1989 despite the slowdown in trade adjustment and more in 1990 if it appeared that the economy was itself slowing down and you were having some lessening of price pressures. That's one of the reasons why we end up straight lining it. If you get too fancy--  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	208	ANGELL	 So if the Committee, as the staff has interpreted it, is very serious in regard to inflation prospects and if that would then cause us to move interest rates somewhat more in the earlier portion of the two-year period, then it would, it seems to me, be possible that the exchange rate adjustment might take place in an environment that would be much different than for an exchange rate adjustment to take place in the current environment in which inflation is such a potential. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	209	TRUMAN	 Yes, it's possible. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	210	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	211	CORRIGAN	 I'll just take the other side of that for a minute. If you look out at 1990, I think the 'Catch-22' can be even sharper in the following sense. It is not at all difficult to stipulate a set of conditions involving a stable exchange rate at current levels, rather than a modest decline and a combination of relative United States and foreign economic growth. That would yield a situation in which the external adjustment not only stops, but it reverses by the end of 1990. I don't necessarily believe that, but if you went through a conventional exercise using conventional, and historical, estimates of the various elasticities, and so on, it's not implausible. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	212	GREENSPAN	 That's what the IMF and OECD [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	213	CORRIGAN	 It's not at all implausible to end up with a result in which, as I said, by the second half of 1990 you have the current account and the trade account deficits actually increasing. I have a great deal of difficulty accepting that view for a variety of reasons, but if you really want a Catch-22 to contemplate, that's it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	214	TRUMAN	 It's difficult to run these forecasts when you have different assumptions, but based on our conversation over the weekend, we did run a forecast in which nothing changed except the exchange rate path. Now, just as you may ask how do you get the exchange rate change, you can also ask how you get nothing changing but the rate. But for whatever it's worth, what we get on the current account under that scenario would be essentially no change in the current account, essentially flat at about a rate in the $110, $120 billion range. However, we do continue to get improvement, but at a smaller rate, on the trade side. And you essentially are in the situation in which the trade improvement just offsets the deterioration coming from the interaction of the higher deficits themselves and the higher interest rates which tends to deteriorate the current account. So, you get some trade balance movement over that period, but you would not get any current account movement. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	215	CORRIGAN	 I'm a little skeptical that the kind of historic relationships--which we implicitly assume--are going to be valid for 1989 and 1990. And as a result, I look upon that type of scenario with a lot of skepticism. But the fact remains that there are a lot of serious people who look at it as a quite realistic possibility.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	216	TRUMAN	 Well, as I said-- CHAlRMAN 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	217	GREENSPAN	 Most of the academics come out exactly [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	218	CORRIGAN	 It gets pretty ugly. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	219	GREENSPAN	 The question is you have to [unintelligible] to get elsewhere. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	220	CORRIGAN	 If they are right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	221	JOHNSON	 I think it's more likely than not that the trade balance is not really compatible with our inflation goals. It would not surprise me at all if we are left with a fairly large trade deficit by doing the things we need to do to keep inflation down. But that means there's a big structural problem and that's really the case. You have a big savings-investment imbalance worldwide and that's basically it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	222	CORRIGAN	 I'll put it in its most graphic terms. If Marty Feldstein is right, what would ultimately happen under those circumstances is that even with relatively high [interest rates, there] would be a major and possibly highly disruptive fall out of bed of the exchange rates. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	223	JOHNSON	 I don't want to focus on the dollar entirely, but the conditions under which you get that--; I don't think just running a large trade deficit is going to do it in and of itself if we maintain a policy that keeps inflation down. But the other side of that is that the trade numbers aren't going to improve either. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	224	TRUMAN	 Well, maybe we might emphasize one of the basic rationales for much of the forecast, which is this view that we have of the Committee's view about what it wants to do with inflation. Now, it also is true that we've done this with a modest exchange rate change and some degree of continuing progress--as a result of that in the real exchange rate change--in the trade and current accounts, obviously. Now, if you could change that equation a little bit so that you didn't have an exchange rate change, it's also true that in some sense you'd have a more favorable inflation outlook over this period because you wouldn't have quite the kind of [inflationary] pressure coming from the new exchange rate change over the forecast period. In that sense, there is a connection between the two parts of the forecast. Whether we got the balance right either on the domestic side or the domestic-external side I think we need to be humble about. But the exchange rate change in and of itself--the one that's built in here--does bring you, if you want to put it that way, further improvement on the external side and not runaway inflation. So, in that sense you're not bumping capacity constraints. That's partly because the rest of the economy is squeezed to the extent that you allow the external economy adjustment to continue. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	225	JOHNSON	 Well, it may be possible to have a financeable current account if it's consistent with keeping the inflation rate level. I'm not saying that's not possible, I'm just saying that's a close call. But I don't know anybody that's saying we can get balance in a short period that's consistent with that.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	226	GREENSPAN	" Well, the next stage of financing if we run into trouble and we are [unintelligible] are ""Bush bonds."" You know, we've got a huge capacity to finance with foreign-currency securities. We can finance this deficit almost indefinitely, if we want to create a huge exposure on the exchange account. We haven't even started in that area. "	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	227	JOHNSON	 Well, I'm thinking about stable financing. I agree that it's possible. Central banks can finance the whole thing for a long, long time. It's just not consistent with a lot of other stability. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	228	CORRIGAN	 That I imagine. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
198812	229	TRUMAN	 Well, I guess you could look at this forecast that we have and argue that you worry about how much of an adjustment there is in 1989 for various reasons, as the Chairman discussed earlier. But, actually, if you look at the total adjustment on the external side over the period where the trade balance essentially declines by $45 billion and the current account declines by about another $30 billion so that you're down to a $70--$80 billion dollar range for those two by the end of 1990, that I think is not an unattractive situation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	230	JOHNSON	 I agree with that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	231	TRUMAN	 Among other things, you could even argue that at that point the system could self-finance, if you want to put it that way, without needing added inducements. Also, once you get the trade balance down a bit, you don't have this great discrepancy between exports and imports. The growth differentials [unintelligible] but still have it working there, but not on the same order of magnitude as when imports were over three times the size of exports for a while. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	232	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Ted? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	233	SEGER	 What are you assuming on the exchange rate situation with regard to the NICs? You know they haven't necessarily followed the weighted-average G-10 that we [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	234	TRUMAN	 Well, this year in fact they've done better--or worse if you wanted to put it that way. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	235	SEGER	 Starting in 1985? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	236	TRUMAN	 That's right. We are assuming that there will be a continuing depreciation vis-a-vis those currencies but at about half the 4 percent rate in real terms to more like 2 percent in real terms. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	237	SEGER	 And the second question I have is for those people who argue that slowing our economy will help our trade deficit. Have you run a recession through your models to see what that does? If slowing is good, then recession must be terrific, right? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	238	JOHNSON	 Does wonders for the trade account but-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	239	SEGER	 Yes, that's what my question was.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	240	JOHNSON	 --bad for the budget. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	241	SEGER	 No, I'm talking about the trade [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	242	GREENSPAN	 It depends on what happens abroad. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	243	JOHNSON	 Yes, that's true. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	244	TRUMAN	 Well, I think one can distinguish between running a recession, which doesn't really buy you very much because you come out of the recession [at a lower] level of income and later come back to the same level of income as before, so you've just bought us a lower financial cost of imports during that interval. I would think between that case and essentially the case that's implicit in the forecast here, which is that the slowdown in growth is essentially a device that is consistent with slowing the rate of growth from something like 3/4 to 1 percentage point above what we think is growth potential to something more consistent with growth potential, and in the meantime dipping down below [potential]. That is, I think different, and you get something from essentially that percentage point, or a little bit more, lower growth than what you had with the economy running along at 1/2 percent [higher] growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	245	SEGER	 I wasn't talking about comparing recession to what we have now, I'm just saying comparing a slow growth forecast with an honest-to-goodness resession. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	246	TRUMAN	 Well, an honest-to-goodness recession would help in the short run. But I think when you come out of the recession and you get back to where you start from, it's not clear to me in terms of the external accounts themselves that you really have bought yourself very much. If you want to prolong the recession for an extended period of time, then you might get something. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	247	SEGER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	248	GREENSPAN	 Are there any questions for Mr. Prell? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	249	PRELL	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	250	FORRESTAL	 Not yet. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
198812	251	BOYKIN	 Could I? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	252	GREENSPAN	 Oh, by all means. I thought you were pointing to your colleague. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	253	BOYKIN	 One thing back on the price of oil and the way it's figuring in, you were saying that you are now looking at a $2 to $2.50 increase in the price of a barrel. At a recent meeting, I guess it was October, we were looking for a decline and it seemed that energy was a fairly significant factor in the inflation outlook--that is, a better outlook for inflation. And now that has kind of come back around to where we've been running $15+ a barrel. As I understand what was said, it doesn't seem to have the same adverse effect on inflation on the upside. Am I misunderstanding something here?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	254	PRELL	 Well, we went down on our oil price assumption for the November meeting. At that point we had consumer energy prices falling about a percentage point from the fourth quarter of this year to the fourth quarter of next year. Now, we have consumer energy prices rising almost 2 percent from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. That largely reverses the change we made last time, puts us back in roughly the same territory as we were in the meeting before last. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	255	ANGELL	 But, Mike, you also have some adjustment on the food side, though, that offsets that do you not? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	256	PRELL	 We have a little lower food price forecast than we did last time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	257	ANGELL	 And that's why the change in oil doesn't then show as much worsening effect this time. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	258	PRELL	 The net is a plus on the inflation rate. We just have a very slight slowing fourth quarter to fourth quarter from our last forecast in consumer food price inflation. We got a little bit better performance recently and so the fourth quarter of this year has been knocked down a couple of percentage points on consumer food price inflation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	259	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions? Mr. Melzer. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	260	MELZER	 I was afraid, when Bob was introducing me here, that I had better come up with a question. Mike, you mentioned that in looking at the 1990 forecast you had not attempted to project any potential shocks. The Chairman had mentioned one in terms of the currency shock. If you had to list the likely candidates, what kinds of shocks would you think about in that context? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198812	261	PRELL	 Well, there are shocks, if you want to call them that, the nonsmoothness that might arise on the real side. For example, on the inventory side of this forecast we have a rather smooth course--a little bit of a rise in inventory-sales ratios, but mild and very smooth. And in essence we have businessmen recognizing fairly promptly this slowing in the pace of sales and tapering down their inventory investment. Historically, things have not normally moved with such precision, though in this cycle we've been impressed with the rapidity of inventory adjustments through production adjust¬ ments when inventories might have piled up [unintelligible] in that very early stage in 1983, early 1984. So, there may be reason for optimism, plus what seems to be a rather cautious attitude that businessmen have looking ahead at this point. So, that would have to be one possible disturbance. Now, there are things that could happen on the financial side; exchange market developments, bond markets, stock markets that could create gyrations in wealth and cost of funds that make a more irregular path than consumption and other spending and then in turn give rise to inventory problems and so on that gives you a little more irregular path. Then there are those risks that one has to recognize as being associated with this kind of rise in interest rates and decline in profits--that in the nonfinancial sector, business finances could deteriorate. We would expect in this forecast a substantial deterioration in interest coverage. And everyone Is mindful of the  LBO situation and what that in turn could lead to, if there are firms [that] fall into some problem and lenders who might react to what they see as the emerging risks in lending to nonfinancial customers. That could have some effect beyond what we are anticipating. And of course the thrift industry situation deteriorates substantially in this picture. The earnings will be deeply negative, will be even sizably negative for the currently solvent institutions who have the smaller interest rate gaps. For the insolvent ones, with their larger gaps, this just exacerbates their problems. So, whatever risks there might be of some liquidity problem arising from a wide loss of confidence and [unintelligible] in thrift institutions, it's awfully hard to calibrate what kinds of real side effects there would be to that kind of development. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	262	JOHNSON	 I'm just following up on what you said there about the thrifts and another possible shock, and this is probably more for Ted, but this interest rate scenario raises questions about the LDCs. How do we see that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	263	TRUMAN	 [Unintelligible]. For those countries who have IMF programs, the modification of the compensatory and contingency financing facility, as it's now called, essentially allows them to build an adjustment factor into the size of financing they get from the Fund for rises in interest rates. It does provide more of a cushion in this area than a year or so ago. But the rise in interest rates no doubt will be an excuse used by those who want to take an unorthodox approach to these matters. On the other hand, a number of the representatives of these countries have also argued that they want to make sure that the North gets its house in order so that they can [not?] have it both ways. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	264	JOHNSON	 Well, what about this recent BA meeting? What did you make of that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	265	TRUMAN	 Well, I only know what I read in the newspapers, which suggested that they are exploring various options, none of which struck me as particularly novel in terms of the things that they like to protect, facilities or various [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	266	JOHNSON	 The only things I saw there were things like the headline that they agreed to work in unison this time more than ever in the past and that they [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	267	TRUMAN	 Well, my understanding of that meeting was that, although it is fair to say that these countries have been comparing notes fairly actively over the last several years, they were even more actively comparing notes [this time]. There is no desire on the part of each country to lock itself into the strategy of the other [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	268	JOHNSON	 I guess the question is, though, what happens under this scenario. I'm just sort of asking. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	269	TRUMAN	 Well, on the other side, we have a rise in the trade and current account deficits of the Baker 15 countries, if you want to put it that way, and they were forecast largely because of the rise in interest rates--though in some sense the interest rate rise is not that much different from what we've had before. It has not been  changed that much, and the issue is whether those larger deficits can be financed. If they can be financed through official or private channels, then the rise in interest rates in and of itself is not enough, it seems to me, to spark a conflagration. Lots of things could spark a conflagration, and if one occurs there will be a number of suspects, as Sam Cross said. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	270	JOHNSON	 What I'm trying to draw out of you is a possibility of a shock. If there's some sort of consortium in this situation and either a moratorium or something like that, what could be the interbank market effects of that? That's a potential shock I think we ought to be aware of. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	271	TRUMAN	 Yes, it would be a shock but I would think that the implications are likely to be less than they were 3 years ago and 6 years ago. Depending on how one classifies Brazil, for example, you have 45 percent of these countries--assuming Brazil has not been paying interest in the sense that the banks have not been taking in income for 2 years now but just now are able to do so. In that sense, you have for the Baker 15 countries about 40 percent of the bank debt of countries that have not been paying service in terms of interest. Taking Brazil out, it's more like 18 percent. But in some sense, the shock of giving up another 25 percent of that or 30 percent of that, if you want to put it that way, leaving just a handful of countries like Columbia and Uruguay etc., I think the shock would be there but it's not going to have a major impact. It's a risk, there's no doubt that it's a risk, but if you're looking for things to change the climate of opinion, as Mike was saying earlier, that certainly is one of the ones that could do so. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	272	PARRY	 Mike, would some of the more recent numbers that you've gotten in the last week or so cause you to revise up the fourth quarter at all? Retail sales and I don't know if you have the business inventory numbers or you will get that later-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198812	273	PRELL	 We don't have them yet; we get them later this morning. But I think the main pieces of data we've had, which are both very noisy series, are retail sales and the trade figures. As I noted, retail sales were a shade stronger than we anticipated. Ted noted the trade data looked a shade weaker without knowing the prices that go with them and all of that. On balance, it doesn't look like a substantial difference. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	274	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	275	GUFFEY	 Mike, in looking at the staff forecast in the Greenbook, it is difficult to know what you are projecting in terms of interest rate levels and when changes in those would take place. It would make quite a difference, it seems to me, as to what one might think would happen if, as I believe you said yesterday, you are looking at a 2 percent rise over a 12- to 18-month horizon. Do you have in this forecast much of that coming early on, or it is on out? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	276	PRELL	 The rise is pretty steady. But again, it's somewhat the same story as Ted described with the exchange rate. We don't have any particular impressions about what the optimal quarter- by- quarter movement would be nor what would be plausible to assume the Committee would want to do at various stages. But we assume that the  movement begins promptly and is significant over the next half-year and fairly steady into early 1990. PARRY. Then it flattens out in 1990? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	277	PRELL	 Then it flattens out. All of the rate increases occur by early 1990. And you can perceive the hint of this in our real forecast in that the most interest-sensitive sector like housing is beginning to level out by the end of the year. Our notion is that we are not trying to drive the unemployment rate up toward 7 or 8 percent in an effort to slow the inflation, that a more modest softening of the economy in terms of resource utilization levels is needed, but our design is that you want to get there fairly promptly so that you begin to turn the corner by 1990. Many different paths could be described; and, as Governor Angell suggested, if you went sooner with large interest rate increases, we presumably would anticipate, all other things equal, a slowing of the economy more quickly and an opening up of that degree of slack that we perceive to be needed. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	278	GUFFEY	 Just to follow on, Mr. Chairman, I would like to request that the staff, if they are going to build a forecast on projecting interest rate levels in the period ahead, that those be explicitly stated in the Greenbook so that we can have some feel when we run the model or make those judgmental changes, how we might compare with the Greenbook. It would be very helpful if there were explicit indications in the Greenbook of what those assumptions were. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	279	ANGELL	 I can understand the advantage of that, but it seems to me the disadvantage is that puts staff in a position of almost telling us what our job is. And I think being that explicit has its disadvantages for the work of this Committee, even though I can understand why it would be helpful to Reserve Banks. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	280	HELLER	 Just on that point, that's why I would be in favor of having alternative forecasts. One with, let's say, the interest rates going up and one with a different policy forecast. So, then you can really tell it apart, and I think that would fulfill what you wanted. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198812	281	GUFFEY	 Yes, indeed it would. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	282	HELLER	 And I think it would help a lot with making the proper policy judgments you want to make. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198812	283	GUFFEY	 As a matter of fact, I think that's the way it used to be done; [an assumption of] no change in policy. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	284	PRELL	 No, not in my decade of memory of this. And I think, Governor Heller, we have attempted on many occasions to present this at the Committee meeting. There are many questions that arise in terms of what should be put in the Greenbook, in part recognizing that this document goes outside of the Federal Reserve. But you know it's up to the Committee and the Chairman to tell us what-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	285	HELLER	 Well, I would think it's a lot less damaging if you've got three different forecasts out there rather than having one, because any outsider can say now that here is the Federal Reserve  forecast. Otherwise, he just has the policy options, and he still doesn't know which one is the right one. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198812	286	GREENSPAN	 Well, if I were on the outside and I got hold of a book which had three forecasts in it and had interest rate numbers projected against it, I wouldn't have any trouble figuring out what the Federal Reserve forecast was. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	287	HELLER	 Well, but not everybody is as smart. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198812	288	GREENSPAN	" Nobody's that dumb! Let's discuss that internally. There is another issue here: If we started to circulate [a document] with numbers on interest rates on them and it ever got out to the public, the implications of that would be beyond comprehension. This Greenbook is a confidential piece of paper. If this got lost on a train and somebody read it, it would be embarrassing but it would not be damaging, certainly not beyond the immediate FOMC meeting. But I would be very nervous about a piece of paper circulating outside the Federal Reserve with numbers on interest rates on it and ""Federal Reserve Confidential"" stamped on it. That would create problems for us for months on end. But I'd like to address the concern that President Guffey raised, because I think it's quite a legitimate one and I think we'd better address it. But let's see if we can find a way to resolve this question without getting on the edge of circulating pieces of paper outside which-- "	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	289	GUFFEY	 It could be done orally, Mr. Chairman. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	290	GREENSPAN	 Well, I'm saying that may well be-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	291	GUFFEY	 Staff to staff. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	292	GREENSPAN	 The question really is, is this something you need prior to coming to FOMC meetings? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	293	GUFFEY	 At least-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	294	GREENSPAN	 Let's see if we can come to some solution on it. It is not a simple issue, as we are well aware. President Hoskins. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	295	HOSKINS	 Well, my comments are really along the lines that have just developed here, which would be a notion of an alternative forecast or two. It's not because there's anything wrong with this forecast; I happen to think it's a very good presentation, particularly looking out to 1990 and trying to address inflation expectations and the rest of the problems that I think all of us are concerned with. So, I would be in favor of some kind of way to look at alternative forecasts. I'd like to know, for example, if you've run the model and you've looked at the 1990 inflation rate under alternative interest rate scenarios. We've got to know what the price might be to get a 1 percent reduction, say, in the inflation rate. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	296	PRELL	 Well, let me be slightly defensive on this, though I probably shouldn't be. We have presented alternative forecasts-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	297	HOSKINS	 I know you have.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	298	PRELL	 --a number of times. And the message is the same every time, and I think you all know it and I communicated it in a rough way yesterday. So, you are not going to get revelations each time we do this. And I have a feeling that the information we've been providing is being somewhat slighted in this discussion. We have on several occasions in the past year presented alternative forecasts, quantified the effects of different interest rate assumptions and so on, and you will [continue to] see the same thing unless our general perception of how the economic system works changes each time we do that. So, there are going to be very rapidly diminishing returns. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	299	HOSKINS	 I don't think you have any need to be defensive. I think the Committee generally has complimented the staff on doing those. It's just that if you were to put out a new one, like for 1990, I think it might be interesting just to refresh us as to what that would be. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	300	TRUMAN	 If I may join Mike, one of the problems this time is that this forecast normally would go to 1990 in February and would be done in conjunction with a chart show. We thought we were doing the Committee a favor, if I can put it that way, by adding 1990 in December rather than waiting until February. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	301	ANGELL	 It's appreciated; it's appreciated. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	302	TRUMAN	 And the task of doing that and combining alternatives with it would be more difficult than otherwise. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	303	GREENSPAN	 Yes, we know. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	304	TRUMAN	 We would intend when we go to 1990 in February, as we've always have done in the 15 years that I have sat around this table, to have alternatives in the chart show. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	305	HOSKINS	 Fine. And I don't think any offense should be taken at these comments. I think in general the staff has been very candid about their interest rate projections. At least, we didn't seem to have much trouble ferreting out-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	306	GREENSPAN	 You know, there's also another problem with this. Sure, you can say let's just re-run the model with the lower interest rates-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	307	HOSKINS	 Yes, that's the second [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	308	GREENSPAN	 The only problem with that is that there is no such thing as re-running the model with one change. The real art of running a model, as I think we are all acutely aware, is what you do with the add-ons, how you play them. This presumption that you've got an econometric structure which is pristine and captures the economy--one that never changes--is terrific for something, but I haven't a clue as to what. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	309	HOSKINS	 Can I finish up with this one? After that, I'm not sure I should venture back out here again! The model by its nature, and I guess the Greenbook as well, works off of an issue I raised before, which is kind of a [unintelligible] notion or a GNP gap notion. There is an alternative way to look at this where we don't  have to say that 2-1/2 percent is the historical real growth, and therefore not an inflationary real growth rate, and therefore anything other than that generates some inflation. We don't seem to be trying to take account, or perhaps we don't have the ability to take account, of changes in expectations about Fed policy or the credibility of Fed policy. So, I'm a little disturbed when we look at resource availability as the only way to get at inflation. I think we don't have a very good handle on that. Some of us might have tightened very aggressively if we believed the actual [full employment] rate was 6 percent, which many people believed a year or two ago. And it looks to me like we might have had a positive supply shock; we've got more labor at the same wage rate than some of us would have anticipated. So, I'm just looking for ways to try to look at it without using the traditional method. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	310	PRELL	 I guess we are questioning your interpretation of this year's events, so there is room for alternative interpretations. Basically, we've seen a substantial acceleration of compensation this year as the unemployment rate fell below 6 percent. Now, we are not taking a rigid view that the NAIRU is 6 percent in this forecast; far from it. But I guess this is an issue that certainly comes to the fore as you look at the experience of the past year. As to alternative years, you're quite correct that fundamentally we are taking a sort of short-run Phillips curve view of the world. One of the reasons that alternative forecasts got presented with diminishing frequency over the last half dozen years or so was the fact that the Committee frequently said that these are not very meaningful because they are based on this kind of wage-price structure, and we will get much better effects because there will be Fed credibility and so on. Now, what we find in actually looking back at the experience of the last several years is that the sort of short-run Phillips curve formulation of expectations built into that works fairly well in explaining the wage-price deceleration we've had without any obvious add-on of credibility. We have experimented, and we are trying to develop an econometric representation of more forward-looking expectations. Most of the rational expectations models have been constructed on very small non-structural models. We have tried to work with what resources we have to build a fuller model that has a more rational expectations sort of sense to it. At this point we really don't have something we can implement. But there's always a proviso you would say in this: that this is how things would turn out if we had the structure right, and if there were credibility effects you could get a bigger payoff for monetary restraint without the real side damage. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	311	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	312	SEGER	 Yes, I need help in the housing area, and this sort of ties into the issue of alternatives. You have housing starts, if I'm on the right line, going from 1.4 million this year to 1.43 then down to 1.36 million in 1990 with a fairly significant amount of monetary tightening built into these numbers. I know when you talked about different scenarios before, you had housing as one of the more interest-sensitive industries and therefore one that would respond most dramatically to tightening. So, when I looked at these, I really wondered if you had enough of a decline; or looking at it another way, I wondered, if interest rates were to stay where they are now, if housing starts would rise?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	313	PRELL	 No, we don't think so. Not certainly from the 1.55 million housing start level we saw in the most recent month's data. We have what we think is a reasonable decline in housing starts given our assumption that mortgage rates will be rising from the current 10-1/2 percent area to something between 11-1/2 and 12 percent by early 1990. This is not an exotic movement in terms of the models that exist. It's not just the mortgage rate that would be working against housing starts in this forecast. By 1990, the slowing of income growth begins to become a significant factor, and so we do have a fairly substantial decline, particularly in the single-family sector. Basically, looking at the demographics and the damage that's already been done in the multifamily area, we think that the single- family side is likely to be hit fairly substantially over this period. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	314	SEGER	 So, you don't think we are vulnerable here then? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	315	PRELL	 Well, there is a substantial range of uncertainty around every number in this forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	316	SEGER	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	317	PRELL	 This is not a very high number--in the area of 1.35 million starts--that we have in 1990. It's not as low as we saw at the depths of the last housing downturn. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	318	SEGER	 I hoped that you remembered that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	319	PRELL	 But you'll recall how high mortgage rates were at that time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	320	SEGER	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	321	PRELL	 So this seems reasonable to us, obviously, or we wouldn't have written it down. But there has to be some confidence interval around it. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	322	SEGER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	323	ANGELL	 What would happen in 1990, just taking the opposite view, if mortgage rates rose only 50 basis points while short-term rates were rising 200 basis points? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	324	PRELL	 That's a good question. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	325	ANGELL	 Well, what would that do to 1990's path? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	326	PRELL	 The question is why does the real rate only rise that much as the short rate is rising. If it is because of an expectational effect wherein the marginal efficiency of investment in a sense shifts, people perceive there is weakness ahead, they pull back, and they don't want to sell bonds to finance investment and housing construction or whatever; you might have in essence the same real outcome for a downward sloping yield structure. So, I guess it really depends what the circumstances are that produce that interest rate environment.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	327	ANGELL	 Well, certainly, we wouldn't be in control of those rates. Now, I suppose the manner and the timing in which rate increases might take place might affect [the outcome]. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	328	PRELL	 The more you surprise the markets with restraint in the short run as you're suggesting, the greater, I would think, [the probability that] you are going to get some adverse effect on the bond market in the short run. But you're probably more likely to generate in due course more of a downward-sloping yield structure as people's expectations of future economic strength and credit demands are weakened. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	329	ANGELL	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	330	GREENSPAN	 If there are no other questions I think we can start on our Committee roundtable. Ted. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	331	TRUMAN	 Can I just correct something which I said before--and I'm sure no one on the Committee remembers what I said-- but I have now looked at the trade numbers in a little more detail, and I want to correct one thing that I indicated. I think I said that non-agricultural exports had declined between September and October, and looking at the numbers a little more closely, I apparently had not adjusted for the fact that there was a rise in aircraft shipments. And if you include that, non-agricultural exports in fact rose or were essentially unchanged between September and October. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	332	GREENSPAN	 Your concept of non-agricultural is now nonag and non-aircraft? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	333	TRUMAN	 And non- aircraft, right. Also, there is a slight rise in those exports from their average for the third quarter. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	334	GREENSPAN	 Would somebody like to start us off on the round robin on the Committee members' positions on the economy? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	335	FORRESTAL	 In the absence of anyone else volunteering-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198812	336	GREENSPAN	 Well, I'm relieved. The silence couldn't go on forever! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	337	FORRESTAL	 Looking at the Atlanta District first, economic activity in our part of the country I think reflects pretty much what's going on in the nation as a whole. Export demand and import substitution are really the driving force in the economy and are supporting many of the basic industries in the District, namely chemicals and paper and steel and so on. In many of these cases, this kind of activity is generating pressure on wages, and it's showing up in the shortage of skilled workers, particularly in the chemical industry. In other industries, as I think the Chairman mentioned earlier, notably steel, the use of labor saving equipment has prevented this kind of pressure from developing. The wage increases that we are hearing about are reported to be in the 4 to 6 percent range, which is substantially higher than we had been hearing before. And I think it's interesting to point out that this kind of increase does not include benefits, some of which are being added to the employee's costs but a lot of it is being assumed by the employer. We are seeing export demand confirmed in other areas where we see  industrial warehouses being built at several of the southeastern ports, Savannah for example, and also some places in Florida. We have some weaknesses as I've reported before. We have high apartment vacancy rates and these have resulted in a number of projects being put on hold. Consumer demand has been fairly sluggish and this has led to softness in appliance production. Import competition is still affecting the apparel industry fairly adversely. In general, Mr. Chairman, if we exclude Florida, where growth remains pretty strong, activity in our other states in the District is on average moving at a rate that's somewhat slower than the nation as a whole with Louisiana, of course, continuing to be at the bottom of the list. Looking at the national economy, our outlook is considerably stronger than the one shown in the Greenbook, but basically because we have an unconditional forecast. And going back to the earlier discussion, I would hope that in any consideration of alternatives we might consider an unconditional forecast at least as an alternative. We are a little surprised and we disagree with the Greenbook forecast in terms of consumption expenditures, which we think will be stronger. And also we think that spending on nonresidential structures will not deteriorate quite as much as is indicated in the Greenbook. Those seem to us to be a little more consistent with actual recession or a substantial downturn than with the projections that the Greenbook shows. Putting this together with our forecast and recent economic indicators, it seems to me that the economy is growing too quickly and I don't think we have sufficient monetary restraint in the economy at the moment to avoid an uncontrollable level of inflation. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198812	338	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	339	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to report healthy economic growth with only a few signs of slowing. Manufacturing activity continues strong with particular strength in aluminum production and the aerospace and aircraft industry. However, we have seen some slowing in the lumber and paper industries where there has been some slowing in demand. In general, real estate activity in the District is robust, but there are some notable exceptions in Alaska and Arizona where commercial real estate is particularly weak and also in Utah. On balance, if we look at wage and price pressures, they clearly are upward and seem to have increased slightly in the intermeeting period. An exception to this is the forest products industry where, as I mentioned, some slackening is showing up and it is having an impact on prices that is quite dramatic. However, in general terms labor markets throughout the District are really quite tight. And if you recall, at the last meeting I indicated there even were signs of firms that are trying to locate in areas where there is greater slack--not in the built-up areas of Seattle or San Francisco or Los Angeles. With regard to the national scene, the economy remains at a level above its long-run potential. As a result, there seems to be a significant danger of more rapid inflation later in 1989 and especially in 1990. Our forecast of real growth in 1989 is not greatly different from that of the Greenbook. It seems to me that the implications of both outlooks are the same and that is that no significant slack in the economy will emerge next year and that  underlying inflationary problems are going to continue to worsen. If the dollar declines in value, as seems likely, that will mean that actual inflation rates will be subjected to further upward pressures as well. It seems that projected economic growth and inflation in 1990 argue strongly for policy tightening through the end of next year. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198812	340	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	341	MELZER	 I guess this would be the first report in four that I've given where, for the latest three-month period and this one would include the period through October, we've had some gains in nonagricultural employment. But those were quite modest, really, and primarily in the manufacturing sector. In the latest three-month period, manufacturing employment is up about 1.4 percent over the preceding period. In both residential and nonresidential construction on a year-over-year basis year-to-date, activity is down substantially, not quite double-digit in residential and about 13 percent in nonresidential. Christmas sales in major metropolitan areas I would say--and this doesn't include this last weekend--are running a little better than last year. In St. Louis and Memphis, that would mean a nominal gain of about 5 percent. Little Rock, and Louisville actually will have slight to moderate decreases on a year- to-year basis. The general sense is that retail inventories are in good shape and there is not a lot of evidence of unplanned price cutting. There have been price promotions, but they pretty much have been planned so far. Also, in the retail area, while [there is] difficulty finding help, we don't pick up a sense that there have been a lot of wage increases in the retailing area. One other anecdote I might pass on, is a large manufacturer of consumer durables; his general sense is that cost increases may have abated a little on the raw material side. They are very difficult to pass on and are being absorbed in margins. His sense is that basically this will continue to keep a lid on wage pressures in that particular area. And I guess that's the general picture there, although it certainly is not surprising given what we see on a broader basis in that sector. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198812	342	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	343	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, in the Eleventh District I think we are beginning to see a two-tier economy emerging. I think there is a little more optimism than we've had in the past. Those outside of the real estate construction and banking sectors are participating in a reasonably strong recovery now. Of course, energy is a swing factor, and the apparent stabilization of energy prices--or at least the lesser likelihood of a precipitous decline--bodes well for our part of the country, although from the inflation side people might wonder a little. This dichotomy kind of shows up in manufacturing, where industries related to foreign trade are doing well, while activities related to energy and construction are not doing all that well. Also, on the agricultural side, livestock producers are going to be squeezed somewhat because of the higher drought-related feed costs, yet the farmers with cash crops are doing pretty well. We think that employment growth in our three District states has been about 1-1/2 percent over the last year which is considerably better than the declines that we had in 1986 and 1987. Perceptionwise, anecdotally, and attitudinally, things really are improving. As I've  reported earlier, in Houston the improved attitude started I'd say 6 or 7 months ago. It's beginning to filter up from the coast to the Dallas area. We've had some fairly visible announcements made such as GTE relocating their telephone operations into the Dallas area out of Connecticut. They are talking 4,000 to 5,000 jobs and about 1,000,000 square feet of office space; they are going to build a big campus- style facility. A Japanese firm just made an announcement that they are going to build a manufacturing plant. They are talking about 1500 jobs in telecommunications manufacturing out there north of Dallas. Of course, the announcement on the super collider just thrilled everybody. It probably will never happen and won't get funded, but everybody is really happy about it. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	344	KEEHN	 Not everybody. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198812	345	BOYKIN	 Everybody that counts. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	346	GREENSPAN	 I assume that it was announced that they only had one state participating, everyone else decided [unintelligible]. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	347	BOYKIN	 That's the way a lot things can go out our way. Also, there's quite a bit of optimism given what appears to be a fairly significant Texas influence coming into the Washington arena with a new Administration. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	348	BLACK	 That may not be shared in other states. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	349	BOYKIN	 Yes, I'm not sure that's going to mean a whole lot, but it's being talked about as good for Texas maybe. On the national side, -- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	350	SPEAKER	 You're supposed to be quiet about that, Bob. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	351	BOYKIN	 Okay, tell all the secrets, right? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	352	BLACK	 We noticed. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	353	BOYKIN	 On the national side, we are pretty much in agreement on the staff forecast. I think there is obviously a chance that the economy will be even stronger than the forecast. We are a little more pessimistic on the inflation side. That being the case, I would be inclined for the reasons that have already been expressed to put in a little more restraint, and I'd be inclined to do it sooner rather than later. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198812	354	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	355	BOEHNE	 The regional economy continues to operate generally at a high level and the current indicators are positive. There are some pockets with some problems, but generally labor markets remain tight. Manufacturing continues to grow. The retailers seem to be feeling better now than they did several months ago. Loan growth is running well above the national average. There is some slowing in the nonresidential area, and I think there are early indications of some slowing in residential construction. There is some sense that next year at least the growth in the economy will not be as fast. It's hard to sort out whether this is supply constraints or lack of  demand. I suspect it's a combination of both. But the outlook is still for a high level of activity. As far as the national economy goes I think it does need some reining in. There are risks on the inflation side. But reaching that conclusion is not a one-way street. There is a whole set of risks that everybody around this table is familiar with--mostly in the financial area, thrifts, LDCs, LBOs, etc., etc. So, while we clearly need to rein the economy in, about the last thing we need is a recession and there is no sure way of reining in an economy without a recession. But even acknowledging all these risks, I don't think that you buy very much by ignoring the inflation side. I think these risks will tend to get larger if we don't deal with inflation. So, I come down on the side of reining in but doing it with some caution. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198812	356	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	357	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, we see the outlook just slightly differently from some of the comments so far; and again I would say. in the national context, our outlook for next year is a little more modest than the staff forecast. In terms of the District, there are really very few changes to report from the last meeting. Certainly, the District economy has moved along at a good pace. I think everything is very solid and there are no significant soft spots out there. But while the current situation does seem very solid, I must say I find the price inflation outlook to be particularly difficult to assess, and I find this an unusually difficult period. The Greenbook and Mike's presentation yesterday clearly make a case that the economy is moving along very rapidly. I think we've got some big price pressures out there, and I do find some of the data to be compelling. Maybe we do have a somewhat overheated economy on our hands. Alternatively, no one that I've talked to certainly is pessimistic; the attitudes with regard to next year I find very positive. On the other hand, from our director reports and our other contacts, I don't sense a particularly big upsurge as folks look into the next year. There are some constructive signs out there. Capital expenditures, particularly for equipment and machinery, are moving ahead at a very good clip, and many of these expenditures are being directed to industries that are operating at pretty high capacity rates: chemicals, petrochemicals, paper and the like. That ought to relieve some of the capacity constraints in those industries. Also, I'm hearing that some products that have been sold with long lead times or allocations are beginning to ease somewhat. Indeed, orders for communications equipment and electronic components clearly are showing signs of peaking. In autos, inventories as Mike reported yesterday are at higher levels. Therefore, I think it's entirely possible that the production schedules will be reduced for the first quarter of next year. And it's just possible that some of these prices that we have been hearing about are showing signs of some stabilization. An example I would give is a company I talked to that keeps a very good track of its expenditures for materials; this year their expectation is that their material costs will have gone up about 2.3 percent. Next year, they anticipate an increase of about 0.4 percent. They are very careful about [their estimates] and they keep good records. These numbers may not be typical of industry at large, but I think it's entirely possible that the trend is.  In my mind the big question is on the labor side. As I go around the District, everybody I've talked to reports a shortage of skilled labor. Labor costs are rising, but this is frequently on the non-wage side as opposed to the wage side. I think firms are continuing to get pretty good work rule changes, and therefore unit labor costs are under reasonable check. In a pricing perspective, the question obviously, which we'll talk about later, is whether we have done enough or should do more. Instinctively, I have the feeling that we've got a very strong economy on our hands. The price pressures are building up. We may see some increases, particularly in the near term. But also as I said I think there are some signs of stabilization. I continue to think that the risks are on the price side and that an upward policy bias will certainly be appropriate. The point I'm making is that I'm not sure just how draconian we need to be at this point to deal with these pressures. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198812	358	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	359	STERN	 I've reported at a number of meetings now about the generally positive, actually quite positive, economic conditions in the District. I've been in a lot of meetings since the last meeting of this Committee and that general tenor certainly continues. In fact, one of the striking things about those series of meetings is a lack of discussion of problems that people are encountering. One exception to that deals with things that I think we are well aware of like excess office space, hotel space, concerns about what people perceive to be some of the excesses on the financial side of the business world. I hear a lot of talk about the shortages of labor, not just skilled but unskilled. But that does not seem to have translated into what I would call generalized acceleration of wages from where they've been running. While you can find people who are talking about having to raise wages 6 or 7 percent, that is by no means typical. And I get the sense that generalized pressures for a variety of reasons just have not built up, and I have not been hearing anything about a generalized acceleration in prices either. As far as the national circumstances are concerned, our model forecast is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook especially going out over time. But that forecast has essentially flat interest rates. And, therefore, I take that forecast in some sense to be consistent with the Greenbook. That is, if you want at some point to start to constrain inflation more than we have and bend it down, it is going to require higher rates. If not, you are likely to get something that our model generates which is somewhat more rapid growth and no discernible progress on the inflation side. I think, as several people have already commented, that the latest batch of national statistics has removed a lot of uncertainty about the state of the economy and suggests that it just has a great deal of momentum to it. Even if we allow for the possibility that these statistics might be revised in the future, the gauges have been very high. And as I've commented before, it seems to me from some work that we've done at our Bank that we've got to start looking toward employment gains that are running more in the neighborhood of 200,000 workers a month or less if we are going to be on a sustainable path and if we are going to bring inflation down further over time. And I suspect that if and when that happens, there is going to be a lot of comment and some concern about whether the economy may be slowing excessively. And I would suggest that that's more like what we need and more sustainable.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198812	360	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Eisenmenger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	361	EISENMENGER	 If I could start off with the exception, which would be the New England economy, we've had the tightest labor in the United States during the last two years, and we are beginning to see some of that soften. In the Connecticut area, they have moved operations to the one remaining area which has some soft labor markets--Maine. And as Bob Boykin just mentioned, GTE is going to move to Texas. Our relative wages have moved up rapidly, and I think that's one of the reasons we may still be the hottest labor market in the United States, but the gap between us and the rest of the country is diminishing. What's happening I think is that the tightness is spreading throughout the country; it's not getting any tighter in New England. I would agree with Mike Prell's conditional forecast, which I also think is consistent with Bob Forrestal's and Gary Stern's forecasts, which are unconditional; and what we see if we move toward restraint is more modest growth next year, which would appear to be desirable. The only issue on which we might disagree with the Board staff is that even with that move toward restraint, we are a little more pessimistic about the inflation rate next year. We don't see many indicators yet of price pressures; they aren't creeping up very fast. But the compensation figures are increasing very rapidly; there has been a big uptick in compensation. And that does pass through to prices with not too long a lag. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	362	GREENSPAN	 Bob, is this a recent pattern you are talking about or-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	363	EISENMENGER	 Yes, we are talking about what has happened during this last year, and we are talking about three quarters-- 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	364	GREENSPAN	 What I'm trying to say, have you seen evidence of any significant acceleration in wages for the last, say, two or three months or is it just-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	365	EISENMENGER	 If you mean unionized wages, no. I was referring here to the figures on the employment cost indexes. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	366	GREENSPAN	 These figures apply to the year as a whole? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	367	EISENMENGER	 Yes. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198812	368	GREENSPAN	 Okay. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	369	EISENMENGER	 And then, no matter how you measure it--one two, or three quarters--it appears to be consistently greater this year than it was last year. I guess for the last two years many of us have underestimated the growth rate of the economy. We've always been a little surprised that it has been a little faster than we anticipated. The latest figures suggest we are going to be a little surprised with the fourth quarter so that we always lag behind a little on the real growth that has come through. So, I guess that would tend to bring about a little support for Mike Prell's assumption on a move toward restraint, or else we won't have that slower growth that he has built into this conditional forecast. I sat in this room on the outskirts with a lot of my former research colleagues during the late 1960s and the early 1970s; and in retrospect we saw, year  after year, that we ran on the ragged edge of full employment--on occasion a little overfull employment--and then gradually the uptick in prices got imbedded in an inflationary psychology in the economy. And we can only wipe that out at incredible expense in the labor markets in the United States and throughout South America and the world, and once that inflationary psychology gets embedded it's very expensive to get it out. I don't know if we'd ever do it again; the medicine for that is to take some prevention, and this way we don't get the same kind of environment embedded in the economy that we did gradually during the late '60s and '70s. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0

198812	371	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman I've been following these Greenbooks for a long time, and I think really in the last year or so they have been considerably better than they were before then although they have always been good. And I found this one particularly helpful although it does make me darn nervous on the inflation side because it suggests that there's very little room for error. It projects a further tightening of policy over this period and an appreciable rise in interest rates, and this doesn't cause the underlying rate of inflation to diminish very much, and then only well into 1990 when the decline is modest at best. So, it seems to me that the risk of error really is that we are probably going to have more inflation than the staff has in the Greenbook if in fact there is any risk of error in this. Wage pressures, as several people have indicated, are increasing--not rapidly in some cases--but certainly unmistakably; and if consumer prices increase at the rate of 4-1/2 to 5 percent that they are projecting for next year, it seems to me it's almost inevitable that we will begin to see some wage pressures then. So, I would not be surprised, in the absence of some action on our part, to see, rather than declining inflation in 1990, some wage-price spiral feeding on each other. and he expected wage pressures there and elsewhere to be considerably stronger than most people seem to anticipate. Now, on the real side of the economy, my guess is that in the first part of next year anyway despite signs that the rapid upward pace of some of the foreign economies may be slowing to some extent, we are still going to have perhaps a little more restraint in our export demand than the staff has suggested. And with the growth in employment and income that we are having in the domestic economy this suggests to me that probably domestic spending is also going to be stronger than the staff is projecting. So, I think we've got an incipient boom on our hands, but basically I'm in pretty close agreement with the staff in what needs to be done to control that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0

198812	373	HOSKINS	 Despite my carping remarks about using Phillips curve analysis, we've tortured the data in a number of ways and come up very close to what Mike does and we have no other way to do it except that. I still am caught with the notion that monetary policy affects nominal variables over time and not real variables. And I guess we can attribute this just to our short-term adjustment process.  There's nothing that I can add to what's been said with respect to either Mike's forecast or the strength of the economy overall. The District, as I've been reporting consistently for over a year, is strong and we don't see any noticeable softening. We don't see any breakout, however, either. We have met with a number of small business groups and also with our directors and the stories there are prices increases in terms of product price increases ranging from 3 to 7 percent, maybe a little higher in a few instances. Wage rates--our highest is probably around 6-1/2 percent in services areas in the Columbus market. There is somewhat of a skilled labor shortage; semi¬ skilled, there's no problem. Manufacturing people can attract the latter without any real upward pressure on wages except for the entry level in manufacturing where there is pressure in the low-skilled jobs. So, it really hasn't changed much; it looks like a fairly robust Fourth District. The only concern that I have relates to the the monetary base. We take the Greenbook forecast and then get an implied growth for the monetary base by using the Rasche model. It has a drop of about 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points from this year's growth rate. I don't know whether that's significant or not any more. I used to think I knew. But it does cause me some concern. So, I'll address that issue in more detail when we get to Don's presentation. Overall, I think the costs of allowing inflation to become embedded in the economy are very high, and I would skew policy and take the risk on the side of being overly tight. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	374	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	375	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There is not a great deal new or different with respect to the regional economy. Agriculture, for example, is very strong. There's a smile on producers' faces simply because the harvest is in and grain commodity prices are high. Along with Bob Boykin, I think the red meat producers probably will be squeezed in the period ahead because of those higher grain prices. Our manufacturing sector is fairly strong, particularly in the export-related types of products. In autos, all of the plants in our District with the exception of one are working a two-shift arrangement. That one produces a car that apparently is not selling, so the workers have simply been given a holiday over Christmas, and just recently that has been extended another four days; so it's the product that they are producing rather than the overall demand for automobiles. One other strong area is the high-tech area along the eastern slope of the Rockies and down into New Mexico. Those high-tech areas that were depressed a couple of years ago have come back and are doing very well. On the weak side, the energy sector in the District and construction, both residential and commercial, are depressed. Retail sales I'm told generally are sluggish. There was a very big day or week after Thanksgiving, which there always is, but rather than continuing on through, sales have dropped off in the major cities in our area. Whether that will come back with an additional weekend to shop before Christmas, our retailers don't know; they are still optimistic. Inventories are in good shape. With regard to the national economy, we are very, very close to the Greenbook forecast, but we didn't build in any restraint which means they are stronger than we would see the economy. But given the comments from directors, businessmen, and others there is a very  strong feeling that the Federal Reserve has a role to play and it will play that role in restraining inflation. As a result everybody talks about it. It is a concern and I think that I would come out on the side--even though our region trails the national rate of recovery--of addressing attention more closely to inflation than I would to the level of real output. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198812	376	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	377	ANGELL	 I've been somewhat surprised that the slower money growth hasn't shown through in auction markets, both foreign exchange and particularly in the commodity markets. M2 in the last four weeks over 24 months previously has grown I believe at a 4.7 percent rate which is the slowest growth rate over a 24-month period since 1961. I'm somewhat surprised that that hasn't shown through in auction makets, both foreign exchange and particularly commodity markets. But it seems to me we clearly have had some upward shocks in those commodity prices, some of them due to the more rapid money growth that took place in 1985 and 1986, and I suppose the most recent round based somewhat on a weather-related condition. But the fact of the matter is that commodity prices have plateaued; there have been some ups and some downs but there has not been a retrenchment from those levels that have given ample profit margins to induce we would hope further output. But it would seem to me that the real key question here is whether we maintain a posture in which the profit margins are expected to be obtained by maintaining restraint on costs and getting cost reductions through economic efficiencies by the use of some new capital and new techniques, or whether some of these higher commodity prices that have not yet passed through it seems to me to the entire consumer-price structure are going to be maintained at this level long enough until that takes place. So, it seems to me that given the fact that inventories are not in a position yet where there has been any inventory holding based upon price expectations, at least it doesn't seem to be clear there that we do have extreme vulnerability at this time to foreign exchange rate adjustments that might I think translate immediately into an inability to bring those commodity prices into line as to where they ought to be. I don't mean to put too much emphasis upon gold, and yet it's just somewhat representative of what I think happens here. As you know the price of gold did move down from $500 to $400, but there certainly has been ample evidence that the price would have the tendency to move back to the $420 range. It just seems to me that as the first of the year moves along for us and we get some return of growth in demand deposits, Don, that the opportunity cost changes that are already in place may not be sufficient to give us the further restraint on monetary growth. I'm still going to continue to believe that if we do get that restraint on monetary growth that we will get a better solution than some anticipate. But it's far better for us to be in tune to these problems at this point in time than to wait and get behind the curve. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198812	378	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	379	CORRIGAN	" Partly because our meeting cycles are a little out of synch, I don't have a lot to add on the anecdotal side at this point. My own general impressions in terms of the economy are that it is strong. In fact, I think it's too strong. Some of the very recent numbers, especially the labor market numbers,  conjure up at least in my mind some of my worst fears as a matter of fact. Insofar as the outlook is concerned, I think it is very illustrative to look at the Board staff's forecast versus the New York staff's forecast because as I've mentioned before by the end of next year those respective forecasts have a difference in the inflation rate of 1.3 percentage points or 1.4 percentage points. That is a very, very dramatic difference. As usual, Mike Prell touched on a critical point concerning that result, or outcome, yesterday when he said that in the process of putting his own forecast together he was continuing to resist the temptation to build into his own price forecast some of the types of behavior or results that might come out of historical experience. And indeed when you look at the New York staff's forecast versus the Board staff's forecast what you have in the Board staff's forecast by the end of next year is a rather distinct negative spread between unit labor costs and the deflator. In the case of the New York forecast, you have a positive spread between unit labor costs and the deflator. At least in an arithmetic way, that is what produces the sharp difference in the net result of inflation at the end of the period. Both have a rather significant further buildup in the rate of increase in compensation per annum. I think in the eyes of the people that do these forecasts in New York, what they essentially or implicitly are saying is that the overall economic conditions, market conditions, and so on are such that you will still maintain at least a small, positive spread between those two variables. My own hunch, if I had to pick a point, which I try to avoid doing, I guess I'd pick a point somewhere between the staff forecast here and the staff forecast in New York. But as I see it, the risks, as I have said before, are really very asymmetric. When I ask myself, what if Mike is right--Mike being collective for the Board staff--I'd say that's pretty good; it's not ideal in that he's got some things in that forecast that give you a little chill, but certainly I'd say ""terrific."" Then I say to myself, what if the New York staff is right? I'd say, holy mackerel, we've really got trouble, big trouble. It's in that sense that I think the risks really are quite asymmetric. Now, like a lot of other people, at this juncture I continue to draw some consolation as we were talking yesterday from what things like the long bond rate are telling us. Again, that's probably one of the reasons why I would be inclined to split the difference between those two forecasts. But I would tend to be pretty cautious even about that. I reminded myself last night, and I think this is illustrated in one of these charts that I guess Don is going to talk about later, if you go back to 1978 and despite the fact that there had been several increases in the discount rate as well as a firming of monetary policy over the course of 1978, by the end of the year we had a federal funds rate in the area of 9-1/2 to 10 percent; one-year Treasury notes at 10.60 percent; and the 30-year bond at 8.80 percent because we had a sharply inverted yield curve. We all know what happened after that. Now, 1988 is not 1978 for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is the energy shock that came in 1979. But at least to me it does illustrate that we have to be cautious in terms of what we read into these things. And again, it just reinforces my view that the risks as I see them at the moment are asymmetric on the side of the inflation rate being higher than the staff forecast. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0

198812	384	BLACK	 He has succeeded where many of us who have tried before have failed! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	385	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, first of all, I certainly concur that the economy is very strong and certainly stronger than I had expected it to be. And I would anticipate being in favor of some further tightening. But I'd like to return for just a second to a point that Ed Boehne made a little earlier, and maybe try to come down a little bit harder on it. That point is that I think we need to try to be sure to maintain a very broad perspective on what is going on in the economy and in our society more broadly and on how best we might be sure to achieve our long-term goal of price stability. Over the foreseeable horizon in the next year or two, I think it's in nobody's interest to allow--that's too strong a word--nobody's interest to have a recession occur. There are a lot of things that need to be straightened out. We all know what they are: the budget deficit, buying our way out of the thrifts, working our way through the Texas banks, chipping away at LDCs. Large money-center banks and maybe some others are going to need to raise some capital for risk-based capital. It's probably not too irrelevant to look forward to the fact that the GATT issue is beginning to accelerate; we had some first shots here recently on that, and if we wind up in an environment of protectionism as that heats up, I think it could be unfortunate. If we are in a bad economy, I think banking structure reform might very well be a victim of that in the Congress. If we have a recession in the next year or two, I think it clearly is going to exacerbate our ability to make progress in just about all of those different areas. We could wind up kicking the deficit sky high which could bring a terrible dilemma, in my view, to the FOMC because I don't know whether such an event would be highly inflationary or deflationary or maybe one then the other successively and both bad. Clearly, it could put both the Administration and the Congress on the defensive across the board on a lot of issues that could be serious. So, in short I can envision a scenario where if the economy were to go south too far too fast, we might wind up spending many more years trying to get to price stability than we would under some alternative scenarios. I would simply like to say that it's my hope that as we do go forward here, we'd be very careful as to how aggressive we get. We don't want to wind up with a Pyrrhic victory. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198812	386	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	387	LAWARE	 Well, I've always been convinced that inflation is the enemy of the people, and I think the inflationary pressures out there that have been described so eloquently by several of you certainly indicate that some [policy] snugging is necessary. I hope  it's not too heretical to say that I think that the markets expect it and that a failure to do some snugging at this point would be sending a very bad signal to the markets. And so I'm encouraged that we ought to do that. Certainly, the economy continues strong. But I've got a metallic taste in my mouth when I start trying to quantify--and this is the difficult part--the implications on these fragile elements in our financial system of a 200 basis point rise in interest rates, or something comparable. Ted has commented that that was not an attractive factor in connection with LDC debt. And whether we like it or not, there are still a lot of the biggest holders of this debt who are under-reserved by any measure of the marketplace. We have these very fragile LBO deals where the cash flow coverage of their debt service is so' tender that anything that might happen to the economy would create a downturn in revenues or an increase in the servicing cost of debt that could crash one or more of these big babies. The ripple effects on investors and on the confidence factors in the economy I think are kind of awesome to contemplate, plus the fact that we are just digging the hole for the thrifts at a much greater and faster rate with this, and nobody has yet come up with the right answer to that one. More recently, we've had the question of real estate overhang, and a higher set of interest rates is obviously going to at least prolong the resolution of that overhang. So, at the risk of sounding like a broken record I think as we apply the brakes here, if that is what we are going to do--snug up--we ought to do it very gently, and as Mike Kelley has said, keep our eye on all of the effects that a snugging has on the economy and be ready to deal with them quickly if we find the thing getting out of control. I think the costs of getting back if we really dump this economy would be terrible. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
198812	388	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	389	SEGER	 I've been sitting here listening, then trying to match the comments with what I read in the Beigebook. Either some weeks have passed or else I just read the Beigebook wrong. But it sounds as though the views expressed were quite different; namely, the views today are much more optimistic than what was presented as those observations. Also, maybe Mr. Hoskins can help me out on this, it seems to me the NABE runs periodic surveys of members, and it seems that roughly half of the members expect a recession some time next year. And most of the remaining respondents expect one in 1990. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	390	HOSKINS	 I don't have the numbers, but I think the majority expect a recession within the next two years. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	391	SEGER	 It was 47 percent next year. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	392	PARRY	 Of course, two-thirds expected one in 1988. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198812	393	HOSKINS	 We tend to roll those things forward. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198812	394	SEGER	" But when I read these I'm trying to ask what they know that we don't know or what are they assuming that we are not assuming. Again, in talking with some business economists, I think they are somewhat more pessimistic on the consumer side than our staff forecast. And in the housing area, at least, again I think some of them might be a little more pessimistic. A number are bringing out these stories of real estate problems, even in the Northeast. I think  there are some banks in the Northeast that are now actually indicating that they are going to have to take some losses on real estate loans which is quite a change from what people were telling us a few months ago. I think this is also true in some other parts of the country which have been doing extremely well and now are turning around a little bit. I can't imagine that that's an environment in which developers are going to hustle out and start more condo projects and apartment buildings, etc. Also, in the capital spending arena some of the reports that I pick up--computer chips, those sorts of companies-- it seems that again the situation has changed dramatically in the last few months. In fact, in some cases they've gone from a shortage of chips to situations with almost an excess. Also, some of the auto economists I know are a little more pessimistic about the inventory situation than I've heard expressed around the table here today. In fact, I heard yesterday that the days-supply for one of the very large auto companies would be a little over a 100 at the end of January. That's high. Also, when you get that kind of inventory situation in autos, you do see them follow through with some production cutbacks. They have used incentives to a tremendous extent as you know, but the ""bang for the buck"" from incentives seems to be petering out. So, if I had to come down on one side or the other, I would think they would fix this through some production changes rather than trying more incentives. Also, in the export area I'm not sure that all the business economists I've spoken with and some other contacts I've made expect the strength in the exports to be as great. They would certainly like to get it, but there is no real confidence that we will continue to make these tremendous advances that we have. Also, in the area of inflation and price stability, etc., one of the things that I think econometric models haven't picked up or haven't captured is the changed situation out in the real world, particularly in manufacturing. I mean the changes that are going on, the emphasis on efficiency, productivity, cost controls, knocking off layers of management, etc., I think that has been going on the last couple of years and I think it is still going on. And frankly when you look at some of these relationships back 10 or 15 years, it was a very different America then. I think we've learned something and I can't imagine that these improved attitudes are just going to suddenly evaporate. Also, I think on the labor side some of those people too would rather be employed at $17 an hour than unemployed at $18.25. Ask your friend with the building trades why so much of the commercial building is being done by non-union workers. Maybe that's had some impact on the fact that unions haven't had those nice settlements that they used to drool over. They, too, may have to pay attention to markets, Bob. This is a shock to union people. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	395	BLACK	 I think they have. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198812	396	SEGER	 But it seems to be going on, and particularly if construction isn't rocketing ahead, I would say that the bargaining power of management might be even stronger now than it was a couple of years ago. And also, looking at some of the sources of the higher prices that we have seen, I'm not sure we are able to control them. For example, looking at copper prices, what are we supposed to do about a strike some place? We are going to go down and pull the people back out? I mean, that has influenced the copper prices. Wayne's farmer friends have certainly suffered from bad weather  conditions this year, and that has certainly put upward pressure on prices of agriculture commodities. I don't know what we are supposed to do about it. And also, looking at the prices of some the steel products, it seems to me that they have been influenced by these silly quotas that we've put on the imports of steel. So, maybe we need some help from our pals down the street to fix some of these things. Now, I think the Federal Reserve ought to do its job. And I know Roger Guffey says everyone is looking to us to do it. Maybe we ought to tell them that we can't solve all the problems, though we can do our share certainly. Picking up on one of Governor LaWare's comments, I think the problems in the thrift area are very, very severe. I met Monday with a person who is I think pretty expert on thrifts and he had some very negative things to say about thrifts. He indicated that even building into their cost of funds the existing level of short-term interest rates would do tremendous damage, because it doesn't feed in immediately. You have CDs that have fixed maturities and it takes a while for existing levels to influence those. He's not a crackpot on this subject, so I took his comments rather seriously. And also on the LDCs, I think that that is something that really could give us and the banks that have been involved with those things even bigger headaches. So, I just think it's a very difficult call. My own personal conclusion would be that it's not certain that 1989 and 1990 would be excessively strong even without a 200 basis point advance in interest rates. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198812	397	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	398	JOHNSON	 I'd generally like to associate myself with what Governor LaWare and Governor Kelley said. I think everybody made a lot of useful comments, but they captured a lot of what I wanted to say. I think generally that the economy is reasonably strong, a little stronger than I probably would have expected at this stage as well. But we've all acknowledged that we see some signs of slowing and I think that's probably in the works but at a fairly high level. I think we've done a good job in establishing the credibility of monetary policy during this period. I say that because I think it is illustrated in the way the financial markets have behaved with long- term rates remaining stable or even showing some signs of declining. Commodity prices, while they are at high levels, have plateaued and have trended down some from their peaks if you take them all together. The dollar has been relatively stable except for this one speculative period after the elections, but I think it's still about 5 or 6 percent above where we started the year. So, in general I think we've pursued a credible policy and haven't been behind the curve, although I agree with what John LaWare said--that part of what we see in the financial markets is the credibility that's based on what they expect us to do. And so I think that if you want to maintain the degree of confidence in the financial markets that you see right now, some tightening is probably necessary. I'm not opposed to that, but I think it's very important to consider the speed at which we undertake these tightening actions. We have to do enough to be credible and to appear to be ahead of the situation, but at the same time we've got to be very careful to consider all of those contingencies that were mentioned by John LaWare, Mike Kelley, others herf;. I happen to have some additional worry about a world-wide ratcheting up of interest rates because I do think Germany is about to move, and I think all of  Europe will follow because of the EMS. I think that's already evident out there if you look at the markets and what they are prepared to do. Europe is prepared to ratchet up rates right away. As a matter of fact, one or two countries already have moved up their discount rate. Whether Japan follows or not, I don't know. But we are about to move the world level of interest rates up in general and that obviously is going to have some effect on the LDCs. It's going to feed back on the thrifts here, equity markets, and all of those things. So, taking all these things into consideration, I still think it's probably a necessary move, but we should be very careful about a sledge hammer effect. We need to be careful in the pace, that's all. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198812	399	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198812	400	HELLER	" Almost everything has been said, Mr. Chairman. Let me make three points briefly. First of all, I think we've got to continue to make progress on the inflation front. We have seen a 1/2 percent increase in wages and a 3/4 percent increase in total compensation. That is unacceptable and will lead exactly to what Bob Eisenmenger was saying was happening in the 1970s, a continuation of the slow upward creep of inflation. What I find troublesome about tightening policy, in particular, is the ill effect on investment; the staff forecast has a 0 to 1 percent growth in investment for 1990. If we are worried about capacity constraints and things of that sort, certainly we are not going to be building any additional capacity in that environment. What makes me feel a little better about tightening is that I think there is a lot of unexploited potential in the export area. A lot of American manufacturers really are not yet focusing on that at all. And so I'm a bit more optimistic than the staff forecast as far as continuation of export growth is concerned at going exchange rates. A lot of speakers have mentioned that we have to be aware of the fragility in the financial system. I think that's certainly an important point. But I would say that we can't design monetary policy to avoid any difficulties in various sectors. In the first place, we've got to focus on inflation and if something goes wrong then you can address those problems very much in a manner in which we have addressed them in the past--for instance, after the stock market crash last year, through a quick adjustment in policy. So, I'm also in favor of a tightening of policy. But just in case you feel too good about the whole thing and you haven't read Paul Erdman's ""The Crash of 1989"", and you still haven't ordered your Christmas present, if I remember correctly the opening sentence of that book is, ""It was early December 1988; the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee was meeting in Washington and there was a chill in the air."" The rest is history. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0

198812	406	KOHN	 As a number of people have already remarked, the period since  the last FOMC meeting has seen a further flattening of the yield curve.  As can be seen in chart 1, this occurred with short-term rates rising  substantially, while long-term rates increased by considerably less a  fairly typical pattern for 1986. Long-term rates have risen by less than  half a percentage point since last winter, while short-term rates have  gone up about two percentage points. Moreover, viewed in a slightly  longer context, Treasury bond rates have fluctuated mostly around 9 percent for more than a year and a half.  This behavior of long-term rates raises a question about the  degree to which monetary policy has applied effective restraint on the  economy this year. A focus on long-term rates remains appropriate, even  with the spread of variable-rate financing in the 1980's. Long-term  rates still directly affect a substantial volume of funding and spending  decisions. In any case, these rates embody a set of expectations about  the path of future short-term rates that anyone contemplating a long-term  resource conmitment would have to take into account.  The most obvious interpretation of the changes in the yield  curve and the lack of trend in long-term rates is that savers and  spenders do believe that the Federal Reserve has applied or will soon  apply sufficient restraint to forestall a major, sustained increase in  inflation rates. The current configuration of rates suggests expectations of some additional firming of policy in the near term, but very  little subsequent Increase in rates. By contrast, as Mike has noted, the  greenbook forecast embodies a quite different outlook for rates. A portion of the difference lies in the staff's assumption of a policy that  will foster a reduction of inflation an outcome the market does not seem  to be anticipating. But the more important factor is the notion in the  staff forecast that rates have not yet Increased to levels that will  forestall additional pressures on resources and higher inflation.  The differences between the market and staff outlooks involve,  at least implicitly, some judgment about two, unfortunately, partly unob-  servable variables the actual level of real interest rates and an equilibrium level consistent with the economy growing along a path that will  not cause inflation to increase or decrease. The actual level requires a  measure of inflation expectations; the equilibrium level, seme notion of  the factors impinging on spending and saving decisions relative to the  economy's potential, taking into account developments abroad as well as  domestically.  One reading on long-term inflation expectations and of actual  long-term real rates is from the Hoey survey of 10 year inflation expectations, shown in chart 2. The last column of this chart shows a drop in  inflation expectations from spring of 1987 when the Federal Reserve began  to tighten. However, the survey does tend to confirm the evidence of the  yield curve that inflation is expected to remain near or a little above  the rates generally prevailing in recent years. The decrease in inflation expectations implies an upward tilt to real long-term rates, shown  in the lower panel, since the spring of 1987, following the substantial  increase in this measure that occurred with the initial upward movement  in nominal rates in early 1987.  One year ahead inflation expectations, shown In the first  column, have risen on balance since early 1987 or 1986. These expectations are likely to be more confidently held than those looking ahead 10  years, and real rates derived from them, though not as relevant in theory, may better indicate immediate influences on spending decisions.  The one-year expectations from the Hoey survey have been subtracted from 1-year treasury rates to produce one-year real rates in the  top panel of chart 3. The middle panel uses the inflation expectations  in the Michigan consumer survey, which have roughly paralleled those in  the Hoey survey. The bottom panel uses recent actual inflation rates as  a proxy for inflation expectations. In all three measures, the intensification of inflation expectations has damped the increase in real  rates associated with the System's firming since March. As a consequence  the rise in real rates through most of 1987 and 1988 appears fairly moderate. The most recent plot on the charts, connoted with a star, was  constructed using yesterday's nominal interest rate together with the  last available Inflation expectations. The apparent juns> in real rates  shown by the star must be interpreted cautiously, since the measures of  inflation expectations have not had a chance to react to the recent  strength in the economic data, but nominal rates have; one-year rates  rose another 10 basis points yesterday following release of the retail  sales data. Judging whether, taking account of these factors, real rates  have risen sufficiently to restrain growth to a more sustainable pace  over the next year or so and to avoid additional inflation requires as  well that they be compared to an equilibrium real rate level.  This equilibrium level has even less foundation in directly  observable market quotes or statistical measures. To a considerable  extent it must be inferred from past observations of real rates and their  effect on the economy, together with an analysis of factors that might  have affected this relationship. Real rates now are well above the late  1970s, when they were associated with excessive demands and accelerating  inflation. But they are under levels earlier in the current expansion,  when the economy was growing rapidly, and in particular below the rate  needed to slow expansion in 1984. Demand in that period, however, was  boosted by substantial fiscal stimulus and catchup spending following the  recession, with some offset from expanding imports.  Real rates also are higher than they sees to have been in the  early 1960's, a period of sustained noninflationary growth. Two factors  make it likely that the equilibrium level of real rates has risen substantially from that earlier period. First, deregulation of the financial system and innovations in financial instruments have reduced  liquidity and credit availability constraints on borrowers. In the  absence of roadblocks to spending associated with difficulties in obtaining credit as a result, for example, of dlsintermediation and usury ceilings, real rates must now rise higher to exert the same restraint on  spending. Second, partly as a consequence of the fiscal deficit, we are  a high consumption-low national saving economy. The consequence of this  for interest rates was damped for a time by the flow of saving from  abroad. But, the rapid improvement in our external balance in real terms  in 1988 in response to the earlier decline in the dollar, together with  the small size of the shift toward less fiscal stimulus probably has  worked to raise the appropriate level of real rates this year. These  effects may have been offset to an extent by the effects of the decline  in the stock market In late 1987, which boosted saving to a degree.  On balance it would seem that relatively high real rates by  historical standards probably are needed now to keep spending in line  with the economy's potential. These equilibrium real rates likely have  not changed very much this year, but if they changed they probably rose a  bit, further limiting the additional monetary restraint implied by the  increase in measured real rates. However, the rise in real rates from  their trough in 1986 probably has contributed to taking some steam out of  the economic expansion in 1988 relative to 1987. And the lagged effects  of further increases this fall should lead to additional slowing in the  nonfarm economy next year. If the slowing already in train were thought  to lead to a pace of expansion and level of demand no greater than the  economy's potential, then alternative B might be considered appropriate.  After year-end, short-term interest rates might edge down a little under  this alternative, given that federal funds eventually might center a bit  below recent levels, and that the firming expected by the market would  not materialize. The implications for long-term rates are more difficult  to discuss. The interest rates of this alternative would be likely to  keep M2 growth above the bottom of its tentative 1989 range over the  first quarter, with growth of about 4 percent expected.  On the other hand, if, in light of the continued expansion of  the economy at rates above potential and the moderate rise in real rates  so far together with the current relatively high level of resource  utilization, the risks were still seen to be asymmetrically on the side  of higher inflation, an additional tightening of policy, such as incorporated in alternative C, might be considered. Although some firming is  built into the existing structure of short-term rates, the size and immediacy of the alternative C action would raise short-term rates, though  by less than the size of the Increase in the federal funds rate. This  increase would be echoed in real as well as nominal rates, unless new  information caused an upward revision in inflation expectations. With  interest rates and opportunity costs rising under this alternative,  demand for money would be restrained, and through March M2 might grow  around the lower end of its 3 to 7 percent tentative range. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	407	GREENSPAN	" Thank you, Mr. Kohn. Having listened to all of this, certain things seem to be coming forth fairly clearly. One starts off with the quite credible concerns of Governors Kelley and LaWare about the dangers of a recession. I think that we must make certain that we focus policy in a manner which reduces the probability that we will be confronted with that. And that strikes me as a requirement to make certain that imbalances don't emerge in a manner which tilts the economy over. As far as I can see, the only way we can do that with some degree of reasonableness is to move toward a tighter policy at this particular stage. The open question is when and how much. The issue was raised in the Bluebook about the alternative of the discount rate. I must say I have some problems with that largely because the distinction between a discount rate and an open market operation is, or should be, largely the announcement effect. I don't think at this stage that we have any need for an announcement effect. I believe that judging from the structure of the markets that what we are doing is perceived by the markets as being sufficient to constrain inflationary imbalances. The markets may be right or wrong about our actions, but if you look at the extraordinary stability of the long-term rate that's what they believe. And so long as that is the case, I do think that does suppress the possibilities of the wage acceleration that I'm sure would occur otherwise. In any event, what I think we have to say to the market is pretty much what they've been expecting us to say and what they think is the right thing to do. Under those conditions, I don't think it is necessary for us to make a big ""gong"" as would be the case if we fell behind the curve, so to speak. If we found we were off center we would have to hit a gong and say we were back here or there. I don't think that is necessary, and in fact I think it probably would have some secondary negative [unintelligible]. Having said that does not mean that I think we should shrink from open market tightening--because at this stage, maybe at any stage, you really have to ask the question of what happens if you institute a policy and you're wrong. Well, from all the evidence that has been introduced around this table this morning and yesterday, I think that with the contemplated tightening that we've been discussing the risk of tilting this economy over at this stage is exceptionally small. Moving forward and finding that we made a mistake is a possibility, but I think the cost of such a mistake is really much smaller than the cost of doing nothing in the face of what basically is going on. As a consequence, the way I see it and I'd be curious to get responses is that (1) I think that we should tighten and I think at the end of the day, meaning certainly by the time we are back here the next time, we should be up by $200 million in additional borrowing. I would be disinclined, however, to do it immediately if for no other reason than I think we are potentially caught in the ratcheting in the EMS that's in the process of going on as Governor Johnson indicated. I don't think it would be useful for us to be perceived in the markets as trying to ratchet up with them. And we'll get the type of results which I think we unfortunately obtained in the summer of 1987. As a consequence of that, what I would think is a possibility, at least one that I'll throw on the table, is that we move $100 million immediately with asymmetric language, with the  understanding that unless something changes the very strong outlook in the period immediately ahead sometime in early January we move another $100 million at the discretion of the Desk with regard to the question of timing and the change in specific data or information. So, I would suggest that as a beginning. I must say that I hope we don't have to go the 200 basis points that's implicit in the staff forecast because I think that's going to create a lot of problems for us. But I don't think there's any difficulty in moving roughly 1/4 to 1/2 a percentage point in here. Clearly, it does move LIBOR, and it will move the prime rate; it will have some negative effect on LDCs and on the S&L cost problems. But in my judgment, the cost of not moving would be far greater. The real decision we are going to have to make relative to these other issues is not this one. If in fact the staff forecast turns out to be relevant to the consideration here, the difficulty that we will have with the secondary effects in the markets will not be the first 100 basis points. It will be the second 100 basis points. And then I think we are going to have some very tough choices to make. Governor Heller. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	408	HELLER	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I broadly agree with that strategy as the right strategy. Where I may differ a little is on the tactics. Like you, I find it very encouraging that long-term rates have remained sort of stable. That has certainly been a very good sign. When it comes to choosing between the alternatives ""B"" and ""C,"" I think this time around we see quite a bit of a gap between the alternatives the way they are specified. Usually, they are almost touching each other. This time there is a considerable gap. The way I read it, the federal funds rate associated with ""B"" is about 8.4 - 8.5 percent; with ""C"" it's about 8.9 - 9 percent. And so there is that considerable hole in between. I think the right policy is right in between that. I'm very much in agreement with you that where we want to get is to a funds rate of 8.7 - 8.8 percent. Now, as far as the tactics are concerned, I certainly think your-- "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198812	409	GREENSPAN	 You're going to the metric system. That's an inside Board joke. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	410	HELLER	 Thank you for this--one small step at a time. The discount rate versus tightening by raising the level of borrowing: I think we all agree the announcement effect right now that we are tightening would be stronger with a discount rate move, and I think I would lean toward doing it with a stronger announcement effect just to make it clear, to put the marker out there that says the Fed is tightening. It's not a snugging exercise but a move to stay ahead of the curve. We'd also put ourselves in a position to be ahead of the EMS--I mean, all the European currencies --which we probably will not be perceived as being if we do it in a gradual escalation of the borrowing requirement. It can be read much more that we know the dollar will be coming under pressure and the Fed is reacting to those pressures in the exchange market. If you move with a discount rate right now when clearly there are no pressures, you forestall that kind of a constellation. And finally, the spread between the fed funds rate and the discount rate is very large. It will become larger if we just tighten, and then the market clamor will continue about when the discount move finally is going to happen. So, we won't get over that particular psychological hurdle; we will still have that hanging behind us. So, to sum up, I probably would go with a discount rate increase right now of 50 basis points and then some additional  tightening if it's necessary late in the period to come out exactly where you want to come out with the federal funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198812	411	PARRY	 Well, you mean, then reduce the borrowings? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	412	HELLER	 Well, I don't know what the borrowings-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198812	413	PARRY	 Well, I mean, that's the implication. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	414	HELLER	 I'd just do it in rates, right? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198812	415	HOSKINS	 You want short rates at 8.9 percent, or something like that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198812	416	HELLER	 No, 8.7 to 8.8 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198812	417	HOSKINS	 I just wanted to be clear on that. Can I just ask a question about something several people have suggested already and that I agree with? The market expects some tightening, but we don't really have an estimate of what that is. Don may be able to help us with that. And a related second question is, to what extent is a rise in the discount rate expected in the market? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198812	418	KOHN	 Peter may have another view, but my reading of the structure at the very short-term end of the market is that the market has close to a 1/2 percentage point [increase] in the rate built in. Sometime in the first quarter market participants expect the funds rate to be close to 8-7/8 - 9 percent, or something like that. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	419	STERNLIGHT	 I would agree with that. I think a discount rate increase had been very imminently expected just after the employment numbers. I think it's still kind of expected. It does not seem to be that much on the edge of the table as it was maybe a week or so ago in the market. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	420	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	421	JOHNSON	 I agree completely with the Chairman's scenario. That's the one that I had in mind when I came into the meeting. I think it's certainly worth discussing the discount rate, and maybe I can be convinced, but I still feel the best option is the one the Chairman outlined. In part, I think if you move on the discount rate, you will run the risk of its seeming to be part of a coordinated world-wide upward ratchet in rates about which I have already expressed some concern. But I also have a little concern that if the [new rate] is considered to be sort of the peak [in rates]--I realize that may not be the case for a lot of you--but if it is expected, given the yield curve, that we really have made the final move and the next move will be to lower rates, I think that's going to put some pressure on the dollar. Moreover, I don't think it's.a bad idea to leave the discount rate hanging in peoples' mind as a means of support for the dollar. And so, I see the scenario the Chairman painted as the best one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198812	422	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	423	MELZER	 I saved my policy comments until now, and I discovered at the end of the other discussion that I may be the only  one who hasn't commented on policy. My view, basically, is that I'm concerned about inflation. I think it's too high and I think it will probably go somewhat higher in the coming year, so I don't disagree with that view. But I also feel, given the restraint that we've exercised over the last two years in general, that inflation is not going to get away from us. I take some comfort from what's going on with long bond yields, as some people have mentioned. And I think we have to put the inflation in a longer-term perspective in a sense and say that to some extent the seeds for the inflation we are looking at now were sown in 1985 and 1986 when we had 12 - 15 percent growth rates in money. And I think to attempt to wring it out all at once-- and this is consistent with some other views that have been expressed here--to try to deal with that too aggressively is just going to take us off the track as I mentioned at the last meeting of really making long-term progress on the inflation front. And if you take a reserve or aggregate base view of what Don was expressing earlier in terms of real interest rates, I think the course we've been on particularly in the last 6 months or in the last 3 months, and particularly where we've had virtually no reserve growth, incremental tightening at least viewed from that perspective could lead to negative reserve growth that is going to hit the economy a lot harder than people may appreciate. So, what I'm saying is that in general I've been quite satisfied with the course we've been on, and I wouldn't advocate substantial additional tightening at this time. I would certainly build into what we are doing what is in effect discounted in the market. In other words, I would definitely support being in a position where our degree of reserve restraint, however defined, would result in a funds rate of somewhere around 8-1/2 to 8-5/8 percent at this time. And I wouldn't object to steps that might lead that modestly higher. But basically I've been satisfied with the degree of restraint and, I think Bob Heller said it right, our primary concern has to be inflation. So, I'm not reacting to what we might set off in this area or that area [of the economy] and we ought to worry about that and that should hold us back. What I really worry about is a very volatile path of policy that in effect makes our long-term job harder. We are coming off a very difficult period. I think every¬ body here appreciates that in the 1980s and maybe the experience in 1985 and 1986 was sort of the last chapter and that to the extent that we can stay on a relatively steady sustained growth of monetary stimulus, I think that would be most constructive. I'd hate to see actions that would disrupt that. So, implicitly I would not favor a discount rate increase at this time. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198812	424	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	425	PARRY	" Mr. Chairman, I think that an increase of $100 million in the borrowing is woefully inadequate. It seems to me that we've spent two days talking about projections for the economy that all come up to the same conclusion; that is, that actual inflation rates stand a good chance of rising next year; that underlying inflationary pressures are building; and that the economy, if anything, has been surprising us on the upside. I think a move of about 1/8 percent in the federal funds rate is just nothing at all. It seems to me that a bare minimum would be alternative ""C"". And I would think as well that the best way to implement that would be something that would be more public in nature and would catch the  attention of those in the financial markets. With regard to the point that was made several times before about risks to the financial sector, I think that history would suggest that the risks are quite different from what has been described. It seems to me that the greatest risk is for us to get behind the curve, and I think we are in great danger of getting behind that curve at this point because in that event what will happen is that interest rates are going to go to even higher levels at a later point; and the burden on the financial sector would be even greater than if we were to move in what I would consider to be a convincing way at this point. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	426	GREENSPAN	 The suggestion on the table is effectively that [result] by early January-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198812	433	PARRY	 What seems appropriate to me would be $300 million or $400 million and an increase in the discount rate. And I think that a bare minimum acceptable to me would be a $200 million increase today. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	434	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	435	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I think if we've learned anything this morning, it's that we don't live in a riskless society or riskless world. But I think the central question before us--and it's going to continue to confront us as these risks continue--is whether or not those risks should constrain or inhibit monetary policy. I come out feeling as Governor Heller expressed it earlier that we should not be so constrained in the absence of some emergency which we can deal with at the time. Like you, Mr. Chairman, I think the risks of recession are fairly slight. I think what we are faced with is a very strong economy, one that has not really moderated as much as we had hoped. The economy is growing at a rate above its potential, and I think the job before us is to contain the inflation and to slow this economy down. Now, I think that the danger is that we don't do enough at this time to send the signal to the market and confirm the credibility that we already have. In implementing that kind of strategy, my preference would be for a discount rate increase. But if that is not the action of the Board, then I certainly think we need to move now on open market operations. Moving $100 million now and $100 million in January would be acceptable to me because I don't feel that that time differential will be all that great. But I do think that we need to move in that direction. So, I would support your prescription. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198812	436	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	437	BOEHNE	 I think your prescription is right on target. I think it appropriately balances what we need to balance. I think that open market operations are much preferable over the discount rate; a discount rate hike would be too much at this point. So, I agree with you. I'd like to just comment on this business of the discount rate and the spread between it and the funds rate. That has been a classic reason given for adjusting the discount rate. But I think, given the technique that we use to operate open market operations with this borrowing, that we simply have to live with ever widening spreads unless we want to raise the discount rate at the same time we want to ease open market operations. I think that sends conflicting signals. To the extent that the widening spread does raise expectations of an increase in the discount rate, I think we ought to do away with that. And it might be well, Mr. Chairman, at an appropriate time either in a speech or at testimony simply to indicate that the spread no longer means what it once did in terms of considerations of whether we change the discount rate or not. In my point of view, the reason you change the discount rate in today's world is that you want an announcement effect either domestically or internationally. And whether the spread is 100 basis points or 500 basis points doesn't seem to me to be terribly relevant. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198812	438	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	439	ANGELL	 I won't use all my arguments about a discount rate increase now because I've already made them to the Board. And the Board members understand my view very well on that. I would comment, Ed, that it seems to me in the environment that we are in now that there is a substantial difference between a discount rate increase and an increase in the federal funds rate through open market operations. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	440	BOEHNE	 I agree with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198812	441	ANGELL	" And the difference is that you are indicating you want rates to be higher and one reason to have a higher discount rate is that you would encounter I think increasing difficulty of managing borrowing at the discount window at $600 million, given Don's surveys of where banks' reluctance to come to the window may be. I think that we have a somewhat more stable borrowing target at $300 million or $400 million than I think we would have at $600 million or $700 million. And I would want the discount rate to be high enough not to have to have what I would call a more unpredictable borrowing target. Now, my view is that whatever we do is going to have some announcement effect. We are not going to make a move after this meeting and have everyone say they didn't understand what the Federal Reserve did. By next Tuesday or Wednesday, no one will ask whether we have moved or haven't moved. In this scenario we are talking about, everyone is going to know that we moved. So, there is going to be an announcement effect. And the discount rate is not ringing the gong; the discount rate is a regular procedure that you use when you want to tighten policy, when you want higher interest rates. And those higher rates will be consistent with slower money growth. So, I'm clearly in camp ""C"". Now, I'm in camp ""C"" because I believe very strongly that the chances of our getting into recession are much less by taking the action that needs to be taken to give us some chance to have some scarcity of money which will show up in some commodity prices and in exchange rates and show up to give some expectations. The thrift  industry is going to be much [unintelligible] for us to deal with this as the Board dealt with it in 1984, and it's more difficult to deal with it now than in 1984 because the economy is further along. But if we wait until the end of 1989 or the middle of 1989 to get into this and if Jerry's staff is right in their inflation forecast and if inflation gets away from us, that's the recession scenario, that's how you're going to buy the recession. I'm convinced that there's no immediate danger to the real economy at this stage. And I think it's a little more above board and will be clear in everyone's mind as to where we are if we do it in a very solid manner. So, I favor ""C"" and I, of course, would prefer to do it with a discount rate increase rather than doing it with a $600 million borrowing target. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	442	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	443	LAWARE	" I like the scenario that you have outlined. I guess the only part of it that concerns me a little is allowing an historically broader range between the discount rate and the funds rate. It would not bother me to see the funds rate go to 9 percent. So that's 250 basis points. By doing that are we muting the announce¬ ment potential of future discount rate changes? In other words, are we heralding our ""gong,"" are we wrapping it in swaddling clothes or something like that? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198812	444	GREENSPAN	 Make sure that is recorded for the record! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	445	LAWARE	" Not to be too precious about it, let me just suggest that instead of ringing the gong, that in connection with this move we might just ""jingle"" the bell--that's a seasonal pun!- - and perhaps not move the discount rate a full half point but rather move it a quarter point, which says something to the marketplace. It says that we are still using the discount rate with some announcement value, but it doesn't ring the gong quite as loudly as a full half point might. But I like the gradual approach to the borrowing target. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198812	446	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	447	STERN	" I agree with those who think that we need some further tightening and that we need it right away. I came in here favoring something between ""B"" and ""C,"" which I interpret to be pretty close to what you've proposed, Mr. Chairman. One way we might approach that--a little elaboration on that-- something we used to do would be to just put a range on borrowings, $500 to $600 million. Not only does that have the value of getting us in the direction we want to go, but given the uncertainty between interest rates and borrowings these days, it gives us a little more explicit flexibility it seems to me in terms of how policy is implemented. The only thing I would add to all of that, this is certainly for more serious consideration in February rather than immediately, is that I do think we should keep an eye on the long-term situation. I would admit that I take some comfort in the modest growth we've had in M2 over the last year or two, though I wouldn't bet the farm on it. But in light of that modest growth, I wonder if a 7 percent upper limit on the M2 range in 1989 is really appropriate. And it strikes me to be on the high side given M2's performance in the last year or two.  "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198812	448	GREENSPAN	 I think we will revisit that at the next meeting. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	449	STERN	 Right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198812	450	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	451	CORRIGAN	" In terms of the Bluebook alternatives I would favor alternative ""C,"" but I certainly would not wildly object to the approach you suggested, Mr. Chairman, which essentially involves sneaking up a little bit on alternative ""C"". There is an interesting question that I think we can now call the ""gong show,"" a variety of both strategic and tactical questions here that arise in the context of a discount rate change. Indeed, I guess if I step back from everything, which one never has the liberty of doing, and I said to myself that I thought it was unlikely that there would be an increase in interest rates in Europe and I made a variety of other assumptions, I could easily talk myself into the view that the absolutely ideal policy would be the combination of a discount rate increase and, say, $500 million in borrowings. That probably would mean that federal funds rates would end up somewhere on the north side of 9 percent rather than the south side of 9 percent. Then, I'd bring myself back a little bit from the ideal and start to superimpose on the way things are in terms of the gong show. And I guess where I would come out is to do alternative ""C,"" but--and this may surprise some people--! probably would leave the discount rate on the bench for at least a moment or two. I worry as does Governor Johnson about the symbolism of getting caught up in what appears to be a worldwide ratcheting up of interest rates especially if there is the appearance that we are in effect getting forced into that posture to stay in lock step with the Germans. What I'm not sure about as a practical matter is whether there is a way to avoid that at this point, since the expectation is widespread in the marketplace that they are going to raise their rates in the very near term anyway. I don't like that at all. And that does influence my thinking in terms of the tactics of the situation. The other thing that keeps rolling around in my mind is the question that Bob Parry raised rather directly and I guess I flirted with in my earlier comments. Suppose that despite the varying degrees of comfort that we draw from long- term interest rates that we are wrong or the markets are wrong or both? What is the kind of thing that will most graphically signal that to us in the near term? And I think there are two [unintelligible] the inflation statistics themselves start to show through. And the second is that, for example, we could get another huge increase in employment in December. Now, Gary was talking before about a 200,000 increase; that sounds high to me. If anything, I think that employment increases may have to be smaller than that. But suppose we get another 350,000 or 400,000 increase in employment right now, which I don't rule out as a possibility. That kind of contingency is another reason why I have a slight preference to keep the discount rate in abeyance at this moment. But I certainly think that at the very least we should get to something as described in the Bluebook as alternative ""C"" and I think as you've described it as quickly as possible. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198812	452	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	453	HOSKINS	" Well, as Governor Kelley indicated earlier I have been an advocate of alternative ""D"" on various occasions. We now have alternative ""gong"" which I interpret to be a discount rate move as opposed to ""C"". Not wanting to be the Paul Erdman of this Committee, I do have concerns along the lines Tom Melzer indicated. But I think that Governor Angell's summation on the discount rate is the appropriate one. So, my preference would be to do a discount rate move and adjust the borrowing targets to ensure that rates are where I think the market expects them which is someplace around 9 percent. Your proposal, Mr. Chairman, if I read it correctly if we do $100 million now and are sure of doing $100 million later I think is livable. I have a comment on the riskless society. Bob Forrestal indicated the fact that there are risks every place out there. There's one exception, however, and that's deposit insurance. I had to get that clear. And, secondly, with respect to the point that Bob Parry made, I think that's an accurate observation. I would suggest that if this Committee had acted differently in the late 1970s, we might not have avoided an LDC debt crisis but the magnitudes would have been a lot lower in terms of the outstanding debt, the problem that we are facing right now. I would link that to the current context of the LBOs, that we may be building the same kinds of things right now with respect to LBOs. And I think a signal by this Committee that rates are moving upward and we are concerned would be the appropriate signal to give. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198812	454	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	455	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, while the risks clearly are on the side of inflation as we've said, not economic growth, it does seem to me as we've gone through the year and particularly starting in the late spring we've been responsive to that concern. And I just don't have quite the feeling that others may have that we've fallen behind the curve on this one. Certainly, at this time I think further tightening is appropriate. And the scenario that you outlined is just right. I would not raise the discount rate now. I would simply raise the borrowing level and initially the fed funds rate to 8-3/4 percent and maybe moving up to 9 percent as we get into the new year would be appropriate. But I'd hold the discount rate for something a little bit more overt than we see now to make that move more appropriate from the point of view of the market. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198812	456	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	457	SEGER	 I'm on the side of the gentleman from St. Louis, President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198812	458	MELZER	 There's no gentleman here! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198812	459	SEGER	 The young boy from St. Louis! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198812	460	BLACK	 He just retracted his comment! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198812	461	SEGER	 I was trying to flatter him. It didn't work. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198812	462	BOEHNE	 Stand up, Tommy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198812	463	SEGER	" Anyway, I would be opposed to a discount rate hike now. I would remind you of what the announcement effect did in  the summer, or actually September, of 1987 when the discount rate was hiked and the idea was that long-rates would decline as a result and short rates would rise. Instead, all rates rose as I recall. And the only thing that didn't rise was Wall Street in October when we had a slight problem with the stock market. Again, their ""gong"" was done in order to sweep up the heavy pile of paper, and the blood on the floor. But anyway I think it would be bad now in that sense. Also, we are right in the middle of the Christmas selling season. And again if you want the announcement effect, I can't think of a worse time unless you really want to cause retail sales to go into a tailspin at a time when for many merchants, a third, 40 percent of their annual sales take place around the Christmas holidays. And, frankly, I just don't think it's needed. The monetary aggregate growth has I think looked pretty good, pretty responsible. Si Keehn said we've had a number of tightening moves since last spring. And I'm not convinced that we've seen all of those impact the economy yet. So, as I said, I'm on Tom Melzer's side. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198812	464	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	465	ANGELL	" That's ""B"" without any change in borrowing? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	466	SEGER	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198812	467	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I would favor ""C"". I have never differed with you since you've been here, and I do so with great trepidation today because I have such respect for your judgment. But I think the market has expected a discount rate increase, and I think if we don't get one it might be interpreted as some lessening of our resolve to deal with this problem we see developing. And I think there's also a lot of substance to the point that Governor Angell made that if we are concerned about the lack of a firm relationship between the level of borrowed reserves and the federal funds rate, I think that would be exacerbated by letting that [rate spread widen] still further. But at the same time I want to be reasonable on this, and I can see the merits to what you've said. I can certainly see the merits to what Tom Melzer has said because the aggregates do concern me a great deal. I would not be willing to go this far if I didn't see a sign that they were beginning to move. I would like to bargain with you a little bit on that $100 million and make it a little higher than that. But I don't think it's an important enough difference that I'd want to go to the mat on it or anything of that sort. I'd really like the discount rate to be a part of it. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198812	468	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	469	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, I fully support your suggestion. I would only add that as I have listened to the comments around the table about the gong-ringing possibility, it has been expressed as merely a matter of timing. We may very well indeed need to ring the gong. I don't think we need to do so now, because I think that there is at least some possibility that we may not need to ring it at all. So, I just would like to have that possibility on the table. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198812	470	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	471	BOYKIN	" Mr. Chairman, my position would be to move on the discount rate. I think that would be the much preferable way to  go. If the Board doesn't see it that way, then certainly alternative ""C"". And I'd move pretty fast on the borrowing. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198812	472	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	473	GUFFEY	" Mr. Chairman, when I came to the meeting I preferred ""B-C"", someplace in between those two. But I have no problem with the proposal that you've laid on the table with the exception of the potential need for the second $100 million sometime early in January. If it becomes evident that that's an appropriate move, then I think the Board should again look at the use of the discount rate at that time rather than today. I'd hold it in abeyance. You may find it helpful in supporting the dollar after the turn of the year. I would not want to do it now because as has already been mentioned at least it's my impression that other rates around the world probably are going to increase, and I wouldn't want us to be a leader in that parade. So, I would hope that we could accept the proposal that you have laid on the table, $100 million now, and a very careful look whether to do the second $100 million or .whether to do a discount rate increase sometime in January. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198812	474	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, could I ask for some clarification? The $100 million, would you anticipate this would move the federal funds rate to 8-7/8 initially from 8-5/8 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198812	475	GREENSPAN	 The first $100 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	476	BLACK	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198812	477	GREENSPAN	 I think it's 8-5/8 to 8-3/4 percent; the second $100 million is 8-7/8 to 9 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	478	PARRY	" The Bluebook alternatives are posed in terms of 8-3/8 percent as being alternative ""B,"" is that correct? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	479	KOHN	 8-3/8 to 8-1/2 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	480	PARRY	 Okay, so you're adding an 1/8 to that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	481	KOHN	 Well, adding a 1/4 to that for $100 million and then 1/2 for $200 million. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	482	PARRY	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	483	STERNLIGHT	 But be aware too that we are coming into the year-end period and seasonal factors could add on something to that first 1/4. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	484	HOSKINS	 Well, one more clarification. Your proposal is to.do $100 million now and then take a look at whether we need to do another $100 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198812	485	GREENSPAN	 Let me clarify later. I think we should get around to everybody who wants to talk. Bob Eisenmenger, I don't think you have indicated your preference, if you want to give one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	486	EISENMENGER	 Well, I think I would prefer to move a little faster than you have proposed, but it's a mild preference. As  far as the discount rate is concerned, that is a determination for the Board anyway. They might wish to do it, but not do it immediately--do it toward the end of the year. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	487	GREENSPAN	 I think Roger Guffey has captured as best it can be done the [consensus] as it has been stipulated by the various members of the Committee. I would propose that we go immediately with $100 million and asymmetric language, with the understanding that unless something significant that is not now perceived occurs that we go the second $200 million in January. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	488	KOHN	 Second $100 million. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198812	489	GREENSPAN	 I beg your pardon; I meant to say a second $100 million in January. But should the Board of Governors at any time between now and then decide to move the discount rate, we would then have a telephone conference call to readjust the borrowing requirements to calibrate them in the context of either fully offsetting the $100 million, or the $200 million, or perhaps only one of the [$100 million steps]. This means in effect that it is possible, depending on the telephone conference should it appear that way, that we could go to shy of 9 percent or north of 9 percent on the federal funds rate, as Jerry Corrigan says. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	490	PARRY	 I don't want to nitpick, but would you envision yourself visiting that issue two weeks from now or six weeks from now? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	491	GREENSPAN	 I would say three weeks. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	492	ANGELL	 It would seem to me the Chairman said either then or before then as I heard it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	493	GREENSPAN	 Yes, the discount rate is reviewed once a week. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	494	ANGELL	 The Board meets regularly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	495	PARRY	 No, I meant this second $100 million; I'm sorry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	496	ANGELL	 Oh, okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	497	GREENSPAN	 Well, basically it really is the second maintenance period. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	498	PARRY	 Two weeks from today? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	499	JOHNSON	 The third or fourth week. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198812	500	PARRY	 Two weeks from today? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198812	501	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	502	BOEHNE	 Well, you can't be that precise. You've got all that year-end churning, and if the year-end churning takes you up to a high level, you might not want to jerk the rate back down. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198812	503	JOHNSON	 That's a good point because that might be the time.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198812	504	BOEHNE	 Right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198812	505	GREENSPAN	 The point being, if you were asking me if was I contemplating or talking about the end of the intermeeting period, the answer is that I was not. This is an issue which, as I originally stipulated and I think is right, is to be considered sometime early in January. That to me is three weeks from now. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	506	HOSKINS	 And that means that unless something of major significance happens in the economy or financial markets that we will do roughly 50 basis points either through a combination of discount rate or-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198812	507	GREENSPAN	 Let me be very specific. If nothing material happens, then I think the Desk will automatically add $100 million to the borrowing requirement. If, however, in the period prior to then, or subsequent to then, the Board decides to move the discount rate, we'll have a telephone conference to adjust the borrowing requirement in line with the instructions of the Committee. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	508	ANGELL	 I think that's a satisfactory solution. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198812	509	GREENSPAN	 The official directive under that would be to go $100 million with asymmetric language. I'm not certain that any further language is required in the directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198812	510	BERNARD	" [The operational paragraph would read as follows:] ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about 3 and 6-1/2 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.""
