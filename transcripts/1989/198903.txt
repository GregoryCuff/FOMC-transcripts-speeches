198903	19	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. I don't like the way this is going! 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	20	SPEAKER	 It sounds all right! 	3	3	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	21	GREENSPAN	 Our Managers for Domestic Open Market Operations and for Foreign Operations are at the moment, as you know, Peter Sternlight and Sam Cross. Would somebody like to move their reappointments? 	3	3	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	22	JOHNSON	 So move. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	23	KELLEY	 Second. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	48.0
198903	24	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. We have the review of--and I assume that they have been mailed out to all of you--the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. Would somebody like to move them individually? Let's do them one at a time. Are there any objections to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations? If not, let us assume that it's so ordered. Sam, would you like to discuss the second issue? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	25	CROSS	 Yes, Mr. Chairman, I would. I would like to raise one point with respect to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations. We are currently authorized to maintain [foreign currency] balances up to a total of $12 billion equivalent. Our present holdings, at about $9.4 billion, are well within that limit. But in addition to this formal authorization there are three informal limits which are not contained either in the Authorization, the Directive, or the Procedural Instructions. These [informal understandings] call for us to limit our holdings of German marks to $8 billion equivalent, Japanese yen to $3 billion equivalent, and other currencies as a group to $1 billion equivalent. All of our intervention in recent months has been in marks and we are now about $150 million or a little more above that informal limit for marks. We notified the Committee of that situation by a telex that was sent out on March 15th. But, Mr. Chairman, I would like to propose that the Committee consider eliminating these informal sublimits for the particular currencies so that the $12 billion authorization for foreign currency balances could be used more flexibly. I question whether the informal sublimits currently are a very useful management tool. The particular currencies that we operate in are determined, of course, by market conditions and other factors. And in any event, we  would continue to be under a number of limitations--qualitative as well as quantitative limitations --both with the [Foreign Currency] Subcommittee and the Committee. These limits relate to the changes in each currency for a single day and for the intermeeting period as well as changes in the overall balances for a single day in the intermeeting period and so forth. I believe these various limits provide for adequate monitoring and control by the Committee and the Subcommittee without the informal sublimits. Accordingly, I would recommend that the Committee consider eliminating the three informal sublimits. If the Committee did wish to retain those sublimits I would need to request a change in the overall Authorization in order to provide more headroom in the event we need to acquire more marks and yen. So, I recommend the elimination of the three informal sublimits. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	26	GREENSPAN	 Would somebody like to move that? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	27	CORRIGAN	 I think I would move it. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	28	GREENSPAN	 Is there a second? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	29	JOHNSON	 Second. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	30	GREENSPAN	 I've just been informed that we don't want a formal vote on this. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	31	BERNARD	 On the informal limits. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	32	GREENSPAN	 On the informal limits. Let me put it this way: Are there any questions on this issue for Mr. Cross? If not, we'll assume [agreement]. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	33	ANGELL	 Would there be some notion as to where we might be going in regard to any one currency? That is, would there be any restraint or any notion that there might be some point at which we would acquire more of a particular currency than might be the most advantageous position for our asset holdings? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	43.0
198903	34	CROSS	 Obviously, we will want over time to acquire various amounts in particular currencies. But I don't think that this particular arrangement is the way in which we are best able to do that. For example, our holdings of yen have been low and we've been undertaking such measures as we could to raise those holdings both for the System and the Treasury. Indeed, we did acquire some yen during this recent period by buying them from a customer. But I don't think that the informal sublimit is a very useful mechanism for doing this. We have to make decisions and acquire those currencies more or less as conditions permit and as our policies aim us to do. I don't think these limits help very much operationally. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	35	ANGELL	 So from time to time you would expect to report to the Committee on [individual] currency holdings as compared to what you might think of as some optimum range? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	43.0
198903	36	CROSS	 Well, if I went too far in saying what was the optimum that might raise a lot of questions. But we certainly report regularly on the amounts of the individual currencies.  	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	37	ANGELL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	43.0
198903	38	LAWARE	 I have a question. Sam, is the $12 billion a big enough kitty for you or do you--? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	50.0
198903	39	CROSS	 Well, at the present time we have $9.4 billion and the limit is $12 billion. Looking ahead, say, for the next year it's certainly conceivable that we would need to go above that. I would assume that the Committee would not find it difficult to change the limit at the time, if the conditions arose. Or, it could be changed right now when we are reviewing this at our annual review. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	40	CORRIGAN	 But to change the $12 billion would take specific action of the Committee? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	41	CROSS	 [Yes.] That is a formal authorization and that is public. The present authorization is for $12 billion and has been at that level for a couple of years, I guess. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	42	LAWARE	 You don't see any immediate circumstances that would likely put you in a position where you'd have to ask for a special meeting in order to enlarge that limit? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	50.0
198903	43	CROSS	 Well, we have a $2-1/2 billion [leeway]. And, of course, when we intervene we have typically done half of it and the Treasury has done half. So that means a potential [increase in U. S. holdings] of $5 billion worth before we run into a problem. I would assume that if conditions were such that we needed a change in the Authorization, it would not be difficult to propose that and to change it at the time. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	44	LAWARE	 Okay. I wasn't trying to sell you anything. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	50.0
198903	45	CROSS	 No. I'd be happy to have any further headroom the Committee wishes to offer. But I can't really make a strong case that it's likely to happen and would require a meeting. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	46	LAWARE	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	50.0
198903	47	GUFFEY	 Sam, can you remind us: what is the intermeeting limit? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	20.0
198903	48	CROSS	 Above $600 million requires the Subcommittee's approval and above $1-1/2 billion requires the Committee's approval. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	49	GUFFEY	 In all currencies? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	20.0
198903	50	CROSS	 That's in all currencies. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	51	GREENSPAN	 Any further discussion on this subject? I will assume a general consensus in favor of Sam's recommendation. However, we do need a vote on the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. I'll entertain a motion. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	52	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	53	SEGER	 Second.  	41	41	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	54	GREENSPAN	 Do all three? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	55	BERNARD	 Yes. 	41	41	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	56	GREENSPAN	 Let's combine all three: the Foreign Currency Authorization and the Foreign Currency Directive as well as the Procedural Instructions. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	57	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	58	KELLEY	 Second. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	48.0
198903	59	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Next we have to approve the minutes of the Committee meeting of February 7th and 8th. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	60	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	61	KELLEY	 Second. 	41	41	0.0	1.0	48.0
198903	62	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Mr. Cross, would you now report on foreign currency operations for us? 	41	41	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	63	CROSS	 The dollar moved lower against the major foreign currencies  from the time of your last meeting through late February, then  recovered in March and is now trading at levels a bit above those  prevailing at the time of that last meeting. Upward pressure on the  dollar intensified at times in March, and the United States monetary  authorities intervened, selling a total of $750 million against marks.  About the time of your last meeting, dollar exchange rates  started to trade with a softer tone. The loss of the dollar's upward  momentum at that time seemed attributable in part to coordinated  intervention that had occurred through the first week of February.  The dollar then moved downward after President Bush's Congressional  budget address on February 9 failed to provide new initiatives and  left market participants with the view that decisive action to reduce  the fiscal deficit was not likely to occur anytime soon. As optimism  surrounding the new Administration began to fade, market attention  turned to a more realistic assessment of economic fundamentals.  In the meantime, newly-reported data pointed to an  acceleration of price increases in several major industrial countries,  leading to growing concerns about inflation worldwide. Against a  background of rising oil prices and some labor and capacity  constraints, the attractiveness of individual currencies tended to be  influenced by market assessments of the willingness of monetary  authorities in particular countries to act vigorously to stem  inflationary pressures in their domestic economies.  In these circumstances, the questions of inflation and  monetary policy moved to center stage. When, in the United States, we  saw a sharp rise in producer prices for January, followed by a  merchandise trade report for December indicating strong domestic  demand, some market participants began to question whether what was  seen as a gradualist policy approach of the Federal Reserve would be  adequate to dampen inflationary pressures. Reports of continued high  inflation in the United Kingdom only seemed to underscore the view  that policy makers may have underestimated the risks of inflation.  At the same time, analysts appeared to be certain that signs  of robust growth and accelerating inflation in Germany would lead to a  quick tightening of the Bundesbank's policy stance. This market view  showed through in a significant increase in German money market  interest rates. By mid-February, German banks were bidding  aggressively for funds, convinced that their massive borrowing at the  Lombard rate would be raised and that German money market rates would  move even higher in the near future. While actual changes in interest  differentials were relatively modest during mid-February, the prospect  of a narrowing of favorable differentials led to further downward  movements in dollar exchange rates. By February 23, the dollar had  eased down to trade around its period low of DM 1.81 against the mark  and Y 126 against the yen.  But, within the next few days, sentiment towards the dollar  improved dramatically after the Federal Reserve moved to tighten its  policy stance, first by Desk action then followed by a discount rate  increase, while the Bundesbank provided clear signals that rates in  Germany were not likely to be raised in the near future. That the  Bundesbank was satisfied with existing rate levels came as a big  surprise to the market. Soon thereafter central bank officials from  several other countries expressed similar opinions. As market  participants reassessed the outlook for interest rates abroad, money  market rates in Germany moved down from their previous highs. At the  same time, dollar interest rates were firming so that interest  differentials widened in favor of the dollar and the dollar's rise  gained momentum. Economic statistics released through mid-March  appeared to support the view that the Federal Reserve policy stance  would remain restrictive, relative to the stance of the European  central banks. There has been much conjecture about the reasons  behind the Bundesbank's apparent reluctance to raise rates, and market  analysts point to the constraints imposed by the present situation in  the European Monetary System (EMS). The exchange rate mechanism there  is stretched to the limit and there is concern that a rise in German  interest rates might put undue pressure on other EMS monetary  authorities. In addition, Bundesbank officials have indicated that  much of the sharp increase in German prices for January was due to a  tax increase and not an increase in the underlying inflation which  they feel remains in the 2 to 2-1/2 percent range. To tighten policy  would simply dramatize these price increases and have a negative  effect on inflationary expectations.  At the close of the period, the dollar remained firm. Some  of its downward momentum appeared to dissipate on news that the rise  in the CPI figures for February was more moderate than feared and on  bits of evidence suggesting that the pace of economic growth may be  slowing. However, political uncertainties in Germany and Japan have  underpinned the dollar. In recent days, in particular, the market has  grown more nervous about the unfolding Recruit scandal in Japan.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to request your approval of the  Desk's operations during the time since your last meeting. The  System's share of intervention sales of dollars, undertaken from March  8 through March 27, was $375 million dollars against marks, with an  equal amount financed by the United States Treasury. The System also purchased  $99.1 million equivalent of yen from a customer to augment Federal  Reserve balances, while the United States Treasury also built up its yen  balances through non-market purchases of $44.1 million equivalent of  yen.  In other operations, on March 15, the Central Bank of  Venezuela drew the full amount of a $450 million short-term financing  facility provided by the United States Treasury through the Exchange  Stabilization Fund. This followed the introduction by Venezuela's new  government of a comprehensive adjustment program which included, among  other things, the decontrol of exchange rates, interest rates, and  most private sector prices. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	64	GREENSPAN	 Are there questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	65	HOSKINS	 Sam, I'm just curious as to why we don't buy yen in the open market. I notice a couple of other central banks have done so. Do we have an agreement with them or--? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198903	66	CROSS	 Well, the Ministry of Finance in Japan thus far often has intervened itself to resist the decline in the yen. And the United States Treasury has not been prepared up to this point to [intervene unless] we have the agreement of the Japanese before anything is done. And the Japanese have not felt that this situation yet warranted intervention. Now, in the past day or two the pressures on the yen have become more substantial. The Finance Minister did make a statement last night--at which point the yen had weakened to above the 133 level--saying something to the effect that they were watching [developments] very carefully at the 133 level, which was taken by the market as a signal that that might be a key point. The rate then moved down a bit below 133 and that's where it is now. I imagine there will be discussions of this--certainly this weekend when the G-7 gets together. But up to this point the Minister of Finance has not wanted to see intervention or to be involved in intervention to resist the decline. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	67	FORRESTAL	 On the general subject of intervention, Sam, do you detect any change in philosophy of the present Administration with respect to intervention? Or are they continuing pretty much in the same vein as the previous Administration? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
198903	68	CROSS	 I don't think there has been any very notable change. The G-7, of course, met in February and they are going to meet again. The general premises within which these activities have been taking place remain more or less the same. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	69	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Cross?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	70	SEGER	 I just want to make sure I understood your comment about intervening and the Ministry of Finance. Do we have a deal with the Japanese that we will not intervene unless they [agree]? What if we reached the point that it was in our interest to do so and the Ministry of Finance was still balking? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	71	CROSS	 Well, I would hope that it wouldn't come to a point where we were operating at cross purposes with the Japanese. It would be very difficult if we reached the stage where it was as overt as that. These intervention operations obviously work much, much better if all parties are marching together. We have seen many times, both with the Germans and the Japanese, that the market pays a lot more attention when they see that we are uniformly aiming in a certain direction, trying to bring about a certain purpose. It's difficult to be operating in one direction if the central bank or the government on the other side doesn't agree or indeed is opposed to it. So, it's much better to work it out. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	72	TRUMAN	 Governor Seger, this is one of the [unintelligible] to President Hoskin's comment. This is one of the asymmetries in the international financial system today. Other countries-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	73	SEGER	 It was too subtle for me. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	74	TRUMAN	 Small countries can buy yen or sell yen. But for big countries like the United States and Germany and Japan their actions in this area are guided by different understandings, if you want to put it that way, about when one does it for the reasons that Sam mentioned. If Canada buys yen, or even if the UK buys yen, that's not the same thing as our buying yen or the Bank of Japan buying yen. Now, the other point-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	75	CROSS	 But even those [transactions] have not been easily arranged. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	76	TRUMAN	 That's right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	77	CROSS	 With the Canadians or the others it required working it out with the Japanese. But they are a little more amenable to that than if it's going to impact directly on their exchange rate. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	78	TRUMAN	 The other point is that there are certain understandings about the point at which intervention becomes more favorably regarded. But as far as the yen is concerned we're far away from that point. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	79	SEGER	 Just looking at their gigantic trade surplus vis¬ a-vis our own situation, it seems that at some point we'd have to ask ourselves what is in our interest rather than having the Ministry of Finance decide. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	80	CROSS	 That's becoming increasingly apparent. It is true that up until recently most of the pressures were not in the yen but were in the European currencies. But it is moving more and more in that direction and it is becoming clear that we are getting to the point where there is a need to do something about the movement in the yen as well. That is part of my own concern. And as I say, the  pressures of the past few days have been led by the movements of the yen. That's the first time during this recent period of activity where that has been the case; but it is now the case. On the other hand, if you look back to the low points --which were at the beginning of last year--the 1988 low point for the mark was 1.56 and we're now at 1.88 and the low point for the yen was just over 120. So, it's getting closer but not quite as much. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	81	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	82	JOHNSON	 I heard what you said, Sam, about Germany but that explanation still doesn't strike me as justifying completely why they have been so reluctant to move. A lot of people seem to be scratching their heads about Germany's behavior relative to inflationary pressures and the fact that they have been sitting back and letting the mark depreciate. I know it has been pretty stable over the intermeeting period in general. But I think the feeling has been: What's going on in Germany compared to their previous behavior? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	83	CROSS	 Well, I think there are various factors. They are divided. There are some in Germany who will say that they could be tightening domestically and not necessarily going through the exchange rate. They are divided. The mark has moved up against some currencies as well as having softened against the dollar. If you look at the mark on a trade-weighted basis you don't get the same picture that you do if you look just at the dollar-mark relationship. The Germans, I think, have a genuine problem with respect to the EMS. Their concern at the moment is that the EMS is fully stretched--in other words, they are at the top of the band and, as it turns out, Denmark is now at the bottom of the band. At those levels they have to intervene fully in order to keep the rates from moving beyond that. There were very, very large amounts of intervention in the Danish currency last week, in fact. They did on one day, which is a lot for a small country. And they did almost the next day. The Germans are concerned that--the mark being weak against the dollar and strong against the EMS--if they intervene on the dollar side it's just going to cause a lot more trouble and lead to serious pressures in flows and political problems and all the rest with the EMS. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	84	JOHNSON	 But isn't it, though, just the Danish that are down there? The lira-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	85	CROSS	 The Danish are down there but the pressures could move to the others, particularly if the question of whether to reform the EMS currency alignments and so forth arose. It could lead to pressures. The French not too long ago had been under some pressure; they are not at the moment. But-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	86	JOHNSON	 It just still seems strange, given that nobody paid too much attention when the Italians were way below the band and just hovered there for heaven knows [how long]. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	87	TRUMAN	 Well, but they weren't down at the 6 percent level. They have a wider band. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	88	JOHNSON	 Well, it was a special arrangement.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	89	CROSS	 Since Italy is not really in the arrangement, they don't have the same obligation to intervene. So they don't have the same problem on the intervention side. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	90	TRUMAN	 Italy has a much broader band. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	91	CROSS	 We talk to the Germans and we make these points, too. But I think you do have to recognize that there are pressures from the EMS angle of it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	92	TRUMAN	 One of the problems is that even if they want to move the D-mark [vis-a-vis] the Danish kroner that would raise questions about what else they would do within the EMS. It seems hard to do since there is this strong desire, especially between the Germans and the French, not to do anything for who knows how long. By [their suppressing] all this, it may be like the United States attitude toward sterling in the late 1960s. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	93	JOHNSON	 Not to prolong this, but what's rotten in Denmark? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	94	CROSS	 Well, they have a stagnant economy and they don't want to raise their interest rates. So they are having a lot of capital outflows. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	95	HOSKINS	 I'd like just one follow-up. I raised the issue about the Japanese but I haven't heard what their argument is. What did they tell us? Why don't they want us in? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198903	96	CROSS	 They are still concerned or have a fear that the dollar-yen relationship is going to move back in the other direction and that it's going to cause problems there. At least that's what they say. Now, I assume that there is an interest from the point of view of their whole economy and their exports and so forth for them to try not to get back into intervention if they can avoid it. But it gets harder and harder to make that case as the rates move. We are still at 133. And the last time we were intervening I think it was close to 137. So the yen is not within any new ranges in that sense. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	97	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	98	KEEHN	 Sam, separate and apart from the central bank attitudes, what's the attitude of the participants in the markets? [Do they see] long-term trends there or is everybody kind of moving day-by-day? What are the basic attitudes? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
198903	99	CROSS	 In terms of the dollar outlook? I think they are waiting and I think they are moving-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	100	KEEHN	 Day-by-day? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
198903	101	CROSS	 --with a short-term focus to see what's going to happen on this. As I said, at the present time these markets are very fickle. They watch one thing for a while and then they watch something else. But right now they are watching very closely the inflation and monetary policy actions in all these countries because there has been so much attention on and concern about whether inflation is growing worldwide. So, that's the main focus of  attention right now: what's going to be done about it and what the various players are going to do. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

198903	106	STERNLIGHT	" Domestic Desk operations implemented a two-step firming  of the System's policy stance during the past intermeeting  period. The first step was undertaken about a week after the  February meeting in reaction to increasing concerns about  inflationary pressures and market skepticism about the adequacy of  System responses. It saw Federal funds move up to about 9 1/4 -  3/8 percent from the 9 to 9 1/8 range prevailing around the time  of the meeting. In terms of reserve path construction, the move  was indexed by a $100 million increase in the borrowing allowance  to $700 million although both before and after the move we were  regarding path borrowing levels with considerable flexibility in  view of the persisting tendency for banks to use the window less,  at given rate spreads, than past relationships would have suggested.  By late February, the accumulating evidence of continuing  strength in the economy and further signs of increased price  pressure called for additional firming action under the  Committee's asymmetric directive. Initially, it was contemplated  that this would be achieved through a further $100 million rise in  the indexed level of borrowing and an accompanying 1/4 percent  increase in expected funds rates. These decisions, however, were  swiftly overtaken by the Board of Governors' action on February 24,  approving a 1/2 percent increase in Reserve Bank discount rates to  7 percent. In light of that decision, the path level of borrowing  was retained at $700 million, with the expectation that Federal  funds would trade roughly in the area of 9 3/4 percent.  While funds trading levels gravitated (or perhaps I  should say ""levitated"") quickly to about the expected range,  actual levels of borrowing continued to run well short of the path  allowance. As this discrepancy persisted, we found ourselves,  increasingly, making allowances for the lower level of borrowing  in the day-to-day planning and execution of Desk operations. In  order to come closer to reality in planning reserve operations, a  downward technical adjustment of $200 million in the borrowing  allowance--to a level of $500 million was undertaken following  the March 8 reserve period, with the expectation that funds would  remain in the neighborhood of 9 3/4 percent. Even following this  adjustment we have continued to regard the borrowing level with  some uncertainty and flexibility but the range of discrepancy has  narrowed appreciably. Indeed, for the three full reserve periods  since the February meeting, seasonal and adjustment borrowing has  averaged about $450 million. Incidentally, that included some  rise in seasonal borrowing over the period, to recent levels  around $150 million. Federal funds averaged 9.33 percent in the  first maintenance period and then 9.81 and 9.85 percent in the  next two periods that essentially followed the discount rate  change. These levels compare with a 9.06 percent average in the  previous intermeeting interval. For the first few days of the  current reserve period, borrowings averaged about $600 million and  funds around 9.9 percent.  The broad monetary aggregates turned in a subdued growth  performance in February and March, broadly in line with expectations voiced at the last meeting. Folding in the small decline in  January, growth in M2 from December to March was at an annual rate  of only about 1 1/2 percent, while M3 grew at an estimated 3 1/2-  3 3/4 percent rate over this period. The March levels are  estimated to be a little below or a little above the lower bounds  of their annual growth cones. With its steep decline in January  and fairly flat performance in February and March, Ml declined at  an estimated 1 1/2 percent rate over the quarter.  Early in the period, the Desk was still engaged in its  typical seasonal reserve-draining operations, offsetting the  release of reserves from various market factors. Over about the  first third of the period, outright holdings of Treasury issues  were reduced by nearly $ 1 billion through a combination of bill  redemptions and sales of bills and notes to foreign accounts. At  the same time, there were substantial temporary reserve draining  operations through matched sale-purchase transactions in the  market. For the balance of the period, the Desk made modest  reserve adjustments, mostly in the form of temporary injections  through customer repurchase agreements, although one small  additional matched-sale operation was undertaken in the market on  March 8. On a number of days, it was possible to refrain from any  market action.  Interest rates climbed across a broad front during the  period, reflecting a combination of concerns about rising  inflation and actual and anticipated policy firming, paradoxically  intermixed at times with worries that policy was not responding  with sufficient vigor to the inflation threat. The economy was  seen as having entered 1989 with a good head of steam, though some  of the data becoming available during the period suggested the  possibility of some slackening in momentum. Market participants  were particularly upset by the strong reported increases in  producer prices for January and February, and consumer prices for  January. February's CPI was not as bad as had been feared,  although commentators were quick to point out that oil price  increases in March were likely to exert upward pressure on indexes  yet to be reported. While the February employment report remained  quite strong, some other broad measures of activity such as retail  sales, housing starts and new orders for durables hinted at  abatement.  Just after the last meeting, when it appeared that there  was no immediate change in policy even though many observers felt  the underlying situation called for some firming, the dollar  weakened and bond prices also gave ground. On the other hand, the  subsequent policy firming moves brought no great rebound, in part  because some criticized the moves as ""too little too late."" Even  the discount rate rise inspired some to comment that the rise  should have been more though one would have been hard pressed to  find evidence beforehand of market anticipations of a larger  move. Meantime, the actual firming moves exerted an upward  influence on funds and other short-term rates. Late in the  interval, yields retreated a bit, chiefly on the more mixed  business indicators and on comments by officials noting that  recent price measures seemed to exaggerate the underlying  inflation rate and that there had been little time as yet for the  economy to react to firming moves already undertaken.  Among the largest net advances in rates were those in  private short-term instruments such as CDs and commercial paper,  which rose close to a full percentage point, or somewhat more than  the rise of about 3/4 percent for Federal funds. In addition to  the rise in overnight funds, it appeared that these money market  rates were partly driven by bank efforts to fund credit demands,  particularly for LBO financings. There were also reports of  active rate hedging strategies employing sales of Eurodollar  futures. Meantime, banks raised their prime rates a full  percentage point, in two steps.  Treasury bills rose a more moderate 50-55 basis points or  so. The Treasury raised no new money in bills, and supplies were  taken up by sustained heavy purchases by individuals, especially  through noncompetitive auction bids. In yesterday's sale, 3- and  6-month bills were auctioned at 9.10 and 9.12 percent respectively,  compared with 8.57 and 8.53 percent just before the last meeting.  (The coupon equivalent yields on the newly auctioned bills were  9.44 and 9.69 percent.)  In the Treasury coupon market, yields rose about 40 to  60 basis points, with the larger increases registered for shorter  maturities. Counting the quarterly refunding, for which auctions  were underway at the time of the last meeting, the Treasury raised  about $21 billion through coupon issues during the period. The  30-year bond sold in a lackluster auction the day after the last  meeting at an average yield of 8.91 percent, and reached a yield  as high as 9.34 percent during the period before closing at 9.22  yesterday. A new 2-year note will be sold today, with auction  talk around 9.85 percent. This compares with yields of  9.49 percent for this maturity a month ago and 9.08 percent a  month before that.  Rates on some Federally sponsored agency issues backed up  more than those on Treasury issues, particularly reflecting the  wider spreads needed to place recent large issues of Federal Home  Loan Bank securities. The FHLB's have had to make record size  trips to the market in recent months to fund the advances to  thrifts faced with large deposit outflows. The last FHLB offering  needed spreads about 20 to 50 basis points wider than a month  earlier. The widening seems to be largely a function of the big  volume of issuance rather than a questioning of the FHLB's  creditworthiness though a few observers cite both factors.  Secondary market spreads on FICO issues have remained narrow in  the area of 55 basis points.  Corporate bond issuance picked up, with a notable  increase in relatively short-term (one year or so) high grade  issues, which investors are apparently ready to accept without  special protections for ""event risk."" The bulge in issuance, much  of it used to pay down commercial paper, seemed to reflect views  that short-term rates will climb further in the months ahead.  More generally, there is a widespread view among  financial market participants that, given the perceived recent  strengthening of inflationary momentum, rate increases have  further to go. There is a division, though, as to the anticipated  size and duration of such a move, largely dependent on views about  the strength of the economy. Some see only a moderate further  rise of perhaps 1/2 percent, quite possibly followed by a  softening of rates as early as the second half of this year, along  with a pronounced slowdown in the economy's growth. Others  anticipate a larger and longer lasting rate rise, though many of  these observers also expect some moderation in the economy's pace  to perhaps a 2 percent growth range. It would be hard to find any  one in the market with a rate outlook similar to that assumed in  the Administration's budget estimates and in general the ongoing  budget discussions are regarded with skepticism or cynicism.  Recommendations on Leeway  Mr. Chairman, for the upcoming intermeeting period,  current projections suggest a maximum reserve need on the order of  about $7-8 billion. The main factors are increased currency in  circulation, higher required reserves, and by early May some rise  in Treasury balances at the Fed. While some of this can be met  with repurchase agreements, which do not count against leeway, I  believe it would be prudent to enlarge the standard $6 billion  intermeeting leeway temporarily by $2 billion to $8 billion.

198903	107	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Sternlight? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	108	HELLER	 Peter, I heard you use a term a little earlier that I think I have never heard used before: the indexed level of borrowings. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198903	109	STERNLIGHT	 [That's] borrowing used in the construction of reserve paths, about which we had a good deal of uncertainty. I say uncertainty, but I had a fairly strong suspicion that we were overstating or were using a higher level than was consistent with what banks would actually come to the window for, given the range of the funds rate that we were expecting. During those first few weeks of this intermeeting period we would make adjustments, particularly if it went well into a reserve maintenance period, for what was turning out to be a lower level of borrowing by $200 or $300 million as this period went along. And as that persisted week-after-week the decision was made--we consulted with the staff and the Chairman on it--to make this downward technical adjustment in the level of borrowing used in the path, but we were not expecting that to be accompanied by any change in the range of expected funds rates. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	110	HELLER	 No, I understand that. But it is not formally indexed or linked to any other variables. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198903	111	STERNLIGHT	 No, no. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	112	HELLER	 Okay. I thought you had some construct there. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198903	113	STERNLIGHT	 I said indexed because it was indexed to a degree of pressure that we expected to be associated with [a certain] range of federal funds trading. It's indexed in that sense. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	114	HELLER	 Thanks. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198903	115	STERN	 Peter, you may already have answered this indirectly, but in view of the widely recognized problems in the relationship between borrowings and interest rates I wonder if some market participants believe now that we're targeting the funds rate? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	41.0
198903	116	STERNLIGHT	 I think they certainly realized that we have had problems with it. Periodically I see things suggesting that they think we are getting back more to the use of borrowings but probably  not all the way back to where it was, let's say, prior to the stock market crash--which was the time of the major departure. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	117	STERN	 I said rates; you said borrowings. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	41.0
198903	118	STERNLIGHT	 Sorry. Maybe I twisted that around. But they think that we are-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	119	STERN	 Getting back to a rate. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	41.0
198903	120	STERNLIGHT	 Getting back toward use of borrowings. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	121	STERN	 Okay. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	41.0
198903	122	STERNLIGHT	 I think we're getting back toward the borrowings but [not] all the way to what we were pre-October '87. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	123	GREENSPAN	 Further questions for Mr. Sternlight? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	124	SEGER	 There was an article in the paper about Salomon Brothers taking big hits in their government trading. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	125	STERNLIGHT	 Yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	126	SEGER	 Given their level of expertise, etc., and what you said about the people in the markets expecting us to tighten further how could they possibly have taken such gigantic loses? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	127	STERNLIGHT	 As I understand it, Governor, it was not so much a bad bet on what was going to happen to the general level of rates but rather some sophisticated rate spread movements that they anticipated that just did not pan out as they expected. That's not to say I agree-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	128	JOHNSON	 They probably believed the long-term rates were going to rise. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	129	STERNLIGHT	 It's surprising to see as sophisticated a participant as they are coming up on the wrong side on that. I will say that in the past couple of years when, in general, the government securities dealers have had a pretty rough time that firm drew on perhaps a more sophisticated view and a better knowledge [of the market] and has fared better than the pack by a fair margin. I'm really more concerned about a great number of other dealers who seem really unable to hack it with the current degree of competition in the government securities market. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	130	SEGER	 The only reason I mentioned Salomon Brothers is that that was the firm that happened to be featured in the news item. But I imagine-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	131	STERNLIGHT	 Yes, they did have that big hit from a bad bet on what was going to happen to the shape of the yield curve. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	132	SEGER	 Thank you. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	133	GREENSPAN	 President Syron.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	134	SYRON	 Peter, how widespread are these exotic--if I can use that term--hedging strategies that Salomon had in place? Are there many other firms that have things that are [that complex]? Obviously, there are varying degrees of complexity, though. Would they have the edge in terms of the complexity of their strategies or are there others that are operating-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
198903	135	STERNLIGHT	 No, I think there were many firms that engaged in those strategies, though probably in lesser dollar magnitudes than Salomon Brothers. But I don't think it's at all that unusual to the degree-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	136	ANGELL	 Well, it really isn't an exotic hedging strategy; it's an exotic speculative strategy, I think. You really have to distinguish between an exotic speculative strategy and an exotic hedging strategy. There's quite a difference. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198903	137	GREENSPAN	 In a total [unintelligible] it turned out- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	138	SYRON	 It may be a [unintelligible] distinction. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
198903	139	JOHNSON	 I don't know that you look [unintelligible]. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	140	CORRIGAN	 [Unintelligible] on a hedge. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	141	JOHNSON	 Well, by definition a hedge is a hedge. It just depends [on whether it was] something they thought was a hedge. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198903	142	SYRON	 They may have thought it was a hedge in priority. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	51.0
198903	143	ANGELL	 But anyone who finds the hedge [unintelligible]. They just have to have more expertise than that. So, I think they were taking a position. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198903	144	STERNLIGHT	 Further questions for Mr. Sternlight? Would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Desk? 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	145	CORRIGAN	 So move. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	146	SEGER	 Second. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	40.0
198903	147	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Peter, would you like to raise your [leeway question]? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	148	STERNLIGHT	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the upcoming intermeeting period, current projections suggest a maximum reserve need on the order of about $7 or $8 billion. The main factors we think will be increased currency in circulation, higher required reserves and, by early May, some rise in Treasury balances at the Fed. While some of this can be met with repurchase agreements, which do not count against leeway, I believe it would be prudent to enlarge the standard $6 billion intermeeting leeway temporarily by $2 billion to $8 billion. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198903	149	GREENSPAN	 Would somebody like to move the leeway? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198903	150	HELLER	 So move.  	6	63	0.0	1.0	46.0
198903	151	CORRIGAN	 So move. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198903	152	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. We now turn to the economic reports. Messrs. Prell and Truman. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	153	PRELL	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As you know, our recent forecasts have pointed to a slowing in  the pace of economic expansion during the first half of 1989. But it is  not until later this year that growth has been projected to slow  sufficiently to begin easing pressures on labor and capital resources,  thereby setting the stage for a topping out of inflation in 1990.  We have read the incoming information since the last Committee  meeting as being broadly consistent with this scenario. As such, the data  have reinforced our view that the pattern now unfolding may not qualify as  a perfect ""soft landing."" Specifically, although we may be on a gradual  descent in terms of real growth, it is looking more and more like we've  overshot the full employment runway and that we'll need to do some backing  up if inflation is to be contained.  Even with due allowance for the transitory nature of recent price  increases for tomatoes and some other commodities, the latest inflation  news has been disturbing. The producer price index, excluding food and  energy, rose an average of 1/2 percent per month in January and February,  and the CPI, again ex food and energy, rose almost as much. As a  consequence, our projection of the first-quarter increase in this  component of the CPI has been raised from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent, at an  annual rate.  But, we probably should not ignore recent developments in the  food and energy sectors entirely in assessing the overall outlook for  inflation in the months ahead. As Ted will be discussing, the inter-  national oil market has been tighter than we had anticipated; in addition  to the higher cost of crude oil that has resulted, there is the  possibility that gasoline prices will be boosted temporarily this summer  by more stringent pollution control standards in the Northeast. Thus,  while we've raised our energy price forecast for the year only a fraction,  the near-term prospect is considerably less favorable than we thought  before.  Meanwhile, on the agricultural front, the recent price indexes  have shown larger increases than we expected for a wide range of processed  foods, possibly signalling pressures from labor costs and from a variety  of packaging and marketing expenses. Prospects for this year's crops  obviously are uncertain, but without yet changing our assumption of normal  yields, we still have felt it appropriate to mark up our forecast of  consumer food inflation for 1989 by a percentage point, to about 4-3/4  percent.  All told, inflation this year, as measured by the overall CPI,  now looks more likely to be a bit more than 5 percent, rather than a bit  less, as we had projected last month.  As for real activity, the news has been mixed. This probably is  to be expected during a period when output growth is slowing toward a rate  in the vicinity of the underlying trend of potential GNP. Whether,  in fact, such a slowing has occurred, it probably is too early to judge  with confidence. Certainly, we could have been burned in the past couple  of years, and occasionally were, by reading too much into a few soft  monthly indicators.  Turning to the dollar, it has been evident that the  dollar has been supported quite well on balance over the past year or so by the reality and the perception that Federal Reserve policy will be relatively tight and is likely to become tighter.  Therefore, for the near term, while United States interest rates continue  to move up in the staff forecast, we are projecting that the  dollar will remain firm. It drifts off a bit during the second  half of 1989 and is projected to decline at a faster pace as United States  interest rates ease somewhat in 1990.  In effect, we have maintained our fundamental view that  a lower dollar eventually will be a necessary aspect of achieving  better balance in our external accounts, but we have put off the  day when that element again comes importantly into play. Thus, on balance, we now see the dollar averaging about  4 percent higher against the other G-10 countries' currencies  over the forecast period than in the February Greenbook    somewhat more than that in the near term, and somewhat less by  the end of the forecast period. As a result, the trade balance  now shows very little improvement during 1989 and only a modest  improvement in 1990. The current account balance is now  projected to be essentially unchanged over this year    abstracting from the influence of capital gains and losses   and  the improvement in real net exports is smaller. The size of the  partial effect of the stronger dollar on real net exports amounts  to about 1/4 of a percentage point on the Q4-over-Q4 growth rates  for real GNP in both 1989 and 1990; taking account of feedbacks  cuts these estimates roughly in half. The implications for the  economy slows. However, we have changed two underlying features of the forecast; these changes imply less improvement in our external balances both this year and next. We raised the level  of oil prices especially in the near term, and we scaled back the  decline in the dollar for the entire forecast period.  With respect to oil prices, the shortages induced by  disruptions to production in the North Sea, Persian Gulf (Qatar)  cutbacks, and now the Alaskan spill have affected supply more  than we had anticipated. At the same time, OPEC has managed to  hold its November agreement limiting production more or less  intact, and reports persist about stepped up demand in the  industrial countries. As a consequence, oil prices have moved up further on the spot markets to around $20 per barrel. This is  somewhat above the level that would be consistent with our  earlier assumption of an average price for United States imports of  petroleum and products of $15.00 per barrel.  We continue to believe that medium-term supply and  demand conditions in the market for crude petroleum make it  reasonable to assume that spot prices will decline in due course.  However, we are now assuming that the average price of United States oil  imports will settle in at $15.50 per barrel and that we will  approach that somewhat higher average price from above rather than from below, reaching it by mid-year. On balance, the  modification of our assumption about the price of United States oil  imports has added about $2 billion per year to our estimates of the United States trade and current account deficits this year and next.

198903	154	TRUMAN	" Since the last FOMC meeting, data have been released on  United States merchandise trade in December and January. Taken together, they were broadly in line with earlier staff projections, at  least as far as the trade balance itself is concerned. Non-oil  imports in December were considerably above our implicit  estimate. They were boosted, perhaps, in part by a spurt of  imports of consumer goods from the four Asian countries that lost  their preferential tariff access to the United States market at the end of  1988. While nonagricultural exports also were somewhat higher  than we had expected, the net effect on the trade balance was  negative. However, for the fourth quarter, preliminary estimates  of net investment income receipts were larger than we had  anticipated, and as a consequence, the current account balance in  the fourth quarter of 1988 essentially matched our earlier  estimate.  In January, both imports and exports dropped sharply  according to the preliminary figures, and with a larger decline  in imports the trade deficit narrowed somewhat. However, the  data could be revised substantially as a consequence of the  change over to new classification systems, and the January  deficit could well be revised up next month.  On balance, these data provided little basis for us to  revise our earlier forecast of a small improvement in the trade  and current account balances this year (in nominal and real  terms) followed by more rapid improvement next year as the United States  Finally, in surveying the major categories of private spending, I  would note that, outside of autos, inventories in the aggregate have  continued to expand roughly in line with sales, and there are few signs at  this point of overhangs that might lead to significant cutbacks in orders  and production.  To sum up, then, we interpret the available information as  providing tentative support for our thesis that economic activity is  decelerating somewhat in the first half of this year. However, given our  view that growth will have to slow considerably further and remain low for  some time in order to reverse the updrift in inflation, we still think it  likely that further increases in interest rates will be needed. Such  increases can work their disinflationary effect through the traditional  ""closed economy"" channels of higher borrowing costs and lower asset  values, or they can exert such an influence through the ""open economy""  channel of firmer exchange rates and damped growth of net exports.  Ted will now discuss the external side of our forecast.  January, and this may show through in a net negative influence on consumer  spending in the current quarter that will be reversed in the period ahead.  In light of these factors and the recent strong gains in employment and  income, we are anticipating a bounceback in real consumer spending growth  in the second quarter, to around 4 percent, and then a marked slowing  later this year.  Unusual weather clearly has been a factor distorting the month-  to-month movements in construction activity, too. In the residential  market, declining building permits and home sales would seem to confirm  that the strength in starts earlier this year was indeed the product of  exceptionally warm and dry conditions. The strength in nonresidential  construction put-in-place in January also was likely attributable in part  to the weather, and while it may contribute to a hefty gain in real  business fixed investment in the current quarter, we don't see that  strength persisting.  The other, larger element of business capital spending    equipment outlays   also looks fairly robust in this quarter. But, while  shipments of nondefense capital goods evidently rose considerably through  February, orders have, on balance, been less impressive. In particular,  orders for office and computing machines plunged in February, according to  the confidential advance estimates. The computer figures are highly  volatile, subject to big revisions, and not very reliable guides to future  sales, but our sense is that this industry is not booming. Thus, despite  healthy gains in orders for industrial machinery, we expect that overall  equipment investment will grow less rapidly in the coming quarter.  We have estimated drought-adjusted GNP growth at 2-1/2 percent in  the current quarter. This is somewhat less than is suggested by the  January-February labor market data. Our experience has indicated that the  labor market indicators often are far better predictors of GNP than are  the fragmentary expenditure data; however, we have chosen to discount the  employment figures somewhat, partly because of the signs that productivity  improvement may be faltering. Apart from the usual pattern of deteriorating productivity when output decelerates, the anecdotal evidence of  scarce supplies of high quality workers suggests that efficiency may be  suffering as hiring proceeds apace.  Among the major expenditure categories, consumer spending appears  to have weakened appreciably in the current quarter. After a 3-1/2  percent rate of increase in the fourth quarter, we have projected in the  Greenbook a 2-1/2 percent gain in the first. The Commerce Department's  report on February consumption, which came out on Friday, would argue for  a fractionally lower number.  While we certainly expect slackening consumer demand to be a big  part of the GNP deceleration later this year and in 1990, I would caution  against concluding from the recent numbers that a major slowdown already  is under way. First, the retail sales data upon which the Commerce  estimates are partly based are subject to sizable revisions. Second, a  late-year bulge in car sales boosted fourth-quarter spending and has held  down first-quarter outlays. (I should note, as an important digression,  that lower auto assemblies are trimming about 3/4 of a percentage point  off of real GNP growth this quarter, and that drag should not be present  in the next three months.) Finally, warm weather reduced heating bills in  external balances in nominal terms are somewhat more pronounced  in 1990 than in 1989 since the relatively favorable J-curve  effects this year would be reversed next year.  This revised outlook for the dollar suggests a somewhat  different balance of risks in our current forecast. On the one  hand, the near-term strength of the dollar would lessen both  direct and indirect inflation pressures; in other words, it implies a contribution from the external side to a soft landing. On the other hand, one might argue that the risks have increased  in the forecast of a greater decline of the dollar. "	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	155	GREENSPAN	 Questions for either gentleman? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	156	JOHNSON	 A couple. One: Just looking at the forecast, which has been revised since last time although it's not dramatically different, you have real GNP slowing significantly by the third quarter of 1989. It averages about 1.2 percent from the third quarter of 1989 through 1990. We have gotten into these arguments before about what potential is but I think everybody agrees that that's well below whatever anybody is thinking of as potential. And that's for a fairly significant period of time. Yet we don't see any improvement on the inflation side. The lags are longer I guess than would show up on here. But exactly what do we expect, ultimately, on the inflation rate from a forecast that has that kind of slack built into it over a prolonged period? Clearly, it's not showing up in the numbers here. When does it show up? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	157	PRELL	 Let me say first that it takes a period of below potential growth in order for some slack to open up in the labor market in particular. But also, we'd expect to have some slack-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	158	JOHNSON	 I know, but there's a year of that kind of slack. And I just wondered-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	159	PRELL	" But, as you know, in our forecast that only brings the unemployment rate up to about 6 percent. The maybe ""worst case"" interpretation of the events of the last two years is that that's only getting us back to the natural rate--if you want to use that framework for looking at this. We have been implicitly a bit more optimistic in the sense that, as we move up to the 6 percent neighborhood and edge above it by the end of 1990, we are anticipating that we will begin to see some tendency toward moderation in the underlying inflation trend. And thus in 1991, if the unemployment rate remained in the low 6 percent neighborhood, by bringing growth up to, say, the 2 percent range we would anticipate that we would begin to discern a very gradual deceleration of inflation. But it would be measured in fractions of a percent for a year at that level. "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	160	JOHNSON	 But if you're just saying that we're moving to the natural rate why would you get below potential growth on that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	161	PRELL	 Well, to raise the unemployment rate you have to move below potential growth. In recent years it has been very clear that on average the economy had to grow less than 2-1/2 percent in order to produce an upward movement in the unemployment rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	162	JOHNSON	 Yes, I know I'm--  	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	163	PRELL	 Our judgment is based on what we've seen in wage and price behavior. All the anecdotal evidence over the past year or so suggests that in essence we have overshot a level of resource utilization that's consistent with stable inflation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	164	JOHNSON	 Again, what happens ultimately? What is the ultimate inflation path that we get out of this scenario? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	165	PRELL	 Well, in 1991 we'd expect to see a fractional decline in the inflation rate barring any exogenous shocks that we obviously can't anticipate at this point. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	166	JOHNSON	 There is one other point I wanted to ask. I asked this last time but I'll ask it again. I was looking at our forecast compared to the Bluechip consensus. I know what was circulated showed some other forecasts besides the Bluechip one, but those are all contained in the Bluechip so I'm comparing that one with ours. We have very similar forecasts on real GNP and inflation. But once again they expect a decline in short-term interest rates by the second quarter whereas we're saying they need to go a percentage point higher. Any comment on that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	167	PRELL	 I don't think we're totally outside the spectrum of outside forecasters, but there continues to be some difference of opinion between the staff and that average in terms of how much weakness is likely to occur in aggregate demand as a consequence of the tightening that has occurred already. I noticed in the article in The Wall Street Journal the other day on the difficulties in economic forecasting that one person commented that it appears that the business forecasters keep predicting recession about a year out and then moving it back as it doesn't materialize. In essence, there's a large element of that: a sense that we have had a long expansion; things have gotten tight; and it's more likely than not that we may have a downturn. And they perceive it occurring by the end of this year, in many cases with interest rates moving down along with it. They also tend to have a seemingly relatively rapid disinflation response to that softening--greater than we would anticipate. And that's part of the difference in our views. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	168	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	169	PARRY	 Ted, considering the strength of the dollar in the past year and your comment that you think the dollar will remain relatively firm in the near term, why wouldn't it be reasonable to expect that any significant improvement in net exports would be delayed to the second half of the year at the earliest and most likely to 1990? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	170	TRUMAN	 I don't think we have much improvement in the second half. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	171	PARRY	 Well, you have improvement over the year going from $103 billion, which of course has been revised. But the change is from $103 to $85 billion; that's not [unintelligible] $18 billion. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	172	TRUMAN	 Yes, but some of the changes have to do with special factors in the last quarter of 1988 when there was a deterioration, some of which was caused by a surge in oil imports and  probably a surge in nonoil imports associated with the buildup in [inventories]. So, you take that out and that's where much of the improvement comes on the trade side in the first half of the year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	173	PARRY	 It's still $13 billion. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	174	TRUMAN	 What? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	175	PARRY	 $98 billion to $85 billion is still $13 billion. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	176	TRUMAN	 What I mean is that while there is a small improvement in there most of it is a bounceback from the fourth quarter on the trade side. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	177	PARRY	 But when-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	178	TRUMAN	 And there is a small adjustment in the-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	179	PARRY	 Wouldn't typical statistical studies lead you to expect an actual deterioration? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	180	TRUMAN	 No, because we think that there still is some effect in the pipeline from the delayed effects of the dollar decline and we have built some of that in there. So that's consistent with the models and the equations that we use in terms of those effects. And then we add on the special factors like oil and agriculture--to the extent that there's a rebound this year in agricultural exports in real terms, in comparison to the flat performance last year--and that's what gives you some of the improvement. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	181	PARRY	 Would you say there's perhaps a greater uncertainty in this area than in some of the other areas of GNP performance? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	182	TRUMAN	 I've always felt there's a lot of uncertainty. That may be because I've been closer to it. But I think that Mike sends me his gospel truth and he's always right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	183	PRELL	 And vice-versa. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	184	SPEAKER	 One of you is making a mistake. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	185	PRELL	 Well, there's a lot of uncertainty on all aspects of the forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	186	PARRY	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	187	GREENSPAN	 Doesn't it bother you that implicit in this scenario is an increasing willingness to [acquire] direct claims on the United States? If you extrapolate to what seems to be going on, what turns it? In other words, I assume the long-term rate differential is what basically is driving the models. Are we expecting that the long-term rate differentials will narrow in the next recession or the next month? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	188	TRUMAN	 That is what it is basically. As you know and others who have looked at it know, the equations for exchange rates just barely qualify as equations in the statistical relationships--  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	189	GREENSPAN	 They're better than anything else I've seen. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	190	TRUMAN	 Well, as we get over this peak and the economy softens a bit--this is basically what Governor Johnson was commenting on in terms of the Bluechip forecast--we have United States rates coming down in 1990 and coming down relative to rates abroad. No matter what model you put that through, that gives you essentially a differential effect. It could differ with regard to how much you get in the short run on the one side. But the changing effect comes from the change in the influence of the interest rate differential on the exchange rate. In a sense we pushed aside the fact that you get very little improvement in nominal terms over this period. And we are assuming, maybe based in some sense on recent experience, that the market will continue to finance us about-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	191	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	192	SYRON	 Mike, I just had a question, which I think I know the answer to. Regarding the rate increase that is implicit in the Greenbook forecast: Is that essentially a straight line linear forecast throughout the year? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198903	193	PRELL	 Well, we wouldn't want to be any fancier than that. We just have a gradual further rise. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	194	SYRON	 I guess the second part of the question I'll put off until later. But I'd be interested in speculating if it wasn't a straight line increase whether the potential impact of that was of importance. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198903	195	PRELL	 I think what we have built into the remainder of this year is not very large. In fact, I will venture to say that it might not be large enough, given the range of possibilities one can see here. But to make distinctions on whether you've gained this increase of roughly a percentage point through a 3/4 point rise over the next three months and a 1/4 point rise thereafter versus 1/4 point and then 3/4 point I think is going well beyond anything that economic science can discriminate between. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	196	SYRON	 The second part of my question relates to the questions Governor Johnson asked. In your model, is it fair to say-- and this leads to the risks--that you don't see us getting below the natural rate until somewhere around the second quarter of 1990? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198903	197	PRELL	 Well, I don't want to speak of models per se here. The models we have been looking at have a longer history of price/wage behavior and would suggest that the natural rate is above 6 percent. However, our interpretation of the errors those models have made recently and of recent evidence leads us to put together a forecast that, if you forced it into that kind of model, would imply a considerably lower natural rate. So, we are in the vicinity of that implicit natural rate by the middle of next year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	198	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	199	HELLER	 If you look at many models in their unadjusted state--just running the pure models whether they're monetarist or  [unintelligible]--over a fairly broad spectrum they tend to come up with a negative growth rate in the first half of next year. And then you judgmentally massage the models. The main difference that I can see is whether the conditions that are implied tend to have no recession. How confident are you that the no recession scenario is judgmentally right--that it will prevail over the simple unfettered models? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	200	PRELL	 Well, there's hardly anyone who runs an unfettered model forecast. You're always confronted with the fact that models have imprecisely predicted the recent past and you need to make some corrections in order to move forward in the forecast period. Our models, for example--the quarterly model and the P* model--have tended to underpredict the strength of aggregate demand in the economy over the past year or so. If you immediately eliminated that and had a pure model forecast moving forward it would suggest a sharper weakening than we have in the forecast. But whether that's the most plausible assumption to make is a question. Certainly, we [would] be inclined to make that kind of adjustment. The basic question, though, is whether the outlook contains a significant risk of recession. In this Greenbook we deviated from what we had done the last couple times--just to avoid needless repetition perhaps--but maybe it is useful to state again: we are skirting zero growth here by a small margin in what we've written down. And certainly a small hiccup in the economy in an adverse way could tip this into negative territory. So I would say that with this kind of outlook there is a non- negligible risk of at least a mild downturn in the economy. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	201	KOHN	 Governor Heller, I could add that we do run some what we call St. Louis-style reduced form equations on monetary aggregates and they do show slower nominal income growth than the staff projection for 1989 and 1990. But they showed substantially slower growth, particularly in the M2 equation, in 1988 than we got. And they made huge errors earlier in the decade, in '85 and '86. On the other side, they had much faster GNP growth, say, in-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	202	HELLER	 How low do they get there? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	203	KOHN	 What? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	204	HELLER	 How would you describe the path at the beginning? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	205	GUFFEY	 In '89, how weak? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198903	206	KOHN	 How weak is it? Let's see. For nominal income growth in 1989 it has about 4 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	207	HELLER	 And real? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	208	KOHN	 I don't have it broken down; this runs off the nominal model. But running it using the base I have 9 percent or so [nominal]. But they have all been making such huge errors that I would have skepticism about-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	209	HELLER	 Well, the skepticism is whether the errors will average out over the--  	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	210	KOHN	 At the end of a certain number of decades, right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	211	PRELL	 It sounds like we're somewhere in between those two in our '90 forecast in nominal GNP. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	212	HELLER	 Thanks, Don. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	213	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	214	FORRESTAL	 Mike, I was curious about the real disposable income number that you have in the Greenbook. The second quarter shows considerable weakness. I know the nominal personal income number doesn't change very much. Is there a special factor there? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
198903	215	PRELL	 I'm sorry I didn't catch the change that you were referring to. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	216	FORRESTAL	 The real personal disposable income in the second quarter of '89 would be quite weak. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
198903	217	PRELL	 Well, there are some special factors boosting the first quarter and some of those, like drought relief payments, won't recur in the second quarter. The growth in the first quarter is also boosted by things like Social Security but that's a level adjustment, so to speak. We are expecting a considerable slowing in employment growth and in hours in the months ahead. And that plays a significant role in the outlook for income growth. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	218	HOSKINS	 Mike, let me ask you Governor Heller's questions perhaps in a different way. And that is: How would you assess the risks of forecast error with respect to inflation? Do you have a symmetrical risk on either side or are we more likely in your view to exceed it on the up side or the down side? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198903	219	PRELL	 I think it's fair to say that the recent data-- and as I indicated we've raised our forecast of the price indexes for the current quarter--leave us with the impression that the inflation pressures at these levels of resource utilization may be a little greater than we had anticipated. But we haven't made a dramatic change here. We have tried to read through some of the noise in these numbers. And we've only passed through a modest bit of this surprise into the forecast for the next two years. I characterized the situation last time as being one where we think this inflation forecast represents our best point estimate. But if I were to draw the probability distribution, my sense is that the distribution has a longer tail on the up side than on the down side. I could envision a percentage point more inflation more readily than I could envision a percentage point less inflation over the next year or so. That doesn't mean that there's a strong likelihood of that happening; but in that sense I think the risks may be a bit on the up side. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	220	HOSKINS	 I'd like to just follow up. Since Don raised it, I want to know what base growth you had to get 9 percent nominal. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198903	221	KOHN	 Actually, I think we have projected about 4-3/4 percent base growth. That model, the base model in particular, has done so poorly that I really shouldn't even have cited it. The errors have been in percentage points.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	222	GREENSPAN	 [There are questions about] the appropriate numerator, I think, on velocity with the base--if you pick up a good chunk of economic activity outside the United States, some of it illegal. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	223	KOHN	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	224	HELLER	 A lot of that activity is in the District of Columbia as well. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	225	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but they do use American currency last I heard. President Melzer. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	226	MELZER	 Mike, I wanted to ask if you had any insight into what's going on with short-term business credit--that there's some strength apart from the LBO situation. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198903	227	PRELL	 I can't slice this too finely; it's very hard to trace that. In the Greenbook we referred to numbers where we've taken away the large corporate merger transactions that we can identify and gotten some additional information there. There are so many corporate restructuring transactions going on that there may be a lot of other things going on in the numbers besides basic financing and capital expenditures and so on. Our reading is that there has been some strength in short-term business credit apart from the RJR/Nabisco and other major merger transactions. And that probably is reflective of the underlying need for funds and the deferral of long-term financing. Some of the long bond issuance that Peter talked about earlier really isn't very long term; much of it has been swapped into floating rate obligations. It just appears that businesses are not anxious to lock in these current long-term borrowing costs which, again, is consistent with the term structure picture and these forecasts of weakening in the economy and lower interest rates down the road. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	228	MELZER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198903	229	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	230	SEGER	 Maybe you can get rid of some confusion I have. I always thought that the housing industry was very sensitive to credit conditions and interest rate movements, and so forth. I see what has happened to interest rates in the last year and I hear the forecast of another percentage point to be tacked on, yet I see housing starts for the calendar year 1989 actually estimated at a touch above calendar 1988--if I'm on the right line, it's 1-1/2 million versus 1.49 million. And then the following year it's 1.44 million, with the weakest quarter not being any worse than 1.43 million. I guess I just need to have that put together for me. How, with these interest rates, would you think that the home construction will not be any weaker than that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198903	231	PRELL	 Well, to date, the effects on housing starts have been negligible. I think housing starts were confounded a bit by the weather that boosted the January figure to such a high level. February is in the area of more than 1-1/2 million. Interest rates have already risen a good bit. We don't have a gigantic further increase in mortgage rates in this forecast, so this kind of decline-- given the underlying demographic influences and so on--looks to us to  be fairly reasonable. I don't think we are all that far off. Given what other forecasters have been anticipating in terms of interest rate movements, I don't think we're that far off the beaten track on the housing starts outlook. Perhaps we're being a little optimistic. If we had a much larger mortgage rate increase it would obviously make a difference. But it's not very large at this point. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	232	PARRY	 Governor Seger, one other perspective that perhaps I can provide on that: If you take the California market, which represents a fairly significant share-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	233	SEGER	 Assume everyone's moving to California--is that it? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198903	234	PARRY	 No, I said it's a fairly significant share of the total housing market. We have had increases in the prices of single- family homes that have averaged 25 to 30 percent in the Los Angeles and San Francisco markets. I think there are some consumers that look at that on a total return basis and figure out that 11 percent is not such a bad deal if you can count on increases in prices of that magnitude. I think that's had an impact in our state. I don't know if-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	235	SEGER	 Yes, but the others -- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198903	236	HELLER	 Mike Kelley wants to speak. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198903	237	GREENSPAN	 That's an interesting issue because the real interest rate there is to be adjusted not by general price levels but by the price of the asset to which it is applied. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	238	PARRY	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	239	GREENSPAN	 And there as you're saying--you don't mean in California that it is literally negative at this stage but-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	240	PARRY	 Well, all I know is that the average price in the two markets that constitute most of the area has gone up about 25 to 30 percent in the past year. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	241	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's not the projection. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	242	PARRY	 No. And one has to figure out what people are projecting. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	243	PRELL	 I think we've seen in some parts of the Northeast that this doesn't go on forever--that you get an affordability problem after a while because the mortgage payment just is unmanageable. But it is a mixed picture regionally, and that's one of the problems in forecasting housing activity. It clearly has been a problem in the last year. We've had very divergent and changing market conditions. We try to sort through all of that as well. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	244	SYRON	 Consistent with what Bob [Parry] said, you get this responding sort of with a lag. In New England now we're seeing lower housing activity than you might expect, considering other variables, because with the rate of appreciation having declined substantially--it has actually gone negative in real terms--people are  buying housing only for shelter. They are not buying it any longer figuring that it is an investment as well. So, at some point it sort of falls off a cliff in a sense, and you get a strong negative reaction to the whole thing. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	51.0
198903	245	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's what will tilt the housing market down. If all of a sudden there is a perception that residential property values are easing then all of a sudden, whatever the nominal mortgage rate is. it will grab-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	246	PARRY	 That's right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	247	PRELL	 I might just note one of the surprises recently: we haven't gotten too excited about this yet, but we have been surprised by the firmness in the multifamily sector. And we notice that there has been some downturn in vacancy rates in some locales. We have a sense that there is a very old stock of apartment buildings out there and some demographic pressure. It may be that there is some considerable resilience in the apartment part of the market. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	248	GREENSPAN	 Bob, I assume that the 25 percent increase is a nominal increase in price and that it has the same problem that the national figure has in picking up a significant increase in the average size of homes and improved quality. So, the adjusted price level is not going up anywhere near that level. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	249	PARRY	 We do not'collect good data on that. I don't know how much that has changed and how much of a factor that is. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	250	GREENSPAN	 We do know in the national figures that it's very significant. And since California is such a big part, clearly, it's got to be an issue there. President Guffey. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	251	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mike, how much of the decline that you're showing in your forecast for 1989 and 1990 from last time is attributed to your assumption of an additional one percentage point increase in interest rates? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198903	252	PRELL	 We haven't really made much of a change from our last projection. Using the model--which I've already indicated is an imperfect predictor of these responses--if you took out the interest rate increase and just held the funds rate stable the model would take off maybe 1/3 of a percent in real growth this year and something over 1/2 a percent next year. That means that we still would have a perceptible weakening in growth and likely some slight edging up in the unemployment rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	253	GREENSPAN	 Ted, can I ask a question on the effect of the rise in the oil price in the last couple of weeks on the Saudi Arabian fiscal situation? A couple of weeks ago, as I recall, it looked as though the rapidly deteriorating fiscal situation in Saudi Arabia and the pressures on the oil price would likely come, with the Saudis having to increase their liftings to meet their revenue requirements, which would accelerate the price level decline. Is there any way of making a judgment as to whether the recent runup in spot crude prices has altered the situation in a way in which they need not move the liftings at this point?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	254	TRUMAN	 Well, it clearly works in that direction, though it all depends a bit on what one thinks the current meeting will produce for the balance of 1989. I have not seen any reports that suggest that the Saudis will step up production because of their fiscal situation or that they do not need to step up their production because prices have moved up. Posted prices have not moved to the same degree as spot prices, although-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	255	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but they are still really selling at spot. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	256	TRUMAN	 But they have some long-term contracts. It depends on how those contracts are written; that's right. It works in that direction. One of the favorable factors has been the supply disruptions in Qatar; that has tightened the supply side. And in some sense there has been a spillover to the price the Saudis are getting. We have a small step-up in production in the second half of the year built into this. Our guess is that they decided to accept the prices coming down on the assumption that there will be a modest increase--a couple hundred thousand barrels a day--in OPEC production in general in the second half of the year. That's not a big deal. A small increase, on that order of magnitude, is built into what we have and if you parse that out among all the producers-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	257	GREENSPAN	 If there are no further questions for Messrs. Prell or Truman, shall we open our tour de table? Who would like to start? President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	258	BOYKIN	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I really don't have any questions or any real disagreement with the staff forecast. Looking at the District, our recent performance and the near- term prospects for our economy continue to improve. Over the last year and a half the gains in the Dallas District have been concentrated primarily in manufacturing services. More recently, we've seen some gain from the energy sector. The contraction in construction seems to be nearing the bottom. Agriculture remains a bit of a concern, primarily because of the uncertainty of the drought situation. As I've reiterated over the last six months, most of my contacts outside the banking and real estate industries have been sounding increasingly optimistic. I had a group of investment merchant bankers in for a breakfast meeting last week and most of them agreed that the Texas economy and even that of Louisiana, which has been one of the weakest states, are beginning to demonstrate increasing strength. In fact, a few who represent very large companies with considerable capital from both national and international sources are beginning to look upon the region as a ripe opportunity because of the reduced competition coming from the banking sector. On the whole the regional economy is improving but growing slower than the nation. Banking, real estate, and now agriculture are the exceptions to this pattern. Within the District no one is noting price or wage pressures but there have been a few signs over the last two or three months of some shortages of engineers, first in Houston and now in Dallas. Overall, I think we're feeling a little more optimistic down our way than we have for quite some time. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198903	259	GREENSPAN	 President Black.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	260	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, the Greenbook projections look quite reasonable to us. Until very recently we had thought that they were underestimating the amount of economic growth we would have in the economy. But at this point I guess we think the risk of error is about equal on both sides of that. This change in our view is not the result of what we see in the Greenbook or the Beigebook or what we pick up in the way of anecdotal information. To us those sources suggest--if you allow for some downtick in some of the monthly statistics in February because of that temporary weather-induced burst in January and also allow for the sluggishness recently in automobile sales, which may prove to be temporary--that the economy looks pretty strong. What makes us think that the risks really have shifted is that we have taken, we think, some pretty significant policy moves in recent weeks and months. The federal funds rate is up about 3-1/2 percentage points over a pretty short period of time, and we think these policy actions--particularly the most recent ones--have increased the odds that economic activity will moderate later this year just as the Greenbook projects. And these actions significantly reduce the risk that the economy is going to overheat further. Now, the recent sharp increases in prices at the wholesale level and certainly at the consumer level worry us a great deal as do the indications of upward pressures on wages. And we're deeply concerned about broad increases in prices outside the food and energy area. That suggests that the underlying rate of inflation has risen at least a notch or two in the last several months. On the other hand, the trend rate of growth in M2 has dropped pretty markedly over the last two years and I think that provides us with at least some insurance against a really sharp further acceleration in the underlying rate of inflation for the remainder of 1989. But I would add, perhaps gratuitously, that if we're really going to get inflation down to a zero level I think somewhere down the road we've certainly got to get the aggregates growing at a slower rate than they have grown over most of this two-year period--maybe no slower in 1989, but certainly in a trend sense they have to come down still further if we're going to get to our ultimate goal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198903	261	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	262	PARRY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy continues to experience healthy growth with only a few signs of slowing. Agricultural producers are enjoying high product prices and recent rains have lessened the chances of drought in the area rather substantially. We also hear reports from Western department store executives that sales of soft goods have improved in recent weeks. But I must admit that that may be a reflection of improved weather conditions and also the early Easter season. In the few sectors that we do see slowing it appears as though supply constraints explain much of the change. In Section II of the Greenbook there was a reference to the types of problems that the commercial aircraft industry is experiencing and I was thinking that it's rather amazing that Boeing has signed an agreement with Lockheed to borrow up to 670 Atlanta-based workers for as long as six months. Turning to the national economy, the level of activity as indicated in the discussion in the Greenbook remains above its noninflationary potential. Strong growth in employment and tightening labor markets suggest that upward pressures on wages are likely to  persist. At the same time, higher short-term interest rates may result in some slowing in the next few quarters. But I must admit that, to me, signs of current slowing are too few to be convincing at this point. Our overall outlook for the economy is really not very different from that of the Greenbook. We also expect the economy to remain above full employment with continuing upward wage pressures for at least the remainder of 1989 and perhaps into 1990. However, we have less strength in our forecast originating in the net export sector, largely as a result of the strength of the dollar that we've experienced during the past year. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198903	263	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	264	STERN	 With regard first to the District economy, in general things remain in good shape and there haven't been any major surprises or new developments that are worth reporting, with a couple of exceptions. On the side of real activity the one surprise that I've noticed is that nonresidential construction activity is certainly stronger than I would have expected at this point. Major projects continue to be announced and initiated in the Twin Cities and the way things are shaping up it looks like that's going to keep that sector reasonably strong early into the next decade. Labor markets generally remain tight and sectors that had been expanding are continuing to expand. Having said that, I do have the sense from talking to a variety of business people that the rate of expansion has eased a bit. And it's very clear to me that in the last several months, at least, business people are once again noticing interest rates. Interest rates have become a topic of conversation whereas as recently as perhaps four or five months ago that subject hardly, if ever, came up. But that's now back on the agenda. Another subject where the tone of the anecdotal information seems to have changed is cost increases. In the past a lot of business people would tell you about the cost increases that they were experiencing and the difficulties they were having in passing those cost increases through. They will admit now that they're having less difficulty moving those cost increases through. They hardly, if ever, complain any longer about the difficulty in doing so. As far as the national outlook is concerned, I have little to add. I think there are some signs that we may be approaching a soft landing, at least as far as real growth is concerned. I wouldn't want to exaggerate those signs, given that January was probably boosted by very favorable weather and some backing off in February was almost inevitable. We do run an unfettered model forecast; it's a wholly unfettered [vector] auto-regressive model. And for what that's worth, that does not have a recession in it. It has continued real growth in '89 and '90, and it has that at modest rates. And, at least as far as consumer prices are concerned, it has somewhat more rapid inflation than the Greenbook. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198903	265	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	266	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, looking first at the District, I'm glad Boeing is borrowing some of the Lockheed workers; that will be helpful. There are several thousand Eastern [Airlines] people who are available as well. We haven't seen very much of a change in the Sixth District since the last meeting of the Committee. We are continuing to see moderately good growth, although it's somewhat  slower paced than the national average. Capital spending plans are quite robust in those industries where capacity pressures are evident and that is certainly the case for industries like paper, chemicals, rubber, and all aspects of the transportation sector. Textile manufacturers are also moving ahead with plans to increase purchases of equipment although in that case it's mostly to modernize their older facilities. We do continue to have reports of shortages of skilled labor and upward [wage] pressures for skilled workers. The markets are not quite as tight for unskilled people but even there we hear sporadic reports of difficulty, particularly in fast-food places and in supermarkets. There is considerable concern among people I talk to about the rising cost of benefits, particularly health benefits, and the impact on total labor costs. In addition to that there's a fear or concern about enactment of a higher minimum wage which would push up wages for higher paid labor as well, given the relative tightness of the labor market. As for prices, on the basis of sporadic reports, the information we're getting is mixed. Increases are mixed for industrial inputs, with a greater upward bias than seen a year ago. And it's rather interesting to me that, in connection with prices as well as some other areas, people talk about a lower level of prices over the last month or so but when they compare their prices to a year ago they are still considerably higher. With regard to the national economy, we don't have very significant differences with the Greenbook forecast. We would have a slightly higher inflation number and a lower unemployment number but those are minor differences; basically we're in agreement. Judging from the Sixth District and from what I see around the nation there is some near-term deceleration in economic expansion, especially if you take into account the fact that we're at full employment and a lot of industries are going full blast and at high capacity. There are two things that continue to disturb me. One is that any slowing that's evident seems to be taken as a sign of real weakness in the economy. I think we've gotten so used to high numbers over the past several years that when the numbers come off even a little people get panicky. On the inflation side the same thing is true. As I've said before, among a lot of people that I've talked to there is kind of an acceptance of inflation at the 5 percent level or even a bit higher. I think that was confirmed when the CPI number the other day came in at .4 percent--which I'm not all that sanguine about--they were relieved that it wasn't at the higher end of the expected range. So in general, I think we have an expectational problem in the economy and in the markets that we really have got to move against. Now, I hope that the economy really is slowing. But as someone said earlier we've been burned on this before. Over the summer I remember a couple of times when we thought there was a slowing and it turned out not to be. So, I'm skeptical that we are really seeing a sufficient slowing to stem the inflationary pressures that are there. And that obviously leads me to a certain conclusion about monetary policy that I'll reserve for the later discussion. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198903	267	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	268	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I do find this a particularly difficult period in which to assess the outlook. In his presentation I think Mike made the case, which we would agree with, that there are at least some tentative signs of moderation out there. In a national context we reviewed a number of things in the Greenbook. We think  consumer spending, particularly for durables, will be showing some sign of leveling. Growth of exports is certainly short of our expectations, and that would be particularly true for industrial supplies, materials, and capital equipment. The housing numbers are showing some signs of softness; interest rates have had an impact on that. The railroads no longer carry the GNP but nonetheless the year- to-date numbers for rail shipments are certainly lower, particularly for February, than was the case for last year. How much of this is weather-related I think is very tough to tell. January was extraordinarily warm, of course, and February was at least normally cold and the seasonal adjustments may have had an impact on some of these national numbers. In a District context, we're really not seeing very much of this moderation. The employment numbers throughout the District continue to be strong; we don't see any weaknesses emerging there. The manufacturing outlook continues at a pretty high level. The steel business, for example, is strong. And the steel plants in the Midwest are exporting--admittedly from a low base--but nonetheless that's a new market for them. Machine tool orders are up. Railway equipment-- an industry that has been absolutely moribund over the last four or five years--is showing some signs of increased orders. So, in a manufacturing context, it's our expectation that activity in the Midwest this year probably will be running ahead of the national numbers. And certainly the other aspects of the Midwestern economy continue to be pretty favorable. On the inflation side I have thought for quite some while that of course the risks really were, on balance, for higher levels of inflation. I think that continues to be the case; but it may just be possible that we're at one of those times when the balance is shifting a little and that as we go into the upcoming period some of the moderating signs will become a bit more specific. The real question--which we'll be talking about a little later--is how much more we need to do in a monetary policy sense, if in fact we need to do more. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198903	269	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Stone. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	270	STONE	 Regionally, the labor markets in the Third District have continued to tighten. The unemployment rate this quarter for the three states represented in the District is estimated to be the lowest it has been in 19 years. We'd be happy to borrow some employees from whatever Districts seem to have some available. Businesses are reporting a shortage of labor across an increasing number of categories and that includes skilled and unskilled workers. And we're starting to hear about shortages in the professional area, including engineers. Prices and wages continue to increase at levels above the national average. We also see some early signs for our regional outlook of more moderate growth in the near term, but not a level moderate enough to reduce substantially the pressures on both labor markets and prices. On the national scene, we feel the staff estimates are relatively reasonable. We probably see more risks on the up side, particularly for inflation. That concludes my report. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198903	271	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	272	CORRIGAN	 Let me start with a couple of impressionistic or anecdotal comments. My sense is that most people in the business community that I talk to associate themselves with the view that there are these straws in the wind that the economy may be settling down a bit. But I think it's almost universally true that they would tend to be in the soft landing camp in that I have absolutely no suggestions [from them] of any accumulating downturn or anything even remotely resembling recession or remotely indicative of that. There is, I think, especially among major industrial companies, far less conviction today than there was three months ago about the prospective strength of exports. Some of that is exchange-rate related but, seemingly, a lot of it is not simply a reflection of exchange rates; there's a combination of capacity constraints and other considerations as well. But certainly there is less conviction about the near-term strength of exports than has been the case. Even has changed his tune, Alan, quite perceptibly. The anecdotal material on the inflation side is, frankly, a bit sour right now. Virtually all companies --small and large--that we've talked to in the recent past do point to both labor and nonlabor cost pressures. And consistent with Gary's comment [they report] less difficulty in passing costs through. I don't think I would characterize these impressions as symptomatic of a 1979-80 type outburst of inflation. Nevertheless, I think the perception is there that the pressure is greater. One little tiny vignette that's germane: our small business and agricultural advisory committee members were talking last week--and this really shocked all of us, I think--about wage increases as high as 9 and 10 percent. Presumably, because these are small companies these are not wage increases as much as they are increases in hiring rates. In other words, when they lose employees they have to go out into the marketplace and replace them. And I think the thrust of their comment was that, in at least some cases, replacement rates are now 9 or 10 percent above prevailing rates for existing employees. So it's not a wage increase in the usual sense of the term but I think it is symptomatic of quite tight labor markets throughout the District, including most of upstate New York at this point. The other impression that I pick up an awful lot lately--and I think it's just worth repeating--is an almost universal skepticism, bordering on cynicism, about the outlook for budget deficit reduction plans, as they may or may not emerge over the weeks ahead. Again, it doesn't matter whether you're talking to small businesses, big businesses, upstate, or downstate. There really is a growing concern that nothing seems to be happening. Whether the Administration's quiet diplomacy will produce something is another question. But I think it is a matter of increasing concern. As far as the forecasts are concerned, the New York staff forecast for 1989 in terms of GNP, real GNP, and indeed almost all the components of GNP, is virtually identical with the Board staff's forecast. The only major difference we continue to have is on the inflation side. Depending upon which index you look at, our inflation rates are a half-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198903	273	GUFFEY	 Jerry, would you speak up a little? We'd like to hear what you're saying.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198903	274	CORRIGAN	 I'm sorry. The only material difference in our staff forecast versus the Board staff's forecast is on inflation. That has narrowed a bit but we still have inflation rates in 1989 --depending upon which index you look at--that are 1/2 to 3/4 of a point above the Board staff's forecast. That still seems to reflect, primarily, a different view on markups. Mike's forecast still has a small negative spread between, say, the deflator and unit labor costs and ours continues to have a small positive spread. But when you add the two of them together it comes out to 3/4 of a point difference on the high side in our forecast. In 1990, for whatever weight one wants to put on a 1990 forecast, there's a fairly sharp difference between the Board staff's forecast and ours. We don't have as much of a slowdown in domestic demand as they do. And we have the external adjustment process essentially flattening out and indeed deteriorating a little. So there's a quite a sharp difference in 1990. I don't put any more weight on those forecasts than Ted Truman does, but to get back to the point the Chairman raised earlier-- whether you take the staff's forecast or our forecast for '89 and '90 on the external side--both imply an increase in United States net external liabilities in balance sheet terms of about $275 billion for the two years combined. And I must say as an intermediate- or medium-term policy problem I am getting more and more concerned about the implications of anything even resembling that kind of a result for the two years running. With regard to the near-term growth prospects in the economy, my sense of things, Mr. Chairman, is that under the best of circumstances the near-term inflation numbers are going to be bad. And if the economy is simply pausing rather than trending down they could be terrible. So an awful lot does ride on the question of how much weight one should give to these signs, however tentative or firm one may think they are, as to the near-term course of the economy. Just one last point on the price side: Mike and Ted talked a fair bit about oil prices and Governor Angell will probably talk a bit about commodity prices. But one thing I did notice in looking at commodities is that stocks of a very wide range of agricultural and industrial crude materials are at quite low levels right now. I'd simply observe that if we don't get some rain in some parts of the country pretty soon that could further complicate the near-term outlook on the price front. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198903	275	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer, why don't you start off by telling us about rain in your area? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	276	MELZER	 It's not a problem; we even had a foot of snow three weeks ago. I think Roger might have something to say about that. In terms of the District numbers, the most recent reported activity is very strong both relative to what we've been seeing lately and also compared to the national numbers. In general, the more recent anecdotal information would tend to confirm that. The general sense I get is that orders are growing, albeit at a slower pace, and that there is some weakness in the consumer area but the commercial area is still quite strong. In particular, we're seeing strong manufacturing employment growth and the industries that you see there are transportation, textiles, food products, and chemicals. On the transportation side--just picking up on what Bob Parry said--a fellow from mentioned to us the other day that they have a five-year order backlog in commercial aircraft and I think half of  their workforce has about an average of one year's experience on those particular assembly lines. He did go on to say that the order backlog includes options--I think they call them reservations--so that some of that could fall away. On the textile side, where we've seen some strength as well, a textile manufacturer who had just returned from the Far East mentioned that, looking at Korea for example, between what's happened to their currency and wage rates domestically in Korea they're looking at cost increases of 25 percent in manufacturing there. And to a lesser extent that's happening in Hong Kong and Taiwan. So, in particular types of products the United States is much more competitive. In terms of other insights of an anecdotal nature, the general sense I get is that people--whether they are in a commercial business or even in a consumer business--really feel that they are under a great deal of margin pressure. Raw material prices are up a lot, as somebody said, over the last year. I think the increases have slowed down recently. There is some sense of potentially growing wage pressures. And certainly in businesses where they're selling to original equipment manufacturers there is still a great deal of difficulty passing along price increases. But they will try to work both ends of the costs savings, passing along increases where they can. In terms of growth in orders, clearly the sense I got is that [the rate of] growth has slowed down in the last couple of months but orders are still growing. I've heard of no cancellations as yet, but reading between the lines I sense a little anxiety about the possibility of cancellations. In a similar vein on receivables, one consumer products company mentioned that they are really taking a very close look at their receivables, which have been growing; and they noted that now 20 percent of the companies they sell to have been involved in LBOs. So, they view the quality of their receivables as really quite low and they are looking at that carefully. On the national front, my observation would be--just going back a month ago--that our forecast in terms of the result was very close to the Board staff's but it presumed roughly 4 percent Ml growth over the forecast period. Clearly, to the extent that we have very low money growth, people who prepare [our forecast] have become increasingly concerned about whether or not things are going to work that way. In a sense that leads me to a bit of concern, to the extent that in our discussions here we tend to focus on current inputs and whether or not we see weakness and how we try to trade that off against price pressures. In a sense I think there's a trap in that process in that it doesn't really take into account some of the inherent lags in policy. By the time we see the weakness it could be too late; and when we do see the weakness we probably will continue to see price pressure. What do we do then? If you look back to the discount rate increase, to some extent the market in effect demanded that, in my view. I'm not saying we wouldn't have done it anyway, but in a sense I don't think we had a choice because the perceptions out there were basically that we were going to respond to these short-term inputs. So, I think at some point we have to introduce into the dialogue something else to look at that can be a guide. In general, I would just urge that we not ignore what's going on with the aggregates. We all know we set a target on M2 and we know where that stands: it's a little below the lower end of the cone. I'm sure you  all recall my proposal for a [monetary] base growth constraint. In the fourth quarter that grew at less than 5 percent, which is what I suggested as a lower bound; this quarter it's probably right around 5 percent. I took a look at reserves and I was interested in what I found there. If you go back to '79 we've only had two quarters over that entire period of negative reserve growth: one was the fourth quarter of '88; the other was the third quarter of '87. And as you know from the Bluebook, we're putting together a second back-to-back quarter of negative reserve growth of fairly substantial proportions. In any case, I just think that as we contemplate policy actions we have to consider not only what's going on in the economy currently but also some gauge of the thrust of our actions and the lagged impacts they are going to have. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198903	277	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	278	SYRON	" Well, maybe it's because I'm sitting next to Bob, but the New England economy sort of performs inversely to Texas. I'm not sure whether there's any causal relationship. Contemporaneous measures of the region's economy are very strong: an unemployment rate of 3.2 percent; personal income still growing at faster than the national level. But if one looks a little beyond that, particularly using anecdotal information from talking to people, there are certainly signs of a number of areas where there are problems. Manufacturing employment has been declining in absolute terms for some substantial period of time. There was some mention of the computer industry on a national basis; that's reflected to an even greater extent in New England. One of largest employers, Digital Equipment Corporation, had a very major decline in its stock price last week that reflected some problems they had in earnings. Consistent with that, we're seeing that wage pressures are still pretty strong at the unskilled end of the labor market. At the skilled end of the labor market pressures seem to be abating somewhat from what has happened in the past. But going beyond that there is a variety of things that I think are going to lead to some further relative slowing in the New England economy. We have serious tax problems in three of the six states that account for about 80 percent of the population and 80 percent of the economic activity in the District. There are incipient problems in the banking sector. Delinquencies have risen. Actually, it's the ultimate in anecdotal information, but in last Sunday's papers we had three pages of ads for single-family houses, which is unusual for us. Granted, they were big ads so they end up taking a lot of space. But interestingly, particularly in the housing area, I think what's driving it is not rates so much as this realization that people are no longer going to buy a house at $600,000 and then two years later turn around and sell it for $800,000. That's what we were talking about before--Bob Parry's point that people are buying shelter. I would maintain that much of what's going on in New England does not really reflect monetary policy or overall constraints in the national economy. It's sort of supply constrained and relative costs have gotten so high in the District; and actually, it's a very small District in terms of its weight nationally. In terms of the national economy, we too don't differ very much--hardly at all--[with the Greenbook forecast]. I have some slight difference with the unemployment path of the staff forecast and agree very much with the tone of the comments that Mike Prell made this morning. However, I find those projections somewhat  disconcerting--not in the sense that we don't agree with them but that they imply that we have a very difficult situation before us in that we know inflationary pressures are there. It seems to me there isn't much question about that, regardless of what we do right now. And while there have been some--to be different I'll use the word ""reeds""- -in the wind of a possible slowdown, I don't think we've seen any broad signs. We have certainly seen substantial increases in personal income; we don't know how that's going to be reflected later on. There really isn't any convincing evidence of a substantial slowdown, so we are rather dependent on a forecast for that. And the Greenbook forecast--which I'll say again we have very little problem with-- shows, even taking out the drought in the second quarter, fairly strong rates of growth. There was discussion about what the natural rate is. I think that we're in a difficult position where if one does believe that the risks are not symmetrical, the risks would lead one to want to be more conservative. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
198903	279	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	280	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to the District economy, it continues to improve albeit at a rate somewhat slower than the national rate of growth. The strength comes largely from the agricultural and manufacturing sectors whereas the weakness is where it has been in the past couple of years--in the energy and construction areas . There is an event that I think is worth noting that somebody spoke of a moment ago, and that's the drought. That will affect portions of the Tenth District, largely an area from about the plains in Kansas to the northeast through Kansas, northern Missouri, and portions of southeastern Iowa and western Illinois. If we do not get rain, some generous spring rains, fairly soon the agricultural situation will be fairly grim. For example, in Kansas about 3/4 of the wheat crop is now estimated to be either poor or very poor, which are two of the lowest categories of estimates of that particular hard winter wheat crop. The one event that was frightening occurred about two weeks ago--and I suspect most of you know this-- when there was a dust storm that was created by 50-60 mile per hour winds that actually darkened the sun in midafternoon in Kansas City. In fact, there were some street lights that came on. I happen to be old enough to remember the 1930's dust storms and this was very reminiscent of that. It happened to be [only] one day; nonetheless, if there is no rain through that belt that I just described I think we will have very serious problems. The estimate of food prices, for example, might be way off. Beyond that, there is strength in the manufacturing sector, and I'm thinking primarily of general aviation. Auto production, up until a couple of weeks ago at least, was going full bore with auto plants operating at two full shifts. That would appear to be slowing now; I don't know what's going to happen in the future but there is a very large inventory, as you know, of unsold autos. The energy sector shows little or no improvement. As a matter of fact, it continues to decrease in terms of exploration activity. It has always been thought that a price around $17 a barrel would regenerate the interest in exploration; but the uncertainties about OPEC and what may happen to oil prices simply are keeping those individuals out of that particular activity and the number of active rigs that are drilling continues to decrease. With regard to the national outlook, there is no real difference between the staff forecast and our own for the horizon of  the forecast with the exception that we're a bit stronger on both growth and prices. In fact, there is some encouraging evidence that has already been cited with respect to a slowdown. But it isn't very convincing, at least yet. I think we still have to wait for some additional information on that. In our forecast, we'd put the risks on the high side rather than the low side, with rather a bit stronger growth and stronger prices. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198903	281	HOSKINS	 The Fourth District really hasn't changed much over the last year and a half that I've been talking to you about it. It's very difficult to pick up any signs that we have a slowing in the area, either through casual observations, talking with people, or trying to ferret through the data. What we did this time was to talk to a few capital goods producers, which includes firms like Westinghouse and Eaton Corp., and several other basic capital goods producers, to try to get a handle on whether or not they see any change in attitudes among the people they supply. And the answer to the question is simply no. Any weakness that you perhaps see in computers or office equipment is being offset, at least in the District, in very traditional capital goods. The most optimistic person was a guy in the capital goods industry who estimates real [growth] for this year at 6 percent, fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter. It's very difficult to find any signs of weakness in that. Now, to some extent I'm a little surprised that we didn't find more price pressures developing than we did. They all expect to be able to move prices up in the coming year but they haven't moved aggressively as of yet generally. Order books are still good and lead times are in most cases lengthening rather than shortening. So the picture for capital goods expenditures--at least what the producers in our District think--is that the outlook for them is quite bright this year, with really very few concerns about a slowing economy. One or two raised a concern about that but they hadn't altered their plans for production. In terms of the Greenbook forecast and the outlook nationally, as usual I am chagrined that, to some extent, again we are pushing back another year any decline we are going to see in the inflation rate. But that has been a continual concern. I haven't seen us making a lot of progress in the last year and a half. I agree very much with the comments made by Tom Melzer that we have done some things that are unusual. One is the growth in total reserves. Maybe Don can talk about that a little later; I don't know exactly what it means. I know that it comes from interest-sensitive asset flows being shifted around. But it seems to me if it's something that we ought not be concerned about at least we should question whether or not there's some significance to it in terms of the outlook. The lag problem is always with us. I presume Mike has built that into the forecast. Now, I have no confidence that any other forecast is better than this one. So, my concerns are the same as his--well, I don't want to speak for him. I view the errors as likely to be on the high side in terms of inflation rather than on the low side. I'll save the rest of it for the policy go-around. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198903	282	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	283	JOHNSON	 I don't really have much to add. We got a rash of weaker indicators for the month of February, where almost across the board all of the data suggested a weakening. But we don't know  whether that is weather-related or not because of the strong data for January. There certainly are some signs of slowing. I agree it's too early to assess whether things are significantly slowing or whether this is establishing some sort of trend. Real personal consumption expenditures seem to have been on a modest track for more than just one month and the order books on capital goods seem to have been moving at a moderate pace for several months now. So, I think those are promising signs. But I don't think there are any indications of things going overboard on the weak side. Or, at least if they are starting to slow down quite a bit, we'only have one month's observation. It's too early to make any judgment one way or the other on that. I think the inflation news recently has been disappointing; but at the same time we knew these lags were built in. Those forces were set in place long ago and we've got to look forward. So the question is whether we have put in place strong enough policy that, with a lag, we're going to get the results we're looking for. That's the key question. I don't think anyone knows this for sure; but we have moved quite significantly over the last intermeeting period and we will just have to see. Economically, I think we are in an uncertain period. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198903	284	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	285	ANGELL	 My sense is that consumer spending in the United States is rather gradually coming into line with what needs to happen. Maybe some of this is interest-rate induced; maybe some of it is demographics; maybe some of it is actually the impact of higher prices and higher interest rates on budgets. In many ways that looks like a 1 to 2 percent growth rate of consumption, which seems to me is exactly what we would like to see happen. And it seems to me that this happens in an environment that's not very prone to a recession. When I look at inventories and at the factors that ordinarily lead to recession I just do not see the economy going into recession in the foreseeable future, and I guess that would take us through the first quarter of 1990. I recognize it's a narrow path to have this slowdown in consumer spending without overshooting and getting a recession out of it. But it does seem to me that that's still a possibility. Hindsight, it seems to me, would say that some of us who watch commodity prices didn't say as much about it as we should have said, but there is a clear indication that year-over-year rates of change in commodity prices have been moderating. But they have been plateauing in a very, very slow manner. Of course, we had the November-December spike in which the world food situation began to be somewhat more clear to the people that follow it. We saw food and fiber prices [rise] in November and December. We've had a year-over-year increase of 42 percent in the price of wheat; the price of wheat is almost 80 percent of its high, which occurred back in 1974. And that's a price that really is very conducive to increased production worldwide. The weather situation is, of course, a very clear one; and it gets interpreted into those commodity prices very, very rapidly. I suppose some things could go wrong but I guess I'm comforted, Tom, by the 2 percent M2 number. Given the price pressures that are there, I couldn't be more satisfied with any M2 growth that I can think of than what we're getting. I suppose it does run some risk of being that close to the precipice. But I think it would be riskier still if we were going along with growth of M2 at a much more rapid pace.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198903	286	GREENSPAN	 Any other Governors wish to add anything? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	287	HELLER	 I think the general reluctance, Mr. Chairman, is indicative of the fact that we all like where we have been and we don't like where we are going. Maybe Mike Prell said it best when he said we're in danger of overshooting the runway and when you overshoot the runway you tend to get stuck in the mud or something. So, with regard to the general picture of the economy that's unfolding here, I'm not particularly fond of the declining investment activity, which doesn't build additional capacity nor of the export picture not being as good as it could be, although we continue to make progress. I see the export picture mainly as a problem of different regions in the world economy and relative exchange rates rather than our absolute exchange rate levels towards Europe. We are in an approximate balance now or actually are running very, very small surpluses, but [not] toward Japan and Korea; obviously that's where the problems are located. And I'm not sure that exchange rate changes are the right way to go at that particular problem. So it isn't going to be very pleasant. But it's all we've got, right? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0

198903	293	GREENSPAN	 Which was my opening refrain to Don Kohn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198903	294	KOHN	" Well, they're in a lot of trouble! In my briefing I will be referring to the package of charts  labelled ""financial indicators"". As background for Committee discussion  of policy options today, the charts show information on recent movements  in various measures of interest rates, money supply, and other financial  variables that might provide evidence on the current stance of policy and  its possible effects on the economy. Before beginning it might be well to  review some caveats on the use of these measures. First, the interpretation of many of them depend on unobservable variables especially market  expectations for prices, the economy, and monetary policy. Moreover, to  understand how they may affect the economy, a number of these measures  need to be related to long-run equilibrium values, which themselves are  not directly observable and also may be shifting over time in response  varying spending propensities and to the evolving structure of the economy  and financial markets. Finally, caution in interpreting financial market  developments would seem to be called for by the tendency for prices in  these markets to vary by more than would seem to be explainable by underlying forces.  With these caveats in mind, the first chart depicts movements in  the yield curve, defined in the top panel by the difference between the  the rates on 30-year Treasury bonds and federal funds. Despite substantial increases in bond yields over the intermeeting period, the rise in  the federal funds rate was even larger, further inverting this measure of  yield curve slope. The interpretation of the yield curve is especially  difficult, since the implications of particular configurations may depend  on whether they are seen as signalling expected changes in real interest  rates or inflation premiums and on the extent to which such expectations  stem from anticipated spending behavior or monetary policy actions.  Further complicating the process is the need to take account of possibly  varying term or liquidity premiums.  Nonetheless, two aspects of the current yield curve seem noteworthy. First, as can be seen in the lower panel, the yield curve retains a  positive slope out to about two years, which did not narrow materially  with the recent firming of policy. The incoming data appear to have  caused market participants to revise upward their estimate of how high  nominal rates will need to go before pressures in the economy and prices  will ease sufficiently to allow rates to drop again. Second, as is evident in the upper panel, the current limited downward slope in the overall  yield curve has not in the past been a precursor of a downturn in the  economy. Indeed, another point or so increase in short-term rates, as  assumed in the staff forecast, even if it were not accompanied by much  rise in long-term rates, would still seem to leave this indicator pointing  more toward a slowing in the economic expansion than to a recession, at  least judging from the pattern from the 1960s on.  The relatively mild signals about the expected impact of the  current stance of policy given by the yield curve are echoed in a number  of other measures that might be sensitive to changes in real interest  rates and other policy variables. Commodity prices, shown in the next  chart, have risen on balance over the period of tightening since last  spring, and have shown no clear cut tendency to ease off after the most  recent round of firming. Such a pattern is not consistent with a high  level of real interest rates that made holding commodities relatively  expensive and that might threaten the expansion. Stock prices, the top  panel of the next chart, also have continued to advance until recently.  Upward revisions to expected profits apparently have more than kept pace  with increases in discount factors. Firmness in the dollar over the past  year, the bottom panel, is consistent with a rise in real interest rates  in the United States relative to those abroad. However, some of the relative movement may reflect declines in expected real rates abroad, especially recently when several monetary authorities surprised market participants with decisions not to tighten.  More direct measures of real interest rates in the United States  are shown in the next several charts. The first updates the calculations  of one-year real rates presented to the Committee in December, using a  variety of price and survey data to proxy inflation expectations. Because  inflation and near-term inflationary expectations have strengthened  appreciably since late last year, the rise in real rates since December  has been considerably less than the rise in nominal rates. Nonetheless,  as can be seen most clearly in the lower two panels, these rates have  risen substantially from their lows of late 1986 or early 1988, although  remaining below the levels that apparently slowed demand in 1984.  One measure of the recent increase in near-term inflation expectations is given in the first column of the upper panel of the next chart.  The February survey, which was done after release of the January PPI but  before that for February, shows a half-point pickup in one-year ahead  inflation expectations since November to a rate 1 full point higher than a  year ago. Longer-term inflation expectations have tended to trend downward, however, so that real Treasury bond yields, the lower panel, have  risen, despite little net movement in nominal rates. Like the one-year  real rate, the 10-year remains below earlier peaks.  The 10-year inflation expectations were also used to derive a  real rate on A-rated corporate bonds, shown in the next chart. The less  pronounced upward drift in this measure over the last year partly reflects  a narrowing of the spread between corporate and Treasury bonds, which had  widened immediately after the stock market crash. The last plot in this  chart, given by the ""X"", is an estimate for the most recent week of around  5-1/2 percent, again, using February expectations.  The next chart relates this measure of the real rate to changes  in inflation. The underlying hypothesis is that there is some level of  real interest rates consistent with inflation neither accelerating nor  decelerating, and that this level has not changed significantly since the  late 1970s. The regression plotted in the chart suggests that the real  corporate bond rate is in the neighborhood of this equilibrium value.  Behind this relationship lie two others. One is between the  level of the long-term real rate and the level of output relative to the  economy's potential. The other is between this so-called output gap and  changes in inflation. The statistical work and recent price data suggest  that the economy has moved above its potential, defined as the level of  output consistent with nonaccelerating inflation. If so, and if real  rates are around equilibrium levels, with no further change in real rates  output growth will decelerate and unemployment and capacity utilization  rates will soften to bring the economy into alignment with its potential.  The inflation rate will tend to level off when the gap is closed, but not  to decline from the higher levels reached in the interim. This implies a  transition period of weaker economic performance and higher inflation if  indeed we have moved beyond the long-run potential of the economy. An  additional complication for policy could occur if evolving inflation rates  proved higher than now anticipated by the market and inflation expectations were revised upward. This would imply a possible need for further  increases in nominal interest rates to keep inflation from re-accelerating, even if economic expansion were temporarily weak.  The rise in nominal interest rates has had a substantial effect  on another key financial indicator, the money supply. As can be seen in  the next chart, growth of M2 on a four-quarter moving average basis has  been between 4 and 5-1/2 percent for more than two years. Money growth  over the entire period since the business cycle trough has been somewhat  atypical. The bulge in money growth early in the expansion was much  smaller and shorter-lived than usual, especially if one takes account of  the fact that some of the observed M2 acceleration in 1983 was a result of  deregulation, and is not mirrored in M3. And the more recent slowing has  not been followed by a cycle peak, within the lag length established  before several other turning points. The deviation from past patterns  linking changes in money growth and income may be a result of a relatively  cautious monetary policy through this period: that is, the experience of  recent years is an important aspect of the Federal Reserve ""staying ahead  of the curve"". Policy has tightened in advance to head off prospective  inflation, even as early as the second year of expansion. As a conse-.  quence, especially in recent years, the demands for money generated by  strength in nominal income and spending have been more than offset by the  effects of rising market interest rates and opportunity costs. If policy  had been more sluggish, both stronger nominal income and a reduced interest rate effect would have boosted money supply growth considerably.  Whether the relatively moderate money growth of recent years  already presages reduced inflation pressures is difficult to determine.  One tool for making such a judgment is the p-star model, shown in the last  chart. That calculation still shows equilibrium prices very slightly  above actual prices in the first quarter. Thus this measure, like some of  the other financial indicators, gives the impression that monetary policy  may have tightened about enough to stop the acceleration of inflation, but  may not yet be tight enough to reduce the inflation rate. Under the  staff projection of M2 growth for the year of only about 3-1/4 percent,  money growth in this model would not have yet created the conditions leading to a slower rate of inflation until the second half of this year.  That projection, of course, assumes the further rise in interest rates in  the greenbook forecast.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, a few words about very recent and prospective money growth. The slow money growth of the first quarter needs to be  interpreted with particular care because it probably was affected by the  thrift situation. Deposits at S&Ls have been very weak, reflecting both  administrative pressure to restrain offering rates and depositor flight.  The former has held down M2 by contributing to wider opportunity costs.  Many of the deposits leaving thrifts out of general concern undoubtedly  have been channelled into banks and money market funds, remaining in M2.  But some probably has found its way into market instruments, especially  Treasury securities judging from the volume of noncompetitive tenders,  which has been larger than might be expected from rate relationships  alone. On the M3 level, substitution of FHLB advances for deposits at  thrifts and weakness in thrift asset expansion* probably held down the  growth of this aggregate as well. Thrift difficulties could have an impact on the economy if they were to interfere in some basic way with the  flow of credit services. We do not expect this to occur, given the competitive situation among depository institutions and the development of  secondary mortgage markets. Weakness in M2 or M3 growth from the thrift  troubles would not itself be an indicator of adverse consequences for the  economy. Rather it should be viewed as a downward shift in money demand  relative to income or spending, or an upward shift in velocity. The extent of this shift is impossible to quantify with much confidence. For  the first quarter it likely is worth perhaps as much as a percentage point  of M2 and M3 growth, judging from model results, noncompetitive tenders.  and FHLB advances. But these modest effects may appear to take on added  importance when the broad aggregates are close to or a little below the  lower ends of their growth cones.  Looking ahead, the bluebook money paths incorporate some continuing weakness at thrifts feeding through to the aggregates, but less so  than in the first quarter. Partly for this reason, even under alternative  C, growth in M2 and M3 for the next three months is expected to exceed the  rate of expansion for the last three months. Nonetheless, reflecting the  lagged effects of the recent increases in market interest rates, any pickup in money growth is likely to be fairly limited, leaving the aggregates  by June well down in or a little below the lower ends of their growth  cones.

198903	295	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Let me quickly ask on Chart 7: I assume that you're not repeating before 1978 because that's when the whole survey started. Or is it because other proxies don't give you as good a correlation with the very present? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	296	KOHN	 Yes, I think it's sort of suspicious too. This chart is plotted from 1978 because that's when the 10-year Hoey survey started. We have done some other experiments using, for example, 1-year rates with 1-year inflation expectations. They tend to get very poor results in the 1960s and somewhat better results in the 1970s and 1980s. They also suggest that there have been changes in the natural real rate, which was a little higher in the 1960s, a little lower in the 1970s and much higher in the 1980s. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	297	GREENSPAN	 Any questions?  	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	298	JOHNSON	 Just one. On the Hoey survey, was that last survey taken before or after our discount rate [action]? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198903	299	KOHN	 I don't know. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	300	JOHNSON	 It's a February survey number. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198903	301	KOHN	 Yes, it was the last half of February, but I don't know the exact date. I know it was after that first PPI number and before the second; that I checked on. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	302	JOHNSON	 Okay. That's all I need. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198903	303	KEEHN	 Don, maybe you answered this, but in the cool light of hindsight has the Hoey survey had a reasonable degree of accuracy? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	35.0
198903	304	KOHN	 Well, I don't know. I'm not familiar with-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	305	PRELL	 It only had one observation in 10 years. You'd have to look back. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	306	KEEHN	 Well, on the shorter? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	35.0
198903	307	KOHN	 I don't know, President Keehn. I haven't seen a study which tends to do that. Generally, these market expectation studies don't show that the market does a very good job of [predicting] what's going to come. But also, I look at it not as a way to see if the market may in some sense be more accurate than someone else, but rather as giving us some clue as to what's going through people's minds, whether it's accurate or not. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	308	GREENSPAN	" Questions for Don? If not, let's move on to a discussion of policy. I'd like to start off by saying that the [outlook for the] economy is generally uncertain, a view I assume a lot of us share. My own impression is that the odds are that what we're going through now is more likely to be a pause rather than the beginning of a downturn. But the odds are less, I think, than they were in earlier stages in this particular cycle, if for no other reason than that we are at much higher levels of activity and the probabilities that the economy will eventually tip over obviously are linked to how long the expansion has been going on, even if age per se does not necessarily throw us over. But there are signs that orders are a little shabby. Basically, with the dollar very strong and with the money supply growth factor rather modest--even though the odds in my judgment are somewhat better than 50/50 that we will probably have to tighten again before this cycle is over--this strikes me as probably a good time to pause and see what effects our actions to date have. That would lead me to come out for ""B"" asymmetrical towards tightness. Governor Johnson. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	309	JOHNSON	 I'd just follow up on that, Mr. Chairman. That's pretty much the way I see it. As I said in my statement just before the coffee break, I think there are certainly some signs of slowing but not enough to feel that a clear trend has been established, although I think we have enough observations on new orders and in the real consumption area to suspect that things are at least slowing or moderating. Whether that will be sufficient is  certainly not clear at this stage. But, given the fact that we have just recently moved fairly significantly on policy, I think we at least ought to wait a while to see how those lags work out. I think it's probably still true that the risks are somewhat asymmetric, so I can certainly go along with an asymmetric policy position in terms of our pause. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198903	310	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	311	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I agree with your view in regard to a pause, so I would go with alternative B also. I have a slight preference for being symmetric but not for operational reasons. It's simply that I believe if we are symmetric and we need to take that next step--and I think there is at least a 50/50 chance that that's the case--we can do it with symmetric language. But if it happens that we don't need to take that move, we just look a little wiser by hindsight. I don't know whether that impresses anyone or not. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198903	312	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	313	PARRY	" Mr. Chairman, I have a request for clarification. In the Bluebook it's stated that alternative B would assume roughly a continuation of 9-3/4 percent [on the funds rate] and that money market rates might tend to decline a bit if that indeed is where we came out. It seems to me in terms of maintaining the existing degree of restraint in financial markets that the market is probably thinking more about 10 percent. Could I interpret support of ""B"" as being an operation which would cause money market rates to remain at roughly their current levels? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198903	314	GREENSPAN	 I would think so. My own impression is that it's much too soon to allow the markets to get any signals, erroneous or otherwise, that we're backing off. That would strike me as a very inopportune signal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	315	PARRY	 So that could be consistent with a slightly firmer funds rate? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198903	316	GREENSPAN	 I would think so. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	317	PARRY	 Okay. Well, in that case I certainly would favor alternative B and asymmetric language at the present time. However, if further signs of slowing do not become more convincing in the next several weeks, I would certainly recommend that we consider moving to alternative C promptly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198903	318	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	319	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I favor holding policy steady over the period ahead, for a period of the next few weeks anyway. My hunch is the same as the one that's there [in the forecast] and also the one you made in assuming that some further increase in the funds rate is probably going to be needed later on to keep inflationary pressures and expectations from building up over the months ahead. So, I would want the directive to be asymmetrical. But I think it's also possible that we've done enough, particularly in looking at the behavior of M2 and how that has decelerated. I realize a lot of that stems from how opportunity costs of holding M2 [have changed] just recently; but if  you look at the last two years M2 growth is still down to 4.7 percent from many years at a trend rate of about 8.9 percent. That is one whale of a lot of deceleration over that period. That leads me to be more sanguine about what might happen to inflation than I would be in the absence of that decided deceleration in M2. So, I would go with ""B,"" at least until we have more information on the March figures; I'd watch those closely because I may well be wrong on that. Certainly, the current statistics do not reflect anything that would suggest that we ought not tighten more. You've got to look way back at what has been put in train, guess about those lagged effects, and reach the conclusion that now is the time to pause. And that's really where I think the focus ought to be right now. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198903	320	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	321	CORRIGAN	" Well, as you know Mr. Chairman, I blow hot and cold on this, to put it mildly. I probably have changed my mind about what is the right thing to do about once every hour for the past two weeks. I clearly think that we've got to maintain a tilt toward firmness; indeed, I think my preference would actually be to come out somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"" right now. Let me just elaborate on two basic reasons as to why that's where my preference lies. The first is, as I've said before, that it seems to me we have a period immediately in front of us just about baked in the cake in which the price statistics are going to tend to be on the bad side. I think that's kind of locked in. By ""bad"" I don't mean anything like those January-February PPI numbers but something in the range of 5 percent or higher. Again, if our forecast and our hunches about soft landings prove to be right then we could get lucky. On the other hand, if our forecast and hunches about soft landings are wrong and we have a pause rather than a slowdown then I think we have real trouble, which is another way of saying that I still think the risks are distinctly asymmetric. I have another concern that reinforces my tilt [preference]. And that is, notwithstanding Don Kohn's Chart 7--which I agree is pretty impressive to look at--I still worry that the changes in the financial system and structure may well have produced a situation in which it takes a higher level of both nominal and real interest rates to get the same degree of restraint that might have been associated with that nice neat relationship in Chart 7. And that leads me to a couple of things. First of all, as we look around right now there is no evidence that I can see of any credit availability problems. There's plenty of credit there. That shouldn't surprise us, given all the structural changes in the financial system and so on. But what it means, of course--and Ted Truman touched on this--is that one way or another restraint has to come through price effects. Price effects either mean the exchange rate--and if they are the exchange rate that complicates immensely that medium-term problem I spoke of earlier this morning--or they have to be one way or another through interest rates. But what I'm not so sure about is how much we know today about the way the interest mechanism itself works. For example, take the consumer sector: it's unambiguously clear that rising interest rates have a net positive impact on personal income even after you take account of floating rate mortgages and home equity loans. Now, that itself doesn't tell you too much; you then have to make a lot of judgments about relative propensities to consume. But it's unambiguous in terms of its cash flow effect on the consumer sector as a whole.  "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198903	322	GREENSPAN	 But adjustable rate mortgages are only 25 percent of total mortgages. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	323	CORRIGAN	" That's true. That's what they are right now. But on the other hand, the business sector clearly is hurt more in cash flow terms by rising interest rates than it once was. And we get the anomalous effect that at least in cash flow terms the effects of rising interest rates are more of a problem in the place where we need spending activity rather than in the consumer sector where it should go the other way. Just as another illustration of this financial engineering, we're now all familiar with the swap market but we now have emerging markets in interest rate caps, collars, and floors. And this market, which is only a couple of years old, we know to be $300 billion in size and we think it is probably $500 billion in size. This market didn't even exist three years ago! And as a reflection of the way that market has been working in recent months, the open interest in Euro-dollar futures contracts in Chicago is now up to $760 billion. Now, I just don't know myself how all these things interact in terms of the way monetary restraint works itself into the system by interest rate channels. But my hunch is that, if anything, it probably works to slow it down rather than speed it up. And that's the second reason why I have that tilt. Having said that my preference would lie between ""B"" and ""C"" right now, I guess I can go along with your formulation in the spirit of Bob Parry's earlier comments. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198903	324	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	325	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I would be in favor of your recommendation, namely, alternative B. But at this point I certainly would continue to favor asymmetric language. Not to go further into the operational aspects of it but, if the market's perception is that the fed funds rate target is, say, 9-3/4 or 9-7/8 percent, it does seem to me that we are in a period in which there may be natural upward pressure on that rate. I wouldn't resist it if the rate were moving up to 9-7/8 or 10 percent, whereas I would resist it if, in fact, the rate began to trend downward. So, I'd have a clear bias toward allowing the rate to go up. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198903	326	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	327	STERN	" Well, Si Keehn and Bob Parry have already pretty much emphasized what I would want to point out. That is, I'm afraid that market participants believe we are targeting the federal funds rate closely at this juncture. So, while I favor ""B"" I think it's important, as we pause in the process of tightening here, that we make sure we pause at the right place and don't give the market a signal that we are in some sense backing off. That's all I would add. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198903	328	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	329	HELLER	" I think President Black gave my speech; I'm for ""B,"" asymmetric. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198903	330	BLACK	 Both? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198903	331	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	332	KELLEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm sensing that the theme of this conversation is that it's time for a pause, and I certainly share that'. Consequently, I can comfortably support your suggestion. But I would like to repeat what Governor Johnson said a little earlier when we were touching on the matter of lags, and that is: Have we put into place already enough [restraint] that will get us what we want? It's in that sense that at this moment I'm in no hurry to tighten. While I would agree that we certainly don't want to be perceived as backing off in any way--that caveat having been given--I really personally would prefer symmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198903	333	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	334	SEGER	" My preference is for no change, which I guess is ""B"" with symmetric language. As has been said by a number of people, we have had a substantial tightening over the last 12 months or so; interest rates have risen rather dramatically. Because of these known lags, much of that tightening has yet to be felt by the economy. Also, as Manley said, there have been some signs of slowing. I personally would argue that there's going to be some more coming, particularly in housing and in the auto industry. I haven't heard it mentioned but I think that the thrift situation is something we should be aware of, if for no other reason than we could easily do something that would make the cost of the bailout quite a bit higher. Also, despite the Brady plan, I don't believe we've solved the third world debt problem; maybe it's coming but I don't think it has been done. Too much additional tightening, I think, could negatively impact those third world nations. Finally, I'm very concerned about the dollar perhaps not performing as Ted and his people think it will--that it will stay strong and that that will prevent this export expansion that we all want which, in turn, will make it even more difficult to narrow our trade deficit. So, for all those reasons I would prefer to sit tight and have symmetrical language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198903	335	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	336	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that a somewhat firmer policy at the moment would be appropriate. My judgment is that we are, in fact, experiencing a pause and not a sustained downturn in the economy. But even if it is not a pause, even if we are seeing some real slowing, I think the risks of recession with a firmer policy are minimal. The Greenbook forecast, with which I agree, is predicated upon some tightening beginning in the second quarter--some tightening from where we are at the moment--and that does not produce a recession in 1990. Moreover, it does not produce any great improvement in the inflation rate. So, not only do I think that we don't need to back off, I think we need to continue our pressure on reserves in order to stay ahead of this inflation curve. We ought to go ahead and do the job now and make a tightening move. I wouldn't do it to any great degree but I think a funds rate around 10 percent, or whatever the equivalent borrowing is, would be appropriate. My preference would be to move now by some small degree. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198903	337	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	338	LAWARE	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I can't remember when I was more concerned about the confusion of the signals that I'm reading or as uncertain about my own conclusions. But I guess I feel  that the economy is a lot mushier and that there are more risks inherent in it than most of you around the table do. I'm kind of like the guy who's gone into the saloon to play poker and is willing to check his sixgun at the door and accept the key as the alternative. But I'd like to keep a derringer in my watch pocket. So, I'm in favor of the asymmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198903	339	GREENSPAN	" So that's ""B,"" asymmetric? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	340	LAWARE	 Yes, sir. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
198903	341	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	342	MELZER	" My preference would be for ""B,"" symmetric. I can certainly live with what you suggested, Mr. Chairman. The other point I would make, consistent with what I was saying earlier, is that I'd be a little concerned if we reacted to a single number in the intermeeting period. It may be that the markets force our hand and we have to do that. But I think there's going to come a time when--and I don't know how this will be achieved--there will have to be something else on the table so that when we decide it's right to start moving, the markets aren't sitting there saying, well, where's the Fed. With respect to the M2 ranges, I don't know whether we have confidence over a long period of time that if we stick with the lower end of the ranges that that's going to contain inflationary pressures. I just think at some point we've got to get out of this mode of the expectation that if a bad number comes out, boom, the Fed ought to be there doing something right then. And if we are not, all the markets [unintelligible]. That's a very difficult thing to deal with but it does trouble me. And, in my judgment, just not moving in response to a number won't solve that. But I think we're getting to a point that we ought to be worried about trying to break that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198903	343	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	344	HOSKINS	 We think that more tightening probably is going to have to take place this year. I'm not terribly concerned about the timing, provided that when we do--to reinforce Tom's point again--that we take a very credible action and to some extent lead market expectations at that point. We take those actions and we explain them; we tell them what we're doing. So, I'm comfortable waiting for a while. But I am disturbed. Again, many of us have spoken out about price stability; yet as we look at the forecast, we're starting 1991 with roughly the same rate that we have right now. I think that's a concern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198903	345	GREENSPAN	 The truth of the matter is that none of us has a clue as to what the price level will be in the fourth quarter of 1990. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	346	CORRIGAN	 That's for sure. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198903	347	GREENSPAN	 The fact that it's in the forecast I don't think [is important]. However, I think the issue that you raise is. But I wouldn't state it as unequivocally as you state it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	348	HOSKINS	 Well, I think we have to look into the future since, presumably, the lags are 18 months to 2 years or perhaps  longer. And I don't know what else to look at. If that's not our objective then I think we probably ought to talk about it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198903	349	GREENSPAN	 No, I think it is our objective. But when you look out in these forecast numbers--. You've done your models and I've done my model; I would hate to go back and have anyone look at our historical forecasts in this area. That's the reason why I think the money supply issue is so crucial. I agree that if we can hold the money supply growth down, just keep it there persistently, I think we'll win this one. President Syron. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	350	SYRON	" I personally would be more comfortable with something closer to ""C"" than ""B"" because I think we are probably going to have to tighten at some point and I would prefer to tighten sooner rather than later. But having said that, I'm comfortable with your suggestion of ""B,"" asymmetrically stated. The point that was made that we certainly wouldn't want ""B"" to be consistent with an easing of market rates--I'm not sure what the exact number is--is an important one. The only other point I would make is that I would not in the immediate period be terribly concerned if M2 continued to grow rather slowly, because I'm not as sanguine that some of these thrift problems, in terms of the deposit outflows, are not going to continue in the immediate period ahead. That's based in part on looking at some data of FSLIC insured thrifts as compared to FDIC insured thrifts. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
198903	351	GREENSPAN	 I should hope we would be able to make some thrift-adjusted M2 judgments. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	352	KOHN	 Of a very rough sort. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	353	GREENSPAN	 I don't know. Here I am complaining about the price forecast and-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	354	ANGELL	 We can call it M2t. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198903	355	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	356	CORRIGAN	 As in MlA? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198903	357	BOYKIN	 I would favor alternative B as you suggested. And I would strongly favor asymmetric language. I would do that because I think projections are extremely important right now. I'm not sure that we will know by the time of the next meeting whether we are in the pause or whether we're heading a little differently. And when this policy record becomes public, following the next meeting, I think it could lead to some confusion in terms of our commitment to having inflation in the forefront of our thinking. I think it could send the wrong signal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198903	358	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	359	GUFFEY	" Mr. Chairman, I would favor ""B"" and an asymmetric directive. I'd just like to highlight the point that Tom Melzer made, however. We have in the past been fairly quick to act on a single number that has been published, given the background of the tightening that we've done over the last year. And that's 3  percentage points over the last year in the federal funds rate alone-- or 2 percentage points over the last 8 or 9 months. I think it is time to pause and see what these numbers really mean. I would like to see a little more accumulation of evidence of this slowing or the lack of slowing before we take any further action. I don't know what that means [in terms of timing] but I think it should be at least a month before we do anything. In my mind that would give us the employment numbers and the next PPI number, I guess. In other words, I need a cumulation of numbers going one way, really, before taking any dramatic action on the asymmetrical language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198903	360	GREENSPAN	 Yes, let me say--and I think it deserves to be said--in the event that some number [becomes available] or that something occurs that is significantly out of tune with this conversation we're having, I think it is obligatory that we have a telephone conference and some rethinking and rejudgments of this. First Vice President Stone. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	361	STONE	" I probably come out where Vice Chairman Corrigan comes out, somewhere between ""B"" and ""C."" But I certainly would be able to live with ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline. I am very sensitive to the points that President Melzer brought up about how we're going to get out of this cycle of reacting to each of the numbers that comes out. One of the ways to get out of that is to be ahead of that; and that's why I'd probably prefer to be between ""B"" and ""C."" But, for all the reasons stated, I think there is some reason to pause at this point and to be a bit more conservative. So, I could support ""B"" with an asymmetric guideline. "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198903	362	GREENSPAN	" It appears as though the critical mass is on ""B"" with asymmetric language. We could insert that into the directive. Let's have it read and we can put in what we need to as we go along. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198903	363	BERNARD	" ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.
