201603	0	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin.	50.0	65.0
201603	1	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Welcome, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201603	2	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As for our past meetings, this entire meeting will be a joint meeting of the FOMC with the Board of Governors, and I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201603	3	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201603	4	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201603	5	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201603	6	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Our first order of business is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’m going to ask Simon to start us off.	61.0	65.0
201603	7	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201603	8	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I will begin by discussing global financial market developments, and then Lorie will review money markets and operational matters.	61.0	999.0
201603	9	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following their worst January since 2009, global risk asset prices continued to exhibit significant volatility over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201603	10	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows that the period can be divided in two.	61.0	999.0
201603	11	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In the first half, risk assets declined sharply, generally continuing the moves seen following the turn of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	12	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, since mid-February, risk asset prices have rebounded.	61.0	999.0
201603	13	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Taking a longer view:  On net, since the December FOMC meeting, risk asset prices and advanced economy sovereign debt yields are lower, while the US dollar is a bit weaker.	61.0	999.0
201603	14	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In order to gain greater insight into the price actions seen year-to-date, we asked respondents to the Desk’s surveys to rate the importance of various factors that may explain the recent financial market volatility.	61.0	999.0
201603	15	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, on average respondents assigned the highest ratings to three factors:  volatility in oil markets, Chinese FX developments, and changes to the outlook for foreign growth and inflation.	61.0	999.0
201603	16	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As I will discuss in more detail in the next three panels, a reduction in heightened concerns over these factors likely contributed to the retracement in risk asset prices since mid-February, although key sources of uncertainty underlying these factors have not been resolved, and this may suggest the rebound is tenuous.	61.0	999.0
201603	17	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Survey respondents also highlighted foreign central bank policy as a contributing factor, and, over the period, investors increasingly questioned the efficacy of monetary policy at the  lower bound in certain developed market economies.	61.0	999.0
201603	18	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I will discuss this later in my briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	19	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Interestingly, only two respondents mentioned market psychology as an important factor, while one other pointed to reduced market liquidity.	61.0	999.0
201603	20	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Beginning with oil, the middle-left panel shows that oil prices fell back to multi- decade lows in mid-February, and, amid ongoing negotiations between many producers to coordinate an output freeze, prices were volatile over the period, with an intraday trading range generally between 3 and 6 percent.	61.0	999.0
201603	21	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The wide daily swings in oil prices continued to have knock-on effects across global financial markets, and the correlation between changes in oil prices and a number of risk asset prices remained well above longer-run historical averages.	61.0	999.0
201603	22	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Although oil prices increased over the period to roughly $40 per barrel, they’re little changed year-to-date, and the outlook for them remains uncertain.	61.0	999.0
201603	23	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	On the supply side, a coordinated output freeze is only speculative at this point, while the outlook for oil demand does not appear to have materially changed.	61.0	999.0
201603	24	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Against this backdrop, market participants continue to expect volatile trading conditions, and options on oil futures suggest price volatility will remain above its post-crisis average in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201603	25	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Moving to China, the stability in recent weeks in the renminbi−US dollar fixing seems to have soothed market concerns.	61.0	999.0
201603	26	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, the onshore renminbi was little changed against the US dollar, broadly consistent with movements in the basket of currencies that many Chinese policymakers describe as the new exchange rate peg.	61.0	999.0
201603	27	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	That said, many investors perceive the recent stability as only temporary, in part because it has required high levels of intervention in foreign exchange markets.	61.0	999.0
201603	28	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that Chinese foreign exchange reserves have declined by over $750 billion since the fall of 2014.	61.0	999.0
201603	29	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite incremental communication in February from Chinese policymakers indicating an interest in renminbi stability against a basket of exchange rates, many market participants are skeptical that this will be delivered, in light of prior abrupt adjustments to the exchange rate policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	30	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants also point to the perceived pressure from capital outflows, the ongoing opacity concerning the exchange rate regime with respect to the US dollar, and the viability of such a regime.	61.0	999.0
201603	31	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Investors still expect the renminbi to depreciate further against the US dollar over the coming year, and options pricing indicates that the demand for protection against surprise renminbi depreciation is near post-crisis highs and well above levels prevailing prior to the August devaluation.	61.0	999.0
201603	32	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Beth Anne will discuss China and oil prices further in her briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	33	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	While oil prices and the renminbi–US dollar fixing have stabilized in recent weeks, concerns about longer-run global growth prospects or secular stagnation have not receded.	61.0	999.0
201603	34	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows that five-year, five-year-forward real yields in the United States and euro area continued to decline over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201603	35	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The decline in real yields—alongside persistently low levels of forward inflation compensation—has resulted in a significant flattening in nominal sovereign yield curves, and nominal yields are at or near historic lows.	61.0	999.0
201603	36	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	At the intersection of these three factors, the financial sector has experienced heightened volatility and significant asset price declines since the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	37	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-right panel shows that domestic and European bank stocks have been notable underperformers, as continued net interest margin compression due to flattening yield curves, energy-sector exposure, and idiosyncratic developments weighed on the sector.	61.0	999.0
201603	38	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Concerns over individual bank earnings and escalated doubts over the ability of certain banks to meet debt obligations exacerbated the steep slide in financial-sector stocks in the euro area, Japan, and the United States.	61.0	999.0
201603	39	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The share prices of some large banks were, at one point, 30 percent below the levels prevailing at the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201603	40	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	By contrast, some observers point to emerging markets, which have performed comparatively well so far this year, as an indication that financial market concerns have been overblown.	61.0	999.0
201603	41	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, the relatively strong performance follows sharp declines across EM assets in the second half of 2015.	61.0	999.0
201603	42	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, as I highlighted with respect to China, most assume the current stability has been supported in part by active FX intervention and, therefore, question its sustainability over the medium-to- long term.	61.0	999.0
201603	43	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As volatility in global financial markets rose, expectations for more- accommodative monetary policies from developed-market central banks increased and have only partially retraced in recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	44	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Year-to-date money market futures rates across the euro area, Japan, and the United States have all declined substantially.	61.0	999.0
201603	45	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, going into the G-20 meeting in Shanghai, there was increased market chatter about the possibility of coordinated responses across central banks and fiscal authorities as many market participants focused on the international spillover effects and efficacy of monetary policy actions at the zero bound.	61.0	999.0
201603	46	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	At the end of January, the Bank of Japan announced a negative interest rate policy to complement its ongoing asset purchase program, an unexpected change to its policy stance, as Japanese policymakers had previously been adamantly against using the tool.	61.0	999.0
201603	47	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite the attempt to provide further accommodation and a short-lived positive response in financial markets, Japanese financial conditions tightened considerably in the weeks after the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201603	48	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows that the Japanese yen appreciated over 5 percent versus the US dollar and Japan’s TOPIX Index declined 14 percent, on net, in the two weeks after the announcement.	61.0	999.0
201603	49	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants link the moves in market prices in part to inconsistent policy communications, a complicated and unclear tiered system of interest rates on reserve balances, and more-fundamental questions about the efficacy of negative interest rate policy and the remaining capacity of BOJ policy tools to stoke inflation.	61.0	999.0
201603	50	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, in view of the size of the BOJ’s asset purchase program and the operational concerns associated with negative rates in Japan, the main tool remaining with ample capacity appears to be FX intervention.	61.0	999.0
201603	51	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, last week the ECB delivered a comprehensive and carefully designed package of accommodative measures, which was generally viewed as surpassing consensus market expectations.	61.0	999.0
201603	52	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As detailed in the top-right panel, the ECB cut the rates on its main refinancing operations, marginal lending facility, and deposit facility, bringing the deposit rate to minus 40 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201603	53	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, it added a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations, increased the pace of asset purchases, and expanded the list of eligible purchase program assets to include nonfinancial corporate bonds.	61.0	999.0
201603	54	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Unlike the BOJ, the ECB faces self-imposed operational limits related to the share of sovereign issuance it is prepared to hold and a floor on the yields of assets it is prepared to buy.	61.0	999.0
201603	55	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	It also decided not to implement a tiered negative interest rate system, which was apparently viewed adversely by a number of market participants.	61.0	999.0
201603	56	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Despite the unprecedented scale of efforts by the ECB and Bank of Japan to stimulate inflation in a situation in which their policy rate has reached  the lower bound, the middle-left panel shows that the forward measures of inflation compensation remain at or near multiyear lows.	61.0	999.0
201603	57	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following the election of Prime Minister Abe and the subsequent implementation of QQE, Japan had some success in the financial markets in raising inflation compensation.	61.0	999.0
201603	58	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, with disinflationary forces building in the euro area and more broadly across the globe since the summer of 2014, long forward inflation compensation has fallen even as the Bank of Japan increased its pace of asset purchases and the ECB started a QE program.	61.0	999.0
201603	59	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	In the United States, inflation swaps are trading in line with crisis-era lows, although they have shown notable increases in the past few weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	60	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The cumulative result of the varied actions by the BOJ and ECB, or perhaps the inability to counteract the conditions prompting these actions, is most evident in the extremely low level of nominal yields in these jurisdictions.	61.0	999.0
201603	61	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that 74 percent of Japanese sovereign debt and about one-half of euro-area sovereign debt are trading at negative yields.	61.0	999.0
201603	62	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	These negative yields might be putting downward pressure on US yields through portfolio balance effects.	61.0	999.0
201603	63	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Further, it is unknown whether sustained periods of negative yields will lead to structural changes in financial systems that, in turn, reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	64	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The heightened market volatility and perceptions of a fragile domestic economic outlook prompted, particularly in early February, expectations of a much more accommodative stance of monetary policy being provided by the FOMC.	61.0	999.0
201603	65	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the current market-implied path of the federal funds rate, the dark blue line, remains notably below the path prevailing at the time of the December FOMC meeting, a path shown in the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201603	66	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market pricing currently suggests that a less than 10 percent probability is attached to an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, and only one rate hike is fully priced in for the remainder of 2016; the path is still consistent with a very gradual data- dependent approach, with a 50–50 chance of a rate increase at or before the June meeting.	61.0	999.0
201603	67	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	These market-implied expectations are generally consistent with the results of the most recent Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201603	68	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss policy expectations further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201603	69	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Following the Bank of Japan decision, market participants began to speculate that negative interest rate policy may be on the horizon in the United States, in part illustrated by a slight inversion of the federal funds futures curve on the morning of February 11, when the value of Eurodollar options that would pay off with negative rates spiked.	61.0	999.0
201603	70	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The Eurodollar option-implied risk-neutral probability of negative policy rates in December 2016 rose from around 2 percent at the start of the year to 12 percent most recently, though it reached as high as 25 percent on February 11.	61.0	999.0
201603	71	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Results in the Desk’s surveys similarly reflect a shift in views, with 18 respondents now estimating the level of the federal funds target range or rate at the effective lower bound as less than zero, compared with only 12 in January.	61.0	999.0
201603	72	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	However, on average, respondents assign a less than 5 percent probability to negative policy rate outcomes occurring over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201603	73	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Fed policymaker comments over the course of February also served to flatten the expected path of the policy rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	74	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Market participants keyed in on comments from Vice Chairman Dudley and the Chair’s congressional testimony, which were taken by some as suggesting that financial market volatility could factor into the path of policy normalization.	61.0	999.0
201603	75	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Additionally, Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments in early February that US dollar strength could have “significant consequences” for the US economy led to a large and widespread depreciation in the US dollar, which had been continuing to appreciate despite a compression in interest rate differentials, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	76	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Arguably, this arrest in broad dollar appreciation helped with the stabilization in global financial markets over the period, reducing both some downward pressures on oil prices and upward pressure on the renminbi fixing.	61.0	999.0
201603	77	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	A key question that remains for market participants, therefore, is the extent to which shifts in US monetary policy expectations have contributed to the stabilization in global financial conditions and, correspondingly, the extent to which the current relative calm would be sustained if expectations for a faster pace of FOMC rate hikes grow or the US dollar starts to appreciate once again.	61.0	999.0
201603	78	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll begin on exhibit 3, with money markets and operational developments.	61.0	999.0
201603	79	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Our experience during the intermeeting period continued to suggest the operational framework has been effective in maintaining control over the effective federal funds rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	80	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This has occurred without enlarging the Federal Reserve’s market footprint or having unintended consequences on financial stability during the financial market turmoil in January and early February.	61.0	999.0
201603	81	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, the effective federal funds rate continued to print near the center of the target range.	61.0	999.0
201603	82	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	I should note that since the previous meeting, we changed the underlying data source for the effective rate to the FR 2420 data and the calculation methodology to a volume-weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201603	83	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This transition went smoothly, with little market reaction and little change in the effective rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	84	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury repo rates traded at modestly higher spreads to the overnight RRP rate, with the overnight Treasury GCF rate, shown as the red line, printing above the target range early in the period.	61.0	999.0
201603	85	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Treasury bill rates, shown as the light blue line, continued to rise following liftoff as a result of significant increases in net bill issuance.	61.0	999.0
201603	86	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	These higher rates on money market instruments contributed to the substantial decline in daily take-up of Federal Reserve overnight RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201603	87	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As indicated by the dark blue line in the top-right panel, daily take-up fell, dropping on occasions to less than $40 billion, which is below what we would have expected even after taking the higher rates on alternative money market instruments into account.	61.0	999.0
201603	88	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Market participants reported that an increase in the availability of private repo, as indicated by the increase in private-sector repo volumes shown in the light blue line, also contributed to the reduced overnight RRP facility usage.	61.0	999.0
201603	89	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts attributed this combination of increased private-sector repo availability and higher rates to the increase in the amount of Treasury collateral that dealers needed to finance in the repo market.	61.0	999.0
201603	90	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This increase in dealer inventory to finance, shown in the middle-left panel, has been driven by sales of US Treasury securities by foreign central banks in support of realized or expected foreign exchange intervention activity, combined with the sustained positive Treasury net bill issuance, shown in your middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	91	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The recent increase in Treasury repo volumes and correspondingly low Federal Reserve overnight RRP facility usage appears to have influenced expectations for future usage.	61.0	999.0
201603	92	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the Desk’s March policy surveys showed that median expectations for six-month-ahead and one-year-ahead overnight RRP facility demand declined by roughly $150 billion.	61.0	999.0
201603	93	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	However, respondents largely maintain that demand is likely to increase from current levels later this year, as implementation of SEC money market mutual fund reforms is expected to result in increased supply of cash for investment into short-term high-quality assets.	61.0	999.0
201603	94	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Although overnight RRP usage declined over the period, we continue to see increases in Federal Reserve reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official institutions—otherwise known as the foreign RP pool—as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	95	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the vast majority of the increase in the foreign RP pool since December 2014, shown in dark blue, has been driven by one customer seeking larger dollar liquidity buffers as a precaution against potential global financial instability surrounding normalization of US monetary policy.	61.0	999.0
201603	96	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This customer’s increases have occurred gradually and ended in January.	61.0	999.0
201603	97	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	A few emerging market accounts have been responsible for the growth more recently amid a desire to increase their dollar liquidity buffers either in anticipation of foreign exchange intervention activity or out of concern over Treasury market liquidity in times of stress.	61.0	999.0
201603	98	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to the final exhibit, I’d like to update you on recent trends in the foreign exchange reserve holdings of the SOMA portfolio, a summary of which is contained in the top-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	99	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The SOMA portfolio holds approximately $12 billion in euro-denominated and $8 billion in yen-denominated investments, which are invested in sovereign bond holdings and deposits at official institutions.	61.0	999.0
201603	100	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your top-right panel, total income from the euro portfolio has been trending lower since late 2011.	61.0	999.0
201603	101	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Since the adoption of a negative deposit facility rate by the ECB in 2014, income earned on cash and time deposits held at euro-area central banks has been negative.	61.0	999.0
201603	102	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With the recent further declines in euro-area rates that Simon highlighted, we expect negative overall interest income on the euro portfolio this month.	61.0	999.0
201603	103	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In contrast, we expect income on the yen portfolio to decline toward zero but remain positive.	61.0	999.0
201603	104	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Although yields on Japanese government bonds with maturities out to 11 years are now negative, we currently earn an interest rate of zero on our deposits left at the BOJ.	61.0	999.0
201603	105	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	We anticipate that the negative income on the euro portfolio will fully offset the reduced—though still positive—income from the yen portfolio in April, resulting in negative total SOMA foreign portfolio interest income in US dollar terms.	61.0	999.0
201603	106	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This would be reported publicly for the first time in late May within the April financial statement of the Treasury Exchange Stabilization Fund, which the Desk manages in an identical manner to the SOMA portfolio.	61.0	999.0
201603	107	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	It would be subsequently reported in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s quarterly report covering the second quarter and other Federal Reserve financial statements.	61.0	999.0
201603	108	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As we have noted previously, we are currently conducting a strategic review of the foreign portfolio investment framework.	61.0	999.0
201603	109	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The goal of this review is to assess and improve the way in which the Desk manages the SOMA’s and the Treasury ESF’s foreign assets in order to better meet the investment objectives.	61.0	999.0
201603	110	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This strategic review is being conducted in parallel with work to modernize the Committee’s Foreign Authorization documents so that they reflect the current operating environment and can be more easily understood by the public.	61.0	999.0
201603	111	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	We will be providing a memo to the Committee on the results of the strategic review, including a recommended benchmark investment portfolio, in the coming weeks.	61.0	999.0
201603	112	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to the domestic portfolio, the Desk is planning to publish the SOMA annual report in mid-April, and the Committee can expect to receive a full copy around the end of this month.	61.0	999.0
201603	113	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In order to demonstrate the sensitivity of income to various factors such as interest rates and the composition of Federal Reserve liabilities, the annual report will include updated SOMA portfolio income projections under both a baseline scenario derived from market expectations and several alternative scenarios.	61.0	999.0
201603	114	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In comparison with the 2014 annual report, the 2015 baseline projection shows a higher level of net income during the normalization process, as shown in your middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201603	115	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This is primarily due to a delay in the expected end to reinvestments—resulting in a larger SOMA portfolio over a longer time period— combined with a lower interest rate path, which reduces expected interest expense.	61.0	999.0
201603	116	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In the baseline scenario, the portfolio is expected to reach its steady-state size in the second quarter of 2022, nearly a year and a half later than projected in the previous report.	61.0	999.0
201603	117	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In terms of portfolio operations, the Desk continued to reinvest repayments of principal on Treasury securities and agency MBS.	61.0	999.0
201603	118	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your middle-right panel, the Desk completed roughly $37 billion in Treasury rollovers in February, a sharp increase in the monthly Treasury rollovers over the prior three-year period when maturing Treasury securities totaled only $6 billion.	61.0	999.0
201603	119	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk also reinvested $22 billion in MBS principal payments.	61.0	999.0
201603	120	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The median respondent to the Desk’s March surveys expected the Committee to first cease some or all reinvestments in June 2017—shown as the dashed line—two months later than in the January survey.	61.0	999.0
201603	121	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	A number of respondents attributed the shift to a flattening in the expected path of the target range.	61.0	999.0
201603	122	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, we would like to review factors that may bear on the Committee’s decision of whether to conduct term RRP operations over March quarter-end.	61.0	999.0
201603	123	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	In a memo sent to the Committee and summarized in your bottom two panels, the staff outlined an option to offer $250 billion in term RRPs at 1 basis point over the ON RRP offered rate, split evenly between seven- and two-day maturities.	61.0	999.0
201603	124	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	On the one hand, conducting term RRPs over quarter-end would provide continuity, support the Committee’s guidance that it expects to reduce elevated capacity in the ON RRPs fairly soon after the commencement of policy firming, and enhance operational readiness.	61.0	999.0
201603	125	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	On the other hand, because ON RRP capacity is currently more than sufficient to meet demand for RRPs over the quarter-end, offering term RRPs will not add to interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201603	126	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Further, there is the added albeit small interest expense of providing term RRPs at a premium to the ON RRP offered rate.	61.0	999.0
201603	127	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	If the Committee wishes to conduct term RRPs over the March 2016 quarter-end, the instruction to conduct such operations would need to be added to the domestic policy directive, which will be included in the implementation note that is published along with the Committee’s postmeeting statement.	61.0	999.0
201603	128	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk would also release an operating statement on term RRP operations on the New York Fed’s website, providing the planned schedule and other details such as the allocation mechanism for the operations.	61.0	999.0
201603	129	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	The memo you received and Tealbook B show the draft language that would be added to the directive; the memo also shows the draft operating statement that the Desk would release.	61.0	999.0
201603	130	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	To conclude, as we noted in January, as part of each FOMC briefing, we will provide a summary of the results of any small-value exercises from the prior period and preview upcoming exercises.	61.0	999.0
201603	131	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	This information is summarized in your appendix, which also notes the results of the TDF test operation performed in February.	61.0	999.0
201603	132	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you.	61.0	999.0
201603	133	2016-03-16	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201603	134	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	135	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Now, from my own standpoint, I’m not particularly concerned about this because, in either case, the minutes for this meeting can clarify something we have said before, which is that we intend to reintroduce an aggregate cap on the overnight RRP facility at some point, and we intend to phase out the facility when it’s no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	62.0	65.0
201603	136	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, personally, this isn’t something I feel strongly about.	62.0	65.0
201603	137	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I’m happy to go along with the prevailing view of the Committee.	62.0	65.0
201603	138	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Before I ask for a show of hands, I’d welcome any comments that you might have.	62.0	65.0
201603	139	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	A few people have indicated a desire to comment on this, and anybody else is welcome to join in.	62.0	65.0
201603	140	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn to the Vice Chairman first.	62.0	65.0
201603	141	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201603	142	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s an earth- shattering decision.	62.0	96.0
201603	143	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If we did one or the other, I don’t think we would be putting the republic at risk.	62.0	96.0
201603	144	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	62.0	96.0
201603	145	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But all that said, I do favor the option of not doing term RRPs at the end of the quarter for two simple reasons.	62.0	96.0
201603	146	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	One, they’re not necessary, in view of the fact that we don’t have a cap on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	96.0
201603	147	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s plenty of capacity to accommodate any quarter-end demand.	62.0	96.0
201603	148	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Without a cap, we clearly don’t need them now, so the default should be no term RRP for the time being.	62.0	96.0
201603	149	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Once we establish a cap on the overnight RRP facility, then we should revisit this issue.	62.0	96.0
201603	150	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	At that time we might decide to have a high cap on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	96.0
201603	151	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, we might still expect to have sufficient headroom at quarter-end so we can safely continue to forgo term RRP, or we can decide to have a lower cap on the overnight RRP facility, which might necessitate term RRP to ensure sufficient headroom at quarter-end.	62.0	96.0
201603	152	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	A second important reason is that I would prefer that we make the decisions in sequence.	62.0	96.0
201603	153	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d have the decision on the overnight RRP cap made first.	62.0	96.0
201603	154	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Then, once that decision was made, I would consider the implications for headroom at quarter-end, and that, then, would drive the decision on term RRP.	62.0	96.0
201603	155	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some might view this decision not to do term RRP as inconsistent with past practice, as we’ve done term RRP operations consistently over recent quarter-ends.	62.0	96.0
201603	156	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I disagree with this.	62.0	96.0
201603	157	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of communication, I completely agree with the Chair.	62.0	96.0
201603	158	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think if we forgo term RRP when we have no cap—I don’t think it’s going to be difficult to explain to anybody.	62.0	96.0
201603	159	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We can make it clear why we’re doing so in the minutes.	62.0	96.0
201603	160	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We simply explain that because we don’t have a cap, we don’t need term RRP right now.	62.0	96.0
201603	161	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	162	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	62.0	65.0
201603	163	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201603	164	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley’s analysis.	62.0	999.0
201603	165	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Although I think it is not putting the republic at risk, I think it’s a close call, and for me there are costs and benefits, obviously, to changing or not changing.	62.0	999.0
201603	166	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I come down on the side of the cost of changing, at least in terms of too many moving parts, until we get sufficiently on our path toward normalization.	62.0	999.0
201603	167	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That seems to be the right thing to do.	62.0	999.0
201603	168	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201603	169	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201603	170	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201603	171	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I agree with our Vice Chairman that the term RRP over quarter-end would be superfluous.	62.0	81.0
201603	172	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I’ve argued that even with a potentially binding cap, it would be superfluous, but we don’t have to get into that discussion today.	62.0	81.0
201603	173	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think changes to the program should go in the direction of parsimony rather than adding bells and whistles.	62.0	81.0
201603	174	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	From here on out, we should keep it simple and wind it down.	62.0	81.0
201603	175	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see a need to add any term RRPs even if we reduce the cap.	62.0	81.0
201603	176	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see why we’d add the term RRPs to the mix.	62.0	81.0
201603	177	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We should just keep it simple until we wind it down.	62.0	81.0
201603	178	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody else like to comment on this matter?	62.0	65.0
201603	179	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201603	180	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On this momentous question, I’m going to ask for a show of hands.	63.0	65.0
201603	181	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with, how many people would be in favor of no term RRPs, just use the overnight RRP?	63.0	65.0
201603	182	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	63.0	65.0
201603	183	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201603	184	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think I see 13.	63.0	65.0
201603	185	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And how many people would prefer to offer term RRP?	63.0	65.0
201603	186	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	63.0	65.0
201603	187	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I’m actually—I would vote for both.	63.0	999.0
201603	188	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	63.0	999.0
201603	189	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201603	190	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You’ve got it.	63.0	65.0
201603	191	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have a strong majority in favor of no term RRP.	63.0	65.0
201603	192	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we incorporate that into the directive, and we’ll vote on that tomorrow.	63.0	65.0
201603	193	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Next, now we have to vote on something.	63.0	65.0
201603	194	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We need to ratify open market operations since the January meeting.	63.0	65.0
201603	195	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201603	196	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201603	197	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201603	198	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11.0	999.0
201603	199	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet labeled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201603	200	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	A small literature in the medical field shows that in the immediate aftermath of a change to daylight saving time, one can document a variety of small but statistically significant adverse outcomes, including unproductive staring at computer screens and workplace accidents.	11.0	999.0
201603	201	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I have experienced one of these—I’ll leave you to guess which—but I hope not to have the other visited on me.	11.0	999.0
201603	202	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	How about FOMC meeting outcomes?	11.0	96.0
201603	203	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So far as I know, that has not been explored in the literature.	11.0	999.0
201603	205	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The first panel in your summary exhibit shows the nowcasts of real GDP growth in the first quarter of this year that have been generated around the System.	11.0	999.0
201603	206	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The black line shows the Board staff weekly judgmental forecast, the red line tracks the daily progress of our own purely statistical factor model, and the blue dashed lines show the forecasts from the various models maintained by the Reserve Banks.	11.0	999.0
201603	207	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Through an intermeeting period that was notable for the volatility in financial markets, the news that was relevant to these models had generally pushed them toward a rough consensus that GDP growth this quarter has been steady, if unspectacular, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	208	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The Board’s dynamic factor model, shown by the red line, briefly became a little more pessimistic about current-quarter growth during the second half of February, but the source of that pessimism was the higher-than-expected reading on the CPI, not the gyrations in any of the financial variables that the model looks at.	11.0	999.0
201603	209	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Since then, the late-February report on consumption expenditures and early-March employment report boosted the model estimate to about 2½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	210	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what it’s worth, this model barely flinched in the face of this morning’s retail sales release and took its projection down a mere 15 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201603	211	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the judgmental side, in light of the retail sales release, we were a little more taken aback by that news, and, in response, we have revised down our estimate of GDP growth this quarter from about 2 percent—at the right end of the black line in the panel—to 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	212	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the chart, the 1 percentage point discrepancy between the judgmental and model estimates is relatively wide and will provide an excellent opportunity for growth and learning for at least one of us.	11.0	999.0
201603	213	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For now, we continue to expect real GDP growth at about a 2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	214	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The main engine of growth in our near-term forecast continues to be private domestic final demand, which we anticipate to increase at about a 2¾ percent annual pace over the first half of this year, supported by still-low interest rates, solid job gains, lagged effects of previous wealth gains, still-favorable readings on consumer sentiment, and what we continue to estimate is a net boost from low energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	215	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other side of the ledger, we expect a slowing pace of inventory investment to subtract about ¼ percentage point from the growth of real GDP over the first half of this year, and we expect net exports to subtract about ¾ percentage point over that period.	11.0	999.0
201603	216	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Fueled partly by the recent bout of turbulence in financial markets, concern has increased during the past several months that the US economy might be heading for a recession.	11.0	999.0
201603	217	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The Board’s staff recently sent you a pair of memos summarizing our views.	11.0	999.0
201603	218	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One of the memos uses a novel technique to demonstrate that, when it comes to discerning the odds of a recession in the next very small number of months, both nonfinancial and financial variables are informative.	11.0	999.0
201603	219	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, if the goal is to gauge the risk of recession as much as a year ahead, financial variables are more useful and nonfinancial ones not so much.	11.0	999.0
201603	220	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 2, which reproduces some of the results of this exercise, on the basis of the February data that were available as of the time that the memo was closed, the model viewed the probability that the economy would be in recession at some point over the coming year as having risen since December, from very low levels to about their unconditional mean, which, in this model, is about 15 percent (as shown by the dashed line).	11.0	999.0
201603	221	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what it’s worth, my colleague Travis Berge was able to rerun the model this morning using updated information, and the difference in probability estimates is imperceptible.	11.0	999.0
201603	222	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I would note, however, that different models can generate markedly different results.	11.0	999.0
201603	223	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For example, Alessandro Barbarino showed in his briefing yesterday that a model he maintains put the probability of two consecutive quarters with decreases in real GDP as being essentially nil at present.	11.0	999.0
201603	224	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	By contrast, the other memo that was distributed to you last week focused on the movements in a measure of investor sentiment, the so-called excess bond premium constructed by Gilchrist and Zakrajšek, and showed that the estimated cumulative probability of the economy entering into recession sometime over the next 12 months had risen sharply and was above 40 percent in February.	11.0	999.0
201603	225	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the end, our own view of where the domestic economy currently stands and where it is headed is relatively little changed from where it was in January.	11.0	999.0
201603	226	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The two most recent employment reports point to a pace of improvement in the labor market about in line with our expectations.	11.0	999.0
201603	227	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Folding in this morning’s retail sales news, the recent indicators of aggregate spending and production have been a little below our January expectations.	11.0	999.0
201603	228	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	But the main metrics of financial market conditions that we look to in setting the medium-term projection are now a little more accommodative, on net, than at the time of the January Tealbook, importantly because the turbulence that peaked around mid-February appears to have largely gone into remission for now.	11.0	999.0
201603	229	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Still, in our view, the events of the intermeeting period validate our assessment that the risks to our outlook for real activity remain weighted to the downside, particularly because the capacity for countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy— both here and abroad—seems more limited than has been the historical norm.	11.0	999.0
201603	230	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 3 reproduces a new exhibit from the Tealbook that gives estimates of the short-run real natural rate of interest from three models that are currently part of the System’s DSGE modeling project.	11.0	999.0
201603	231	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The natural rate of interest is defined here as the real risk-free interest rate that would obtain in the absence of nominal wage and price rigidities.	11.0	999.0
201603	232	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The shaded region in the panel shows the range of estimates across the three models, while the solid line gives the median.	11.0	999.0
201603	233	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the wake of the Great Recession, all three models see aggregate demand as having been hit by adverse shocks that pushed the natural rate into negative territory; the effects of those shocks have been wearing off, but only slowly.	11.0	999.0
201603	234	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For the past few quarters, the median estimate has hovered right around zero.	11.0	999.0
201603	235	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Over the next several years, however, the median estimate of the short-run real natural rate from these models rises very gradually, reaching about 1 percent at the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	236	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The next two panels provide an overview of the medium-term outlook for real activity.	11.0	999.0
201603	237	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 4, our forecast of real GDP growth is marginally weaker in the near term but a shade stronger in 2017 and 2018, mostly because of the improvement in overall financial conditions since January.	11.0	999.0
201603	238	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 5, our unemployment rate projection is almost indistinguishable from the January Tealbook through late next year but creeps a little lower in 2018, reaching 4.3 percent at the end of that year, three-tenths below our January forecast.	11.0	999.0
201603	239	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Part of this downward revision reflects the slightly stronger GDP growth in 2017 and 2018, but part also reflects the fact that in this round we reduced our estimate of the natural rate by one-tenth, to 5 percent, which lowered our projected path for the actual unemployment rate an equal amount.	11.0	999.0
201603	240	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The panels on the next page summarize the inflation forecast.	11.0	999.0
201603	241	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 6, we marked up our projection for total PCE price inflation in the first half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201603	242	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	About half of this revision reflects a higher projected path of energy prices, while the remainder mainly owes to the fact that—as can be seen in panel 7— the January reading on core inflation came in higher than we expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	243	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This upward surprise to core inflation was largely attributable to several erratic components— including the nonmarket component—where price changes in a single month have historically carried little signal about future inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	244	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, due to the residual seasonality that is present in the data, we tend to discount high core inflation readings that we see in the first part of the year.	11.0	999.0
201603	245	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, the January jump in core goods prices that we saw seems difficult to square with declining import prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	246	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In light of these considerations, therefore, we left our core inflation projection beyond the near term about unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201603	247	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Tomorrow morning we will receive the February CPI report, which, together with today’s PPI data, will give us a better—but still incomplete—idea of what PCE price inflation was last month.	11.0	999.0
201603	248	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 8 and 9 reproduce two exhibits from the new inflation monitor that we intend to include regularly in upcoming Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201603	249	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Thus far, as indicated by the black lines in these two panels, we still have made only small revisions to our total and core PCE price inflation projections since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	250	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The upside surprise in the core inflation reading for January shows up in panel 9 as the yellow-shaded box in the stack for 2016; as you can see, we have neither extrapolated that surprise forward nor assumed that it will be reversed.	11.0	999.0
201603	251	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We have revised down our forecast of core inflation in 2017 and 2018 by about one-tenth since December, partly because of the small adjustment that we made this round to our estimate of underlying inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	252	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As we discussed in a memo that we sent to you earlier this month, some market- and survey- based indicators of longer-term expected inflation, such as the Michigan survey’s measure of longer-term expected inflation shown in panel 10, have moved down noticeably over the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201603	253	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In light of the accumulation of evidence since we last adjusted our assumption regarding underlying inflation in June 2014, we judged that a small downward adjustment of 5 basis points better balanced the risks.	11.0	999.0
201603	254	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, as Alessandro noted in his briefing yesterday, the latest data provide little sign of labor compensation having accelerated.	11.0	999.0
201603	255	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Under our interpretation of wage dynamics, which was discussed in a memo that you received last fall, the relatively flat contour of hourly compensation growth in recent years is attributable to a slowdown in trend productivity growth that has largely offset the effects of a continued reduction in labor market slack.	11.0	999.0
201603	256	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Over the medium term, we continue to expect that compensation gains will pick up gradually.	11.0	999.0
201603	257	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Beth Anne will continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201603	258	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	259	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I’ll be referring to the materials titled, cleverly, “The International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201603	260	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Financial markets have taken us on a wild ride since your December SEP round, and many of the twists and turns along the way have been foreign.	11.0	999.0
201603	261	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Much of the market stress appeared to reflect underlying concerns about the pace of global growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	262	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Is the Chinese economy slowing sharply?	11.0	999.0
201603	263	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Did the dropoff in oil prices reflect a collapse in global demand?	11.0	999.0
201603	264	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Has monetary policy lost its mojo?	11.0	999.0
201603	265	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Against this, we received a steady stream of economic data that, while not brilliant, didn’t signal an acute dropoff in performance.	11.0	999.0
201603	266	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, as seen in panel 1, we have again been surprised on the downside.	11.0	999.0
201603	267	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In December, we were expecting some moderation in Q4 foreign growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	268	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the event, the step-down was somewhat greater than anticipated.	11.0	999.0
201603	269	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Interestingly, it was not concentrated in the emerging market economies, or EMEs, where, except for a few cases like Brazil, growth, though unspectacular, held up fairly well, including in emerging Asia.	11.0	999.0
201603	270	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Instead, our Q4 misses were concentrated in the advanced foreign economies, or AFEs, where we saw sharp dropoffs in Canadian and Japanese growth and less momentum in Europe than we had been anticipating.	11.0	999.0
201603	271	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We have taken some signal from this weakness in putting together our forecast for this year.	11.0	999.0
201603	272	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In particular, although we appreciated the irony in previous forecasts of Europe being a relatively robust part of our outlook, we have now revised down our projection for the euro area and the United Kingdom noticeably.	11.0	999.0
201603	273	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The revision reflects recent incoming data and greater financial stresses, especially in the banking sector.	11.0	999.0
201603	274	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In addition, we have built in some drag that arises from rising political uncertainty, including the risk of “Brexit.”	11.0	999.0
201603	275	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In assessing the strength and risks to the global outlook, we wrestled with how to interpret the Sturm und Drang over the Chinese exchange rate, the volatility in the price of oil, and concerns about the efficacy of monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201603	276	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar (the black line in panel 2) and clumsy communication by Chinese authorities in early January reverberated negatively across global markets, and markets were calmed after the Chinese restabilized the renminbi against the dollar and, effectively, against the trade- weighted basket (the red line).	11.0	999.0
201603	277	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We had not bought into the view held by some that the earlier renminbi weakening signaled a collapse in Chinese growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	278	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We do, however, have Chinese growth slowing from almost 7 percent last year to 6¼ percent this year and 6 percent in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	279	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Over the next year, we assume the Chinese achieve a relatively flat path for the renminbi against the dollar and the basket.	11.0	999.0
201603	280	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This currency forecast reflects several factors:  recent communications by authorities that have stressed the goal of exchange rate stability, waning outflow pressures as repayment of external debt winds down, China’s significant foreign exchange reserves and huge current account surplus, and authorities’ recognition of the economic and credibility costs that would follow from a disruptive devaluation.	11.0	999.0
201603	281	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But, as Simon has pointed out, there are downside risks to this exchange rate forecast, especially if growth does not pick up after this quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	282	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This stability of the renminbi contributes to our forecast of a stable dollar, shown in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201603	283	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	After appreciating sharply in early January on flight-to-safety flows, the dollar has depreciated against most currencies despite significant easing by AFE central banks and as concerns about global growth have lessened.	11.0	999.0
201603	284	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	On net, these moves have left the value of the broad real dollar remarkably little changed since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	285	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	For the period ahead, we see the dollar appreciating against the AFE currencies as markets are surprised by the extent of monetary policy divergence between the United States and other advanced economies.	11.0	999.0
201603	286	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This appreciation is almost fully offset by some dollar depreciation against the EME currencies.	11.0	999.0
201603	287	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The early-year market tailspin was also fueled by concerns about a lack of floor on oil prices, as both spot and far futures prices (panel 4) fell sharply further.	11.0	999.0
201603	288	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although spot prices have recovered, far futures prices remain down since December, signaling that market participants expect very low oil prices to persist.	11.0	999.0
201603	289	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Much of the volatility of late seems to be linked to news on supply, including incoming data showing rising inventories and robust production, and the waning and waxing— possibly waning—of OPEC members’ willingness to commit to production limits.	11.0	999.0
201603	290	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Even so, swings in oil prices have been strongly positively correlated with US equity prices and forward inflation compensation.	11.0	999.0
201603	291	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This elevated correlation appears to be importantly reflecting a greater sense of uncertainty about the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201603	292	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In our baseline, we assume that oil prices follow the futures path, rising ever so slightly over the forecast period but following a lower trajectory than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	293	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This lower trajectory led us to shift down our near-term growth forecast for commodity-producing countries—in particular, Canada and Mexico—but still supports the broad recovery of growth abroad.	11.0	999.0
201603	294	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The fact that oil prices are not expected to fall further also contributes to our expectation of a gradual rise in global inflation (panel 5).	11.0	999.0
201603	295	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, the inflation environment looks more concerning than before:  We have a somewhat weaker outlook for growth; inflation data have disappointed in some AFEs; and there has been a downshift in market-based measures of inflation compensation, which we are not willing to wholly discount.	11.0	999.0
201603	296	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although we might expect central banks to look through the decline in energy prices, these other developments have spurred greater monetary policy accommodation in Japan and Europe, as discussed by Simon, and since December we also built in more accommodative future policy—with a more gradual rise in rates for Canada and the United Kingdom (panel 6), some additional easing by the Bank of Japan (not shown), and a much larger balance sheet for the ECB (panel 7).	11.0	999.0
201603	297	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	However, the adverse market reaction in the wake of the Bank of Japan’s shift into negative interest rates, the Riksbank’s further cut into negative territory, and the most recent ECB announcements have raised questions about the effectiveness of further monetary policy easing.	11.0	999.0
201603	298	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As Simon detailed, in the aftermath of the BOJ announcement in late January, the yen appreciated, inflation compensation measures fell, and bank equity prices plunged.	11.0	999.0
201603	299	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the case of the ECB, press conference comments by President Draghi ruling out further rate cuts led equity prices to decline and bond yields and the euro to rise.	11.0	999.0
201603	300	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, to borrow from Mark Twain, we think reports of the death of monetary policy have been greatly exaggerated.	11.0	999.0
201603	301	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Although the market reaction has been disappointing, it is premature to judge the outcome of recent actions.	11.0	999.0
201603	302	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Part of the negative response to the BOJ’s decision appears to reflect the fact that participants were caught off guard by earlier BOJ statements ruling out negative rates and were thus left scrambling to adjust.	11.0	999.0
201603	303	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	And the ECB appeared to undermine the strength of its actions by seeming to limit itself for the period ahead.	11.0	999.0
201603	304	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Financial markets have been quite volatile, and these initial reactions may fade.	11.0	999.0
201603	305	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Even traditional monetary policy takes time to transmit, and it will take some time to understand and adjust to these more unconventional polices.	11.0	999.0
201603	306	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But the experience has been a cautionary one.	11.0	999.0
201603	307	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the face of continued tepid growth and persistently low inflation, central banks are being stretched to design ever more complex and experimental policies that pose increasing challenges in terms of communication, implementation, and transmission.	11.0	999.0
201603	308	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Should monetary policy tools prove to be weaker than we anticipate, the costs of a downturn become greater.	11.0	999.0
201603	309	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As discussed in your next exhibit, in the forecast we took a stand that the adverse market moves earlier this year were not a harbinger of a sharp step-down in global growth.	11.0	999.0
201603	310	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But we would not completely discount such fears.	11.0	999.0
201603	311	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In particular, in the Tealbook, we present estimates of recession probabilities for the world economy on the basis of indicators of global macroeconomic activity and financial market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201603	312	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As outlined for reference in panel 8 and shown in panel 9, our estimated probit model appears to signal the cyclical slowdowns in the world economy since the 1970s, showing increases in the estimated probability ahead of recessions.	11.0	999.0
201603	313	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Because of the deterioration in macroeconomic and financial conditions through February, the estimated probability of recession has risen, pointing to downside risks to the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201603	314	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the Tealbook, we looked at the implications for the United States of a global recession with and without effective foreign monetary policy actions.	11.0	999.0
201603	315	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As described in panel 10, in both scenarios, foreign economies experience sharply tighter financial conditions and declines in confidence, and foreign central banks respond with monetary stimulus.	11.0	999.0
201603	316	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the first scenario, policy stimulus both boosts domestic demand and depresses the value of the currency.	11.0	999.0
201603	317	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As seen by the red line in panel 11, despite this stimulus, foreign GDP growth falls to 1 percent, compared with around 3 percent in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201603	318	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	As a result, the broad real dollar (panel 12) rises 4 percent, and US growth (panel 13) slows, leading to a somewhat lower trajectory for the federal funds rate (panel 14).	11.0	999.0
201603	319	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In the next scenario, measures implemented by foreign central banks prove ineffective at stimulating domestic demand, with the boost to GDP coming through the exchange rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	320	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	In this case, foreign GDP growth falls into negative territory, and the broad real dollar appreciates almost 9 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	321	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Consequently, US real GDP growth slows to below 1 percent, and the federal funds rate follows a much shallower path than in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201603	322	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So what do we make of all this?	11.0	999.0
201603	323	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The wild ride I alluded to at the beginning has, in many respects, left us close to where we started, but changed for the journey.	11.0	999.0
201603	324	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We are a bit more uncertain about the trajectory of the global economy; a bit more unsettled about the path for global inflation, including how well anchored inflation expectations are; and a bit more wary about the efficacy of monetary policy abroad to achieve its targets.	11.0	999.0
201603	325	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	326	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Bob Tetlow will now proceed.	11.0	999.0
201603	327	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Thank you, Beth Anne.	11.0	999.0
201603	328	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201603	329	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which, as you know, are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201603	330	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the top panel, a substantial majority of you project that real GDP growth this year will be at least a bit above your assessments of its longer-run rate and anticipate real output to either grow at about the same pace in 2017, or to decelerate, before converging toward its longer-run rate in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201603	331	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Overall, the medians of your projections for real GDP growth this year and next are a bit above the median projection of 2 percent growth in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	332	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the second panel, all of you see the unemployment rate declining to, or below, your estimate of its longer-run value by the end of this year, and most of you expect the unemployment rate to decline somewhat further in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201603	333	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As can be seen in the third panel, on the heels of headline PCE inflation of just 0.5 percent last year, the median of your projections moves up to 1.2 percent in 2016 and 1.9 percent in 2017.	11.0	999.0
201603	334	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Most of you project that headline PCE inflation will reach the Committee’s objective by 2018, and all but three of you expect inflation, in that year, to be within 0.1 percentage point of 2 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	335	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As the bottom panel shows, almost all of you expect core inflation to increase gradually over the course of the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201603	336	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 2 compares the medians and ranges of your current projections with those in the December Summary of Economic Projections as well as the March Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	337	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As can be seen in the top panel, your median projections for real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 are 0.2 percentage point and 0.1 percentage point lower, respectively, than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	338	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Most of you revised down projected growth this year.	11.0	999.0
201603	339	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Only a few of you anticipate some making-up of this shortfall in subsequent years.	11.0	999.0
201603	340	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As the second panel shows, the median of your forecasts for the unemployment rate is a bit lower in 2017 and 2018 than in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	341	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	However, many of you also reduced your estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, and, thus, although a dozen of you expect the unemployment rate to undershoot its longer-run level this year, that is fewer of you than was the case in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	342	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Even so, the median of your unemployment gaps for this projection is the same as in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	343	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Many of you made substantial downward revisions to your projections for total PCE inflation this year, leaving the median projection, shown in the third panel, down 0.4 percentage point from December’s value.	11.0	999.0
201603	344	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	In contrast, most of you did not change your projection for total PCE inflation at longer horizons.	11.0	999.0
201603	345	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	This in part reflected, as several of you noted, an expectation on your part that the effects of lower oil prices would fade.	11.0	999.0
201603	346	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As indicated in the final panel, the median path for core PCE inflation was little changed from December.	11.0	999.0
201603	347	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For both inflation measures, the medians of your projections are a bit above the staff forecast, as has been the case for some time now.	11.0	999.0
201603	348	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the forecast horizon and in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	349	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The medians of your funds rate projections, indicated by the red lines in the top panel, stand at 0.9 percent at the end of 2016, 1.9 percent at the end of 2017, 3.0 percent at the end of 2018, and 3¼ percent in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201603	350	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Since December, most of you have revised down your projected path for the federal funds rate over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201603	351	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Seven participants reduced their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate by ¼ percentage point, and no participant raised his or her projection of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate for any forecast date.	11.0	999.0
201603	352	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Among the reasons you cited for a more gradual pace of increases in the federal funds rate were a tightening in financial conditions since December, lower energy prices, and reductions in your estimates of longer-run growth or the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	353	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Almost all of you project that, at the end of 2018, the appropriate level of the federal funds rates will still lie below your individual judgments of its longer-run level.	11.0	999.0
201603	354	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The red diamonds in the upper panel of exhibit 3 show the medians of interest rate prescriptions based on a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule, taking as given your projections for core inflation, the unemployment gap, and the longer-run nominal federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	355	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Comparing these to the same chart for December, displayed in the lower panel, shows that the median prescription for the end of 2016 shifted down 60 basis points, about the same as the shift in the median of your federal funds rate projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	356	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	By contrast, for 2017 and 2018, the downward revisions in the federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor rule are small to negligible and notably less than the reductions in the median of your projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	357	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 4 shows your assessments of uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201603	358	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the figures to the left, your views regarding uncertainty have not changed in a material way since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	359	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Almost all of you judge the level of uncertainty about your individual projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as broadly similar to the average levels over the past 20 years.	11.0	999.0
201603	360	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	In contrast, your assessments of the risks to GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and both headline and core inflation have shifted adversely since December.	11.0	999.0
201603	361	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	As shown in the panels to the right, about half of you now see the risks to real GDP growth as weighted to the downside—up from just three in December.	11.0	999.0
201603	362	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Four of you now see risks to the unemployment rate as skewed toward higher unemployment—two more than in December—while two of you continue to see risks weighted toward lower unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201603	363	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Your explanations pointed to favorable labor market news over the past three months as a reason why the increase in pessimism regarding the risks to unemployment was less widespread than for real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201603	364	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	You also cited financial market and global economic conditions, on their own or coupled with the limited capacity—or willingness—of policymakers to respond to economic disturbances, as part of the reason for the change in your assessments of risk.	11.0	999.0
201603	365	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	On inflation, 11 of you indicated that the risks to your headline inflation forecasts are skewed to the downside, up from 7 in December; all but 1 of you saw the same tilt to the risks for core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	366	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Many of you noted the deterioration, or an absence of improvement, in indicators of long-term inflation expectations as contributing to increased downside risks for inflation, while some pointed to the further declines in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	367	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For the remainder of this briefing, I will build on material in exhibit 4 by reviewing the history of your assessments of uncertainty and risks, beginning with the first SEP that included your assessments of appropriate policy in January 2012.	11.0	999.0
201603	368	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 5 shows a diffusion index of your assessments of uncertainty by projection date.	11.0	999.0
201603	369	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The index is constructed as the fraction of respondents who said that uncertainty at the time was higher than the average level over the previous 20 years, minus the fraction of respondents who said that uncertainty was lower.	11.0	999.0
201603	370	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Several observations are worth noting.	11.0	999.0
201603	371	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	First, participants have never collectively judged uncertainty for any variable to be lower than average.	11.0	999.0
201603	372	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Second, assessed uncertainty regarding real GDP growth and the unemployment rate began at high levels and has been largely on a downward trend since.	11.0	999.0
201603	373	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	For the two inflation measures, you were less unified in viewing uncertainty as high initially, and the subsequent decline in the indexes was not maintained, presumably because of a sequence of oil price declines beginning in mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201603	374	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Finally, uncertainty surrounding headline and especially core PCE inflation forecasts has undergone a modest rebound in the past two years, with the rebound in uncertainty regarding core inflation occurring even though downward pressure on prices was arguably contained within noncore prices, and labor market conditions had continued to improve.	11.0	999.0
201603	375	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Exhibit 6 provides a similar exercise for the risks associated with your forecasts.	11.0	999.0
201603	376	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Over the period shown, risk perceptions have nearly always been skewed to the pessimistic side.	11.0	999.0
201603	377	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	But whereas the pessimism for real variables has diminished over time, or at least until 2015, the opposite has occurred for inflation.	11.0	999.0
201603	378	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Your assessments for both headline and core PCE inflation, which in 2012 showed roughly no skew, have turned somewhat pessimistic over the past several years.	11.0	999.0
201603	379	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Of note, some of this degradation in risk assessment coincided with a period of stronger-than-potential output growth and above-trend employment gains and started before oil prices began their marked decline in mid-2014.	11.0	999.0
201603	380	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	The indexes differ very little across the two inflation measures, suggesting that some participants have regarded risks emanating from noncore sources, such as energy prices, as affecting the risks to both core and headline inflation in a similar fashion.	11.0	999.0
201603	381	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201603	382	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	That concludes our presentations.	11.0	999.0
201603	383	2016-03-16	meeting	TETLOW	We welcome your questions.	11.0	999.0
201603	384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for any of the presenters.	12.0	65.0
201603	385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let me start off with a question for David on consumer spending and your reaction to this morning’s retail sales release.	12.0	65.0
201603	386	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You said that the judgmental forecast has had a very substantial downward revision.	12.0	65.0
201603	387	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	It looks like a larger downward revision than seen in other comments this morning.	12.0	65.0
201603	388	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You also mentioned, I think, that the Board model doesn’t react very much, or substantially less.	12.0	65.0
201603	389	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Could you talk a little bit more about that data release and what you saw in it that led to such a significant change?	12.0	65.0
201603	390	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the current quarter, our basic approach is to attempt to mimic, as much as possible, the construction methods that the BEA will use in putting together GDP.	12.0	999.0
201603	391	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re trying to process the information in a parallel manner to the way that the statistical agency will use it to put together the GDP estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	392	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re attempting to, for example, build in an assessment of serial correlation.	12.0	999.0
201603	393	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So, for example, there is a slight tendency of big moves in one direction in retail sales to be a little bit offset in subsequent months, so our reaction on the judgmental side takes that into account.	12.0	999.0
201603	394	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not very large.	12.0	999.0
201603	395	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The main surprise here in this morning’s release is not actually the estimate of growth in February.	12.0	999.0
201603	396	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s the January estimate, which was totally extraordinary.	12.0	999.0
201603	397	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I didn’t mention in my remarks that, according to our sector specialist, that revision was in the leftmost 1 percentile of revisions of retail sales from the prior month.	12.0	999.0
201603	398	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So it was really a very large, very unusual statistical event.	12.0	999.0
201603	399	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The revisions were quite widespread across categories of spending.	12.0	999.0
201603	400	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They were in general merchandise stores, in the personal and health-care areas, and in food services, so it wasn’t that there was an anomaly in one particular area.	12.0	999.0
201603	401	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We took our judgmental estimate down about ½ percentage point, and the statistical black box model that I referenced took it down about 15 basis points, so by about one-third as much.	12.0	999.0
201603	402	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re still, to be honest, gaining experience with how that model reacts.	12.0	999.0
201603	403	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One of the reasons why I was interested to show it is that it does have a little greater variance, actually, as you can see in that top panel, in its release revisions over this one episode than the judgmental process has.	12.0	999.0
201603	404	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know at this point which is going to prove more accurate.	12.0	999.0
201603	405	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The sad fact of the matter is that both its estimate and ours are well within the 70 percent confidence interval.	12.0	999.0
201603	406	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think it does suggest that the momentum of aggregate demand was just a little bit less than we had thought in our Tealbook projection.	12.0	999.0
201603	407	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Whether it’s just a tiny bit, as the model suggests, or more substantial, as our judgmental operation would suggest, is yet to be seen.	12.0	999.0
201603	408	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s about what I know at this point.	12.0	999.0
201603	409	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I have no reason to discount the retail sales reading.	12.0	999.0
201603	410	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The second estimate is based on a much wider sample of selling institutions than the first one is, so it should be a more complete estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	411	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	But, as I say, there is a fundamental puzzle.	12.0	999.0
201603	412	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This was a very big revision.	12.0	999.0
201603	413	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You’re assuming that services is also moved down?	12.0	65.0
201603	414	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	No, we made no adjustment to the services.	12.0	999.0
201603	415	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The retail sales release only covers goods that are sold through stores.	12.0	999.0
201603	416	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But you get that big—	12.0	65.0
201603	417	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We get that big of a reaction just from this.	12.0	999.0
201603	418	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Just from this.	12.0	65.0
201603	419	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201603	420	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As I say, it was a very big event, statistically speaking.	12.0	999.0
201603	421	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201603	422	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	96.0
201603	423	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for Beth Anne, or an observation that you could comment on.	12.0	96.0
201603	424	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In exhibit 2, chart 9, you show a relatively high probability of recession.	12.0	96.0
201603	425	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	You also express your worries about the effectiveness of monetary policy.	12.0	96.0
201603	426	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve had chronic misses on the foreign growth outlook over the past few years.	12.0	96.0
201603	427	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So it raises the question, do you think we are too optimistic about the growth forecast in exhibit 1, or do you think that that’s the modal forecast and there’s a big skew in terms of probability density to the downside?	12.0	96.0
201603	428	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the question.	12.0	96.0
201603	429	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And I have a little trouble reconciling chart 9 with the idea of accelerating global growth.	12.0	96.0
201603	430	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Should I have that problem?	12.0	96.0
201603	431	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We will always be worried about global growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	432	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So it’s true, we have had serial downward revisions, and I personally think it is probably more risk skewed to the downside than it is to the growth trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201603	433	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But it is harder and harder to tell stories on the upside of what the risks could be.	12.0	999.0
201603	434	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	One of them might be that over this time, part of our downward revision has come because we have underestimated the costs of low oil prices on oil- producing economies, especially Canada and Mexico, which have a very high trade weight for us.	12.0	999.0
201603	435	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Research that we have done here and that others have done has suggested that it could be that the boost to consumption is delayed, and that we should be seeing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	436	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So we view that as one upside risk to our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201603	437	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	And then, to look at the elevated probability, that’s come down a little bit with the more recent data that we’ve gotten, including some good IP data from the euro area today, and some diminution of financial stresses, but it still remains high.	12.0	999.0
201603	438	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	One reason it might be elevated is because we look at that estimate using an average across the whole period for global growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	439	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	If you have, like you suggested, some secular trend down in potential output in these economies, that may be overindicating a recession when we are seeing lower growth.	12.0	999.0
201603	440	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	That said, the growth we got in 2015 on average was very, very low for the global economy, and it’s hard to imagine that it would stay that low.	12.0	999.0
201603	441	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I, for one, found your presentation pretty sobering.	12.0	96.0
201603	442	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12.0	65.0
201603	443	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	102.0
201603	444	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of questions on the outlook and the presentation of the outlook for David Wilcox.	12.0	102.0
201603	445	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is on the inflation data.	12.0	102.0
201603	446	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In reading the Tealbook and listening to your presentation, you put in a word of caution about overinterpreting the January PCE price index reading.	12.0	102.0
201603	447	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am reminded of a comment that Governor Brainard made at the US Monetary Policy Forum, which I thought was a great way to say this: that we want to be data dependent but not data-point dependent—so, very much in the spirit of that.	12.0	102.0
201603	448	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I get the fact that we should be careful, that this could be noise.	12.0	102.0
201603	449	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I am looking at all of the 12-month changes, and some of the arguments you gave were about residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	450	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, 12-month changes may be minimizing some of that.	12.0	102.0
201603	451	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am also looking at core and other trimmed means, and things like that, which, again, are designed to smooth on the cross-section and on the time dimension here.	12.0	102.0
201603	452	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And when I look at the past 6 months or the past 12 months, it doesn’t matter how you look at this—over the past 6 months, core PCE 12-month changes is up four-tenths, market-based core PCE is up five-tenths, and trimmed mean is up three-tenths.	12.0	102.0
201603	453	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past 12 months, it is even larger.	12.0	102.0
201603	454	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, how do I put these two together?	12.0	102.0
201603	455	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It seems like you were telling stories about noise in the data versus the idea of “no matter how I clean the data up over the time dimension or cross- section, I kind of get the same answer.”	12.0	102.0
201603	456	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is my first question.	12.0	102.0
201603	457	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My second question is on labor markets, so maybe it would be good to do that one first.	12.0	102.0
201603	458	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Maybe I better get this one off the stack.	12.0	999.0
201603	459	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So there has been some pickup across inflation measures, just as you suggest, but we think it is likely to recede in the near term some.	12.0	999.0
201603	460	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me just give you one example, and our analysts have parsed this at a very fine level of detail.	12.0	999.0
201603	461	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	A notable element of the upward surprise in January, just to give you a little bit of a flavor of the general kind of feeling that you come away with, is that jewelry prices, which is an utterly tiny—	12.0	999.0
201603	462	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s a huge part of my spending.	12.0	102.0
201603	463	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	12.0	102.0
201603	464	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I am sure.	12.0	999.0
201603	465	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	You hide it well.	12.0	999.0
201603	466	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201603	467	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Jewelry prices increased 4 percent in one month, not at an annual rate, but they were flat over 2015.	12.0	999.0
201603	468	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	If I showed you a picture and asked you what piece of data didn’t fit, that would jump out.	12.0	999.0
201603	469	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there is always a danger of making excuses for the pieces of evidence that are inconvenient, and there is a chance that that’s going on here.	12.0	999.0
201603	470	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The pattern of the past few years is that we have tended to get upside surprises in the first half of the year.	12.0	999.0
201603	471	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Last year was the first year when we resisted being overly sensitive to those upside surprises in the first half of the year, and that turned out to be the correct judgment.	12.0	999.0
201603	472	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the prior years, we revised up our estimate, and, retrospectively, that turned out to be a mistake.	12.0	999.0
201603	473	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Alessandro showed, I thought, quite a striking panel yesterday—I don’t know whether you had a chance to take a look at the briefing—that showed the monthly price increases by month over the past 10 years.	12.0	999.0
201603	474	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There is really quite a strong pattern that documents the claim of residual seasonality.	12.0	999.0
201603	475	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, you might say, well, if you knew about the residual seasonality going in, you shouldn’t have been surprised ex post.	12.0	999.0
201603	476	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And that would be true on average, but it turns out that the timing of when it shows up by month is also quite variable.	12.0	999.0
201603	477	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Last year, I believe, if memory serves, it was the second quarter that was higher than normal.	12.0	999.0
201603	478	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So it is, at this point, a hypothesis.	12.0	999.0
201603	479	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It is nothing we can prove that we shouldn’t adjust upward, but it is a hypothesis that is founded on the evidence and the experience of the past few years and supported by the examination of some of these detailed price increases.	12.0	999.0
201603	480	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That is a perfectly reasonable response.	12.0	102.0
201603	481	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But on the 12-month changes—your story is very subtle, then, about residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	482	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because if you do 12-month changes, you don’t have residual seasonality.	12.0	102.0
201603	483	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it is really maybe more about, as in the briefing, that this varies over time, and so there may still be some leakage into the data.	12.0	102.0
201603	484	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But that’s something we will get a better picture on in the next few months, I am guessing.	12.0	102.0
201603	485	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That is correct.	12.0	999.0
201603	486	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay.	12.0	102.0
201603	487	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My second question is really more of, I think the staff needed a little help with thinking about some upside risks to the outlook, on the basis of my reading of the Tealbook.	12.0	102.0
201603	488	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You know, if you would come to California more often, you will feel better.	12.0	102.0
201603	489	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s sunnier.	12.0	102.0
201603	490	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It will help you there.	12.0	102.0
201603	491	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the scenarios that I was struck by in the Tealbook is actually related to productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	492	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have productivity growth output per hour this year of 1.7 percent.	12.0	102.0
201603	493	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just reading off the table.	12.0	102.0
201603	494	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Last year it was about—a little more than 1 percentage point slower than that, roughly ½ percentage point.	12.0	102.0
201603	495	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	If we were to generate the 2 percent, 2¼ percent GDP growth that we are penciling in and we did a replay of productivity growth last year of about six-tenths—so 1 percentage point less productivity growth than in the Tealbook—where would the unemployment rate be at the end of the year, all else being equal?	12.0	102.0
201603	496	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just trying to think through—last year one of the big reasons the unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage point is that we had essentially no productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	497	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And you all have a very big rebound in productivity growth coming this year.	12.0	102.0
201603	498	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So let me try to do this in my head.	12.0	999.0
201603	499	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, knock off 1 percentage point of productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	500	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	Let’s see.	12.0	999.0
201603	501	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	I am guessing that would be roughly another ¼ percentage point off the unemployment rate, if I am doing it in my head correctly.	12.0	999.0
201603	502	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So it would be down about 4 percent—but not next year.	12.0	999.0
201603	503	2016-03-16	meeting	WASCHER	So next year we would be down around—we have 4.8 currently, so we would be down closer to 4½ percent on your counterfactual, I think.	12.0	999.0
201603	504	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the total decline would be around ½ percentage point.	12.0	102.0
201603	505	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You have a little bit of pickup in—	12.0	102.0
201603	506	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I am going to be a little more disagreeable than that and question—the math of what you suggest is absolutely correct.	12.0	999.0
201603	507	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think the plausibility of the experiment—it feels to me like an artificial experiment to hypothesize that we would get the same GDP growth with that much lower productivity.	12.0	999.0
201603	508	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we did that last year.	12.0	102.0
201603	509	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had 1.9 percent GDP growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	510	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had 0.6 percent productivity growth.	12.0	102.0
201603	511	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am just saying, if we relived the big data of last year, we would have an unemployment drop of six-tenths.	12.0	102.0
201603	512	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is not implausible.	12.0	102.0
201603	513	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We did it last year.	12.0	102.0
201603	514	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It is not implausible.	12.0	999.0
201603	515	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think it’s the most likely—	12.0	999.0
201603	516	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sure.	12.0	102.0
201603	517	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I was just trying to think through the scenario.	12.0	102.0
201603	518	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201603	519	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think it is an evenly balanced probability outcome.	12.0	999.0
201603	520	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s a tail hypothesis.	12.0	999.0
201603	521	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an upside risk.	12.0	999.0
201603	522	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	That is what I thought President Williams was saying.	12.0	97.0
201603	523	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	524	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had four years of productivity growth of essentially zero.	12.0	102.0
201603	525	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it doesn’t seem that implausible.	12.0	102.0
201603	526	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	527	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me elaborate a little bit on what I’m thinking.	12.0	999.0
201603	528	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For example, next Tealbook we are going to have one of our alternative view franchises, another installment in that, that will point out that, just as you suggest, we have been repeatedly disappointed, gravely disappointed, to the downside, and arguing that maybe we ought to hypothesize a much worse productivity outlook.	12.0	999.0
201603	529	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, if we were to adopt that, and we may well move in that direction, we would also move our projection for actual GDP growth down significantly as well.	12.0	999.0
201603	530	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the basic point I’m getting at.	12.0	999.0
201603	531	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201603	532	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201603	533	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201603	534	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have several questions.	12.0	94.0
201603	535	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The first one is on the US outlook—panel number 2, “Recession Probabilities at Various Horizons.”	12.0	94.0
201603	536	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During your presentation of this, you said, despite what I think this picture says, that you thought that the recession risks were weighted to the downside.	12.0	94.0
201603	537	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So let me give you a different interpretation of this picture.	12.0	94.0
201603	538	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	These recession probability models actually did fairly well in the 2006−07 time frame, as they did signal that something was amiss in the US economy, and our subsequent recession actually occurred.	12.0	94.0
201603	539	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And I would interpret that as being that the recession probabilities went up to, say, 30 percent when the unconditional probability is about 15 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	540	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now, if you look at the current situation, we are either below the unconditional probability or at the unconditional probability.	12.0	94.0
201603	541	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So if you just wanted to use these recession probability models to say what the risks were, maybe a sensible thing would be to say, well, we are about where we expect to be in terms of recession probability.	12.0	94.0
201603	542	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I think that would be fine as far as the information that’s available to this model.	12.0	999.0
201603	543	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	What this model doesn’t know is anything about the capacity of fiscal policy or monetary policy to combat an adverse shock, and that’s the basis for our assessment in the Tealbook that the risks are weighted mainly to the downside for real activity.	12.0	999.0
201603	544	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This model also doesn’t know anything about the slower trend growth of real output.	12.0	999.0
201603	545	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12.0	94.0
201603	546	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, the recession definition maybe changes if you have a different growth rate.	12.0	94.0
201603	547	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, a more slowly growing economy would have—	12.0	94.0
201603	548	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know how the NBER will handle their determination of what constitutes a recession.	12.0	999.0
201603	549	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201603	550	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to turn to the international outlook panels 8 and 9, which Vice Chairman Dudley has already referred to.	12.0	94.0
201603	551	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I want to learn more about this.	12.0	94.0
201603	552	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	It says “world recession defined as countries comprising two-thirds of world GDP in recession.”	12.0	94.0
201603	553	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Do we literally mean two-thirds of the GDP in the world has had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth?	12.0	94.0
201603	554	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s not what you mean, but—	12.0	94.0
201603	555	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We use the Economic Cycle Research Institute dating methodology.	12.0	999.0
201603	556	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It does a sort of NBER-esque dating methodology rather than two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but they’re fairly similar.	12.0	999.0
201603	557	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This database covers 22 countries.	12.0	999.0
201603	558	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We actually looked at a few more.	12.0	999.0
201603	559	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But what it does is, we define a world recession as occurring when countries representing two-thirds of world GDP are classified as being in recession by this database’s definition.	12.0	999.0
201603	560	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Right.	12.0	94.0
201603	561	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If China is one of those countries, does it mean China is actually shrinking, or does it mean China is growing at 3 percent?	12.0	94.0
201603	562	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I actually don’t know how they do China.	12.0	999.0
201603	563	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, for the ones I’ve seen, it really amounts to saying global growth slows to, say, below 2 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	564	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So this is a way of capturing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	565	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Because if the world is in recession, it will pull Chinese growth down as well to levels that we could consider, given its potential, to be weak.	12.0	999.0
201603	566	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But two-thirds of the countries are not really in recession in the conventional sense as defined inside the United States.	12.0	94.0
201603	567	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	To the extent that this mimics the NBER dating process, it would be the countries comprising two-thirds of world GDP, not two-thirds of the countries in the world.	12.0	999.0
201603	568	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Also, why not just define it as a certain—some global growth rate that you want to call recession, and put a dotted line there?	12.0	94.0
201603	569	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	This is one way of doing that.	12.0	999.0
201603	570	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	There are different ways of doing that, and we also did some robustness checks.	12.0	999.0
201603	571	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We did a two-thirds measure.	12.0	999.0
201603	572	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We looked at it if it were 60 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	573	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	We looked at it if it were 70 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	574	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	The probability of recession changes, but also the sort of unconditional probability changes, and what you observe in each of those cases, if you varied the definition, was an increase in the probability.	12.0	999.0
201603	575	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I guess another way to say this—I’m looking at these shaded regions back here, 75, 80, and so on.	12.0	94.0
201603	576	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Global growth has not been negative, except, I think, for a single quarter.	12.0	94.0
201603	577	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So what are these shaded regions indicating?	12.0	94.0
201603	578	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Those shaded regions are regions in which countries comprising two- thirds of the world’s GDP are calculated as being in recession.	12.0	999.0
201603	579	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So global growth is—	12.0	999.0
201603	580	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	What is the world GDP growth rate in these shaded regions?	12.0	94.0
201603	581	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I say that it’s still positive.	12.0	94.0
201603	582	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Per capita is the issue, I think, a little bit.	12.0	999.0
201603	583	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	While countries are growing, population—	12.0	999.0
201603	584	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Yes, it goes back to your question about, is 3 percent for China basically a recession or not.	12.0	999.0
201603	585	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Exactly.	12.0	94.0
201603	586	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It’s not negative.	12.0	999.0
201603	587	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	I think we’re answering your question in the sense that, no, global growth in some of these cases may not be negative.	12.0	999.0
201603	588	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I just didn’t want the impression to come out to the Committee that global growth is going to shrink with high probability, according to this model, which says 48 percent of a chance of recession.	12.0	94.0
201603	589	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Right.	12.0	999.0
201603	590	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	So I wouldn’t read this as a literal 48 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	591	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	There are ranges around it reflecting uncertainty.	12.0	999.0
201603	592	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	What I would take away from this is that the probability of recession is higher than it would be unconditionally, that economic conditions are suggestive.	12.0	999.0
201603	593	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I took the black line here to represent the unconditional probability, which looks like 18 percent.	12.0	94.0
201603	594	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The horizontal black line.	12.0	94.0
201603	595	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It’s 16 percent, yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	596	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This number is high.	12.0	94.0
201603	597	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This number is quite high.	12.0	94.0
201603	598	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Right, and there are a numbers of reasons why.	12.0	999.0
201603	599	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	It could reflect some sort of structural slowing in growth, which we’re not accounting for.	12.0	999.0
201603	600	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	But one of the issues is that last year, growth was very weak, unusually weak.	12.0	999.0
201603	601	2016-03-16	meeting	WILSON	Growth as weak as it was globally last year has occurred very few times outside actual recessions or crises.	12.0	999.0
201603	602	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I’ve complained about this before for this Committee.	12.0	94.0
201603	603	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think you should come with a recession probability model to this Committee that hasn’t been vetted.	12.0	94.0
201603	604	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of ways to do these things.	12.0	94.0
201603	605	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There’s a lot of ways to cut this data, and this looks like a very scary number.	12.0	94.0
201603	606	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m not sure you should—	12.0	94.0
201603	607	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We asked the dealers and the buy side what they think about the probability that the global economy would be in recession six months from now using the IMF definition.	12.0	999.0
201603	608	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The probability has moved up since we’ve been asking the question and is just over 20 percent.	12.0	999.0
201603	609	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	So that’s in the ballpark of this estimate.	12.0	999.0
201603	610	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	That’s just a subjective one, but it has moved up.	12.0	999.0
201603	611	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, if you want to come to the Committee, come with a memo that summarizes 10 different models of global recession probabilities—and show me how the assumptions matter, something like that.	12.0	94.0
201603	612	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12.0	65.0
201603	613	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A lot of this meeting is about how we think about volatility.	12.0	90.0
201603	614	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	The stock market isn’t dramatically lower than it was at the beginning of the year, and if you look at both the Tealbook forecast and the SEP submissions, we have an unemployment rate that’s a little bit lower than what we had before.	12.0	90.0
201603	615	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have an inflation rate that’s roughly the same, and yet we’ve moved our interest rate projection over the course of this year by a fairly substantial amount.	12.0	90.0
201603	616	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	So it looks like the volatility wasn’t enough to have dramatically changed our real economic outlook—it doesn’t enter the model.	12.0	90.0
201603	617	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A Taylor rule doesn’t have volatility in it, so it would be looking just at the inflation and unemployment you’re looking at.	12.0	90.0
201603	618	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	How should we process volatility if nothing changed but the mean?	12.0	90.0
201603	619	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	One way to think about it is, the risks have changed, but we’re looking mostly at modal forecasts of the real economy.	12.0	90.0
201603	620	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	And I’m wondering whether our models should be incorporating that volatility, or should the discussion be more about risks that are implied by that volatility?	12.0	90.0
201603	621	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do you have any views in terms of how to think about volatility, both in terms of modal and then thinking about tails of the distribution, maybe?	12.0	90.0
201603	622	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Some, but not great.	12.0	999.0
201603	623	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The most direct channel by which volatility enters our baseline projection directly is in our investment projection, in which we have spreads making a modest but noticeable negative contribution in this round relative to previous rounds.	12.0	999.0
201603	624	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re able, with some effort, to get spreads to enter modestly negatively in our equations for business fixed investment.	12.0	999.0
201603	625	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is an area, as you know, where there’s a very large amount of active research going on.	12.0	999.0
201603	626	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In mid-February, we put out an update to our forecast that had a much more significant downward revision to the outlook on the basis of the volatility that we thought was prevailing at that time.	12.0	999.0
201603	627	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, what remains in the Tealbook is a pretty small shadow of what we showed in February for a couple of reasons.	12.0	999.0
201603	628	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that the turbulence seems to have, to a significant degree, gone into remission.	12.0	999.0
201603	629	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The other is that as we thought harder about the experiment that we had implemented in mid-February, we decided that, all things being equal, just an increase in bond spreads alone was a pretty unusual tail experiment, because what that meant was that all the other financial conditions that we key off are held constant, and that one measure of bond volatility widens out.	12.0	999.0
201603	630	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That turns out to be a pretty far tail experiment.	12.0	999.0
201603	631	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	What we saw in February didn’t look like it answered to that description.	12.0	999.0
201603	632	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It had the bond spreads widening, but it had a deterioration on a number of other dimensions that were already captured in our standard operating procedure.	12.0	999.0
201603	633	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So we decided that the amount of weakening that we had in mid-February probably overdid it.	12.0	999.0
201603	634	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is one of those areas in which I think the intuition that there must be something there makes a ton of sense.	12.0	999.0
201603	635	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve taken a small step toward building that in when the evidence looks strongest, but other dimensions of it may be at work.	12.0	999.0
201603	636	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We haven’t seen it show up in measures of consumer sentiment, though.	12.0	999.0
201603	637	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So households, as best as we’re able to capture that, aren’t reporting that they’re unnerved by the financial developments.	12.0	999.0
201603	638	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The hiring picture still looks pretty good.	12.0	999.0
201603	639	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve looked hard and have thus far been unable to develop very strong evidence that volatility by itself should be having big effects on our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201603	640	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So I think that puts us mostly in the camp of thinking that what we’re talking about is downside risks.	12.0	999.0
201603	641	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I do think the journey that we went through, from the January Tealbook through a somewhat scary period through mid-February and back, took, at least in my mind, a statement about downside risks in our projection that had felt a little antiseptic, a little theoretical, and put some meat on the bones of how it could be that those downside risks could materialize.	12.0	999.0
201603	642	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201603	643	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201603	644	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a 15-minute break.	52.0	65.0
201603	645	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Coffee is ready.	52.0	65.0
201603	646	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And then we will come back and begin our round.	52.0	65.0
201603	648	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, let us resume.	13.0	65.0
201603	649	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And President Williams will start us off.	13.0	65.0
201603	650	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201603	651	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other than energy producers and exporters, my business contacts remain optimistic.	13.0	102.0
201603	652	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s probably because of a combination of the sunny skies and the rain we are getting, which is ending our four-year drought.	13.0	102.0
201603	653	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	They tell me they generally look through gyrations in financial markets.	13.0	102.0
201603	654	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with labor income on the rise and the windfall from low gas prices starting to accumulate, there is more cushion in household budgets.	13.0	102.0
201603	655	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So with the economic data overall meeting or beating my expectations back in December, my outlook also remains upbeat and is essentially unchanged since our meeting in December despite the financial market’s downs and ups.	13.0	102.0
201603	656	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, I have not meaningfully altered my outlook or my assessment of the balance of risks to the achievement of our dual mandate since we raised rates at the end of last year.	13.0	102.0
201603	657	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	As in December, I expect real GDP to grow 2.2 percent this year, above my estimate of long-run growth of 1.9 percent.	13.0	102.0
201603	658	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A lot of the fears from heightened financial volatility that were flashing yellow in January have diminished.	13.0	102.0
201603	659	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, there are still risks to growth from global headwinds.	13.0	102.0
201603	660	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s important to recognize that policymakers overseas have acted forcefully to mitigate those risks, and there are upside risks on the domestic side, as both consumer spending and housing construction still have room to grow faster than expected.	13.0	102.0
201603	661	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another upside risk to the outlook for employment, which I have already made reference to, is that the economy replays its performance of last year.	13.0	102.0
201603	662	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let’s think back to 2015.	13.0	102.0
201603	663	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We added over 2.7 million jobs, we had less than 2 percent growth in GDP, and we saw a 0.6 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	664	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And this all occurred in the face of very weak foreign demand, plummeting commodity prices, and the sharp appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	102.0
201603	665	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the fact that we got roughly 2 percent growth and 2.7 million jobs, points to two things.	13.0	102.0
201603	666	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One was the resilience of the US economy and labor market, and the other was the fact that labor productivity was so very slow last year—following a trend that we have seen over the past four years.	13.0	102.0
201603	667	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as my questions to and discussion with David Wilcox highlighted, I think there is a risk that we could see productivity growth this year be quite slow, which would lead to a much lower path for the unemployment rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	668	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it does bring me to the key question, I think, for looking at the economy over the next couple of years in terms of our mandate goal of maximum employment, and that’s what’s going to happen to productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201603	669	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, my own estimate of potential growth is based in large part on a continuation of the modest trend pace of productivity growth that we have seen over the past decade—that’s going back to 2004.	13.0	102.0
201603	670	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	These weak productivity numbers have been particularly disconcerting for many on the West Coast.	13.0	102.0
201603	671	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is a really strong disconnect between doing the economic analysis concerning productivity and then talking to anybody in Silicon Valley, in the Bay Area, because the pace of innovation in the Bay Area does seem very fast.	13.0	102.0
201603	672	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I haven’t seen flying cars or jetpacks yet, but self-driving cars and commercial drones are clearly on their way and are getting to market a lot faster than many expected.	13.0	102.0
201603	673	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The general reaction in Silicon Valley to the national productivity statistics is denial.	13.0	102.0
201603	674	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reported data must be underestimating significant gains from the information revolution that they are leading, and this led to the famous Hal Varian quip that we don’t have a productivity problem, we have a measurement problem.	13.0	102.0
201603	675	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So to try to reconcile this disconnect between the data and innovation that feels so fast and is changing so rapidly in front of us, John Fernald on my staff and Dave Byrne here at the Board, along with Marshall Reinsdorf, wrote a paper that they presented at the Brookings Institution last Thursday.	13.0	102.0
201603	676	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And they looked at the contribution of free digital services, like Google, Wikipedia, and Facebook, which have clearly been deeply interwoven into the fabric of everyday life.	13.0	102.0
201603	677	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, consumers don’t pay for these services, so they don’t show up in the national accounts.	13.0	102.0
201603	678	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, the best estimates suggest that even if we were to somehow come up with prices for these services, they’re still such a small factor that they wouldn’t offset the drop in productivity growth that we have seen in the past decade.	13.0	102.0
201603	679	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A second area that they examined is the mismeasurement of prices for IT hardware and software.	13.0	102.0
201603	680	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We know that the measurement of prices of IT and communications equipment are misstated, that, in general, the prices are overstated.	13.0	102.0
201603	681	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But in their paper, in a careful analysis, they find there is no evidence that this overstatement of prices has in any way gotten worse as productivity growth has slowed.	13.0	102.0
201603	682	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, after doing all of their careful calculations, they think that mismeasurement actually boosts productivity growth more during the late ’90s and early 2000s, the period of the tech boom, than it does during the past decade.	13.0	102.0
201603	683	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, when you adjust the data for the best measures we have of the true underlying quality of these investment goods, the slowdown in business-sector labor productivity since 2004 has actually been larger than is reported in the data.	13.0	102.0
201603	684	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the factors that I think we know, but it’s important to emphasize, is that domestic production of IT equipment is a much smaller share of the economy than it used to be.	13.0	102.0
201603	685	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, if you think about the ’90s and the tech boom, we were building a lot of computers and IT equipment.	13.0	102.0
201603	686	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most of the equipment is now being built abroad, so it shows up in export and import prices.	13.0	102.0
201603	687	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t affect US GDP and productivity the same way it used to.	13.0	102.0
201603	688	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I think that’s an important factor explaining why the ’90s and today are different.	13.0	102.0
201603	689	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the bottom line of their work is that mismeasurement of innovation accounts for very little of the weakness in productivity growth that we have seen for, now, 11 years.	13.0	102.0
201603	690	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, in common with the finding in Bob Gordon’s work, they view the slow growth as actually being real.	13.0	102.0
201603	691	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s genuine.	13.0	102.0
201603	692	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s not an issue of mismeasurement.	13.0	102.0
201603	693	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the days of 2½ to 3 percent real output growth on a sustainable basis are over, at least for now, and my longer-run projection of productivity growth and potential output recognizes this lower benchmark for what our longer- run potential is.	13.0	102.0
201603	694	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Also, on the basis of the fact that my view of potential output growth is lower than it used to be, and that this is not a reflection of mismeasurement, it also argues the case that r* is lower.	13.0	102.0
201603	695	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	As in the Laubach-Williams model, there is roughly a one-to-one relationship with the neutral real rate and potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201603	696	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So my current estimate of r*, the equilibrium real interest rate, is 1¼ percent, the same as it was back in December.	13.0	102.0
201603	697	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead with above-trend GDP growth this year, my projection has the labor market overshooting full employment by a substantial margin.	13.0	102.0
201603	698	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I expect we will see unemployment at about 4½ percent by the end of the year.	13.0	102.0
201603	699	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But with monetary policy normalization occurring over the next few years, we are going to need to see output growth somewhat below potential in 2017 and 2018 in order to bring the unemployment rate slowly back to my 5 percent estimate of the natural rate by late 2018.	13.0	102.0
201603	700	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The sustained period of labor market overheating will put upward pressure on inflation and offset some of the lingering disinflationary pressures associated with the pass-through of lower import and energy costs into core prices.	13.0	102.0
201603	701	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The news on inflation, in my view, has generally been good.	13.0	102.0
201603	702	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The January jump in the core PCE to 1.7 percent and the trimmed mean to 1.9 shouldn’t be dismissed completely as statistical noise.	13.0	102.0
201603	703	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would also note that the forces weighing on import inflation from commodity prices and the dollar are diminishing.	13.0	102.0
201603	704	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, I continue to expect to see inflation gradually move back to our 2 percent target by the middle of 2018.	13.0	102.0
201603	705	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And for those who would like additional reading on my views, I am respondent number 4 in the SEP.	13.0	102.0
201603	706	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201603	707	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	708	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201603	709	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201603	710	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	There has been an interesting dichotomy between the real economy and financial markets since the beginning of the year.	13.0	90.0
201603	711	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While financial markets have been quite volatile, US real domestic data have continued to be quite solid.	13.0	90.0
201603	712	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	My forecast of real GDP growth over this year is a little over 2 percent, not unlike the average growth we have seen over this recovery.	13.0	90.0
201603	713	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I continue to expect a consumption-led economy that is restrained by lackluster business fixed investment and weakness in net exports, which will be held back by the lagged impact of dollar appreciation and weakness among major trading partners.	13.0	90.0
201603	714	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	This modest growth will be sufficient to cause continued improvement in labor market conditions and for core PCE to reach 2 percent gradually.	13.0	90.0
201603	715	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In essence, my forecast is not that different from my previous SEP submission.	13.0	90.0
201603	716	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of inflation, it remains to be seen how evanescent recent readings on core PCE inflation will be.	13.0	90.0
201603	717	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I view the lower readings on market-based measures of inflation and some survey-based measures as potentially troubling, the recent data on core PCE inflation and some evidence of very gradual increases in wages and salaries now make me somewhat more confident that we will see some pickup in wages and prices.	13.0	90.0
201603	718	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	A study by my staff looking at various measures meant to capture the underlying trend and the 172 detailed components of core PCE finds a modest increase in the trend for inflation in recent data.	13.0	90.0
201603	719	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, we are already near my estimate of full employment, and we are quite likely to exceed my estimate of full employment over the forecast horizon, though not by the amount assumed in the Tealbook.	13.0	90.0
201603	720	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If I were to look at the forecast, ignoring financial markets, and based purely on inflation, unemployment, and real GDP readings to date, my view of the economy and appropriate monetary policy would be little changed from my December SEP.	13.0	90.0
201603	721	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, financial markets have been quite volatile.	13.0	90.0
201603	722	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While stock indexes in Asia have been hardest hit, the S&P had declined notably by the middle of February, although US equity prices in general have recovered much of those losses as of the end of last week.	13.0	90.0
201603	723	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Bank stocks have been particularly volatile.	13.0	90.0
201603	724	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Bank stock prices in Europe were exceptionally hard hit, with declines of 30 percent or more between the beginning of December and the middle of February.	13.0	90.0
201603	725	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Particularly notable was the public announcement by a European finance minister that he was not worried about the financial health of a G-SIB.	13.0	90.0
201603	726	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such a statement is a fairly reliable indicator that we should actually be worried.	13.0	90.0
201603	727	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	13.0	90.0
201603	728	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Given the relatively modest change in most domestic forecasts of the US economy, it was a surprising deterioration in the readings from stock prices and CDS of some of our largest banks.	13.0	90.0
201603	729	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While less dramatic than equity price movements in European banks, stock prices for some of our largest banks and some of our banks that are most dependent on wholesale funds declined approximately 25 percent from the beginning of December to the middle of February.	13.0	90.0
201603	730	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While US bank stock prices and CDS prices have improved quite significantly going into this meeting, I have been surprised by the financial sensitivity of these banks during a time when the real economic data have remained relatively benign.	13.0	90.0
201603	731	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	It does make me worry that major banks may be more financially fragile than I had assumed despite the improvements that have been made in capital positions.	13.0	90.0
201603	732	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, data for the real economy remain satisfactory, while the financial data have been worrisome.	13.0	90.0
201603	733	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	So far, it appears that the financial data in the United States are in the process of converging to an outlook more similar to the economic picture we have received on the real side of the economy.	13.0	90.0
201603	734	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I remain concerned that financial stresses emanating from abroad could leave a larger imprint on our economy as we go forward, but I am heartened by the continued progress in labor markets and the evidence so far that we are likely to grow somewhat faster than potential.	13.0	90.0
201603	735	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201603	736	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	737	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201603	738	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201603	739	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Since our decision to raise the interest rate three months ago, we’ve come through a remarkable period.	13.0	108.0
201603	740	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	For nearly two weeks, until the turn of the year, we were able to take satisfaction from the smooth execution of the increase in the federal funds rate and to offer well-deserved congratulations to our New York Federal Reserve colleagues on that achievement.	13.0	108.0
201603	741	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then came the financial market turmoil through February 11, reflecting, in part, renewed concerns about the Chinese economy, regarding the effects of declines in the price of oil and other commodities, and about whether central banks were running out of ammunition, and the related question of whether negative interest rates could, by reducing banks’ profits, be counterproductive.	13.0	108.0
201603	742	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Our January FOMC meeting and the Chair’s subsequent congressional testimony took place in the midst of the market and media turmoil with her message being the right mixture of “steady as we go” and “our decisions are data driven.”	13.0	108.0
201603	743	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Then, on Thursday, February 11, the tide turned, and we have now virtually returned to where we were in December in terms of the stock market and the continued strength of labor market performance, along with an increase in the price of oil and a probably temporary increase in inflation but with lower interest rates and the memory of an uncomfortable period of volatility.	13.0	108.0
201603	744	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So where are we now?	13.0	108.0
201603	745	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We have had two good but slightly mixed employment reports since the previous FOMC meeting.	13.0	108.0
201603	746	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The 172,000 addition to employment in January was well above the amount needed to hire new entrants to the labor force, and the 242,000 addition in February was impressive and should have reduced concerns about a possibly slowing labor market that the January figure might have raised, especially at its first reported level of 151,000.	13.0	108.0
201603	747	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, labor force participation rates have risen.	13.0	108.0
201603	748	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We had some signs of higher wage growth in January, but these reversed in February, and we’ve also seen an increase in core PCE price inflation, although the rise reflects, in large part, increases in the prices of volatile components and perhaps also difficulties with first-quarter seasonal adjustment.	13.0	108.0
201603	749	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The price of oil has risen, perhaps easing fears that inflation expectations are becoming unanchored, as a positive correlation between declining oil prices and measures of inflation compensation appears to have contributed to a decrease in those measures and then to an increase in recent weeks.	13.0	108.0
201603	750	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That is to say, some of the signs of inflation that we’ve been expecting for a long time may have begun to appear, but hesitantly, implying that uncertainty about their persistence has not been significantly reduced.	13.0	108.0
201603	751	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	More generally, the volatility of the volatility we have experienced recently has to some extent increased uncertainty about the external environment in which the United States economy will operate in the next few months and possibly years.	13.0	108.0
201603	752	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That increased uncertainty about the global economy also includes upside risks, among them the results of the strong measures taken by the ECB last week, the first reports that the Japanese consumption-tax increase scheduled for April next year may be postponed, and the impact of the expansionary measures recently decided in China.	13.0	108.0
201603	753	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Most of all, I take from the experience of the past three months the conclusion that the growth of the US economy is resilient, and that conclusion will be further strengthened if it is supported by incoming data over the next few months.	13.0	108.0
201603	754	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, my uncertainty about global growth has increased, while my confidence about the resilience of the US economy has increased.	13.0	108.0
201603	755	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Let me also take stock of where we stand in relation to attainment of the dual mandate.	13.0	108.0
201603	756	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We are close to the maximum sustainable level of employment in the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	757	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The unemployment rate is close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	758	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The employment situation has improved for all of the major population groups.	13.0	108.0
201603	759	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The participation rate has turned around and is beginning to increase.	13.0	108.0
201603	760	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	These are major achievements, but there is more still to be achieved.	13.0	108.0
201603	761	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	There are still more people working part time than would like to, and wage growth has yet to show a sustained pickup.	13.0	108.0
201603	762	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On the inflation front, the core PCE price deflator for the 12 months ending in January of this year was 1.7 percent per annum.	13.0	108.0
201603	763	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The median 2016 increase in the core PCE deflator projected in the SEP is 1.6 percent, compared with 1.4 percent in the staff forecast, while the median SEP forecast of actual PCE inflation in 2016 is 1.2 percent, compared with 1.0 percent in the staff forecast.	13.0	108.0
201603	764	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The medians projected for 2017 with regard to core inflation and PCE inflation are 1.8 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively, with the staff forecast being 1.6 percent for both.	13.0	108.0
201603	765	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In summary, with respect to employment, we are very close to our target.	13.0	108.0
201603	766	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	With respect to inflation, we are reasonably close to our 2 percent target.	13.0	108.0
201603	767	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And, with the benefit of hindsight, it is becoming even clearer that the divergence between actual inflation and 2 percent over most of 2015 and part of 2014 was primarily due to the effects of the decline in the price of oil and to the strengthening of the dollar.	13.0	108.0
201603	768	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to add a few considerations that we will need to take into account as we make our policy decisions at this and future FOMC meetings, and I’ll raise these considerations in the form of questions.	13.0	108.0
201603	769	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, central to our future decisions will be estimates, explicit or implicit, of the impact on the exchange rate of changes in the federal funds rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	770	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	One safe but unsatisfactory answer is, it all depends on the context in which we make the decision.	13.0	108.0
201603	771	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Among the key factors we will need to consider—and here, I’m going through material that was presented earlier by Beth Anne—are possible policy changes in foreign countries in response to our decision and their feedback effects on us.	13.0	108.0
201603	772	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Perhaps we can get some estimates using SIGMA or perhaps rules of thumb of what are the key variables of policies at home and abroad that affect the impact abroad and the resulting feedback effects on us.	13.0	108.0
201603	773	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	As our knowledge of these connections increases, we will learn whether we will increasingly be taking decisions that are influenced by the feedback effects on us of the condition of foreign economies and of their likely policy responses to our policy decisions, a situation that, if it develops, could put us in the place of the Bank of England in the 19th century, whose decisions were taken in the interest of the United Kingdom but were often also interpreted as being good for maintenance of the international financial and monetary system.	13.0	108.0
201603	774	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Now, these interactions among monetary policies of different countries are complicated and could give rise to game theoretic elements in our and other countries’ monetary policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201603	775	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	It may well be that the more monetary policy diverges across the major central banks, the more it may be necessary to agree more clearly on rules of good behavior for central banks operating in the international system.	13.0	108.0
201603	776	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	This, of course, is related to the implicit or sometimes explicit agreements on policies that lead to changes in the exchange rate.	13.0	108.0
201603	777	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it’s easy to say that it may be necessary to agree on rules, but there will no doubt be enormous difficulties in reaching any agreement on such rules, and it is interesting that yesterday Raghuram Rajan, Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, also asked to have an agreement on rules for how central banks behave, but I think he was thinking about us as the one that needed to have the rule.	13.0	108.0
201603	778	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201603	779	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we were certainly justified in downplaying the importance of the stock market declines earlier this year, but we are all aware of the fact that changes in market sentiment can have a self-justifying effect on the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	780	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, at some point, in the event of a serious and apparently persistent financial market decline, we might find ourselves having to act to stabilize the financial markets in order to stabilize the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	781	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	None of us welcomes the charge that monetary policy contains a “Fed put,” but, in extremis, there may be a need for such a put, if not in the strict sense of the finance term, then at least in regard to the direction of policy.	13.0	108.0
201603	782	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	How should we communicate about such actions, or, as used to be said of the lender of last resort, should we leave such actions shrouded in constructive ambiguity?	13.0	108.0
201603	783	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Third, what lies behind the current correlations between the price of oil and the variety of financial variables?	13.0	108.0
201603	784	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And to what extent, if any, can we rely on the continuation of these correlations?	13.0	108.0
201603	785	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Presumably, if the price of oil reaches high enough levels, the stock market will cease interpreting a further increase in the price of oil as positive for the economy.	13.0	108.0
201603	786	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But the level at which the interpretation will change is far from clear at this point.	13.0	108.0
201603	787	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, how important is it quantitatively if longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored from our target inflation rate?	13.0	108.0
201603	788	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That must depend, in part, on the extent to which movements in longer-term expectations affect short-term expectations or are correlated with them in the many aspects of economic behavior in which short-term expected inflation matters: at a minimum, in the asset markets; in the goods markets, including the effects of expected inflation on investment via the real interest rate; and in the labor market.	13.0	108.0
201603	789	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The staff has recently done some work that goes down this road, but further work would be welcome.	13.0	108.0
201603	790	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Fifth and finally, in view of the uncertainties we face, what should we communicate about the likely path of policy?	13.0	108.0
201603	791	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On this question I believe we need to bear in mind continually the uncertainty that we face today about the circumstances in which we will have to make future policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201603	792	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	On this question, I can offer at least a partial and a local answer, “local” meaning near in time.	13.0	108.0
201603	793	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We should be careful not to say anything that takes either April or June off the table.	13.0	108.0
201603	794	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	We do not know what policies will be appropriate at the times of those meetings, and we should keep our options open.	13.0	108.0
201603	795	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	And over longer periods, we should make clear our expectations for future policies, but also make absolutely clear the considerable uncertainty that surrounds them.	13.0	108.0
201603	796	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201603	797	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	798	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201603	799	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201603	800	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I am heartened by the US economic data since our previous meeting, which suggest further movement toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201603	801	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market continued to strengthen last month, with job growth above 240,000, the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.9 percent, and the labor force participation rate rising noticeably.	13.0	107.0
201603	802	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The turnaround in the participation rate since last summer is particularly encouraging, as it suggests the possibility that labor supply may be more responsive to improved conditions than previously thought, and there may be reasons to believe there is some room for the labor market to improve still further.	13.0	107.0
201603	803	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains 1¾ percentage points below pre-crisis levels.	13.0	107.0
201603	804	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Involuntary part-time employment is still elevated, and wage growth has shown little sign of acceleration.	13.0	107.0
201603	805	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation has also moved closer to our goal recently.	13.0	107.0
201603	806	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in headline PCE inflation moved up to 1.3 percent in January, while core PCE inflation moved up to 1.7 percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	807	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	These moves are encouraging and, if sustained, would be highly reassuring.	13.0	107.0
201603	808	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	However, the broader context suggests some caution.	13.0	107.0
201603	809	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff projects the 12-month change in core prices to move back down to 1½ percent in coming months, and, of course, a reversal would not be hard to imagine, as core inflation has remained stuck in the vicinity of 1¼ to 1½ percent for the past three years.	13.0	107.0
201603	810	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, we can’t entirely rule out the risk that this lengthy underperformance of inflation may be having some depressing effect on inflation expectations.	13.0	107.0
201603	811	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although longer-term inflation expectations of professional forecasters and market participants have remained steady, household expectations have moved lower.	13.0	107.0
201603	812	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In February, 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations in the Michigan survey were 2.5 percent, ½ percentage point below the series longer-run average.	13.0	107.0
201603	813	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Three-year inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s consumer expectations survey have also moved lower in recent quarters, reaching 2.6 percent last month, nearly ¾ percentage point below the level two years ago.	13.0	107.0
201603	814	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More notably, both the TIPS- and swaps-based measures of inflation compensation are down about 1 percentage point from mid-2014 and remain at very low levels, with the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS-based measures at around 1½ percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	815	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	These indications that inflation expectations may be edging down are concerning and, together with the persistent underperformance of inflation, imply that risks remain weighted to the downside.	13.0	107.0
201603	816	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to economic activity, the recent data point to continued moderate growth on balance.	13.0	107.0
201603	817	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The pace of consumer spending looks to have slowed a bit recently, but solid job and income growth, together with elevated readings on sentiment and the boost to household purchasing power from low energy prices, should support consumption growth.	13.0	107.0
201603	818	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And the housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year and should continue to do so.	13.0	107.0
201603	819	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, sectors of the economy exposed to the strength of the dollar or the fall in energy prices have struggled.	13.0	107.0
201603	820	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Net exports subtracted about a ½ percentage point from GDP growth in each of the past two years, and staff models suggest that net exports will be a source of another sizable subtraction this year.	13.0	107.0
201603	821	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The extreme financial difficulties faced by some firms in the energy sector have spilled over into financial markets, in which we saw a pronounced widening of corporate bond spreads.	13.0	107.0
201603	822	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the middle of last year, triple-B spreads have increased about 75 basis points, while higher- yield bond spreads have increased substantially more despite the recent improvement.	13.0	107.0
201603	823	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Bond spreads are a potentially important gauge of financial frictions.	13.0	107.0
201603	824	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	They play a powerful role in some DSGE models that explicitly incorporate a financial sector—such as the New York Federal Reserve’s DSGE model—and, of course, spreads have proven to be one of the more accurate harbingers of recessions.	13.0	107.0
201603	825	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although much of the recent increase is concentrated in energy, which likely weakens the signal for the overall economy, spreads have also increased notably outside the energy sector on net.	13.0	107.0
201603	826	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, the substantial financial volatility and tightening that we saw from early January through late February was quite sobering.	13.0	107.0
201603	827	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	On net, since that time, financial conditions have eased somewhat and now look less adverse for the US outlook.	13.0	107.0
201603	828	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s possible these reflect improvements in some underlying drivers.	13.0	107.0
201603	829	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, some have seen recent movements in oil prices as a possible inflection point underpinned by a rumored agreement among some of the major producers.	13.0	107.0
201603	830	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, the broader foreign environment remains highly uncertain.	13.0	107.0
201603	831	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	What has fundamentally changed on China?	13.0	107.0
201603	832	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The answer is, “Not much.”	13.0	107.0
201603	833	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent news doesn’t materially change the risks concerning China’s path forward.	13.0	107.0
201603	834	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Policymakers have signaled a commitment to some more fiscal stimulus this year, but China’s data on trade, retail sales, and PMIs have been relatively downbeat.	13.0	107.0
201603	835	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Central bank communication has soothed markets, and the exchange rate has been relatively stable against the designated basket of currencies since Golden Week, but so, too, has the dollar.	13.0	107.0
201603	836	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	And the institutional framework and lack of transparency on monetary policy communications, decisionmaking, and even the basic objective function have not changed.	13.0	107.0
201603	837	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Similarly, tough policy tradeoffs remain unchanged.	13.0	107.0
201603	838	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Policymakers confront a sharp slowing in the goods sector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign assets.	13.0	107.0
201603	839	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	A further slowing in growth, continued increases in leverage, and capital outflow pressures, along with a further weakening in the RMB, are all still possible outcomes.	13.0	107.0
201603	840	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, sources of economic strength across the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively greater.	13.0	107.0
201603	841	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since mid-2014, the IMF has repeatedly revised down its projections of 2015 growth, with these downward revisions now accumulating to 1 percentage point, and incoming data have similarly led the Board’s staff to mark down further its projection of foreign growth this year.	13.0	107.0
201603	842	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Commodity producers and countries with strong trade ties to China face difficult adjustments.	13.0	107.0
201603	843	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Growth in advanced economies remains extremely weak despite recent moves to reinforce extraordinary monetary accommodation.	13.0	107.0
201603	844	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In Japan, activity contracted last quarter, and growth for the year as a whole was only ¾ percent.	13.0	107.0
201603	845	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In the euro area, growth was only 1¼ percent last quarter, and the mixed financial market reaction to recent announcements of further accommodation by the BOJ, ECB, and Riksbank has contributed to questions about whether foreign policymakers might confront limits, or at least tradeoffs, in their policy responses upon reaching a policy-rate lower bound, if additional unexpected adverse developments were to arise.	13.0	107.0
201603	846	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Weak global growth and low global inflation magnify both the risks and consequences of adverse shocks, and it’s not clear whether policymakers across the globe will be able to deploy all of the necessary tools in order to address these risks adequately.	13.0	107.0
201603	847	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As we’ve seen, this can lead to strong dollar appreciation and increased concern about downside risks to growth globally in financial markets, spilling across our borders.	13.0	107.0
201603	848	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As I said earlier, recent weeks have seen an easing in financial conditions, supporting a recovery in equity markets and relieving pressure on the dollar, which is now 2 percent below its trade-weighted value earlier in the winter.	13.0	107.0
201603	849	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	One thing that has changed is the market’s expectations surrounding the FOMC’s path.	13.0	107.0
201603	850	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Changes in the expectations surrounding the policy rate path coincide with material reductions in important long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates and rates for higher-grade corporate bonds.	13.0	107.0
201603	851	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Since the time corporate bond spreads started to rise, OIS quotes suggest that expectations regarding the federal funds rate at the end of this year and the end of 2017 are down close to 35 basis points and 75 basis points, respectively.	13.0	107.0
201603	852	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Current OIS quotes are consistent with one further rate increase this year, while the median of primary dealer and market participants’ modal forecasts is of two rate increases.	13.0	107.0
201603	853	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s thus quite likely that if we were to signal a materially steeper path, we would see a broader financial tightening in anticipation, perhaps reversing all or some of the important easing in financial conditions we have seen in recent weeks.	13.0	107.0
201603	854	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s thus important that we take into account this endogeneity of financial conditions and their implications for the US outlook as we choose our words and actions in response to the evolution of the economy, a topic to which we return tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201603	855	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201603	856	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	857	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201603	858	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201603	859	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Information received since the previous FOMC meeting indicates that business conditions in the Eighth District have been mixed.	13.0	94.0
201603	860	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Business contacts report strengthening wage pressures and modest employment growth.	13.0	94.0
201603	861	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	However, reports also suggest that first quarter sales were generally unchanged compared with one year ago.	13.0	94.0
201603	862	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The outlook for local economic conditions deteriorated relative to our December 2015 survey of contacts.	13.0	94.0
201603	863	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Respondents who marked down their outlook generally emphasized the negative impact of relatively low agricultural and energy prices.	13.0	94.0
201603	864	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	An uptick in commercial construction activity was the most cited reason for a positive outlook.	13.0	94.0
201603	865	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	District housing market conditions continue to improve.	13.0	94.0
201603	866	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Real estate contacts noted that 2016 has started off well, and they are expecting strong growth.	13.0	94.0
201603	867	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Data on sales, building permits, and prices are consistent with contacts’ assessment of the housing market.	13.0	94.0
201603	868	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few remarks on the national outlook.	13.0	94.0
201603	869	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	From the St Louis perspective, real GDP growth was disappointing in the second half of 2015 and does not look like it will be particularly robust in the first half of 2016.	13.0	94.0
201603	870	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciated President Williams’s comments on potential growth earlier.	13.0	94.0
201603	871	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, we at the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis have marked down our real GDP forecast for 2016 into the 2.0 to 2.5 percent range.	13.0	94.0
201603	872	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This marks the end of a sequence of St.	13.0	94.0
201603	873	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Louis forecasts obtained from our empirical model, which called for at least a several-quarter period of real GDP growth markedly above trend.	13.0	94.0
201603	874	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This lower growth outlook in turn suggests that policy recommendations may be somewhat less aggressive than previously called for in our SEP.	13.0	94.0
201603	875	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	On labor markets, inflation, and the global outlook, however, recent data have been consistent with our previous projections.	13.0	94.0
201603	876	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of these data alone, I think there is a strong case to be made that the Committee is today more or less where it expected to be last December, and, therefore, that the Committee should be more strongly considering a follow-up increase in the policy rate than we apparently are.	13.0	94.0
201603	877	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is an important matter for the Committee, as it reflects on the time consistency of monetary policy.	13.0	94.0
201603	878	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If we did not think we would move in a certain state of the world, arguably we should not have said so via the December SEP.	13.0	94.0
201603	879	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	One way to think about this would be that the SEP does not contain all of the variables that are important to the Committee decision.	13.0	94.0
201603	880	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During the past several months, I have become more concerned about the state of longer- run inflation expectations in the United States.	13.0	94.0
201603	881	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, five-year, five-year-forward market-based inflation expectations fell at one point to a post-crisis low, although they have since recovered to still-low December levels.	13.0	94.0
201603	882	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I am not anxious to push a policy of rate normalization with this type of volatility in an important measure of the credibility of the Committee’s resolve to achieve an inflation target of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201603	883	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I have several remarks on this issue.	13.0	94.0
201603	884	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I appreciated the staff memo on this topic.	13.0	94.0
201603	885	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I thought it was nicely done and a good summary of the issues.	13.0	94.0
201603	886	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I think I want to comment a little bit on the high correlation between oil price movements and market-based inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201603	887	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During 2015, at this table, I argued that we needed to wait for oil prices to stabilize before we could assess the meaning of the inflation expectations measures.	13.0	94.0
201603	888	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	However, last November oil prices resumed falling and have been volatile since then.	13.0	94.0
201603	889	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Market-based inflation expectations fell further.	13.0	94.0
201603	890	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, they fell too far for comfort, regardless of whether the oil correlation makes sense or not.	13.0	94.0
201603	891	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And the price of oil correlated with the five-year, five-year-forward inflation rate makes no sense.	13.0	94.0
201603	892	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But whether it’s there or not, these inflation expectations measures have simply fallen too far as of, say, mid- February.	13.0	94.0
201603	893	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Generally speaking, across the maturity spectrum, inflation compensation has declined 100 basis points from July 2014.	13.0	94.0
201603	894	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I would regard July 2014 as a satisfactory level for inflation expectations in the United States, so the recent lows were well off that level.	13.0	94.0
201603	895	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Third, I regard these market-based compensation numbers as good indicators of inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201603	896	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In a model, on account of the credibility of the monetary authority, these measures should not change much, especially the five-year, five-year-forward rate.	13.0	94.0
201603	897	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In the real world, the central bank does not have perfect credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	898	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The TIPS measures could be interpreted as a day- by-day measure of FOMC credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	899	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	During the intermeeting period, the five-year, five-year- forward rate fell below 1.5 percent, a value that I would consider the outer bound of where I’d like to see that number go.	13.0	94.0
201603	900	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There is a literature, often cited here, based in part on affine term structure models, that attempts to decompose inflation compensation into inflation expectations, a risk premium, and a liquidity premium.	13.0	94.0
201603	901	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do not find these decompositions very convincing, because there are a lot of ways in which to accomplish the decomposition, with quite different implications for the volatility of the various components.	13.0	94.0
201603	902	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, I’d prefer to interpret risk premiums and liquidity premiums as relatively stable and the overall inflation compensation as a rough barometer of inflation expectations and, hence, of FOMC credibility.	13.0	94.0
201603	903	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Fourth, I would add that I do not find survey measures very useful because they do not respond very much to incoming data and therefore don’t help us much via signaling.	13.0	94.0
201603	904	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, market-based inflation expectations have rebounded in recent weeks, but I remain concerned that they fell as far as they did during the intermeeting period, and I would like reassurance that they have stabilized during the coming months.	13.0	94.0
201603	905	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In short, I think we ignore market-based inflation expectations at our peril, and we should not downplay movements as much as we typically do.	13.0	94.0
201603	906	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201603	907	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	908	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201603	909	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	910	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to improve, and there are even signs that manufacturing has bottomed out and may be growing once again, albeit slowly.	13.0	999.0
201603	911	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth is strong, consumer spending remains healthy, and commercial construction continues to grow modestly.	13.0	999.0
201603	912	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, however, residential construction has weakened, and house price appreciation is a good bit more restrained.	13.0	999.0
201603	913	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	After six straight months in negative territory, our Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey bounced back strongly in March.	13.0	999.0
201603	914	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The general activity index now stands at 12.4, which is slightly above its nonrecessionary average of 9.9.	13.0	999.0
201603	915	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Strength was seen both in new orders and especially shipments.	13.0	999.0
201603	916	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Further, inventories continued to be drawn down, but there’s no evidence of any significant improvement in job growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	917	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There’s also no evidence of any price pressures, either for prices paid or prices received.	13.0	999.0
201603	918	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Area manufacturers are also significantly more upbeat than they were in February, with the diffusion index for future activity jumping 11 points, to 28.8.	13.0	999.0
201603	919	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As well, all future subindexes reflected a rebound in optimism.	13.0	999.0
201603	920	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As this is only one report and we don’t want to be data point dependent, I would not wish to get overly carried away by it.	13.0	999.0
201603	921	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	But it does appear that manufacturing in the Third District may have bottomed out and may even be showing signs of slow growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	922	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly, as reflected by our NBOS headline activity index of 25.6 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	923	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The index is now only slightly below its nonrecessionary average of 29.7.	13.0	999.0
201603	924	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There is also some evidence of inflationary pressures building in this sector, as the prices-received index increased to 22.4 and continues to remain above the level that is typical in an expansion.	13.0	999.0
201603	925	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Expectations of future activity also rose modestly in February and remain solidly in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201603	926	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Our Beige Book contacts report a slight weakening in some sectors in the region, with homebuilding and loan activity declining slightly.	13.0	999.0
201603	927	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Unlike the nation, housing permits actually declined in January.	13.0	999.0
201603	928	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	For the three states in the District, house prices continue to rise but at a less rapid pace than for the nation.	13.0	999.0
201603	929	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	On the positive side, auto sales remain brisk and commercial construction continues to be a source of strength.	13.0	999.0
201603	930	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The Philadelphia staff also constructs coincident indexes for all 50 states.	13.0	999.0
201603	931	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The indexes are based on statewide employment growth, unemployment, hours worked in manufacturing, and wage growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	932	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Looking at each state index, we now see seven states that are experiencing negative growth, most of them with significant reliance on the energy sector.	13.0	999.0
201603	933	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That is a higher number of states than we have seen in the recent past, so we analyzed whether this represented a harbinger of a significant downturn in economic activity.	13.0	999.0
201603	934	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	We did this by creating a diffusion index using the percentage of states that were growing more than 0.1 percentage point minus the percentage of states contracting more than 0.1 percentage point—and that was computed as a three-month rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	935	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	That index stands at 82, which is a very healthy number.	13.0	999.0
201603	936	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Although we have not done any formal statistical work, it appears that one generally needs at least two consecutive quarters for which the index is below 50 before a recession would occur.	13.0	999.0
201603	937	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	For the nation as a whole, the economy looks to be in better shape than it did in our previous meeting.	13.0	999.0
201603	938	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets remain robust.	13.0	999.0
201603	939	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Consumption appears to be picking up.	13.0	999.0
201603	940	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	And, as in my District, manufacturing may well have bottomed out.	13.0	999.0
201603	941	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Further, recent data on inflation, coupled with the findings contained in the excellent Board staff memo on longer-term inflation expectations, lead me to be more sure that inflation expectations continue to be well anchored and that inflation will return to target, although we have the concerns that President Bullard and others have expressed.	13.0	999.0
201603	942	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	My current forecast of the economy is informed by work by Shigeru Fujita on our staff on the effect that the increasing rate of retirement will have on the behavior of labor force participation.	13.0	999.0
201603	943	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	He finds that over the next three years, the labor force participation rate is likely to fall 1.2 percentage points because of the increase in the retirement rate resulting from the continued aging of our workforce.	13.0	999.0
201603	944	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The retirement rate continues to decline after 2018, and it is projected to decline 4 percentage points over the next 10 years.	13.0	999.0
201603	945	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	His estimates of labor force participation are in line with the estimates made by Aaronson and others here at the Board.	13.0	999.0
201603	946	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Incorporating the effects of falling participation rates leads me to slightly downgrade my view on employment growth and hence output growth from my previous forecast.	13.0	999.0
201603	947	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	The fall in the growth rate of the labor force may place a bit more upward pressure on wage growth, and that could lead to inflation.	13.0	999.0
201603	948	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I regard this as placing more upside risk on my inflation projection, but I haven’t as yet marked up my inflation projection.	13.0	999.0
201603	949	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	To summarize, I still believe that we will see economic activity rebound to about 2 percent this quarter, then grow a bit above trend for the rest of the year.	13.0	999.0
201603	950	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Growth will then gradually slow to a trend-like rate by 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	951	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	This is the same contour as my previous projection, but it takes into account a slightly lower trend growth rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	952	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I anticipate growth of around 2.3 percent this year and next, falling to 2.1 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	953	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I now anticipate that the unemployment rate will drop to 4.7 percent by the end of the year and 4.4 percent by the end of 2017 and remain there in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	954	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	In light of first-quarter weakness in headline PCE inflation, I forecast that inflation will be 1.2 percent this year and move up to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	955	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I also see gradual firming in core PCE inflation and project that core PCE inflation will be 1.6 percent this year and rise to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	956	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, my forecast is pretty much in line with that as presented in this month’s Tealbook.	13.0	999.0
201603	957	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	958	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	959	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201603	960	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201603	961	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I will start, as always, with energy.	13.0	110.0
201603	962	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There will be a time in the future when we won’t start with energy.	13.0	110.0
201603	963	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Since the previous FOMC meeting, as Beth Anne mentioned, there was an announcement of discussions of a production freeze between OPEC members and Russia.	13.0	110.0
201603	964	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our own view is, the actual supply–demand impact of this agreement is questionable, particularly as the parties involved are all operating basically at capacity.	13.0	110.0
201603	965	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And the one party that is relevant, Iran, has explicitly said they will not participate in this agreement and they won’t freeze their supply until they reach the presanction production level, which is approximately 3 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201603	966	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In the previous meeting, I said we thought that during 2016, excess supply would average about a million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201603	967	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I said we thought we’d end 2016 with an excess supply of about 500,000 barrels per day, and we thought we’d reach some level of daily supply–demand balance probably by mid-2017.	13.0	110.0
201603	968	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And although there’s disagreement, I must say that the data we’ve seen since the previous meeting are to the downside on all of these measures, and I’ll come back to that.	13.0	110.0
201603	969	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think if we’re wrong about being in balance, it will take longer.	13.0	110.0
201603	970	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Here’s why.	13.0	110.0
201603	971	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The International Energy Agency has been very public in saying they are much more optimistic than we are about this forecast.	13.0	110.0
201603	972	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They think we’ll end 2016 close to balance, but they’re counting on very significant supply reductions in the United States.	13.0	110.0
201603	973	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The issue is, the shale industry in the United States is about 4 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201603	974	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This is relative to world production and petroleum/petroleum equivalents of about 96 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201603	975	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And what we’ve seen so far is, despite substantial cap-ex cuts and draconian cuts further in 2016, supply reductions have been slow to materialize.	13.0	110.0
201603	976	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And when they have materialized, they’ve been dwarfed by increases of supply outside the United States by Russia, in the Gulf of Mexico, and by Iran.	13.0	110.0
201603	977	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’re skeptical that we can see enough supply cuts in the last half of this year to help offset what is going on in the rest of the world.	13.0	110.0
201603	978	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And, in fact, our own estimate is that, for all the pain and suffering we’ve been through, we think global supply will actually increase slightly from 2015 to 2016 and then will flatten from 2016 to 2017.	13.0	110.0
201603	979	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So why are people, including us, calling for balance?	13.0	110.0
201603	980	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the things that we are relying on is, we still expect global demand to grow almost 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201603	981	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So even if global supply simply flattens, because of ongoing demand growth, we will eventually get into balance.	13.0	110.0
201603	982	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Here are a couple of other reasons why the price may have firmed recently.	13.0	110.0
201603	983	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think people in the market probably have an unrealistic expectation that there will be additional OPEC action.	13.0	110.0
201603	984	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think this is unlikely because the economic incentive of the individual players is to keep pumping.	13.0	110.0
201603	985	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We think there’s been some amount of short covering—the financial players have been short this commodity, and they’re needing to cover their shorts.	13.0	110.0
201603	986	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The other very significant event that has happened that is very real is, there have been about 2 million barrels of unplanned outages because of pipeline bombings in Nigeria and Iraq.	13.0	110.0
201603	987	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	There’s some uncertainty as to when those 2 million barrels will come back in the market, as we’re waiting for repairs to be made, and we think that has had an effect on firming the price.	13.0	110.0
201603	988	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Our working range on the price of oil is somewhere between $25 and $45 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201603	989	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re right in the middle of that range right now.	13.0	110.0
201603	990	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It would not surprise us to revisit the lower end of that range.	13.0	110.0
201603	991	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We hope we don’t, but we think that is a real possibility.	13.0	110.0
201603	992	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Time will tell.	13.0	110.0
201603	993	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And in the meantime, we really do expect we’re going to see more price volatility; potentially, downside risks; and bankruptcies, mergers, and restructurings.	13.0	110.0
201603	994	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But a lot of the question is going to be, in light of the draconian cuts that are being made in the United States, how far can those supply cuts go and can they offset what’s going on in the rest of the world?	13.0	110.0
201603	995	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And we are still skeptical about that.	13.0	110.0
201603	996	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Not surprisingly, because of energy and the strong dollar, there are clear headwinds in the Eleventh District.	13.0	110.0
201603	997	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Manufacturing remains weak, and in fact is now in negative growth territory.	13.0	110.0
201603	998	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	The services sector is slowing but still growing.	13.0	110.0
201603	999	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston is obviously suffering.	13.0	110.0
201603	1000	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin are still growing because they’re diversified and because there’s a continued migration of people and firms to Texas.	13.0	110.0
201603	1001	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing remains strong except in Houston.	13.0	110.0
201603	1002	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And we’re now down to the point at which the energy industry in Texas is 2 percent of employment and 10 percent of GDP, and that was 14 percent just two years ago.	13.0	110.0
201603	1003	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	So this industry obviously is shrinking in its importance.	13.0	110.0
201603	1004	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We still expect some positive job growth in 2016 in Texas, but risks are clearly to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201603	1005	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	For the nation, our own GDP forecast is very similar to the 2015 outcome.	13.0	110.0
201603	1006	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We expect 1.9 percent growth in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201603	1007	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We do expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline from 4.9 percent to 4.6 percent during the year even as the participation rate slowly ticks up.	13.0	110.0
201603	1008	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe slack in the labor market will decline this year.	13.0	110.0
201603	1009	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	A number of you have mentioned the Dallas trimmed mean.	13.0	110.0
201603	1010	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It had been running at 1.6 to 1.7 percent from early 2014 to the end of 2015.	13.0	110.0
201603	1011	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	It did tick up in January, as President Williams mentioned, to 1.9 percent.	13.0	110.0
201603	1012	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We don’t know that that will be sustainable, but we will be watching the stability and trend of this measure.	13.0	110.0
201603	1013	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We do expect the consumer to remain strong this year because of lower gas prices, a strong dollar, and a strong jobs market.	13.0	110.0
201603	1014	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	A couple of comments on non-US events.	13.0	110.0
201603	1015	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Much has been discussed already about declining estimates for rates of growth outside the United States, and we view the risks for global growth as to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201603	1016	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We are particularly focused on high levels of debt to GDP in developed economies and aging demographics, as President Harker mentioned, not only in the United States, but in most developed economies.	13.0	110.0
201603	1017	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re focused on China, whose growth, as has been said, is slowing.	13.0	110.0
201603	1018	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, the structural challenges of overcapacity, high levels of debt to GDP, and transition to an economy that is based on consumer services threaten spillovers to emerging markets in other countries.	13.0	110.0
201603	1019	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	But we’re more concerned, and I’m more concerned, about the financial transmission of potential devaluation, stock market turmoil, and capital flight from China.	13.0	110.0
201603	1020	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m more worried about that than the underlying economic conditions.	13.0	110.0
201603	1021	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And on that point, we’ve talked about this before:  The S&P 500 derives as much as 50 percent of its profits from outside the United States.	13.0	110.0
201603	1022	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	We carefully track S&P estimates.	13.0	110.0
201603	1023	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	They have been steadily and gradually revised down since January 1, and that continues.	13.0	110.0
201603	1024	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Part of it is energy, part of it is weakness in financials, but part of it is also the strong dollar and weak non- US growth.	13.0	110.0
201603	1025	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Because of that, we believe we will continue to be vulnerable to periodic bouts of financial market tightening, particularly because, on balance, market participants are overallocated to risk assets.	13.0	110.0
201603	1026	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201603	1027	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1028	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201603	1029	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201603	1030	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The reports on economic activity from my business contacts were similar to January.	13.0	91.0
201603	1031	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Manufacturers with international exposure or businesses with a presence in the energy or agriculture sectors continue to struggle.	13.0	91.0
201603	1032	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But I heard positive commentary about the US consumer and a few somewhat better reports on construction.	13.0	91.0
201603	1033	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	For example, my director from Discover Financial Services noted that the gyrations in financial markets and other unsettling news did not have much of an effect on retail sales.	13.0	91.0
201603	1034	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	On a year-over-year basis, his nominal credit card receipts excluding gasoline have been growing at about a 5 percent rate for several months in a row.	13.0	91.0
201603	1035	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	My new director from Illinois Tool Works, a large and widely diversified manufacturing conglomerate, reported continued strong demand from the automotive sector.	13.0	91.0
201603	1036	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	He also said that demand for products used in residential and commercial construction had begun to increase after being flat last year.	13.0	91.0
201603	1037	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But on the downside, their product lines related to capital expenditures continued to be soft.	13.0	91.0
201603	1038	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Others reported similar news.	13.0	91.0
201603	1039	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	With regard to to the economic outlook, the data on spending, when compared with our December SEP, have been broadly in line with our earlier expectation that the labor market has improved somewhat faster, but financial conditions are more restrictive.	13.0	91.0
201603	1040	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Balancing these factors, we left our forecast of real GDP growth in 2016 unchanged at 2.1 percent.	13.0	91.0
201603	1041	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	If you’re keeping score, I’m number one in the SEP packet.	13.0	91.0
201603	1042	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We’re also looking for growth in 2017 and 2018 to average near this 2¼ percent pace.	13.0	91.0
201603	1043	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	However, our assumptions about potential output growth are somewhat stronger than those in the Tealbook, and we currently see a little more slack in labor markets.	13.0	91.0
201603	1044	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, our projection does not overshoot potential output as much as the Tealbook forecast.	13.0	91.0
201603	1045	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	President Williams may be happy to hear that there is some upside potential to our outlook.	13.0	91.0
201603	1046	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A solid labor market and continued low energy prices could lead to stronger household spending than we are expecting, with attendant spillovers to other components of domestic demand.	13.0	91.0
201603	1047	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	However, we do not see these possibilities as being as likely or as powerful as the downside risks that financial shocks could weigh more heavily on credit conditions, household and business sentiment, and domestic spending than we have assumed.	13.0	91.0
201603	1048	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, although I think we’ve written down a reasonable modal forecast, we see the balance of risks to the GDP projection as tilted to the downside.	13.0	91.0
201603	1049	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I want to spend some time now on credit conditions and market sentiment.	13.0	91.0
201603	1050	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Two economists on my staff, Marco Bassetto and Luca Benzoni, ran an interesting empirical exercise to calibrate the effects of an increase in risk spreads in terms of an equivalent tightening in monetary policy.	13.0	91.0
201603	1051	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	For example, how many rate increases is a 50 basis point increase in spreads actually worth?	13.0	91.0
201603	1052	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	They added a financial conditions indicator to a standard macroeconomic-data vector autoregression (VAR) system that I’ve used in work with Larry Christiano and Marty Eichenbaum.	13.0	91.0
201603	1053	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The VAR analysis measures shocks in these financial indicators and also policy shocks in the federal funds rate.	13.0	91.0
201603	1054	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The analysis compared the effects of each shock on macroeconomic variables to gauge their relative effects.	13.0	91.0
201603	1055	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The most interesting results use the excess corporate bond spread index developed by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek.	13.0	91.0
201603	1056	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The GZ spread was featured in the Tealbook box and FOMC memos on recession probabilities.	13.0	91.0
201603	1057	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	From last summer to the end of February, the GZ spread widened considerably.	13.0	91.0
201603	1058	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Marco and Luca use an ARIMA analysis to isolate the unexpected component of this spread widening.	13.0	91.0
201603	1059	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This leads them to estimate that the effects on GDP from such an exogenous GZ spread widening would be roughly equivalent to a 75 basis point tightening of the federal funds rate.	13.0	91.0
201603	1060	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	That’s three rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201603	1061	2016-03-16	meeting	PARTICIPANT	Or one very big one.	13.0	999.0
201603	1062	2016-03-16	meeting	PARTICIPANT	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201603	1063	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Always happy to leave something for the table commentary, I guess.	13.0	91.0
201603	1064	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Furthermore, a GZ shock of this magnitude would typically induce an additional endogenous reaction of FOMC policy to limit the damaging effect on GDP growth, and this is an example of influences that Governor Brainard was discussing.	13.0	91.0
201603	1065	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In the VAR, this response dictates that the federal funds rate falls about 75 basis points over a year.	13.0	91.0
201603	1066	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In the analysis, if the 75 basis point easing was not taken, that would be another exogenous federal funds tightening of that magnitude.	13.0	91.0
201603	1067	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In my notes, I mention how many rate increases that is, but I don’t think that’s necessary now.	13.0	91.0
201603	1068	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201603	1069	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Presumably, the reduction in the SEP median path and the market’s lower assessment of this path are responses to events like these tighter financial conditions.	13.0	91.0
201603	1070	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I can’t stress too strongly that these findings are quite preliminary, and much uncertainty surrounds them.	13.0	91.0
201603	1071	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But they strongly suggest that the recent financial spread widening is worth multiple federal funds rate increases.	13.0	91.0
201603	1072	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition to past financial tightening, a number of our financial market contacts have expressed the view that we could be in store for recurrent risk-off episodes that lead to a downward skew in financial conditions.	13.0	91.0
201603	1073	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	They see these episodes emanating from ongoing concerns over structural issues in emerging markets and their impact on the global economy.	13.0	91.0
201603	1074	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, there are the difficulties around the world in policymakers’ ability to address these challenges at the effective lower bound.	13.0	91.0
201603	1075	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I share these concerns.	13.0	91.0
201603	1076	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Others have mentioned them, too.	13.0	91.0
201603	1077	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	And these downside risks could, on account of their sources, be with us for some time to come.	13.0	91.0
201603	1078	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Let me finish with our outlook for inflation.	13.0	91.0
201603	1079	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The higher incoming data caused us to raise our forecast of core inflation one-tenth this year to 1.6 percent.	13.0	91.0
201603	1080	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We then have inflation slowly rising to near target by the end of the forecast period.	13.0	91.0
201603	1081	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We see the slightly improved higher outlook for inflation as a good modal forecast, albeit one with the risks tilted to the downside.	13.0	91.0
201603	1082	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Although a number of our statistical models expect a good deal of persistence from the recent higher readings on core inflation, we recognize a strong case can be made for the Tealbook’s view that the bump-up in some of the PCE price index components will prove to be transitory.	13.0	91.0
201603	1083	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, the persistently low readings on inflation breakevens and downward drift in some surveys suggest that longer-run inflation expectations may have already slipped below our inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201603	1084	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	At a minimum, they point to a worrisome fragility in inflation expectations and uncertainty about our nominal anchor.	13.0	91.0
201603	1085	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Any meaningful reduction in expectations would make it all that more difficult to reach our 2 percent target.	13.0	91.0
201603	1086	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This is the biggest downside risk of all to our inflation forecast, in my opinion.	13.0	91.0
201603	1087	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201603	1088	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1089	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201603	1090	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	13.0	999.0
201603	1091	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Leading into our January meeting, business sentiment had fallen in the Fourth District.	13.0	999.0
201603	1092	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But over this intermeeting period, sentiment has improved decidedly.	13.0	999.0
201603	1093	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Overall activity in the District remains consistent with continued moderate economic growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	1094	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions increased 30 points, from minus 16 in January to plus 14 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	1095	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	This is the best reading we’ve seen in over six months.	13.0	999.0
201603	1096	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Bankers in the Fourth District reported overall credit demand has increased slightly, with commercial lending mainly financing acquisitions or commercial real estate projects.	13.0	999.0
201603	1097	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	One real estate developer reported that banks are becoming aggressive in lending for commercial development, offering longer-term financing and interest rates approaching historical lows.	13.0	999.0
201603	1098	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	He expressed concern about the ability of some developers to roll over maturing credit obtained during the crisis, because of the high leverage in some of these deals and the decline in appraised value since the bubble burst.	13.0	999.0
201603	1099	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The improved sentiment in the District is consistent with the solid and ongoing improvement we’ve seen in labor markets.	13.0	999.0
201603	1100	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland staff estimates that District employment grew 1.3 percent over the year ended in January.	13.0	999.0
201603	1101	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate was 4.9 percent in January, well below the minimum of 5.2 percent reached during the last expansion.	13.0	999.0
201603	1102	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The staff’s diffusion index of hiring activity increased from minus 1 in January to plus 10 in February.	13.0	999.0
201603	1103	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Now, a broader set of contacts are reporting ongoing signs of labor market tightening, with firms across the service sector saying it’s difficult to find and retain workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1104	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Retailers and bankers are now experiencing rising wage pressures for lower-skilled workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1105	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	One Branch director, whose firm assists in placing unemployed workers, indicated that her pool of potential workers has shrunk to those whose skill sets leave them difficult to place.	13.0	999.0
201603	1106	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The relocation of workers in the energy sector has been slow.	13.0	999.0
201603	1107	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Much of the District’s employment in the mining, oil, and gas sector is in Appalachia and eastern Ohio, and those areas do not have diversified economies.	13.0	999.0
201603	1108	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It seems likely that these displaced workers will need to relocate to other areas to regain employment.	13.0	999.0
201603	1109	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	When we’ve been through a period of very high unemployment, as we have during the recession, sometimes it’s easy to forget the types of inefficiencies that occur if the unemployment rate moves too far below a sustainable rate.	13.0	999.0
201603	1110	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The kind of unintended consequences of an overly tight labor market is conveyed by a report from one of our directors who’s a community banker.	13.0	999.0
201603	1111	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Since the start of the year, he’s been visiting many of his clients across the region.	13.0	999.0
201603	1112	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Mayors in several towns indicated that labor market tightness has become a big enough issue that they’ve had to pull back on efforts to attract new firms to their towns, which would be valuable to the community over the longer run, because of pushback from incumbent firms who would prefer not to have to face increasing competition for the small pool of available workers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1113	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the national economy, early indicators suggest the step-down in growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the tightening in financial conditions earlier this year have begun to reverse.	13.0	999.0
201603	1114	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Growth indicators suggest a pickup from the 1 percent seen in the fourth quarter.	13.0	999.0
201603	1115	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff has two nowcasting models that are reported in the Tealbook, and those have been reestimated including the data that have come in over the past week since the Tealbook closed, including today’s retail sales report and PPI data.	13.0	999.0
201603	1116	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Basically, the nowcasts are now about 0.1 percentage point lower than the estimates reported in the Tealbook for Q1 growth.	13.0	999.0
201603	1117	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Financial condition indexes, which had shown significantly tighter conditions in January, eased in February and March, reflecting the increase in stock prices, narrowing of credit spreads, and depreciation of the dollar in recent weeks.	13.0	999.0
201603	1118	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On balance, financial conditions are only a bit tighter than anticipated.	13.0	999.0
201603	1119	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	These relatively fast moves in financial markets point out some of the challenges in assessing the impact of financial conditions on the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201603	1120	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On the basis of available data and anecdotal reports from business contacts, in my view, the underlying fundamentals of the US economy remain sound.	13.0	999.0
201603	1121	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I’ve made some changes to my projections since the December SEP submission, mainly regarding my longer-run projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1122	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In particular, I’ve moved down my estimates of longer-run growth, the longer-run unemployment rate, and the longer-run federal funds rate by 25 basis points each.	13.0	999.0
201603	1123	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	My longer-run growth and unemployment rate estimates had been on the high side of the FOMC projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1124	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But because of the combination of continued improvement in labor markets, moderate growth, and low inflation, it seemed like it was time for me to move toward the consensus on these measures.	13.0	999.0
201603	1125	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I now project longer-run growth at 2 percent, the longer-run unemployment rate at 5 percent, and the longer-run funds rate at 3¼ percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1126	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In response to incoming data, I’ve made relatively minor adjustments to my projections over the next three years, and the narrative underlying the forecast remains the same:  Namely, growth slightly above trend will generate further improvement in the labor market, and inflation will gradually return to our target of 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201603	1127	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	My modal forecast has growth picking up to the 2¼ to 2½ percent range this year and next and gradually returning to trend in 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	1128	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Despite the volatility in financial markets, consumer spending has held up, buoyed by gains in the labor market, low energy prices, and highly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1129	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Housing has also shown slow but steady improvement.	13.0	999.0
201603	1130	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The gains in consumption and housing will help offset continued weakness in manufacturing in sectors exposed to energy and international trade, which I anticipate will remain challenged in the wake of weak growth abroad.	13.0	999.0
201603	1131	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Business investment is something that bears watching, and although it’s just one month of data, January’s improvement in capital goods orders is a positive sign.	13.0	999.0
201603	1132	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets are showing continued strong performance.	13.0	999.0
201603	1133	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe the economy is basically at our goal of full employment from the perspective of monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1134	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	With growth above trend, I see the unemployment rate falling below my longer-run rate of 5 percent this year and next before gradually returning to that level by the end of 2018.	13.0	999.0
201603	1135	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Since its low point last September, the labor force participation rate has risen ½ percentage point.	13.0	999.0
201603	1136	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It’s slightly above its longer-run trend, as estimated by the model developed by the Cleveland Federal Reserve and Board staff.	13.0	999.0
201603	1137	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Certain measures of underemployment, like the number of part-time workers who would rather work full time, remain at higher levels than before the recession.	13.0	999.0
201603	1138	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, businesses tell us they cannot find workers with the skills they need.	13.0	999.0
201603	1139	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I do believe there are longer-run problems, including workforce development issues, affecting US labor markets, and that deep recession and slow recovery have exposed and exacerbated these problems.	13.0	999.0
201603	1140	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But it’s difficult for me to see how monetary policy can be effective in addressing these remaining issues.	13.0	999.0
201603	1141	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And at this point in the cycle, using it to try to do so can be counterproductive because it takes the focus off government programs and policies that would be effective.	13.0	999.0
201603	1142	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The recent data on inflation have been encouraging and consistent with the pattern that has been anticipated by the FOMC.	13.0	999.0
201603	1143	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	As oil prices and the value of the dollar have shown some stability, both headline and measures of underlying inflation have moved higher.	13.0	999.0
201603	1144	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And these moves are not just one month’s data.	13.0	999.0
201603	1145	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Headline and core measures of CPI and PCE inflation have been moving up over the past year.	13.0	999.0
201603	1146	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	As one well-respected economist and monetary policymaker, who happens to go by the name of Stan Fischer, carefully articulated in a speech last Monday, “We may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the inflation rate.”	13.0	999.0
201603	1147	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Stable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics.	13.0	999.0
201603	1148	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Despite some small movements, I view inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored.	13.0	999.0
201603	1149	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Long-run PCE inflation expectations in the SPF moved up this quarter back to 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1150	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Moves in the Michigan survey’s long-run CPI inflation expectations measure are correlated with changes in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1151	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And according to the Board staff memo, much of the decline in this measure since the second half of 2014 can be accounted for by the drop in gasoline prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1152	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The sharper fall in the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations is difficult to interpret because this survey is new and its measures expected inflation three years ahead, which may be more heavily influenced by recent inflation movements.	13.0	999.0
201603	1153	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Many of the market-based measures of inflation compensation have fallen by more than the survey measures.	13.0	999.0
201603	1154	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	An exception is the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s five-year, five- year-forward measure, which is based on a model that incorporates survey measures of inflation expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps.	13.0	999.0
201603	1155	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve measure has been relatively stable at near 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201603	1156	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Like the survey measures, changes in market-based inflation compensation have shown high correlation with changes in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201603	1157	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And in this period of heightened market volatility and flight-to-quality flows into US Treasury securities, I think it’s particularly difficult to discern how much of the moves reflect changes in inflation expectations and how much reflect changes in risk premiums or liquidity premiums.	13.0	999.0
201603	1158	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	So although I agree that it’s very important to continue to monitor all of these measures, so far I don’t see them as alarming, and the movement up in actual inflation is somewhat reassuring.	13.0	999.0
201603	1159	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Hence, if the real side of the economy continues to perform consistent with my projections, I’m reasonably confident that inflation will gradually move back to our goal of 2 percent, likely by the end of 2017.	13.0	999.0
201603	1160	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with that forecast as roughly balanced, with lower oil prices being a downside risk in the near term but an upside risk in the medium run because they may spur stronger-than-expected consumer and business spending in an environment of significantly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1161	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I note that in the chart on page 27 of Tealbook A, which shows the 70 percent confidence interval associated with the staff’s inflation projection based on historical staff forecast errors, the risks are tilted to the upside, not to the downside, throughout the forecast horizon and particularly so for 2016.	13.0	999.0
201603	1162	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Of course, my projections are dependent on appropriate monetary policy, which I continue to believe entails moving the funds rate up gradually over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201603	1163	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Because I have moved down my longer-run funds rate projection 25 basis points, my funds rate path is now shallower across the forecast horizon than in my December projections.	13.0	999.0
201603	1164	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I acknowledge there continue to be risks to the forecast, but I see them as roughly balanced and not much larger than what we’ve seen historically.	13.0	999.0
201603	1165	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Of course, I also accept the fact that economic forecasts generally have fairly wide confidence bands around them, but I’m not ready to call them “lack of confidence” bands.	13.0	999.0
201603	1166	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The volatility in financial markets is a risk to my forecast.	13.0	999.0
201603	1167	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	If it were sustained and intensified, it could lead to a sustained pullback in risk appetites among investors, businesses, and consumers.	13.0	999.0
201603	1168	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But so far we haven’t seen this, and messages from the market can turn around quickly.	13.0	999.0
201603	1169	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	A related risk comes from developments in the global economy.	13.0	999.0
201603	1170	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	If it turns out to be weaker than anticipated, this could lead to weaker growth in the United States.	13.0	999.0
201603	1171	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The actions taken by several foreign central banks to increase monetary accommodation help to mitigate some of this risk.	13.0	999.0
201603	1172	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	It’s good to remember that despite the volatility, despite the pain inflicted on the energy sector from falling oil prices, and despite weaker growth abroad, the US economy has proven to be quite resilient.	13.0	999.0
201603	1173	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I think this should be the message coming out of our meeting tomorrow.	13.0	999.0
201603	1174	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201603	1175	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1176	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201603	1177	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201603	1178	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I haven’t materially changed my outlook from my December submission.	13.0	88.0
201603	1179	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m still expecting growth between 2 and 2½ percent for the year, and my submission for this meeting is at the high end of that range.	13.0	88.0
201603	1180	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Although inflation could soften a little over the next few monthly reports, I still expect both headline and core inflation will be firmer in 2016 than 2015, and I expect further strengthening in 2017.	13.0	88.0
201603	1181	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I asked my staff to do a side-by-side comparison of a list of data elements to identify where, if at all, important indicators were diverging from the basic economic narrative that informed my December submission.	13.0	88.0
201603	1182	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The one element that stands out as weaker is business fixed investment.	13.0	88.0
201603	1183	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Otherwise, real economy performance seems to be consistent with my outlook going into the December meeting.	13.0	88.0
201603	1184	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My view at that time was that ongoing solid growth of domestic demand would likely override headwinds resulting from the uncertain global environment.	13.0	88.0
201603	1185	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Because the key driver of real-side performance continues to be domestic demand underpinned by growth of consumer activity, today’s retail sales report was disappointing.	13.0	88.0
201603	1186	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	However, even with the February report and the downward January revision, consumer spending remains at a relatively solid 2.7 percent annual growth rate in my Bank’s current-quarter nowcast calculation.	13.0	88.0
201603	1187	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My Bank’s nowcast exercise for the first quarter currently has growth coming in at 1.9 percent as of this morning.	13.0	88.0
201603	1188	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As the February data come in over the next several days, the estimate could move, but my sense of the picture reflected in the data since December is, the economy remains on plan, so to speak, with some downside risk.	13.0	88.0
201603	1189	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In my team’s outreach to business contacts this cycle, we heard confirming anecdotal reports—or, put differently, we did not hear reports that cast substantial doubt on our basic narrative.	13.0	88.0
201603	1190	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts report that activity remains reasonably strong, with the exception of sectors connected to offshore demand and energy production.	13.0	88.0
201603	1191	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Retail industry contacts reported solid consumer activity, with expectations of modest acceleration in retail spending in 2016.	13.0	88.0
201603	1192	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Auto sales remain strong, although considerable price discounting and incentives are being used to maintain high sales levels.	13.0	88.0
201603	1193	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the labor market, we continue to hear reports that conditions are tightening even as underlying pressure on compensation growth remains light.	13.0	88.0
201603	1194	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	So, to summarize the rebound in our tracking estimate for this quarter versus the fourth quarter, we see, on net, positive signals on consumer spending, strength of the labor market, and strong reports from the business community.	13.0	88.0
201603	1195	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	All of this generally affirms the view that the fourth-quarter slowing was an aberration—more aberration than signal—and the economy in 2016 remains on a moderate growth track.	13.0	88.0
201603	1196	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	All that said, to present a complete picture, we did note a slightly more guarded tone in the feedback received from business contacts.	13.0	88.0
201603	1197	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Conversations with our directors reflecting their own recent contacts point to an environment of somewhat heightened uncertainty.	13.0	88.0
201603	1198	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	They attribute this apprehensiveness to the recent financial market volatility.	13.0	88.0
201603	1199	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In a survey of business contacts completed last week by my Bank, about 20 percent of our panel of CEOs, CFOs, and business owners indicated they have scaled back their cap-ex or employment plans in response to the recent financial volatility.	13.0	88.0
201603	1200	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	We don’t have good methods of benchmarking this response, so we’re just taking note that one in five respondents appears to have postponed, but not canceled, expansion spending.	13.0	88.0
201603	1201	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This may explain the weaker business fixed investment data.	13.0	88.0
201603	1202	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	My bottom line from all of this is that the spell of volatility experienced in January and early February should be processed in our policy thinking in a way similar to that of last August and its aftermath.	13.0	88.0
201603	1203	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s a bout of nervousness that has raised uncertainty but apparently has not thrown the real-side economy off track.	13.0	88.0
201603	1204	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Just as the October meeting last year was too soon to be comfortable with that conclusion, this meeting may be a little too early to draw such a sanguine conclusion.	13.0	88.0
201603	1205	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The data calendar has not lined up propitiously with the timing of this meeting, but by the April meeting we will have more information—although, to be fair, not the first-quarter GDP report, unfortunately.	13.0	88.0
201603	1206	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	And I will have more to say about the positioning at the April meeting in the next round.	13.0	88.0
201603	1207	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201603	1208	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1209	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201603	1210	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201603	1211	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Weakness in the ag and energy sectors continues to weigh heavily on the Tenth District economy, and growth has diverged between states that are dependent on these sectors and those that are not.	13.0	103.0
201603	1212	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Farm income is expected to weaken modestly in 2016, marking a third consecutive year in the current downturn.	13.0	103.0
201603	1213	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Demand for credit continues to rise.	13.0	103.0
201603	1214	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	And despite reduced cash flow, balance sheets continue to be bolstered by high farmland values, which have only modestly declined.	13.0	103.0
201603	1215	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In energy-dependent parts of the region, the downturn in the energy sector has spilled over to other segments, such as consumer spending and residential construction activity.	13.0	103.0
201603	1216	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The financial condition of many District energy firms has also continued to deteriorate.	13.0	103.0
201603	1217	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In recent weeks, credit ratings have been downgraded, including a four-notch downgrade to one of the largest energy companies headquartered in the District, pulling its debt below investment grade for the first time.	13.0	103.0
201603	1218	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	District manufacturing and export activity continues to contract, and our manufacturing index has fallen to its lowest level since the financial crisis.	13.0	103.0
201603	1219	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With significant layoffs in energy, anecdotes from our District contacts, however, suggest some of the workers are finding other jobs.	13.0	103.0
201603	1220	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Nationwide, I would note the number of jobs lost in this sector since September 2014 has outstripped the number of job losses in this sector during the Great Recession.	13.0	103.0
201603	1221	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	However, analysis by my staff suggests that energy-sector workers appear to have had an easier time finding employment over the past year than they did during the recession, and at better wages.	13.0	103.0
201603	1222	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Other than ag- and energy-intensive areas, the District economy is performing well, with employment expanding, wage growth strengthening, residential construction activity accelerating, and leisure and tourism improving.	13.0	103.0
201603	1223	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	One of our directors, who is from a major railroad shipping company, reported declines in energy-related shipments but also noted improving activity in automobile, chemical, and lumber shipments.	13.0	103.0
201603	1224	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	On the national outlook, my forecast has changed little since our previous meeting.	13.0	103.0
201603	1225	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Despite another bout of volatility in global financial markets, which has at least temporarily dissipated, I expect growth to step up from about a 2 percent rate in the first half of the year to 2½ percent in the second half as the drags due to energy-related investment cuts and inventory overhang run their course.	13.0	103.0
201603	1226	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The outlook for consumer spending looks particularly solid to me in light of the recent data on consumption and employment.	13.0	103.0
201603	1227	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Hiring appears to have somewhat more momentum than I expected, and there is now clearly some upside risk to my medium-term growth forecast if wages rise more than expected as firms compete to fill their openings.	13.0	103.0
201603	1228	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With the quits rate back to its pre-recession average and the hires rate just slightly below its pre- recession average, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the employment gap is essentially closed.	13.0	103.0
201603	1229	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Another positive labor market development has been the increase in labor force participation of prime-age workers over the past six months.	13.0	103.0
201603	1230	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My staff has looked at this prime- age cohort that transitioned from being outside the labor force to being employed in 2015 and found that reentrants were more likely to be highly educated.	13.0	103.0
201603	1231	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Although this is a positive development for labor markets, the available pool of such potential workers is limited.	13.0	103.0
201603	1232	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So as this well-educated, flexible pool of workers shrinks, employers will need to curtail hiring or dig more deeply into the pool of the unemployed for new hires.	13.0	103.0
201603	1233	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I suspect it will be a mix of both.	13.0	103.0
201603	1234	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So I have lowered my unemployment rate forecast in the medium term, although I still anticipate employment growth to slow from its current pace in the future because of slower growth of the working-age population.	13.0	103.0
201603	1235	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, there are risks to this outlook originating both domestically and abroad, and I remain attentive to these expectations.	13.0	103.0
201603	1236	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Appealing to the wit of the late Alfred Kahn, my staff, too, has been evaluating whether the economy will experience a “banana” in the near term.	13.0	103.0
201603	1237	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I knew there was a risk to this kind of a joke.	13.0	103.0
201603	1238	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s no longer a risk, Esther.	13.0	97.0
201603	1239	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201603	1240	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I know.	13.0	103.0
201603	1241	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I’ve gotten the answer that I worried about there.	13.0	103.0
201603	1242	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to watch signals stemming mostly from the energy sector and the effect on financial conditions as well as elevated levels of inventories.	13.0	103.0
201603	1243	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	However, the positive slope of the Treasury yield curve and strong job growth relative to the slower underlying trend due to demographics do not seem consistent with the near-term, broad-based downturn.	13.0	103.0
201603	1244	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	And although foreign growth could certainly disappoint or be an ongoing source of concern, modal forecasts are for it to strengthen in 2016.	13.0	103.0
201603	1245	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding inflation, although the strong reading for core PCE price growth in January may have resulted in part from residual seasonality and other temporary factors, as the Tealbook concludes, I would also note that the four-tenths increase in the year-over-year growth rate since last year has been relatively broad based.	13.0	103.0
201603	1246	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Previous health-care payment changes were a contributing factor, but about half of the increase can be explained by stronger durable goods price growth.	13.0	103.0
201603	1247	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Other measures, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean PCE inflation rate and the Cleveland Fed’s median CPI, have increased, suggesting the rise in core PCE was not primarily due to idiosyncratic factors or issues related to seasonal adjustment.	13.0	103.0
201603	1248	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation expectations appear to be relatively stable, although we must remain attentive to signals to the contrary.	13.0	103.0
201603	1249	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I take some comfort that, as noted in the Board staff’s memo and from my own staff’s research, we have seen declines in the number of forecasts predicting higher than 2 percent inflation—a positive development—and have seen relative stability in the lower end of the distribution.	13.0	103.0
201603	1250	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Also, the distribution of individual longer-term inflation expectations is currently similar to the distribution that existed before the financial crisis.	13.0	103.0
201603	1251	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, as it relates to household views on inflation, I don’t read too much into the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.	13.0	103.0
201603	1252	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Its measure of longer-term inflation expectations is highly correlated with gasoline prices, so it moves dramatically to news about near-term inflation.	13.0	103.0
201603	1253	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In fact, when you drill down to the actual survey questions, I wonder how well consumers are able to respond to the time-frame dimension.	13.0	103.0
201603	1254	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the question “What about the outlook for prices over the next 5 to 10 years?” is then followed by a flow chart to elicit more detail.	13.0	103.0
201603	1255	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So although consumer expectations bear watching, I am cautious about taking too much signal from small moves in this measure in terms of evaluating the anchoring of long- term inflation expectations.	13.0	103.0
201603	1256	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201603	1257	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1258	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201603	1259	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201603	1260	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District appear to have strengthened in recent weeks.	13.0	81.0
201603	1261	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Preliminary readings on our March surveys are quite positive.	13.0	81.0
201603	1262	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	These won’t be released until next Tuesday, so these are preliminary numbers, but the number of responses is pretty high.	13.0	81.0
201603	1263	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The manufacturing index rose from negative 4 in February to positive 10, with strong readings for shipments, new orders, and hiring.	13.0	81.0
201603	1264	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, our service-sector survey rebounded strongly from negative 2 in February to positive 10 in March.	13.0	81.0
201603	1265	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The retail revenue and shopper traffic numbers were particularly strong.	13.0	81.0
201603	1266	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Comments from our directors and roundtable members were also more positive than in January.	13.0	81.0
201603	1267	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Reports from retailers were generally upbeat, particularly for auto dealers.	13.0	81.0
201603	1268	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets were said to strengthen in the District, and reports of difficulty finding qualified workers continued.	13.0	81.0
201603	1269	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	One contact noted that there was an increased availability of workers in their area due to an influx of laid-off energy workers from the west, so perhaps the Fifth District’s gain is the Tenth District’s loss.	13.0	81.0
201603	1270	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Residential real estate contacts were upbeat as well, except for concerns about the supply of buildable lots in some locales.	13.0	81.0
201603	1271	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And commercial real estate appears to be strong across all segments:  industrial, multifamily, office, and retail.	13.0	81.0
201603	1272	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	With regard to the national economy, I submitted a projection of real GDP growth in 2016 that’s just a little bit below what I submitted in December—2.1 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1273	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	This mostly reflects a somewhat lower path for business fixed investment early in this year.	13.0	81.0
201603	1274	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	My outlook reflects an assessment that the downside risks to US growth that we saw in January and early February as a result of global economic and financial developments have largely dissipated, and I see them as having few downside implications at this point.	13.0	81.0
201603	1275	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The strong consumption growth we saw last year was an important influence on my December projections, and I believe the fundamentals for housing spending remain solid.	13.0	81.0
201603	1276	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets have continued to strengthen, and the recent numbers on consumer spending have confirmed that outlook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1277	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In particular, the strength of vehicle sales and consumer sentiment indexes suggest that US consumers have not been deterred by financial market developments.	13.0	81.0
201603	1278	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Residential investment also appears to be on track for strong growth this year.	13.0	81.0
201603	1279	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Business fixed investment, however, has been soft lately, largely attributable to falling energy prices and the strong dollar as well as broader concerns about global economic growth.	13.0	81.0
201603	1280	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	This is one area in which you might expect to see significant fallout from the weakness in US equity markets or global growth concerns more generally, but the effect so far appears to be limited.	13.0	81.0
201603	1281	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We have not heard any reports of material cutbacks from our District contacts, for example.	13.0	81.0
201603	1282	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Some others have reported that as well.	13.0	81.0
201603	1283	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And respondents to the Duke business school’s CFO survey for March, released just last week, expect an average of 2.0 percent capital expenditure growth for this year, down from 2.6 percent for the previous survey in December.	13.0	81.0
201603	1284	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And this hardly constitutes a massive cut in spending plans.	13.0	81.0
201603	1285	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	It’s still consistent with an economy growing near trend.	13.0	81.0
201603	1286	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	All of this is in line with the Tealbook’s forecast that equipment and intangibles investment will show more strength in the second half.	13.0	81.0
201603	1287	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The dollar has retraced in recent weeks, and I expect somewhat less drag due to net exports this year than I did in December—again, consistent with the Tealbook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1288	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The continued strength in labor markets has been remarkable, with employment growth continuing to outpace growth in the working-age population.	13.0	81.0
201603	1289	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	For this year, I expect job growth to slow to levels closer to labor force growth as the unemployment rate bottoms out and moves back toward its longer-term level, which I estimate to be close to where it is right now.	13.0	81.0
201603	1290	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now that the unemployment rate is at or below most estimates of the natural rate and labor force participation is close to estimates of its trend, the share of those working part time for economic reasons is one utilization indicator that remains somewhat elevated relative to pre-recession levels.	13.0	81.0
201603	1291	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	But we shouldn’t look at this measure in isolation.	13.0	81.0
201603	1292	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	For example, job openings are significantly above pre-recession levels relative to hires or the labor force, which suggests that something other than cyclical factors or deficient demand is keeping the measure of those working part time for economic reasons elevated.	13.0	81.0
201603	1293	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	With regard to inflation, it’s certainly possible that the strong January number will turn out to be transitory.	13.0	81.0
201603	1294	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That said, the pickup in January was spread pretty broadly across PCE components, and that leads me to place somewhat more probability on inflation returning to 2 percent faster than we’ve been expecting.	13.0	81.0
201603	1295	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The stability of longer-term inflation expectations is clearly critical to our confidence that inflation will return to target over an acceptable horizon.	13.0	81.0
201603	1296	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And I appreciate the staff memo.	13.0	81.0
201603	1297	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	It provides a comprehensive review of some of the subtleties involved in estimating longer-term expected inflation.	13.0	81.0
201603	1298	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	TIPS-based inflation compensation has been weak in recent months, although it has rebounded in recent weeks.	13.0	81.0
201603	1299	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Extracting measures of expected inflation from observed inflation compensation requires making assumptions of one sort or another, and the results can be sensitive to the assumptions one chooses.	13.0	81.0
201603	1300	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	At this point, I’m persuaded by the analysis I’ve read that most of the variation we’ve seen in the inflation compensation numbers is attributable to movements in risk and liquidity premiums, and that expected inflation has been relatively stable.	13.0	81.0
201603	1301	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Across an array of financial markets, risk premiums have been found to account for a significant portion of the variation in prices, and this is despite the fact that in models, for convenience, we typically make assumptions that imply conditional variances are fairly stable.	13.0	81.0
201603	1302	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I don’t think it should be a surprise if these premiums are driving fluctuations in breakevens, particularly during episodes of greater volatility in financial markets more generally.	13.0	81.0
201603	1303	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	A sizable share of the recent decline in these premiums seems to me to be plausibly attributable to flight-to-quality in response to global developments.	13.0	81.0
201603	1304	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And if so, I think we should expect to see the compensation measures move back up as global uncertainties continue to subside.	13.0	81.0
201603	1305	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Survey measures of expected inflation have also moved down recently, and these presumably are free from the confounding effects of risk premiums.	13.0	81.0
201603	1306	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The staff memo points out, however, that consumer-based survey measures tend to react strongly to retail gas prices, as many others have remarked this afternoon.	13.0	81.0
201603	1307	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And when they adjust the Michigan survey for such effects, the resulting measure is more stable and has not fallen below 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1308	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Expected inflation from surveys of professional forecasters are also more stable and are not below 2 percent.	13.0	81.0
201603	1309	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I still see 2 percent as the effective attractor for inflation over the medium term, and I remain reasonably confident that, barring unexpected developments, inflation will move up.	13.0	81.0
201603	1310	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	To sum up, like many of you, my outlook for growth and inflation is very close to my December outlook.	13.0	81.0
201603	1311	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	As a result, I’m left wondering why our projected policy rate path would be revised down by much.	13.0	81.0
201603	1312	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Presumably, we’ll discuss this tomorrow.	13.0	81.0
201603	1313	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201603	1314	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201603	1315	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In the past six months, financial markets have experienced two significant meltdowns in which volatility spiked, commodity and equity market prices plummeted, the dollar rose, and credit spreads increased substantially as investors fled from risk assets.	13.0	104.0
201603	1316	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Both episodes were tied to concerns of much weaker growth in China and the related possibility of significant depreciation of the RMB—concerns that connected to fears of broader global weakness.	13.0	104.0
201603	1317	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In both cases, the tightening in financial conditions abated by some measures after a period of turmoil.	13.0	104.0
201603	1318	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	But the recurrence of these episodes nonetheless suggests caution to me for the time being.	13.0	104.0
201603	1319	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	China’s management of the RMB exchange rate may be just reaching a more stable footing, although it’s too early to have comfort in that.	13.0	104.0
201603	1320	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	China seems, for now, to be papering over the hard issues that it confronts in its ongoing economic transition.	13.0	104.0
201603	1321	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although these issues will be daunting in the medium term, it is probably still true that China can muddle through in the short term despite a troubling and unsustainable buildup of debt, and risks of even slower growth remain in the near term.	13.0	104.0
201603	1322	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The picture for other emerging market economies is also a challenging one, and the outlook for many advanced foreign economies has also weakened, for example, in Europe, Japan, and Canada.	13.0	104.0
201603	1323	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The ECB’s strong actions announced last week are welcome but, nonetheless, a sign of deep concern, and the Bank of Japan’s surprise deployment of negative rates has so far not been well received by the markets.	13.0	104.0
201603	1324	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The question of whether central banks may be running out of tools is very much in the air.	13.0	104.0
201603	1325	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For the United States, of course, the picture remains a better one.	13.0	104.0
201603	1326	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In January and February, US market participants were highly focused on the likelihood of a recession in 2016.	13.0	104.0
201603	1327	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Many well-known outside economists wrote pieces addressing that question, generally concluding that recession probabilities had increased but remained low.	13.0	104.0
201603	1328	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And that is also the view of the fine staff memo distributed before this meeting.	13.0	104.0
201603	1329	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Meanwhile, US economic readings have held up reasonably well.	13.0	104.0
201603	1330	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For us, the tightening in financial conditions has been unwinding now for over a month, and conditions are now about where they were in December.	13.0	104.0
201603	1331	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Job growth has remained strong, as has consumer spending.	13.0	104.0
201603	1332	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Both household and business sentiment have held up reasonably well.	13.0	104.0
201603	1333	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	After a sharp correction, leveraged finance markets have settled down and show some early signs of recovery.	13.0	104.0
201603	1334	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Spreads have come back in significantly but remain far from fully recovered, and contacts suggest that the pipeline, which was nearly empty a month ago, is showing signs of increased activity.	13.0	104.0
201603	1335	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	So with that background, my modal forecast hasn’t changed much since the December SEP round.	13.0	104.0
201603	1336	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I see growth continuing at around 2 percent, modestly above potential.	13.0	104.0
201603	1337	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I see continued strong job growth.	13.0	104.0
201603	1338	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook calls for a sharp increase in labor productivity growth from the five-year average of 0.5 percent to around 1½ percent in 2016.	13.0	104.0
201603	1339	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And I have stuck with a more-of-the-same approach instead, with productivity increasing but on a more gradual path.	13.0	104.0
201603	1340	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	As a result, with the continuation of strong job growth, my unemployment rate falls to 4½ percent by the end of this year and edges down further in the out-years.	13.0	104.0
201603	1341	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I’m also very encouraged by the welcome increase in labor force participation.	13.0	104.0
201603	1342	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Looking through the ups and downs, labor force participation has now been flat for two and a half years in the face of an estimated trend decline of roughly 30 basis points annually.	13.0	104.0
201603	1343	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Of course, these readings are noisy, but this kind of an increase would be consistent with the pattern of the past two recoveries in which labor force participation rose above the underlying trend late in the cycle, and that would be a particularly desirable and welcome result in this recovery.	13.0	104.0
201603	1344	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, the achievement of our 2 percent objective has once again shifted a bit further out.	13.0	104.0
201603	1345	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I am comfortable with the Tealbook projection, with inflation rising gradually as the effects of lower oil prices and the dollar’s rise eventually fade and the economy tightens.	13.0	104.0
201603	1346	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The reversal of these transient effects should eventually raise underlying core inflation close to the 2 percent objective.	13.0	104.0
201603	1347	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	More fundamentally, though, it is essential that inflation expectations remain anchored around 2 percent, as I believe they are today.	13.0	104.0
201603	1348	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	For that to remain true, the Committee must be credibly committed to bringing inflation back to 2 percent.	13.0	104.0
201603	1349	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I will add that I find that the staff memo buttresses my view that the low market-based measures of inflation expectations need to be handled with care and should not be given more prominent discussion in our communications.	13.0	104.0
201603	1350	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although the modal outlook for the US economy is broadly the same as it was in December, the balance of risks, in my view, has shifted to the downside.	13.0	104.0
201603	1351	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In particular, I continue to see the external sector as an important downside risk.	13.0	104.0
201603	1352	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Overall, the risk of a global recession has increased.	13.0	104.0
201603	1353	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	We will feel weak global demand.	13.0	104.0
201603	1354	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	In addition, weakness abroad in the context of ongoing easing by other major central banks may put further upward pressure on the dollar.	13.0	104.0
201603	1355	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Weak global growth is likely to put a relatively low speed limit on our growth and on the pace at which it will be appropriate to raise interest rates.	13.0	104.0
201603	1356	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201603	1357	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201603	1358	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1359	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201603	1360	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201603	1361	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform relatively well.	13.0	111.0
201603	1362	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Employment is strong in the region.	13.0	111.0
201603	1363	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The unemployment rate in Minnesota, for example, is 3.7 percent.	13.0	111.0
201603	1364	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The global decline in commodity prices, however, is having a notable impact on my District.	13.0	111.0
201603	1365	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Our contacts report that depressed commodity prices, the strong dollar, and a slowdown in global trade have taken a toll on agriculture, mining, heavy equipment producers, and transportation firms that ship those commodities.	13.0	111.0
201603	1366	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The sustained drop in oil prices is having a very heavy weight on the oil-producing economy of North Dakota.	13.0	111.0
201603	1367	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	In addition, more than 2,000 workers in Minneapolis’s Iron Range region have been laid off over the past year, as firms have idled mines and processing plants largely in response to declines in iron ore prices and in demand.	13.0	111.0
201603	1368	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	On the positive side, the construction sector and the health services sector are strong, and companies in the District in the food processing, aircraft, fertilizer, electronics, and medical devices industries have all recently announced large investments and plans to increase employment.	13.0	111.0
201603	1369	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	At the national level, the economy’s performance has also been uneven.	13.0	111.0
201603	1370	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The labor market continues to show strength, with unemployment at low levels and payroll employment growing substantially.	13.0	111.0
201603	1371	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As Governors Powell and Brainard and others have noted, the uptick in the employment-to-population ratio and the labor force participation rate is clearly a good thing.	13.0	111.0
201603	1372	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	You know, in recent years, many people have been focused on the prospect of a lost generation of workers as the long-term unemployed became permanently unemployable.	13.0	111.0
201603	1373	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I don’t want to overreact to near-term data, but it is unquestionably a good thing that we’re seeing people come off the sidelines and back into the labor force, and I would encourage us to continue that process as long as we can get it to go because it’s a big benefit for society.	13.0	111.0
201603	1374	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Inflation is more concerning, however, despite the recent uptick.	13.0	111.0
201603	1375	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As many have noted, inflation is still running below our 2 percent target, and continued undershooting of the target could push down inflation expectations.	13.0	111.0
201603	1376	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, inflation expectations are edging down in surveys and in market-based measures.	13.0	111.0
201603	1377	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Such mixed signals for the national economy are especially worrisome in the context of elevated uncertainty in financial markets and in foreign economies.	13.0	111.0
201603	1378	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Uncertainty about China’s economic and policy outlook continues to be a risk for the health of emerging markets and financial markets in general.	13.0	111.0
201603	1379	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The Tealbook, as we discussed, reports an increase in the probability of a global recession.	13.0	111.0
201603	1380	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Softening of euro-area economies with the added uncertainty about a potential Brexit has prompted a strong response from the ECB.	13.0	111.0
201603	1381	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	But that action only highlights the divergence between our own monetary policy and those of other major central banks—a divergence that poses downside risks for the US economy, including the potential for further appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	111.0
201603	1382	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	In summary, I view the US economy as gradually recovering, but the mixed signals for labor markets and inflation in the context of global risk tell me that the uncertainty continues to be elevated.	13.0	111.0
201603	1383	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201603	1384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201603	1386	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201603	1387	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Like most, if not all, of you, I find that my assessment of the economy hasn’t actually changed much since we did the December SEP, notwithstanding the interesting three-month interval.	13.0	97.0
201603	1388	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	My baseline expectation is still for the US economy to chug along with modestly above-trend growth.	13.0	97.0
201603	1389	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s obviously been, first, volatility and then the stabilization in financial markets between the December SEP and today.	13.0	97.0
201603	1390	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As several of you have pointed out, that stabilization probably has at least something to do with the recalibration of people’s expectations as to what our policies are going to be.	13.0	97.0
201603	1391	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So I want to say a few things in the remainder of my remarks about labor markets, inflation, and the balance of risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1392	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to labor markets, I just wanted to recall that a couple of years ago we were still having a very active debate around this table as to whether the unemployment rate was capturing reasonably well the amount of slack in labor markets.	13.0	97.0
201603	1393	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And some of the issues we were debating at the time included whether there had been a substantial increase in structural unemployment and whether the long-term unemployed would mostly transit out of the labor market completely and, thus, couldn’t really be counted as part of labor market slack.	13.0	97.0
201603	1394	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In retrospect, it seems quite clear that the unemployment rate did not totally capture the amount of slack that was in the labor market and that it did, indeed, reflect dominantly cyclical factors and not an additional quantum of structural unemployment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1395	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think that the way in which the labor market continues to improve suggests that there is some slack remaining, though, obviously, considerably less than when we were having those debates a couple of years ago.	13.0	97.0
201603	1396	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, people have noted the continuing anecdotal reports about difficulty in finding qualified people.	13.0	97.0
201603	1397	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You know, I literally was thinking about one of my very first meetings in my first job in the government, which was with a group of auto and steel executives.	13.0	97.0
201603	1398	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This was in 1979.	13.0	97.0
201603	1399	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And what I still remember from that meeting is one of their complaints—imports was at the top of the list, but right after that, they couldn’t find qualified workers.	13.0	97.0
201603	1400	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I have to say that in the intervening years, in every government policy job I’ve had, that is a perennial complaint of all employers.	13.0	97.0
201603	1401	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	They can never find qualified workers, and so I think we’re always going to continue to hear that, and we’ve got to look at data to determine the degree to which that’s really translating into economic performance.	13.0	97.0
201603	1402	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would also say that there’s a reasonably good relationship between periods in which employers really do have trouble finding qualified workers and, thus, are confronted with either having to raise wages or find productivity increases.	13.0	97.0
201603	1403	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And one of those two things usually results when labor markets really do tighten to a substantial degree.	13.0	97.0
201603	1404	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would expect that we’ll see some combination of those in the quarters ahead.	13.0	97.0
201603	1405	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So adding a couple of points to those that Lael already made on the hypothesis of some continued slack, well, job creation continues to average more than 200,000 a month.	13.0	97.0
201603	1406	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Metrics such as the average workweek and people working part time for economic reasons have been essentially flat over the past six months, suggesting that the ways in which labor markets are improving are such as to be drawing on some slack and not eliminating it.	13.0	97.0
201603	1407	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The number of those out of the labor force but wanting a job is still somewhat elevated.	13.0	97.0
201603	1408	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And now I’ve got a new little analytic observation to put into the mix, since everybody is getting tired of hearing about PTER and the average workweek.	13.0	97.0
201603	1409	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This one our labor economists drew to my attention.	13.0	97.0
201603	1410	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s a little obscure, but it’s actually pretty interesting.	13.0	97.0
201603	1411	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	They point out that although folks have focused on those who are out of the labor force and want a job, the much greater group out of the labor force are those who say they don’t want a job.	13.0	97.0
201603	1412	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And yet approximately 4 percent of that group continues to transition into employment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1413	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And if you look at just prime-age workers, this number is over 6 percent and has been rising over the course of the past year.	13.0	97.0
201603	1414	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So as the labor market improves, and as employers are more motivated to look for workers, even those out of the labor force, oftentimes through informal mechanisms, are recruited back in—a situation that suggests, once again, that there’s still some slack remaining, although obviously not an enormous amount.	13.0	97.0
201603	1415	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And as a number of you have already noted, a pickup in wage increases is still largely in the realm of anecdote despite a couple of data points to the contrary, which have been given to us and then taken away.	13.0	97.0
201603	1416	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On inflation, I’m still not at the point at which I can have reasonable confidence that inflation will return to 2 percent within a reasonable period.	13.0	97.0
201603	1417	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Though let me be clear—I don’t think the prospects for achieving this goal have worsened since December, and I think they have actually probably increased a bit along the way and obviously will be strengthened further still if the one-month increase portends more of the same, contrary to current staff expectations.	13.0	97.0
201603	1418	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The staff estimate that the waning of the energy and dollar effects, which are clearly lingering longer than many expected, will get us only about halfway from the current core PCE inflation rate to the 2 percent goal, and it seems reasonable to expect some effect from further reductions in the output gap, though how much is difficult to say, absent faith in the return of a considerably steeper Phillips curve.	13.0	97.0
201603	1419	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So the remaining work has to be done by overshooting, by the work of expectations, or by some combination thereof.	13.0	97.0
201603	1420	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Expectations have recently bumped off their lows, but both market- and survey-based expectations are still toward the low end of historical ranges.	13.0	97.0
201603	1421	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This is a global phenomenon, which some market participants and commentators attribute, in part, to skepticism that central banks will be able to achieve their inflation goals.	13.0	97.0
201603	1422	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And recently, at least—and I am relying here on, I think it was a really good New York Federal Reserve Open Market Desk survey of developments in inflation expectations—it doesn’t appear that liquidity considerations can account for the recent declines in inflation compensation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1423	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	We’re in a global environment of persistently low inflation with some continuing risk of further disinflation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1424	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In the United States, the combination of the slow waning of some factors and the indeterminate pull of increasing capacity constraints may get us closer to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1425	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But as I mentioned a moment ago, some further energizer is needed, at least in the staff projection, for that final ¼ percentage point from 1.75 to 2 percent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1426	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So those are the reasons why, at this point, I’m still not in the “reasonable confidence” camp, though I may yet get there.	13.0	97.0
201603	1427	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I thought it was useful, though, for my own thinking to consider the other side.	13.0	97.0
201603	1428	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	What are the risks that inflation gets away from us if my absence of reasonable confidence proves to have been—I guess it wouldn’t be misplaced, because it’s an absence—if I should have had reasonable confidence sooner than I did.	13.0	97.0
201603	1429	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I asked the staff to do an alternative scenario that incorporated some pretty optimistic inputs about what would be happening in the US economy, and these are the three key ones that I specified for them.	13.0	97.0
201603	1430	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	One is that the US dollar is immediately 10 percent lower in real terms and remains so through the simulation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1431	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Two, oil prices are up $20 a barrel from the beginning of and through the simulation.	13.0	97.0
201603	1432	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, three, aggregate demand is boosted so that the output gap is The results of the simulation?	13.0	97.0
201603	1433	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, total PCE inflation was about ½ percentage point higher by the end of this year—that’s dominantly the effect of oil prices—and then about 20 basis points higher in each of the next two years, which is primarily the effect of the lower dollar but also a little from overheating.	13.0	97.0
201603	1434	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second, core PCE inflation is only slightly above the baseline in 2016 since oil doesn’t have that much effect, obviously, on the core.	13.0	97.0
201603	1435	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But even in 2017 and 2018, core is less than 20 basis points higher, mostly attributable to the dollar and the stronger economy.	13.0	97.0
201603	1436	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	In the simulation, just to give you some context on the real side, GDP was, on average, ½ percentage point higher through the period, and the unemployment rate was about ½ percentage point below the baseline by the end of this year, remaining at that interval through the next two years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1437	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, the simulation pulled the federal funds rate up about 80 basis points above the baseline by the end of 2018.	13.0	97.0
201603	1438	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, actually, that looks like a rather nice outcome, if we could get it.	13.0	97.0
201603	1439	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But for me, the key point is that it’s hard to see inflation getting away from us even with substantially different real economy outcomes than any of us believe are likely at this time.	13.0	97.0
201603	1440	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, as in all simulations using the staff model, the impact of expectations in holding changes in actual inflation back is pretty significant.	13.0	97.0
201603	1441	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So if expectations become unanchored or if, as I have wondered from time to time, the inflation expectations hypothesis turns out to be more a matter of correlation between measured expectations and actual inflation over the past 20 years than it does a matter of causation, then the increase in inflation could be greater than that produced by the alternative scenario.	13.0	97.0
201603	1442	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if you want to postulate the unanchoring of expectations after a relatively brief period of rising inflation, I think you need to explain why that would happen after seven years in which lower-than-target inflation and apparently substantial patience by the FOMC in getting back to 2 percent has produced only a flirting of expectations with historic lows rather than their becoming unanchored.	13.0	97.0
201603	1443	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I just have to note in passing that as I listen to the conversation around the table, people have now cumulatively disrespected both market measures of expectations and survey measures of expectations, and yet everybody continues to say that expectations are really important, except that we just don’t trust the measures of them.	13.0	97.0
201603	1444	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But I’ll just let that pass for the moment.	13.0	97.0
201603	1445	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, if you don’t think that expectations have that much effect on actual inflation, then what’s your theory for explaining the past seven years and why we haven’t been doing more to return to target if you don’t think that expectations are going to pull us back that way?	13.0	97.0
201603	1446	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I hardly need to speculate as to what some members of the Committee would be saying had we been above target for even a year during that period, much less for seven.	13.0	97.0
201603	1447	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So if you’re sticking with the expectations theory for inflation, I think this alternative scenario should give you considerable reassurance.	13.0	97.0
201603	1448	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And if you’re not, and you want to come over to my self-described pragmatic approach and be more sensitive to actual developments, that’s great.	13.0	97.0
201603	1449	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I welcome the converts.	13.0	97.0
201603	1450	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it’s hard to conclude in either case that there’s a large risk of inflation getting away from us if and as we follow appropriate policy, should a sustained uptick become apparent.	13.0	97.0
201603	1451	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, to risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1452	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Domestically, I agree with President Williams that risks are roughly balanced.	13.0	97.0
201603	1453	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On the upside—I’m not sure this totally correlates with yours, President Williams, but I think they’re consistent—some dissipation of uncertainty in the global economy would probably have a confidence effect.	13.0	97.0
201603	1454	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	If wage increases do pick up, as many expect, that should support aggregate demand even with a somewhat slowing pace of employment growth, and that, in turn, might prompt a little bit of acceleration of business fixed investment, which, as a number of you noted, has been lagging somewhat.	13.0	97.0
201603	1455	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	On the downside, we’ve seen some signs of slowdowns in some spending categories.	13.0	97.0
201603	1456	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Some survey-based measures of hiring expectations are edging down.	13.0	97.0
201603	1457	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The ISM nonmanufacturing index and, most importantly, the orders component of that index have been trending down for about six months now.	13.0	97.0
201603	1458	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So there are some signs that maybe things are slowing a little bit, notwithstanding the fact that there are other signs that things may be picking up.	13.0	97.0
201603	1459	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Eric, I’m not sure you were positing banks as a downside risk or not, or it just was sort of a financial stability observation, but to the degree it was a downside risk, I’m not sure I totally agree.	13.0	97.0
201603	1460	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I do agree with your assessment of the global banks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1461	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But with the US banks, I actually didn’t see as close a correlation with short-term wholesale funding and the relative equity declines of the banks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1462	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll tell you, the correlation I saw was rather more closely with the banks whose business models are being met with the most skepticism in investor markets as to how profitable these institutions are going to be in the new economic and regulatory environment that they currently occupy.	13.0	97.0
201603	1463	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And so in at least one case, a bank that’s not overly dependent, relatively speaking, on short-term wholesale funding continues to take the biggest hits to its equity price and even to its CDS spread.	13.0	97.0
201603	1464	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I think—but this is just a hypothesis—it’s probably got more to do with whether you can be profitable, whether you have to make more changes, particularly as more regulation directed at the SIFIs comes online.	13.0	97.0
201603	1465	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if risks are roughly balanced domestically, I think internationally they’re decidedly weighted to the downside.	13.0	97.0
201603	1466	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not like the global economy is falling apart, and Beth Anne made this point, I think, in her initial remarks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1467	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with those of you who have said that markets probably overreacted both late last summer and in the January–February period.	13.0	97.0
201603	1468	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the ECB and the Bank of Japan are both struggling to produce a monetary policy that achieves even very modest growth.	13.0	97.0
201603	1469	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	There’s essentially no chance for a rapid pickup in growth in those rather important economies.	13.0	97.0
201603	1470	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	China should be okay—I think Governor Powell hit the nail on the head.	13.0	97.0
201603	1471	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	For the next six months or so, China should be fine.	13.0	97.0
201603	1472	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I’m pretty certain that nothing bad is going to happen between now and the G-20 meetings.	13.0	97.0
201603	1473	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But after that, there are some problems that they’re going to have to confront, and they pose as more of a medium-term risk.	13.0	97.0
201603	1474	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, there’s not all that much upside risk that they’re going to go back to 9 or 10 percent growth over the next several years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1475	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Emerging markets are in an extended period of readjustment to less-attractive export markets due to China’s slowing, sluggish growth of mature economies, the related end of the so- called commodity supercycle, and the big shifts in capital flows that have occurred over the past couple of years.	13.0	97.0
201603	1476	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Again, it doesn’t seem as though a crisis is likely.	13.0	97.0
201603	1477	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You know, even in Brazil, the economics suggest hard times rather than a crisis, although politics may push them over the edge.	13.0	97.0
201603	1478	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But it’s still a very vulnerable position, and that’s the way I assess the global economy more generally.	13.0	97.0
201603	1479	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The baseline is not for a global recession, although I found the staff work that Beth Anne presented very valuable in thinking about the increased risks.	13.0	97.0
201603	1480	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the odds are up, to some degree—exactly how much, we don’t know—and most importantly, from my point of view, the world economy is very vulnerable to any form of adverse shock, whatever its origin, whether it’s economic, geopolitical, or something else that we can conjure up.	13.0	97.0
201603	1481	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, thus, we would see not only the modeled effects on the US economy, which will probably only be moderate, but, as Rob points out, some of the flow through to the earnings of US companies, which are increasingly important, and also the harder-to-quantify but very real risk-off sentiment that would occur if you had that kind of global reaction to some external shock.	13.0	97.0
201603	1482	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So it’s for that reason that, while not wanting to overstate it, I think the risks really are on the downside globally and pretty significantly so, thereby offsetting, in my mind at least, the roughly balanced risks that you’d see if you just looked in an insular fashion at the United States.	13.0	97.0
201603	1483	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201603	1484	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201603	1485	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201603	1486	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1487	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, we’re pretty much like everybody else.	13.0	96.0
201603	1488	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We haven’t changed our forecast of growth or inflation much for 2016.	13.0	96.0
201603	1489	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, we’ve lowered GDP growth a couple of tenths to 2.1 percent fourth quarter over fourth quarter.	13.0	96.0
201603	1490	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That reflects several factors, including the weaker foreign growth outlook and the fact that there’s even wider corporate credit spreads.	13.0	96.0
201603	1491	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On inflation, we haven’t made meaningful changes to our forecast.	13.0	96.0
201603	1492	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are crosscurrents here that we’ve discussed.	13.0	96.0
201603	1493	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, the January core PCE reading was quite a bit firmer, so that pushed the year-over-year rate up to 1.7 percent.	13.0	96.0
201603	1494	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t put much weight on that, because it’s due mainly to one month’s reading.	13.0	96.0
201603	1495	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m sympathetic with the Board staff’s assessment of this, that we should discount it until we get some more information.	13.0	96.0
201603	1496	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But at the same time, the fact that the core PCE trend has been flat to higher during a period when we’ve been hit with effects of the firmer dollar and lower energy prices, I do take some signal from that, that we’re not really suffering a lot of disinflation either.	13.0	96.0
201603	1497	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, inflation expectations continue to concern me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1498	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They are still soft.	13.0	96.0
201603	1499	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, maybe this reflects just the drop in energy prices, which is obviously not a big reason for concern, but maybe it reflects the fact that we’ve been running below 2 percent now for some time and this is beginning to weigh on inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1500	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If that’s the correct explanation, then we have to give some weight to that in our decisionmaking.	13.0	96.0
201603	1501	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side of the ledger, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations came out yesterday for February.	13.0	96.0
201603	1502	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think Governor Brainard referenced this.	13.0	96.0
201603	1503	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	It showed an uptick in both the one-year and three-year median inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1504	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We were at the all-time low for this survey, but the one-year ticked up to 2.7 percent from 2.4, and the three-year, to 2.6 percent from 2.5.	13.0	96.0
201603	1505	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, these figures are still very low relative to the past history of the surveys, but I view the upticks as mildly encouraging.	13.0	96.0
201603	1506	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of our federal funds rate projections, we continue to show two 25 basis point increases in 2016, but we flattened out our federal funds rate trajectory thereafter with three increases in both 2017 and 2018, down from four in each year previously.	13.0	96.0
201603	1507	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	It strikes me that the road back for Europe and Japan is going to be longer and more difficult, and that suggests more persistent drag on trade for us.	13.0	96.0
201603	1508	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that we’re only growing at about a 2 percent pace even with stimulative monetary and fiscal policies in place suggests to me that the headwinds persist, and they may be likely to abate even more slowly than I earlier anticipated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1509	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Even with my lower federal funds rate forecast trajectory, this does still imply a pretty significant rise in long-term interest rates at some point.	13.0	96.0
201603	1510	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to take that into consideration.	13.0	96.0
201603	1511	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When the 10-year Treasury yield is below 2 percent and most of us have 10 increases in the federal funds rate taking us to 3 percent or so over the next few years, that does imply a pretty significant rise in long-term rates at some point, and that is going to have consequences for financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1512	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the valuation of financial assets, for me it all starts with long-term bond yields.	13.0	96.0
201603	1513	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Things don’t look overvalued relative to long-term bond yields, but, boy, long-term bond yields look pretty rich relative to what we think is likely to actually happen for monetary policy looking forward.	13.0	96.0
201603	1514	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of risks to the outlook, I continue to see them skewed to the downside for both growth and inflation.	13.0	96.0
201603	1515	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This stems mainly from my concerns about the foreign outlook and how this might spill back to the United States.	13.0	96.0
201603	1516	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Although financial markets have recovered somewhat in the past few weeks, it’s important to remember that the market turbulence we saw earlier in the year was not just about animal spirits.	13.0	96.0
201603	1517	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There really are still a number of significant open issues in terms of the foreign economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1518	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	To name just a few, we have China’s growth prospects and its currency policy.	13.0	96.0
201603	1519	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We have the efficacy of negative long-term interest rates in Japan and Europe and the related question of whether Japan and Europe are running out of monetary policy ammunition.	13.0	96.0
201603	1520	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And, if so, what are the implications on household and business confidence in those areas?	13.0	96.0
201603	1521	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Then we have commodity price weakness and the pressure this puts on commodity-exporting countries and commodity producers.	13.0	96.0
201603	1522	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And there’s a smaller issue that we haven’t discussed today, Brexit, and all of the uncertainties associated with that.	13.0	96.0
201603	1523	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Sentiment has improved, no doubt, but most of the underlying issues driving the earlier tumult in financial markets still seem quite relevant and pertinent to me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1524	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me the markets can reverse just as quickly as they recently improved.	13.0	96.0
201603	1525	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And in some ways, the concerns about the absence of further firepower on the monetary policy front means if you do get hit with an adverse shock, the consequences for household and business sentiment could turn out to be more powerful than what people anticipate.	13.0	96.0
201603	1526	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	My particular concern is that the negative interest rate policies in Japan and Europe are not really working well to stimulate demand and lift inflation expectations.	13.0	96.0
201603	1527	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	While it’s true that the negative interest rate policies do appear to provide support to the economy by shifting down the yield curve—and bond yields in Japan and Europe have fallen to levels that I view as basically almost inconceivable—they seem to be offset by some other negative factors.	13.0	96.0
201603	1528	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The first is that the drop in yields is threatening to crimp bank net interest margins and squeeze bank profits.	13.0	96.0
201603	1529	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The second is that the negative yields, I think, do send a bad signal to households and businesses about the outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1530	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Households, even when shielded from negative interest rates, may decide they need to save more, in light of the poor expected returns that they can anticipate on their current and future savings.	13.0	96.0
201603	1531	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That doesn’t receive much emphasis, I think, when people talk about this.	13.0	96.0
201603	1532	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m also not convinced that the negative interest rate policies provide appreciable stimulus, on net.	13.0	96.0
201603	1533	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s especially the case with any currency depreciation benefit, which was really the original motivation for these policies, either to generate currency depreciation or prevent currency appreciation.	13.0	96.0
201603	1534	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If all of the countries are pursuing a negative short-term interest rate policy, most of that currency benefit gets canceled out.	13.0	96.0
201603	1535	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, in terms of the running-out-of-ammunition story, I think the earlier response to the ECB’s actions last week was quite illuminating.	13.0	96.0
201603	1536	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	After initially responding quite positively to the fact that the ECB’s actions were significantly larger and broader than anticipated, the focus turned quickly back to Draghi’s remarks, which implied that no further short-term interest rate reductions were contemplated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1537	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This suggested to some, rightly or wrongly, that there was not much ammo left, and I think that’s really what people found disconcerting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1538	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The way I reconcile the market reactions to the ECB moves last week—and I don’t think it’s easy to reconcile or explain the reactions—is by interpreting them to mean that there was sort of good news and bad news.	13.0	96.0
201603	1539	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The good news was that the ECB was aggressive.	13.0	96.0
201603	1540	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The bad news was that there’s presumably not much left in the toolkit.	13.0	96.0
201603	1541	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If inflation expectations were less damped and the international situation was less unsettled, I would favor tightening at this meeting, actually.	13.0	96.0
201603	1542	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But, to me, the risk-management considerations argue for caution right now.	13.0	96.0
201603	1543	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Clearly, tightening at this meeting at this point would provoke an undesirably large tightening of financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1544	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This is especially a risk, as the likelihood of tightening at this meeting is judged as negligible by market participants.	13.0	96.0
201603	1545	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In my view, one reason why financial conditions have eased recently is precisely because market participants now judge we are likely to go more slowly.	13.0	96.0
201603	1546	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So that means if we don’t go more slowly, it’s probably going to generate a significant tightening of financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201603	1547	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So we do need to consider that in terms of the path of policy that we pursue.	13.0	96.0
201603	1548	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, the way I think about it conceptually is that Japan and Europe are now going to follow an easier-for-longer path, and if we were to follow the same monetary policy path that we thought we were going to follow in December, the divergence between us and them would be greater, and that would probably lead to a greater tightening of financial conditions than what we thought at the time of the December meeting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1549	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So in view of the fact that they’re going to be easier for longer, then we need to maintain the same degree of divergence in policy from them.	13.0	96.0
201603	1550	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	To do that we have to actually lower our federal funds rate path, and that’s really what the SEP numbers seem to show.	13.0	96.0
201603	1551	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of where we’re going from here, I think that there is a good chance that the foreign situation could remain stable or improve, and I think inflation expectations could stabilize and increase.	13.0	96.0
201603	1552	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And if all of that happens, then I would be inclined to move again in the near future, presumably at the June meeting.	13.0	96.0
201603	1553	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t rule out April categorically, but that seems a high bar to me.	13.0	96.0
201603	1554	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Moving at a non–press conference meeting would imply an urgency to tighten that I think I’d find difficult to justify under the current set of circumstances.	13.0	96.0
201603	1555	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, it would be a big surprise.	13.0	96.0
201603	1556	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	The Open Market Desk surveys indicate market participants put a very low weight on April and a considerably higher likelihood on June.	13.0	96.0
201603	1557	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But I’m jumping the gun a little bit, so more on monetary policy tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201603	1558	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201603	1559	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201603	1560	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d like to ask a question of the Vice Chairman.	13.0	102.0
201603	1561	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you think about the ECB’s actions and the comment you just made—you talked about Japan, too, but let’s just take the ECB, case by case.	13.0	102.0
201603	1562	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So in light of the ECB’s action of lower for longer, more of a stimulus, that means that we should, all else being equal, have a lower path for the policy rate.	13.0	102.0
201603	1563	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It kind of reverses my view of the lesson that we had when we did easier monetary policy in, say, 2012, for which the argument is, that’s actually good for the global economy, it’s good for other countries.	13.0	102.0
201603	1564	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So let me ask you the thought experiment, which you put out on the table—say, the ECB, given everything else being equal, did nothing at their meeting or did less.	13.0	102.0
201603	1565	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Would we, therefore, have a tighter path of policy?	13.0	102.0
201603	1566	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But this is subject to their economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1567	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know, but I’m just—	13.0	102.0
201603	1568	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If they did less, they would have a worse economic outlook.	13.0	96.0
201603	1569	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re doing this to generate an economic outlook similar to the economic outlook that they had before.	13.0	96.0
201603	1570	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m holding the economic outlook in Europe essentially unchanged.	13.0	96.0
201603	1571	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the real argument that you’re making was not about the policy action—there was bad news in Europe and, therefore, we need a lower path of interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201603	1572	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	They need a lower path of interest rates to generate outcomes that are—	13.0	96.0
201603	1573	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to clarify, because the way you said it was—	13.0	102.0
201603	1574	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s fair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1575	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s fair.	13.0	96.0
201603	1576	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it actually goes the other way.	13.0	102.0
201603	1577	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that what they’ve done was very strong, and that’s good for the global economic outlook, conditional on the same economic data.	13.0	102.0
201603	1578	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	13.0	96.0
201603	1579	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But the fact that they had such a strong policy reaction was because the outlook in Europe had actually deteriorated.	13.0	96.0
201603	1580	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s how I—	13.0	96.0
201603	1581	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do see.	13.0	102.0
201603	1582	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just wanted to clarify, because you don’t want to get into this game—	13.0	102.0
201603	1583	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I understand.	13.0	96.0
201603	1584	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201603	1585	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for an interesting round of reflections on the economic outlook and risks.	13.0	65.0
201603	1586	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, if you don’t mind, before we break for dinner, I’d like to wrap up with some comments of my own, including some observations on the policy implications of economic and financial developments over the past few months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1587	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with the labor market, which I would characterize as showing further solid improvement since the December meeting.	13.0	65.0
201603	1588	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 230,000 over the past three months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1589	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate ticked down one-tenth and would be lower, if not for a most welcome increase in the labor force participation rate.	13.0	65.0
201603	1590	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	U-6 is down 0.2 percentage point since our December meeting, and the employment-to-population ratio has risen almost ½ percentage point.	13.0	65.0
201603	1591	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Some other cyclical indicators that I track also suggest that we’re more or less back to a normal labor market.	13.0	65.0
201603	1592	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The quits rate has returned to its pre-recession level, as have households’ perceptions of job availability and firms’ assessments of the difficulty of filling jobs.	13.0	65.0
201603	1593	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Nonetheless, I put myself in the camp of those who argue that there remains some scope for further improvement.	13.0	65.0
201603	1594	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is still a bit above my estimate of its longer-run level, and voluntary part-time employment for economic reasons remains somewhat elevated and has changed little in recent months.	13.0	65.0
201603	1595	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the unexpected pickup in the participation rate reinforces my optimism that a tight labor market will draw more people into the labor force permanently, thereby boosting the economy’s productive capacity.	13.0	65.0
201603	1596	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, although there are many anecdotal reports of faster wage increases, the aggregate data still reveal few, if any, signs of upward pressure on wages beyond some selected job categories.	13.0	65.0
201603	1597	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	While the link between nominal wage growth and slack is quite loose, I would, nonetheless, have expected some rise in nominal wage growth in response to the marked tightening of the labor market over the past two years.	13.0	65.0
201603	1598	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons alone, I’d like to see further declines in the unemployment rate and improvements in other measures of labor utilization.	13.0	65.0
201603	1599	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But I also consider a tighter labor market as important to speed the return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	65.0
201603	1600	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Indicators of spending indicate that household spending continues to be a relative bright spot in this economy, although a little less so in light of this morning’s marked downward revision to retail sales in January.	13.0	65.0
201603	1601	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Still, retail sales were up modestly in February for the control category used to compute PCE, and light motor vehicle sales have continued to run at a high level.	13.0	65.0
201603	1602	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Factoring in projected gains and outlays on services, the staff now estimates that consumer spending is likely to increase at 2½ percent at an annual rate this quarter, which remains a respectable pace.	13.0	65.0
201603	1603	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, residential investment continues along a path of gradual recovery.	13.0	65.0
201603	1604	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, as the Tealbook points out, the fundamentals underpinning near-term growth and household spending look reasonably good, in light of recent gains in real disposable income, an elevated ratio of household wealth to income, lower mortgage rates, and a relatively high level of consumer sentiment.	13.0	65.0
201603	1605	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In contrast, spending and production indicators for other sectors of the economy have been weak.	13.0	65.0
201603	1606	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods have been essentially flat for some time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1607	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Recent readings on business sentiment have been lukewarm at best, and some surveys suggest a weakening in planned cap-ex.	13.0	65.0
201603	1608	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I found President Lockhart’s comments about his survey interesting in that regard.	13.0	65.0
201603	1609	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Drilling and mining activity continues to contract at a rapid pace under the weight of very low oil prices.	13.0	65.0
201603	1610	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As the Tealbook noted, most other components of nonresidential construction have been soft.	13.0	65.0
201603	1611	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the latest monthly trade data indicate that the combination of dollar appreciation and slow foreign growth continues to hold down exports, and I expect these external factors will continue to do so for some time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1612	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, taken together, the available spending and production indicators suggest that the overall economy has been advancing at a moderate pace, with moderate growth in household spending offsetting weakness in other sectors.	13.0	65.0
201603	1613	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But that’s the past.	13.0	65.0
201603	1614	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	What about the future?	13.0	65.0
201603	1615	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Looking forward, a key question is how much effect the fallout from global economic and financial developments since the turn of the year will have on economic activity.	13.0	65.0
201603	1616	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In some respects, the answer appears to be, “Surprisingly little.”	13.0	65.0
201603	1617	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Although securities and commodity markets have experienced bouts of volatility and prices were down sharply for a time, conditions have calmed down recently and many asset prices have recovered.	13.0	65.0
201603	1618	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On net, equity valuations are down only a little since our December meeting, while oil prices and the dollar are essentially unchanged.	13.0	65.0
201603	1619	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But in other respects, recent global developments have left their mark.	13.0	65.0
201603	1620	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In the Tealbook, the projected level of trade-weighted foreign GDP at the end of 2016 is now almost ½ percent below the staff’s December forecast.	13.0	65.0
201603	1621	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Risk premiums here and abroad have risen notably on net in recent months, with the spread between the yield on triple-B corporate bonds and long-term Treasury yields up about 30 basis points.	13.0	65.0
201603	1622	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Analysts’ earnings expectations have been marked down, in part reflecting weaker global sales prospects since December.	13.0	65.0
201603	1623	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	By themselves, these developments have negative implications for the baseline outlook.	13.0	65.0
201603	1624	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But, in addition, the turbulence in recent months suggests that the risks to the outlook from developments abroad have increased.	13.0	65.0
201603	1625	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	At the time of the December meeting, last summer’s market volatility could reasonably have been viewed as a one-time event that was behind us.	13.0	65.0
201603	1626	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	But the developments of recent months, including the missteps of some foreign authorities in dealing with market stress, suggest that the global economy is more fragile than I’d previously thought.	13.0	65.0
201603	1627	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Reflecting these heightened risks, respondents to the dealer survey see a nontrivial probability, as Beth Anne’s analysis also showed, that the global economy will fall into recession this year, and that the next FOMC move will be to lower, not to raise, rates.	13.0	65.0
201603	1628	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Market participants have reacted to these developments by revising down their expectations for the future path of the funds rate considerably since our December meeting.	13.0	65.0
201603	1629	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, longer-term Treasury yields and residential mortgage rates are down about 30 basis points over that period, while triple-B corporate yields are down a little less despite the widening of risk premiums.	13.0	65.0
201603	1630	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	That financial market participants would respond in this stabilizing manner was not guaranteed.	13.0	65.0
201603	1631	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	If they had, instead, mistakenly believed that policy was on a more or less preset course of funds rate hikes this year, I think it’s safe to presume that financial market conditions would now be considerably less favorable.	13.0	65.0
201603	1632	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Not only would long-term interest rates be higher, but equity valuations and oil prices would likely be lower, and the dollar would probably have appreciated further.	13.0	65.0
201603	1633	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The possibility that the market might have reacted in this way strikes me as quite real, in view of how many commentators viewed the December dot plot as a commitment to four hikes this year, a misinterpretation I hope we will all strive to correct whenever possible.	13.0	65.0
201603	1634	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately—and I’m joining a number of my colleagues here in interpreting things in this way—the market responses we have seen suggest that financial market participants do understand that our policy is data dependent, and, as a consequence, current financial conditions remain consistent, in my view, with the baseline outlook for real activity that is little changed.	13.0	65.0
201603	1635	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As in December, I continue to anticipate that growth will be moderate and that labor market conditions will improve further, conditional on a path of increases in the funds rate over time that are now a bit more gradual than the path I anticipated in December.	13.0	65.0
201603	1636	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the balance of risks, however, in light of my concerns about the global economy, I now see the risk to real activity as tilted to the downside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1637	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On inflation, I agree with the staff’s judgment that the bump-up in inflation in January will probably prove to be an artifact of movements in a few volatile items that are unlikely to be repeated and seasonal adjustment issues.	13.0	65.0
201603	1638	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, my baseline inflation forecast is little revised from December, as oil prices and the dollar are essentially unchanged.	13.0	65.0
201603	1639	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, I continue to expect that inflation will remain low through the end of the year but then will move up in early 2017 once the transitory effects of previous declines in energy prices and dollar appreciation finally disappear.	13.0	65.0
201603	1640	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Over the rest of next year and through 2018, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent, aided by further labor market improvement.	13.0	65.0
201603	1641	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	This unchanged outlook rests heavily on the continued stability of the true long-run inflation expectations that matter for wage and price setting over time.	13.0	65.0
201603	1642	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	On this point, I found the analysis presented in the staff memo on this topic reasonably persuasive and so continue to assume in my baseline forecast that inflation expectations are reasonably well anchored.	13.0	65.0
201603	1643	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Nevertheless, my confidence in this assumption has fallen somewhat in recent months, because I cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that the declines in inflation compensation and some survey measures are signaling some slippage.	13.0	65.0
201603	1644	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, like many of you, I now see the risks to the inflation outlook as also tilted slightly to the downside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1645	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	What does this mean for tomorrow’s policy decision?	13.0	65.0
201603	1646	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the case for leaving the target range unchanged for the moment seems clear.	13.0	65.0
201603	1647	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Reflecting my baseline outlook, my assessment of the risks, my view that the level of the neutral federal funds rate remains low, and some skepticism on my part that the headwinds holding down the neutral rate are apt to subside over the next few years as rapidly as in the Tealbook baseline, I see limited danger of falling “behind the curve.”	13.0	65.0
201603	1648	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, financial market participants do not expect any move at this meeting, and surprising them by unexpectedly tightening would likely be highly disruptive.	13.0	65.0
201603	1649	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, leaving policy unchanged at this meeting will give us more time to confirm that, despite unsettled global conditions and the drag arising from weaker foreign growth, the economy is continuing to expand at a moderate pace, accompanied by further job gains.	13.0	65.0
201603	1650	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I think such a cautious approach is prudent in light of our asymmetric ability to respond to shocks to the economy.	13.0	65.0
201603	1651	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	While we can speed up the pace of tightening as needed, if conditions turn out to be unexpectedly strong, we have less ability to provide accommodation in case of a downturn because of the effective lower bound and costs associated with our unconventional policy tools.	13.0	65.0
201603	1652	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	To be clear, I do expect that further gradual increases in our target range will be appropriate if the labor market continues to improve, even if the risks pertaining to global conditions do not significantly subside.	13.0	65.0
201603	1653	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	To remain on hold for too long as the labor market improves, assuming that inflation continues to evolve in line with our forecast, would risk inadvertently allowing the economy to become overly tight, although, as I mentioned, I don’t think we’ve reached that point yet.	13.0	65.0
201603	1654	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there.	13.0	65.0
201603	1655	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Do we want to call it quits at this point or let Thomas—	52.0	65.0
201603	1656	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We should leave something for tomorrow.	52.0	91.0
201603	1657	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	52.0	91.0
201603	1658	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we have dinner across the street at 5:30, but it’s not yet quite 5:30.	52.0	65.0
201603	1659	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll walk slowly.	52.0	102.0
201603	1660	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	52.0	102.0
201603	1661	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201603	1662	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s have Thomas start tomorrow morning, and why don’t we call it quits for the day.	52.0	65.0
201603	1663	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	52.0	65.0
201603	1665	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	March 16 Session .	52.0	65.0
201603	1666	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201603	1667	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201603	1668	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get going.	52.0	65.0
201603	1669	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We do have data releases this morning, but David is waiting for a little bit more information to be available to him before he discusses those.	21.0	65.0
201603	1670	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So what we’d like to do is to start off with Thomas’s briefing, and when David’s ready, we’ll interrupt the policy round and turn to David.	21.0	65.0
201603	1671	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	21.0	65.0
201603	1672	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201603	1673	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1674	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Central to your policy decision at this meeting is your assessment of the implications of recent financial market volatility and of the current state of inflation expectations for the economic outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1675	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A, B, and C present essentially the same modal outlook for economic activity and the labor market but different assessments of the outlook for inflation and of the risks attending the economic outlook, along with corresponding policy choices about adjustments in the federal funds rate today and at subsequent meetings.	21.0	999.0
201603	1676	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	On balance, the turbulence in financial markets earlier this year and continued low readings from various measures of inflation expectations appear to have left only a small imprint on the modal projections of private forecasters.	21.0	999.0
201603	1677	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Like you and the staff, they have marked down slightly their expectations for 2016 real GDP growth and inflation and, as shown in the top-left panel, have barely changed their outlook for 2017.	21.0	999.0
201603	1678	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Those forecasts also appear to build in an assumption of a somewhat lower level of short-term interest rates at the end of 2017, whereas market expectations for the federal funds rate path, shown in the upper right, have shifted more noticeably.	21.0	999.0
201603	1679	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Even though in recent weeks the current path has moved back up to where it was at the time of the January meeting, it remains substantially flatter than in December.	21.0	999.0
201603	1680	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	One possible way of interpreting the divergent messages from economists’ forecasts and investors’ policy expectations is that the modal economic outlook is associated with downside risks that, if realized, would lead to a shallower future path of the federal funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201603	1681	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The colored bars in the middle-left panel present averages across respondents to the primary dealer survey of the probabilities they assign to the level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2017 under two scenarios—one in which the federal funds rate returns to the lower bound at some point between 2016 and 2018, the blue bars, and one in which it does not, the tan bars.	21.0	999.0
201603	1682	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The black dashed line shows the probability distribution that results from assigning weights of ¼ and ¾, respectively, to the blue and the tan bars, ¼ being the probability assigned by the median dealer to returning to the lower bound during the next three years.	21.0	999.0
201603	1683	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	When pricing derivatives contracts, modest shifts in the weights on these two scenarios could result in sizable shifts in the expected policy rate path.	21.0	999.0
201603	1684	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, some investors might envision scenarios in which the federal funds rate returns to the effective lower bound persistently, explaining the sensitivity of the market-based path at horizons of four years or so.	21.0	999.0
201603	1685	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Despite the recent improvement in market sentiment, it is not difficult to come up with a list of risks to the economic outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1686	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Indeed, market participants have been discussing vulnerabilities abroad, including those in China, Japan, and the euro area that were noted by Simon and Beth Anne yesterday.	21.0	999.0
201603	1687	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The striking co-movement observed over recent months among several classes of assets—notably, the price of oil, broad stock market indexes, and corporate bond spreads—could reflect changes in the perceived likelihood of protracted weakness in major economies that would result in policy rates being at their effective lower bounds for quite some time.	21.0	999.0
201603	1688	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, the middle-right panel shows that the correlation between oil and stock prices has been extraordinarily tight since late fall.	21.0	999.0
201603	1689	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As discussed in Monday’s Board briefing on financial developments, in the recent period, neither demand- nor supply- driven declines in oil prices have been read by investors as conveying good news.	21.0	999.0
201603	1690	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The large and synchronized fluctuations in these asset prices may be related to the downward shift in perceptions of the neutral rate in many major economies implied by expected policy rate paths and attendant concerns about central banks running out of ammunition.	21.0	999.0
201603	1691	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Another possible interpretation of recent market turbulence and associated shifts in the expected policy rate path is that investors simply overreacted to relatively inconsequential economic and financial developments earlier in the year, and that, as fear dissipated, asset prices retraced most of their earlier decline and market conditions may continue to improve.	21.0	999.0
201603	1692	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, to the extent that investor psychology is still scarred by the recent financial crisis, or a deterioration in liquidity in some markets may have amplified the moves in asset prices, it is quite possible that risk aversion will recede and the expected policy rate path will, before too long, shift back to where it was in December or rise even higher.	21.0	999.0
201603	1693	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Under alternative B, the Committee would communicate that it is taking a wait-and-see position on assessing the risks to the economy posed by somewhat weaker economic growth abroad and whether financial market developments have led, on net, to a tightening in financial conditions that might constrain economic activity.	21.0	999.0
201603	1694	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C, by contrast, places less weight on the possibility that recent developments have heightened the downside risks to the economy and gives greater weight to the view that the outlook for real activity and the labor market is still solid.	21.0	999.0
201603	1695	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatively, the recent market volatility and lower paths for expected policy rates could reflect a more lasting reassessment of the underlying strength of the major economies and their vulnerability to adverse shocks.	21.0	999.0
201603	1696	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	With a lower path for the neutral real rate and muted inflation, modest adverse shocks could be sufficient to pin policy rates for a long time at the effective lower bound.	21.0	999.0
201603	1697	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Moreover, greater pessimism about the ability of economies to escape the lower bound could become self-fulfilling.	21.0	999.0
201603	1698	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	This sentiment might be more aligned with the view embedded in alternative A in which the Committee would put its policy adjustments on hold until it sees the risks as more closely balanced.	21.0	999.0
201603	1699	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The memo you received regarding the staff’s current assessment of the state of longer-term inflation expectations relates to a second issue you are confronting, which is whether these expectations have moved in ways that would alter either your baseline outlook for inflation or your risk assessment associated with that outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1700	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As discussed in that memo, although we see some evidence pointing toward modest slippage in longer-term inflation expectations, we cannot rule out with confidence either that inflation expectations have remained stable or that they have slipped more noticeably.	21.0	999.0
201603	1701	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The lower-left panel contrasts two views on the role of inflation expectations in explaining the roughly 100 basis point decline in far-forward inflation compensation since mid-2014.	21.0	999.0
201603	1702	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the blue portion of the left bar, the respondents to the Desk survey view a decline in inflation expectations as playing a noticeable role in investors’ thinking; by contrast, the right bar shows that Board and Reserve Bank models attribute most of the decline to inflation risk premiums.	21.0	999.0
201603	1703	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The risk-neutral probability of inflation running below 1 percent, on average, over the next 10 years, derived from inflation caps and floors and shown to the right, is quite elevated.	21.0	999.0
201603	1704	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	But the sheer size of this probability suggests sizable premiums for insuring against the risk of protracted low inflation, perhaps because investors have become more concerned that low-inflation scenarios would be associated with persistent economic weakness.	21.0	999.0
201603	1705	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	In light of the ambiguity of the evidence regarding longer-term inflation expectations, the draft alternatives offer various options for how to characterize the outlook for inflation and the risks to this outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1706	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A and B acknowledge that inflation is likely to remain low in the near term due in part to the earlier decline in energy prices, while alternative C looks beyond the near term and focuses on the expectation that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201603	1707	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	The alternatives also differ in the degree of concern they express about the downside risks to the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201603	1708	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives B and C revert to language used before January, stating that “the Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1709	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative A expresses the judgment that inflation expectations have declined and that “the risks that inflation will fail to rise to 2 percent over the medium term have increased.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1710	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	It therefore announces that no further increase in the target range will occur “until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced.”	21.0	999.0
201603	1711	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201603	1712	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201603	1713	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for Thomas.	22.0	65.0
201603	1714	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	22.0	65.0
201603	1715	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	88.0
201603	1716	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thomas, just a little mundane question.	22.0	88.0
201603	1717	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Do you have the latest probability the market is placing on April versus June?	22.0	88.0
201603	1718	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	What’s the latest on that?	22.0	88.0
201603	1719	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So I believe April is close to 10 percent, whereas June is closer to 50, but I—	22.0	999.0
201603	1720	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	It’s probably 60 percent as of this morning because of the CPI data, and one rate hike is now priced in fully by September.	22.0	999.0
201603	1721	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201603	1722	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22.0	65.0
201603	1723	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	102.0
201603	1724	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a couple of questions for Thomas.	22.0	102.0
201603	1725	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is on the primary dealer survey, the lower-left chart.	22.0	102.0
201603	1726	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m going to repeat, I guess, a statement/question that I’ve made before on this.	22.0	102.0
201603	1727	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I look at Simon Potter’s memo from March 11 to research directors—which I’m allowed to read, apparently—it shows that the median projection of the primary dealers for inflation over the next few years has not changed since January.	22.0	102.0
201603	1728	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So when you were asking primary dealers—that is, the chief economists at the primary dealers—for their own view, at least the median response is that the inflation expectations have not changed.	22.0	102.0
201603	1729	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So you’re asking them to opine on why market participants have changed their views.	22.0	102.0
201603	1730	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I liken this to going to a restaurant that we like and reading Yelp reviews that people don’t like it, and trying to figure out what it is that they think, and trying to come to conclusions, and then maybe divide it among the service, the food, and the prices.	22.0	102.0
201603	1731	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, maybe that’s more of a statement than a question, but I just want to be clear on this, that these are people who have not changed their views on inflation, but they are asked why the market pricing has changed.	22.0	102.0
201603	1732	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	They haven’t changed their views on inflation nearly by as much as the persons whose views they are reporting on.	22.0	999.0
201603	1733	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s correct.	22.0	999.0
201603	1734	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Well, actually, the primary dealer surveys have changed very little, I think, at the long horizon since mid-2014.	22.0	999.0
201603	1735	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	Simon is better suited to speak in response to this question, but my understanding is that they are asked to report on the views that they hear from the people who are actually trading these securities.	22.0	999.0
201603	1736	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I understand.	22.0	102.0
201603	1737	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We asked them, “If the change in your expectations is different from what you estimate is the change in market expectations over this period, please explain.”	22.0	999.0
201603	1738	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	And I looked to how they explained it, and that didn’t help.	22.0	999.0
201603	1739	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	22.0	999.0
201603	1740	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	They are basically as confused as everyone else.	22.0	999.0
201603	1741	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	When we asked a different set of people in the Survey of Market Participants, we basically got exactly the same results.	22.0	999.0
201603	1742	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Having done this years ago, I have a lot of sympathy with your view.	22.0	96.0
201603	1743	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	When I saw this originally, I looked and I said, “Oh, so they don’t really know what’s going on, so we’ll just put a third, a third, a third” was sort of my reaction, frankly.	22.0	96.0
201603	1744	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I can see absolutely where you’re coming from, President Williams.	22.0	96.0
201603	1745	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I even asked myself, if we were to poll ourselves about market expectations, we would probably come up with something similar—so I guess that’s my first comment.	22.0	102.0
201603	1746	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second question is more substantive, and that is that the SEP rate path is actually quite a bit lower in March than it was in December.	22.0	102.0
201603	1747	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	How do you view the market reaction to that?	22.0	102.0
201603	1748	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Do you think that this is going to get a lot of attention, and how do you think about that?	22.0	102.0
201603	1749	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	There is a question in the dealer survey asking them about their expectations—what the median dot will be—and they’re expecting 25 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1750	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So the 50 basis point shift in the median at the end of 2016 and 2017 will come as a surprise.	22.0	999.0
201603	1751	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	The median response to the question about how the median SEP dot will move is 25 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1752	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	If you read the detailed comments, they’re all aware of how fragile the median can be, so they did understand that it’s possible for one more person to move and to get 50 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1753	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	And the mean of the end-2016 change is actually only 26 basis points.	22.0	999.0
201603	1754	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	So the median in this instance exhibits that fragility to which Simon was referring.	22.0	999.0
201603	1755	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So your answer to the question—Do you think that markets will just see this as, kind of, what they expected, or do you think they’ll see it as a softening of the Committee’s views about the future policy rate path beyond what they were already expecting?	22.0	102.0
201603	1756	2016-03-16	meeting	LAUBACH	A fair bit seems to be expected.	22.0	999.0
201603	1757	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	22.0	102.0
201603	1758	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201603	1759	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201603	1760	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to follow up on President Williams’s first question, and I appreciate his comments on this about inflation expectations and the interpretation.	22.0	94.0
201603	1761	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So if you look at something like the Survey of Professional Forecasters, they always say 2 percent, no matter what.	22.0	94.0
201603	1762	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Among those people, I’d interpret that to mean we have a lot of credibility.	22.0	94.0
201603	1763	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a general equilibrium, so if you believe the central bank is going to do the right thing to get back to the inflation target, then you just keep saying 2 percent, because you have full confidence in the central bank.	22.0	94.0
201603	1764	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But the market as a whole, I don’t think, has that same level of confidence, and that’s why those TIPS five-year, five-year-forwards move around, and so that’s my interpretation—they represent credibility, and I don’t want them to get too far out of line.	22.0	94.0
201603	1765	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously, as I’ve said before, I’m a little bit suspicious of these decompositions into liquidity premiums and inflation.	22.0	94.0
201603	1766	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I interpret them mostly as inflation expectations on the part of the market, and I interpret that as—if they’re falling, it’s waning credibility in either the ability or willingness of the Committee to keep inflation at its target.	22.0	94.0
201603	1767	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201603	1768	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	91.0
201603	1769	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Just to pick up on this discussion here, I guess I’m a little confused.	22.0	91.0
201603	1770	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I always thought the value proposition for the New York Federal Reserve’s Markets Group when they go out and talk to people in the market was—they were talking to people in the market.	22.0	91.0
201603	1771	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	When Vice Chairman Dudley was in charge of that group and we had commentary, he would say that when he worked at Goldman, well, you were supposed to go talk to the people—you know, the traders and that type of thing.	22.0	91.0
201603	1772	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	But some of the chief economists’ forecasts come into play.	22.0	91.0
201603	1773	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	If you tell me that all they’re going to do is report back on forecasts like the Blue Chip or Survey of Professional Forecasters, then the value proposition goes way down for that type of intelligence activity.	22.0	91.0
201603	1774	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So I can’t say I know exactly—Simon, you’re looking puzzled at that.	22.0	91.0
201603	1775	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	We make sure we ask them much harder questions than the Blue Chip.	22.0	999.0
201603	1776	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	That’s right, but the idea is basically that they’ve sort of heard, right?	22.0	91.0
201603	1777	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	And we want to know what the people who are actually trading in the markets are thinking—so that’s what I’m hoping to get out of this type of commentary.	22.0	91.0
201603	1778	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	I’d say that we focus a lot on what the median response is, and the distribution across types of market participants is really important, and there was some distribution across how you would decompose the drop in inflation compensation.	22.0	999.0
201603	1779	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	You know, a lot of people don’t understand it.	22.0	999.0
201603	1780	2016-03-16	meeting	POTTER	Some of the answers that they gave as to why it might be different are reasonably smart, but it’s not as if anyone’s got a “secret sauce” they can give you that’s different from the models, or from the lack of understanding that we have of what’s happened.	22.0	999.0
201603	1781	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Right.	22.0	91.0
201603	1782	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So you folks do analysis with that, too.	22.0	91.0
201603	1783	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	So that’s also part of the proposition.	22.0	91.0
201603	1784	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	President Bullard mentioned the Survey of Professional Forecasters flatlining at 2 percent on their long-term inflation forecasts for the PCE, and I always interpret that as, well, they know what π* is—we’ve said it’s 2 percent, so the long-term PCE projection doesn’t move.	22.0	91.0
201603	1785	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s much more revealing when you look at the CPI longer term, and that one acts like we don’t give them the answer in the back of the book, so the fact that that one is trailing down a little bit I find much more worrisome.	22.0	91.0
201603	1786	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201603	1787	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201603	1788	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201603	1789	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	David, are you ready to talk about the data?	11.0	65.0
201603	1790	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Absolutely.	11.0	999.0
201603	1791	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I’m as ready as I’m going to be.	11.0	999.0
201603	1792	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201603	1793	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	When I was in high school, I thought I might be a professional French horn player.	11.0	999.0
201603	1794	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And when you hadn’t really spent enough time in the practice studio, you’d console yourself that you really didn’t want to be overrehearsed when you got to your lesson.	11.0	999.0
201603	1795	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201603	1796	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So this will test that proposition.	11.0	999.0
201603	1797	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Let me start with the consumer price index and its implications for the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1798	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	You have a handout called “Material for Consumer Price Index Update.”	11.0	999.0
201603	1799	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the top lines in the table, on a rounded basis, the overall CPI came in close to our expectation, declining 0.2 percent in February.	11.0	999.0
201603	1800	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is an area, though, in which basis points matter, and, on an unrounded basis, the decrease was 4 basis points less than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1801	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So the actual decline, unrounded, was 17 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201603	1802	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We had expected a 21 basis point decline.	11.0	999.0
201603	1803	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Off with your head.	11.0	96.0
201603	1804	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	11.0	96.0
201603	1805	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There you go.	11.0	999.0
201603	1806	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	It only gets better—or worse, depending on your point of view—from here.	11.0	999.0
201603	1807	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Within the overall index, energy prices declined a little more than we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1808	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’d looked for a very sharp decline of 5½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	1809	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They were down 6 percent.	11.0	999.0
201603	1810	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Food prices were one-tenth stronger than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1811	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The core CPI obviously is a piece that we focus on an awful lot—the bottom set of rows in the table.	11.0	999.0
201603	1812	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those increased 0.3 percent, and, yes, it was a full 10 basis points stronger than we had been looking for.	11.0	999.0
201603	1813	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The biggest surprises look to have been in the core goods area, in which prices increased 0.3 percent, whereas we’d expected them to be flat.	11.0	999.0
201603	1814	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	This is the second month in a row with core goods price surprises.	11.0	999.0
201603	1815	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Almost all of the miss this time was in apparel, which is quite a volatile component of the price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1816	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Another piece of the surprise was in the CPI for medical prices, which the BEA does not pick up in constructing PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	1817	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	They use the PPI prices for medical care in putting together the PCE price index.	11.0	999.0
201603	1818	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In terms of the implications for PCE prices, for top-line PCE inflation, we now estimate an increase of 0.4 percent for the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	1819	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That’s a quarterly figure at an annual rate.	11.0	999.0
201603	1820	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That is up from our forecast of an increase of 0.1 percent in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1821	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For core PCE prices, we’re now projecting a quarterly increase at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2.2 percent, which is up from 1.9 percent in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1822	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the second quarter for core prices, at this point on a preliminary basis, we’ve nudged up our projection from 1.5 to 1.6.	11.0	999.0
201603	1823	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So we’re still expecting basically the same contour, albeit following a slightly higher path than what we had in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1824	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t yet have a full set of 12-month changes for you, but I do have February—that the 12-month change for top-line PCE prices is 1.0 rather than 0.9 as we had projected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1825	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So there is the one-tenth upward surprise in PCE prices.	11.0	999.0
201603	1826	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And for core, we now have that estimated at 1.8 percent, up from 1.7 in the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201603	1827	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The piece that I don’t have for you is the 12-month changes for March, April, and so forth.	11.0	999.0
201603	1828	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	That’s for PCE prices?	12.0	65.0
201603	1829	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those last two figures that I gave you are PCE prices—top line of 1.0, up from 0.9, and core PCE prices of 1.8, up from 1.7 in the Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201603	1830	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Now, let me turn briefly to our estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201603	1831	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	The figures that I’m going to report here will all be in terms of their contributions to growth of real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201603	1832	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And, in case there was any suspense, let me remove it.	11.0	999.0
201603	1833	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I reported yesterday that we’d revised our estimate of GDP growth to 1½ percent from 1.9.	11.0	999.0
201603	1834	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	There have been a bunch of puts and takes since yesterday, but we’re still at 1½.	11.0	999.0
201603	1835	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	As I reported yesterday, we revised down our estimate of the contribution to real GDP growth from PCE, which is one of the pieces that’s informed by the retail sales release, and that took 0.4 percentage point out of our GDP estimate.	11.0	999.0
201603	1836	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Subsequent to my report yesterday, we’ve taken on board some additional information.	11.0	999.0
201603	1837	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Sales at building material and supply stores were a little stronger than what we had expected.	11.0	999.0
201603	1838	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	That points to a little stronger growth in residential improvements, and those are part of residential construction.	11.0	999.0
201603	1839	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, we filtered some of the relevant components of the February PPI.	11.0	999.0
201603	1840	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Those were a little lower than what we had expected, so they imply marginally stronger growth in various categories of equipment investment and both residential and nonresidential construction.	11.0	999.0
201603	1841	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, the higher prices in the CPI today imply yet weaker real growth of PCE, so that’s going to take, on our estimates now, about one-tenth and a half or two-tenths out of GDP from the higher prices deflating the nominals that we learned about.	11.0	999.0
201603	1842	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	All told, we’re at 1½ percent for Q1 and 2 percent for Q2, and, for those who are really keeping track of the details, we’re up one-tenth in Q4, from 1.2 to 1.3.	11.0	999.0
201603	1843	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	So that’s where we are.	11.0	999.0
201603	1844	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	The last Q4?	12.0	108.0
201603	1845	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201603	1846	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re up one-tenth for the fourth quarter of last year, from 1.2 to 1.3.	12.0	999.0
201603	1847	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	We’re still at 1.5 for Q1, as was the case yesterday, but with a bunch of jiggling around.	12.0	999.0
201603	1848	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And we’re still at 2.0 for Q2.	12.0	999.0
201603	1849	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	In the details, what that 2.0 reflects is a little weaker real household spending due to the higher price inflation and marginally stronger residential investment from the higher single-family starts that were also reported this morning.	12.0	999.0
201603	1850	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for David?	12.0	65.0
201603	1851	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just note one thing—that in alternative B, as distributed in Thomas’s handout, we did change one word in paragraph 1 describing household spending.	12.0	65.0
201603	1852	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We changed “solid” to “moderate,” in light of the data that David described.	12.0	65.0
201603	1853	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I realize that, just from Q4 over Q4 for GDP growth, you gave a lot of numbers.	12.0	102.0
201603	1854	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m struggling to do this all in my head and get it right.	12.0	102.0
201603	1855	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	For what year?	12.0	999.0
201603	1856	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	For 2015 and 2016.	12.0	102.0
201603	1857	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m guessing 2015 doesn’t change.	12.0	102.0
201603	1858	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But 2016?	12.0	102.0
201603	1859	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	I’m guessing that 2015 doesn’t change, because it’s one-tenth on one quarter, so divide that by 4, and we’d still be at 1.9.	12.0	999.0
201603	1860	2016-03-16	meeting	WILCOX	And our estimate for 2016, I think, should be down one-tenth, to 2.1.	12.0	999.0
201603	1861	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay, that’s what I thought.	12.0	102.0
201603	1862	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	12.0	102.0
201603	1863	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any other questions?	12.0	65.0
201603	1864	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201603	1865	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201603	1866	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin our policy go-round.	23.0	65.0
201603	1867	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201603	1868	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201603	1869	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	90.0
201603	1870	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the real data have been about as I expected, problems with major trading partners and the volatility in financial markets make a tightening at this meeting premature.	23.0	90.0
201603	1871	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I view the global economy as still fragile, which is presumably the source of the volatility we have seen in financial markets.	23.0	90.0
201603	1872	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	With many of our trading partners experiencing very low inflation rates and weak economies and, consequently, with regard to untried new monetary policy tools, a risk-management approach to monetary policy indicates that the benefits of waiting dominate the modest cost of not moving at this time.	23.0	90.0
201603	1873	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, my SEP forecast embeds the assumption that we will raise the federal funds rate three times this year.	23.0	90.0
201603	1874	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	If wage and price data in the intermeeting period provide more evidence that PCE inflation is likely on its way toward 2 percent, and that labor markets are tightening further, I could imagine it would be appropriate to move as soon as April.	23.0	90.0
201603	1875	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	I do not think the current statement sets up that possibility, so if inflation improves and labor markets tighten further, additional communication by the Chair might be necessary.	23.0	90.0
201603	1876	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Of course, I could also imagine that problems abroad start to leave more traces in the financial and economic data after this meeting, and it would then be quite appropriate to wait longer before our next move.	23.0	90.0
201603	1877	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, I am comfortable waiting at this meeting, but I do want to encourage the perception that each meeting is “live.”	23.0	90.0
201603	1878	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not moving in January and March already indicates that we are responsive to data and potential risks to the economy.	23.0	90.0
201603	1879	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	But many financial market assessments of future FOMC actions suggest that markets remain more pessimistic than many FOMC participants about both the strength of the US economy and our likely path for raising rates.	23.0	90.0
201603	1880	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	For the period ahead, we may need to enhance our communications to address this persistent gap in perceptions so as to avoid a significant disruption to markets at the time we choose next to move.	23.0	90.0
201603	1881	2016-03-16	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201603	1882	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1883	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201603	1884	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	1885	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	On balance, the medium-run economic outlook has not changed materially since we made our previous SEP submissions in December.	23.0	999.0
201603	1886	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The tightening in financial conditions we saw over January and early February has largely reversed.	23.0	999.0
201603	1887	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Oil prices and the dollar have shown some stability.	23.0	999.0
201603	1888	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Growth was weak in the fourth quarter of last year, but, on the basis of the data we have on the first quarter, it appears that growth is rebounding toward the 2 percent pace we’ve seen over much of the expansion.	23.0	999.0
201603	1889	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Throughout, labor markets have continued to show solid improvement, and the news on inflation over this intermeeting period has also been positive.	23.0	999.0
201603	1890	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	In my view, in light of actual and expected economic performance, it’s appropriate for monetary policy to remain on a gradual upward trajectory this year.	23.0	999.0
201603	1891	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, our data on the first quarter are limited.	23.0	999.0
201603	1892	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Because we have not prepared the public for it, a rate increase at this meeting would come as a surprise, which might induce volatility just when it looks like volatility has settled down.	23.0	999.0
201603	1893	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	So I can see a reasonable argument that it’s better to not make a change today and to continue to gather information and assess conditions.	23.0	999.0
201603	1894	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And I will support alternative B today.	23.0	999.0
201603	1895	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But I’d like to point out that, while alternative B sounds like the less risky strategy, there are some risks to the strategy as well that we need to consider.	23.0	999.0
201603	1896	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	First, there’s always uncertainty out there, and the FOMC could always make the case that we should wait to act until we gather more information.	23.0	999.0
201603	1897	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But waiting until all of the data line up in the correct way means waiting too long.	23.0	999.0
201603	1898	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	We risk having to move rates up more aggressively in the future, with negative effects on the economy.	23.0	999.0
201603	1899	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Forestalling rate increases for too long in light of financial market conditions may simply produce more volatility in the future if we find ourselves having to increase rates more aggressively than anticipated.	23.0	999.0
201603	1900	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Second, it’s very important that our lack of action today not be read as a negative message about the economy, which can be a self-fulfilling prophecy and would be inconsistent with our outlook.	23.0	999.0
201603	1901	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe that the proposed language in alternative B is much improved from the preliminary draft in that respect, although I think it will need to be followed up on in the press conference and in the Chair’s other communications after this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201603	1902	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Standing pat on rates today should not be read by the public as our having had a significant rethinking of the medium-term outlook or as indicating that we view the move in December as unjustified.	23.0	999.0
201603	1903	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I believe the message should be that we are data dependent, yes, but our best assessment at this time is that the economy will evolve in a way that will make gradual reductions in the degree of accommodation this year appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201603	1904	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	The path may be a bit shallower than we thought in December because of the weaker growth seen at the end of last year and somewhat tighter financial conditions.	23.0	999.0
201603	1905	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	But the economy has shown considerable resilience, and the outlook supports continuing on the path of normalization.	23.0	999.0
201603	1906	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	I would like us to be in a position to move rates up at any meeting this year should the data support it.	23.0	999.0
201603	1907	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	And we need to recognize that our communications—in particular, the statement, minutes, and, importantly, communications from the Chair—play a critical part in getting us there.	23.0	999.0
201603	1908	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, had we better prepared the public for a move at this meeting, I would have advocated making such a move, on the basis of the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201603	1909	2016-03-16	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	1910	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1911	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201603	1912	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201603	1913	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I, too, support the policy action in alternative B and the statement as written.	23.0	88.0
201603	1914	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As noted in the economic go-round, I think the data to date this year are largely consistent with my December projections.	23.0	88.0
201603	1915	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	But the first-quarter data are still relatively incomplete, and there is enough remaining ambiguity, especially as regards business fixed investment, to warrant some patience in moving ahead with the next adjustment of our policy rates.	23.0	88.0
201603	1916	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I am of the opinion that a rate move could be justified at the April meeting should the data continue to support the view that the economy is on a modestly above-potential growth track; labor markets remain robust, on the whole; and inflation signals continue to show some firming relative to our objective.	23.0	88.0
201603	1917	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	The language in alternative B today strikes me as consistent with keeping the April meeting live for a potential rate increase.	23.0	88.0
201603	1918	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	However, whether the public perceives April as a “live” option will depend critically on our subsequent communications, including the Chair’s comments following this meeting.	23.0	88.0
201603	1919	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I would be a little troubled by an alternative approach that, perhaps unintentionally, serves to reinforce the public’s conclusion that April is absolutely off the table and the earliest possible normalization move is June.	23.0	88.0
201603	1920	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	This seems to me a little awkward following a December liftoff decision that was accompanied by a median projection of four rate increases in 2016—of course, in the context of the now well-accepted caveat of being data dependent.	23.0	88.0
201603	1921	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t think the data alone will demand a reappraisal of the path of the policy rate, so the interpretation could be that the Committee has shifted to a paradigm or changed to a reaction function that places more emphasis on global conditions, the policy stance of other central banks, financial market risk, and other exogenous factors that pose risks or work to tighten financial conditions in our markets.	23.0	88.0
201603	1922	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Effective communications may require an explanation that these factors are data, too, particularly if the baseline domestic economy readings continue to look fine.	23.0	88.0
201603	1923	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Anyway, I think it would be appropriate to convey that the Committee is keeping its options open regarding April.	23.0	88.0
201603	1924	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	If the data we receive between now and the April meeting are broadly affirming of what amounts to the Committee’s base case, I think we should at least consider policy action.	23.0	88.0
201603	1925	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As of now, it appears that the market participants and observers are placing, per the question I asked earlier, about a 10 percent probability on an April move.	23.0	88.0
201603	1926	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	In part, this is due to an ongoing belief that this Committee will be reluctant to make policy adjustments at meetings without a scheduled press conference.	23.0	88.0
201603	1927	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this is a less-than-ideal situation.	23.0	88.0
201603	1928	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I believe that data-dependent criteria may well allow a rate adjustment in April.	23.0	88.0
201603	1929	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	I won’t go so far as to say the probability is 50–50, but, in my view, it’s closer to even odds than it is to 10 percent.	23.0	88.0
201603	1930	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	As a consequence, I think it’s important to adopt communications that nudge the market to be more in line with the possibility that April is truly possible.	23.0	88.0
201603	1931	2016-03-16	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201603	1932	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1933	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201603	1934	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201603	1935	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	110.0
201603	1936	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m confident we are moving toward reaching our full-employment objective, but I still believe there is additional slack that can be removed from the labor force.	23.0	110.0
201603	1937	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I feel better about the progress we’re making on inflation, but I still would like to see more evidence of progress in reaching our 2 percent objective.	23.0	110.0
201603	1938	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	And, as I mentioned yesterday, I would like to see more evidence of oil prices firming.	23.0	110.0
201603	1939	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	This all comes against a global backdrop that I view as challenging.	23.0	110.0
201603	1940	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Slowing global growth and overcapacity, high levels of debt to GDP in advanced economies, and aging populations in advanced economies—I think these issues all have the potential to affect financial conditions and make us susceptible to bouts of tightening, which could manifest themselves in the 10-year Treasury and a flight to quality, widening credit spreads, and a strengthening dollar.	23.0	110.0
201603	1941	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	As a result, I agree with the decision not to act at this meeting, and I think a slower, more gradual path may, over time, allow us to normalize more quickly.	23.0	110.0
201603	1942	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	In my comments after this meeting, I plan to avoid speculating on the timing of future rate moves.	23.0	110.0
201603	1943	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I plan to emphasize that we’re keeping an open mind and are avoiding a predetermined path, and that we will base any action on our ongoing assessment of underlying economic conditions.	23.0	110.0
201603	1944	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	I plan to emphasize that any removal of accommodation will be done only gradually, and that, at this juncture, the FOMC remains accommodative.	23.0	110.0
201603	1945	2016-03-16	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201603	1946	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1947	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201603	1948	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201603	1949	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201603	1950	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The implied probabilities in the markets that Simon cited earlier—a very low probability of a move at the April meeting and about 50–50 or so at the June meeting—strike me as about right.	23.0	104.0
201603	1951	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	With a weak external environment and inflation running below target and likely to go sideways for at least a few quarters, I think that the Committee can afford to be patient.	23.0	104.0
201603	1952	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I’m open to moving in April, but I guess I don’t see it as a likely outcome.	23.0	104.0
201603	1953	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I think it would be great to find a way to deviate from our pattern of only moving at the quarterly meetings associated with a press conference, but I’m afraid doing so now would inevitably send a note of urgency.	23.0	104.0
201603	1954	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I guess I don’t see it as justified, and I see us as being able to be patient anyway.	23.0	104.0
201603	1955	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The SEP median funds rate path is moving much closer to market forecasts, and I see that as healthy and appropriate.	23.0	104.0
201603	1956	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The sense that the Committee is likely to move more slowly than the December SEP suggested is probably one of the reasons why financial conditions have improved so much since February 11.	23.0	104.0
201603	1957	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	My own forecast is now for two rate increases this year and three next year, which is not far from the SEP median.	23.0	104.0
201603	1958	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I find it interesting that the SEP medians are moving decidedly away in this round from the Tealbook rate forecast and closer to markets.	23.0	104.0
201603	1959	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Now, of course, the Tealbook rate forecast is, by construction, a mechanical application of a particular Taylor rule without normative aspirations or intent.	23.0	104.0
201603	1960	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Although I’m broadly comfortable with the Tealbook’s real economy forecast, I doubt that forecast would be achieved if rates actually followed the forecast path in the Tealbook.	23.0	104.0
201603	1961	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	The forecast is for eight or nine rate increases in the next two years.	23.0	104.0
201603	1962	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	And if you add in those rate increases plus a reversion of the term premium, the 10-year Treasury yield is forecast to be 3.6 percent at the end of 2017, and those readings all seem to be deep in the tails of market expectations, both in market readings and in surveys, and out of touch with the realities of the global economy.	23.0	104.0
201603	1963	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I don’t really have an answer to suggest.	23.0	104.0
201603	1964	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	I just will note that there seems to be a growing disconnect there.	23.0	104.0
201603	1965	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, weak global growth is likely to put a fairly low speed limit on our own growth and on the path of rate increases.	23.0	104.0
201603	1966	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	It strikes me that the Committee faces a tradeoff between policy divergence and economic divergence.	23.0	104.0
201603	1967	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	If our policy diverges too much from what the rest of the world is doing, we’ll be unable to diverge meaningfully from the dismal state of global growth.	23.0	104.0
201603	1968	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Fortunately, I don’t see this tradeoff as a difficult one for us in the near term.	23.0	104.0
201603	1969	2016-03-16	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201603	1970	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1971	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201603	1972	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201603	1973	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201603	1974	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	My December SEP path assumed two funds rate increases later this year, and, after taking a hard look at my outlook, I found no compelling reason to change that assessment.	23.0	91.0
201603	1975	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A basic data-dependence calculation calls for holding steady today, in my opinion.	23.0	91.0
201603	1976	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Inflation is higher, but, as I discussed yesterday, we’re also facing tighter financial conditions than we anticipated in December.	23.0	91.0
201603	1977	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In effect, financial markets have tightened for us.	23.0	91.0
201603	1978	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	In addition, I continue to be concerned that inflation expectations have declined or, at the very least, are fragile.	23.0	91.0
201603	1979	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	The forces holding down inflation expectations are global, and I don’t think it is so easy for us to depart from the rest of the world.	23.0	91.0
201603	1980	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	To me, these developments at least offset what could prove to be a short-lived increase in core inflation, but, of course, monitoring the data developments remains important.	23.0	91.0
201603	1981	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	A risk-management approach also continues to argue for no change in rates today and a plan for only a couple of increases in 2016.	23.0	91.0
201603	1982	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	First, we shouldn’t overreact to the positive news on inflation.	23.0	91.0
201603	1983	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	We’ve underrun 2 percent for quite a long time.	23.0	91.0
201603	1984	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Now we’ve seen high first-quarter readings on inflation.	23.0	91.0
201603	1985	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	This could turn out to be transitory.	23.0	91.0
201603	1986	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	There’s very little cost in waiting a few months to get a better reading on the true underlying trends.	23.0	91.0
201603	1987	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Second, on account of the modest pace of growth in our baseline forecast and the considerable uncertainty and downside risks emanating from international economic conditions, I believe that policy should provide strong support to aggregate demand as a buffer against future downside shocks.	23.0	91.0
201603	1988	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Our continued proximity to the effective lower bound leaves us little conventional ammunition to address such shocks, and, despite the excellent staff memos on policy alternatives we could use if the economy were to weaken, I would prefer to be extracautious this year to avoid having to resort to those contingencies.	23.0	91.0
201603	1989	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Third, a very gradual path of rate increases helps counter the risk that inflation expectations could be lower.	23.0	91.0
201603	1990	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Any appropriately accommodative policy rate path should provide a strong signal of our commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201603	1991	2016-03-16	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201603	1992	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	1993	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201603	1994	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201603	1995	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I also favor alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201603	1996	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think the impulse to allow some time to see if global volatility has actually calmed down may itself be a sufficient reason for maintaining the policy stance.	23.0	97.0
201603	1997	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	For me, there’s the additional, more basic motivation of a risk-management approach that counsels some—although, obviously, not heavy—bias against raising rates under current circumstances and does so for a few reasons.	23.0	97.0
201603	1998	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	First, as people in and out of the Committee have mentioned frequently, there is the asymmetry of tools available to us to meet upside and downside risks.	23.0	97.0
201603	1999	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, in that regard, I’d recall Beth Anne’s discussion yesterday of the difficulties being encountered by the ECB and the BOJ in trying to implement unconventional policies.	23.0	97.0
201603	2000	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Second, there is what I, at least, regard as the relatively low probability of inflation getting away from us if it proves to have a little bit more bounce than I currently expect.	23.0	97.0
201603	2001	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And here I think—not today, obviously, but over the coming months—I could probably use some help from those of you who keep referring to this possibility of inflation getting away from us, because I want to understand what the theory of that is under current circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201603	2002	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I know there are a couple of historical episodes that people point to, but, with my limited reading and understanding of those episodes, they seem to be characterized by things like the economy having run hot for a considerable period of time; a big fiscal stimulus in one instance coming into play; and being in an era in which central banks, including this one, had not worked as hard as they have more recently to establish the prevailing theory of anchored inflation expectations.	23.0	97.0
201603	2003	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I may have some doubts personally about what I still regard as sort of an undertheorized theory, but if you believe in the anchored expectations approach—and that seems to have animated a good majority of this Committee over the past five or six years—I do have some difficulty understanding how and why those same anchored inflation expectations would not keep inflation anchored during a period in which actual inflation was beginning to move up and thereby give us time to react.	23.0	97.0
201603	2004	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The reaction could be, by some measure, a little bit slow, but, again, if I understand the inflation expectations hypothesis correctly, it shouldn’t get too far away from us during that period.	23.0	97.0
201603	2005	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And, presumably, as the Committee begins to react, the expectations would have been reinforced—“Oh, yes, they may be a little bit slow, but they’re still committed to 2 percent over the medium term.”	23.0	97.0
201603	2006	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As I say, I would like to understand better what the current theory is for why things could get away from us.	23.0	97.0
201603	2007	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And I’ll just note very briefly that there’s a third reason for what people term the risk-management approach—the possibility that we’re in a fundamentally different economic environment in which the major challenge is not inflation or stagflation but stubbornly low inflation and growth.	23.0	97.0
201603	2008	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	This is sort of the secular-stagnation hypothesis and its variants.	23.0	97.0
201603	2009	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	You don’t need to believe that this is necessarily the case, but if there’s something to it, we could be assessing things through eyes that were trained for and through very different experiences.	23.0	97.0
201603	2010	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But if these sorts of hypotheses prove to have limited or no salience, again, we should have time to react to actual changes in the economy.	23.0	97.0
201603	2011	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	As to the language, personally, as I noted yesterday, I think the risks are pretty clearly to the downside, but there are good institutional reasons, both positive and normative, for issuing a statement that doesn’t come down too heavily in making that point or, indeed, in making any point substantially different from the ones we’ve been making over the past couple of statements.	23.0	97.0
201603	2012	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	The positive reason is the obvious one that I probably couldn’t garner a consensus for that view and inserting a stronger statement.	23.0	97.0
201603	2013	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But the normative reason, I think, is more powerful, and that’s that I don’t believe we should swing too much from meeting to meeting in what we’re saying in the statements.	23.0	97.0
201603	2014	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	We need to take account of things that are happening, and that’s what paragraph 1 allows us to do.	23.0	97.0
201603	2015	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	It may shift a little bit what we’re expecting, and that’s what paragraph 2 allows us to do.	23.0	97.0
201603	2016	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	But too much of a swing, particularly at periods in which we are not actually inclined to make a policy move, strikes me as risking our own credibility as markets begin to try to figure out “Where are they this month?” and “They just kind of veer all over the place.”	23.0	97.0
201603	2017	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I would have felt that way even if things were still somewhat more volatile in markets, so long as the effect was not being significantly felt in the real economy.	23.0	97.0
201603	2018	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	I think alt-B does a very nice job of doing that, in that the important clause inserted in paragraph 1 makes the point that, notwithstanding the global developments of recent months, we’ve still been expanding at a moderate pace.	23.0	97.0
201603	2019	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	And paragraph 2 notes that there are still some risks out there.	23.0	97.0
201603	2020	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	So I think that actually does quite a good job of maintaining everyone’s optionality right now.	23.0	97.0
201603	2021	2016-03-16	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201603	2022	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2023	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201603	2024	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201603	2025	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although financial markets have improved recently, the underlying drivers of the risk-off movements in markets last summer and at the start of this year remain largely unresolved.	23.0	107.0
201603	2026	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Global growth is very low.	23.0	107.0
201603	2027	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This low growth, together with concerns about foreign policymakers having limited additional space, increases the vulnerability of important economies to adverse shocks and makes it more difficult to correct financial imbalances.	23.0	107.0
201603	2028	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the chances that adverse events abroad will, through significant further dollar appreciation or financial turmoil, affect inflation and activity here at home are sobering.	23.0	107.0
201603	2029	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, the asymmetry in policy at the effective lower bound makes it more challenging to respond to such adverse shocks.	23.0	107.0
201603	2030	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, there are also risks on the other side.	23.0	107.0
201603	2031	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	The strength in household demand and the labor market could be indicating that resource utilization will soon become very tight.	23.0	107.0
201603	2032	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This could push inflation persistently above our 2 percent target and put upward pressure on inflation expectations above 2 percent.	23.0	107.0
201603	2033	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve listened carefully to the discussion around this table, and I take these considerations very seriously.	23.0	107.0
201603	2034	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	However, I believe we have much greater policy space using conventional tools to deal with this, and several considerations lead me to assess that the probability of such an outcome is somewhat lower than the alternative.	23.0	107.0
201603	2035	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	First, as the most recent labor market report illustrated, supply in the labor market may be more responsive to improving labor market conditions than we previously thought.	23.0	107.0
201603	2036	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Second, recent research has suggested that the slope of the Phillips curve is flatter now than it has been in previous decades.	23.0	107.0
201603	2037	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, recent data on inflation expectations suggest that the risks to inflation expectations are to the downside, not to the upside.	23.0	107.0
201603	2038	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, these hints of lower inflation expectations have developed against a backdrop of sub–2 percent inflation for nearly every month of the past six years, together with weak and fragile global growth.	23.0	107.0
201603	2039	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It is difficult to imagine these circumstances reversing—with inflation persistently significantly above our target and worries about inflation expectations moving higher—any time soon.	23.0	107.0
201603	2040	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, I’m struck that the majority of FOMC participants see risks to headline and core PCE inflation as tilted to the downside, a noticeable shift compared with December.	23.0	107.0
201603	2041	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Third, it’s helpful to remember that the world is in a different place than it was in the decades prior to the financial crisis.	23.0	107.0
201603	2042	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the natural rate of interest both here and in much of the rest of the world is considerably lower, with many estimates suggesting a rate currently close to zero.	23.0	107.0
201603	2043	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, the backdrop of weak and decelerating global demand suggests that any unexpected strengthening here at home will be absorbed, at least in part, through some combination of further appreciation of the exchange rate and tightening of financial conditions.	23.0	107.0
201603	2044	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	To guard against the downside risks posed by the current environment, monetary policy should focus on carefully preserving and protecting the areas of strength in our economy.	23.0	107.0
201603	2045	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	It should recognize the endogeneity of financial conditions to our expected policy rate path due to the fragility of the global economy.	23.0	107.0
201603	2046	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	By doing so, we can increase the economy’s resilience and make it less susceptible to adverse shocks, and, importantly, we’ll also reduce the probability that we would confront the need to make further use of unconventional policies.	23.0	107.0
201603	2047	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the language in alternative B strikes that careful balance.	23.0	107.0
201603	2048	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Although it notes that global economic and financial developments pose risks, it does not conclude that, therefore, overall risks are tilted to the downside.	23.0	107.0
201603	2049	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	This careful evolution of the language, together with the SEP, should provide useful guidance on how the Committee is likely to adjust the policy rate path in response to the evolution of the data.	23.0	107.0
201603	2050	2016-03-16	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201603	2051	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2052	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201603	2053	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	2054	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	As inflation remains below target, and that my economic forecast anticipates only a gradual increase in inflation, I support alternative B at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201603	2055	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	It is not crucial that we adjust policy today, but I believe it is important, in view of the underlying strength of the economy and the increasing likelihood that inflation will return to target in the not-too-distant future, that a move in April not be taken off the table at this point.	23.0	999.0
201603	2056	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets continue to improve, and a recent FRBSF Economic Letter—“What’s Up with Wage Growth?”	23.0	999.0
201603	2057	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	There’s been a strong rebound in equity prices, and financial volatility has waned as well.	23.0	999.0
201603	2058	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Inflation has shown signs of firming as oil prices have bottomed and even risen a little bit of late and the dollar has stabilized.	23.0	999.0
201603	2059	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I am more confident in the economy than I was two months ago and less concerned about the potential for a sustained decrease in inflation or inflation deviating from target for a significant time to come.	23.0	999.0
201603	2060	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Monetary policy remains accommodative, and we will still be accommodative in the event of future rate hikes.	23.0	999.0
201603	2061	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I think we need to remain, as we’ve all said, data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201603	2062	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	And should the economy evolve somewhat in line with my forecast, a rate hike at the next meeting merits consideration.	23.0	999.0
201603	2063	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Signs of firming in inflation remain an important consideration for the setting of policy.	23.0	999.0
201603	2064	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	But with inflation moving toward our objective and the economy at or above full employment, we risk sending confusing signals to the market if we delay normalization for too long.	23.0	999.0
201603	2065	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	I worry that we are setting up an uncertainty feedback loop in which we consistently emphasize the risk that inflation will not return to target, and the markets reflect that concern, leading to volatility and lower inflation compensation, causing us to, again, pause normalization, which further worries the market.	23.0	999.0
201603	2066	2016-03-16	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201603	2067	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201603	2068	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201603	2069	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I support alt-B.	23.0	108.0
201603	2070	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe the federal funds rate should be placed on a very gradually rising path, which should, of course, be data dependent in the sense that every decision depends on economic developments and, primarily, on expectations of the effect of that and expected subsequent decisions on the economy.	23.0	108.0
201603	2071	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	At this time, after a period of serious market and economic turbulence from which the US economy has largely but not totally recovered, we should pause for at least one more meeting in order to assess whether the ill winds of the first six weeks of 2016 have mostly abated, as now appears to be the case.	23.0	108.0
201603	2072	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	By “ill winds,”	23.0	108.0
201603	2073	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I mean mainly winds that have come from abroad, but also some that are domestic—for example, the apparent loosening of the long-term expected inflation anchor, on whose amazing stability we have long relied.	23.0	108.0
201603	2074	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	As I mentioned yesterday, I believe we need to figure out how changes in the inflation anchor relate to the short- term expectations that matter for critical aspects of the inflationary process, including wage determination.	23.0	108.0
201603	2075	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In yesterday’s interesting go-round on the state of the economy, there was virtual unanimity that the global environment in which the US economy operates has become more risky—mainly, but not entirely, in a downward direction.	23.0	108.0
201603	2076	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	There was more confidence about the resilience of the US economy, along with concerns about the potential unmooring of inflation expectations; the potential slowdown of domestic demand, which was reinforced by the data that came in at the beginning of yesterday’s session; and the potential damage, in particular, that could be caused by foreign shocks.	23.0	108.0
201603	2077	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, each of us produced a list of potential problems in both foreign and domestic economies, replete with cautionary adjectives, to an extent that must have frightened all of us.	23.0	108.0
201603	2078	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, it was enough to make one’s hair curl.	23.0	108.0
201603	2079	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Certainly, my hair has curled, though I must admit that, when my wife explained to me it was the humidity that had done it, I countered that she had not been at the discussion, and that she needed to understand how frightening that was.	23.0	108.0
201603	2080	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	What was lacking was an estimate of what the sum of all of the foreign risks amounted to, in terms of their potential effect on us, whether we move in April—as I would, at this stage, believe appropriate—or, rather, wait until June or even make no further moves this year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2081	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I understand from a conversation with the staff that the appreciation of the exchange rate since mid-2014 is estimated to have reduced GDP by 1 percent in total so far and is expected to reduce GDP by 1¼ percent in total by the end of next year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2082	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, there are other considerations that explicitly or implicitly affect our decision.	23.0	108.0
201603	2083	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	First, it’s hard to pull the trigger.	23.0	108.0
201603	2084	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Among the 320 million or so Americans are several million, a number of them columnists, who know much better than we do what decisions we should make.	23.0	108.0
201603	2085	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23.0	108.0
201603	2086	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	So we will be criticized no matter what decisions we make.	23.0	108.0
201603	2087	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the price we pay for having accepted the responsibilities of making the critical decisions we face eight times each year.	23.0	108.0
201603	2088	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Concern over making a mistake may sometimes point to the value of waiting for more information.	23.0	108.0
201603	2089	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But prudence requires us to make the right decisions at the right times on the basis of the information available.	23.0	108.0
201603	2090	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Second, and most important, is the credibility of the Federal Reserve.	23.0	108.0
201603	2091	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we gained credibility by the Chair’s calmness during the recent turbulence, and the expected continuation of that calmness will contribute even more to our credibility.	23.0	108.0
201603	2092	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	But, of course, what ultimately gives an individual or an institution credibility is the quality of its decisions, and I believe we’re making the right decision today.	23.0	108.0
201603	2093	2016-03-16	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201603	2094	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2095	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201603	2096	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201603	2097	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today as written.	23.0	94.0
201603	2098	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think there is a good case for moving today on the basis of the Committee’s outlook as of December.	23.0	94.0
201603	2099	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We basically have very good labor market reports, we arguably have an upside surprise on core inflation measures, and the global economy is arguably expected to grow more rapidly in 2016 than it did in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201603	2100	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, I’m advocating that we wait at this juncture because I would like more reassurance that market-based inflation expectations will return to more satisfactory levels.	23.0	94.0
201603	2101	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment is partially based on my reading of the euro-area experience over the past several years.	23.0	94.0
201603	2102	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that our European colleagues reacted slowly to declining inflation expectations in Europe.	23.0	94.0
201603	2103	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	They did eventually move aggressively, but it’s a very long road back for them.	23.0	94.0
201603	2104	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	In January 2012, 10-year nominal government bonds in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany had very similar yields, with Japan and Switzerland about 150 basis points lower.	23.0	94.0
201603	2105	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You could interpret that as differences in inflation expectations in the two sets of countries, with a real interest rate that is equalized across economies.	23.0	94.0
201603	2106	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Today Germany has joined the lower group, and the United States and the United Kingdom remain in the higher group.	23.0	94.0
201603	2107	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I would prefer that we not join the lower group.	23.0	94.0
201603	2108	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that, ultimately, we got a more substantial impact on the basis of the December rate hike than I anticipated at the time when we made that move.	23.0	94.0
201603	2109	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	At the time, I interpreted our move as a small action with a lot of language meant to emphasize data dependence.	23.0	94.0
201603	2110	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	My judgment today is that the market interpretation was very different.	23.0	94.0
201603	2111	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The market took the view that the December move set in motion a train of calendar-based moves.	23.0	94.0
201603	2112	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	This is not entirely unwarranted on the market’s part—because this is how the Committee actually behaved from 2004 to 2006, when we made 17 straight moves of 25 basis points per meeting.	23.0	94.0
201603	2113	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The combination of moving off zero and the median of the dot plot seemed to suggest a fixed path of rates regardless of the data.	23.0	94.0
201603	2114	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And, early in the year, as the data came in negative, that seemed to add up to recession probabilities for the United States, according to market participants.	23.0	94.0
201603	2115	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	To me, this experience calls into question the value of the policy rate portion of the SEP.	23.0	94.0
201603	2116	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	One of the problems with the policy rate portion of the SEP is that we have in the past tried to use that as a tool to commit to the path of interest rates.	23.0	94.0
201603	2117	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So during the time we were at zero, we wanted to encourage markets to look at the zero rates out into the future as a commitment that we would be sufficiently accommodative to match the state of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201603	2118	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We are now trying to say that the path of rates suggested in the SEP is not a commitment but is merely a reflection of our judgment of the future evolution of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201603	2119	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think that this is causing confusion, and our experience over the December/January/February period has made me worry more about it.	23.0	94.0
201603	2120	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	There was a time when we did not give such explicit forward guidance about how we were going to operate in the future, and a lot of that period—in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s— was considered very successful.	23.0	94.0
201603	2121	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Part of the reason it might have been successful is, we did not have this possibly misinterpreted future path of the policy rate sitting out there.	23.0	94.0
201603	2122	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not under any illusions that we would do anything about this immediately, and I think it would help the Committee to put the confidence bands around the policy rate and the other elements of the SEP that we discussed previously and, I think, are going to discuss again.	23.0	94.0
201603	2123	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But we should think more carefully about the wisdom of giving policy guidance through the SEP if we do not intend it to be some kind of commitment in the future.	23.0	94.0
201603	2124	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Now, we have a lot of language that says everything is data dependent, but I guess my experience over December/January was that we don’t have a lot of credibility on that particular language.	23.0	94.0
201603	2125	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Today’s decision will indeed demonstrate some data dependence but in a somewhat awkward way, since intermeeting jobs reports were strong and inflation seems to be conforming more or less exactly with Committee projections.	23.0	94.0
201603	2126	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So we’re likely to create with the decision today, even though I support it, a somewhat more confused picture about what the Committee’s policy reaction function actually is.	23.0	94.0
201603	2127	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee’s policy reaction function does not simply depend on our mandated inflation and employment variables, why not put the other variables in the SEP?	23.0	94.0
201603	2128	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If we’re going to cite global GDP growth, then why not have Committee members forecasting global GDP growth and seeing what their outlook is, and we can see how that changes from meeting to meeting?	23.0	94.0
201603	2129	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If it’s risk associated with the global outlook, let’s put risk in there, and then people can see how that’s evolving over time and how that’s feeding into our policy decisionmaking.	23.0	94.0
201603	2130	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think what we have is that these kinds of objects are supposed to feed back to employment and inflation outcomes, but what we’re saying today is that, even though those outcomes were relatively good during the intermeeting period and are basically on track, we’re still not going to move today.	23.0	94.0
201603	2131	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Also, I’m citing inflation expectations—those also aren’t in the SEP.	23.0	94.0
201603	2132	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	If I really thought I needed inflation expectations to get to some particular level, then maybe that should be in there as well.	23.0	94.0
201603	2133	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee is, in my view, today taking a calculated risk and possibly getting “behind the curve” later this year.	23.0	94.0
201603	2134	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I guess one thing I’d remind the Committee of is, we’ve moved only once, so it’s not like we’ve had a sequence of moves.	23.0	94.0
201603	2135	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve made only a single move of 25 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201603	2136	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	We did lay out a path of what we’re going to do, and it could easily get derailed in the first half of the year.	23.0	94.0
201603	2137	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation could continue to go up.	23.0	94.0
201603	2138	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think this risk is particularly high right now, but it’s becoming palpable.	23.0	94.0
201603	2139	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	A larger risk may be that the signal being sent is that the Committee is growing very pessimistic concerning US macroeconomic prospects.	23.0	94.0
201603	2140	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I think such a signal would be unwarranted, and that should not be the main message of the FOMC in this situation.	23.0	94.0
201603	2141	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201603	2142	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2143	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201603	2144	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201603	2145	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	I support the language in alternative B for paragraphs 1 and 2, but I do not agree with its policy prescription.	23.0	103.0
201603	2146	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Since the December meeting, incoming data have largely confirmed my outlook.	23.0	103.0
201603	2147	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	We’ve received three strong labor reports as well as data indicating that inflation is moving higher.	23.0	103.0
201603	2148	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Unfortunately, our initiation of removing accommodation has coincided with what appears to me a more vulnerable global economy and a domestic economy that is threatened by markets that seem to be anxious, uncertain, and volatile.	23.0	103.0
201603	2149	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Faced with these dynamics, I recognize that the Committee’s decisions to continue to normalize its policy settings become far more difficult.	23.0	103.0
201603	2150	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Risks associated with financial volatility and global concerns have diminished recently, but I would agree with others that there have been no fundamental changes that would preclude more bouts of volatility in the days and even months ahead.	23.0	103.0
201603	2151	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So, in the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, I’m inclined to focus on our longer-run objectives.	23.0	103.0
201603	2152	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the economy is near full employment, and the recent upward movements in year- over-year headline PCE inflation and core PCE inflation suggest that the temporary downward pressures associated with falling oil prices and appreciation of the dollar have been dissipating.	23.0	103.0
201603	2153	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	In the interest of our mandate to promote long-run sustainable growth with healthy employment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these developments by slowly removing accommodation.	23.0	103.0
201603	2154	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The Committee has acknowledged that the pace of policy adjustments is expected to be more gradual than would be dictated based solely on economic conditions as prescribed by policy rules.	23.0	103.0
201603	2155	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Likewise, a gradual path does offer a risk-management approach as we face various headwinds and risk in the economy.	23.0	103.0
201603	2156	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	As described in Tealbook B, the real equilibrium interest rate and policy rules continue to point to settings that are, and will continue to be for some time, very accommodative under the baseline assumption regarding the federal funds rate path.	23.0	103.0
201603	2157	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	The current federal funds rate is more than 2 percentage points below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r*, and the only time since 2005 that this gap was larger was immediately prior to the December liftoff.	23.0	103.0
201603	2158	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Postponing the removal of accommodation in the wake of improving economic conditions could very well promote risk that would decrease the likelihood of achieving our longer-run objectives.	23.0	103.0
201603	2159	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	As we near full employment and price stability, continuation of the current level of accommodation invites further misallocation of capital and labor resources to sectors that are most interest sensitive.	23.0	103.0
201603	2160	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My District is experiencing the fallout of a commodity price boom, and concerns are being raised nationwide regarding risk associated with commercial real estate lending.	23.0	103.0
201603	2161	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	My concern for some time has been that extending monetary policy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic, and political distortions.	23.0	103.0
201603	2162	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Waiting may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressures, and confidence is often expressed that we’ll have the ability to make the necessary or steeper adjustments later.	23.0	103.0
201603	2163	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	This argument might be more persuasive if one was confident that the relationship between employment and inflation was reasonably positive.	23.0	103.0
201603	2164	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	But most estimates suggest that the Phillips curve is pretty flat.	23.0	103.0
201603	2165	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Under this scenario, the challenges of speeding up inflation now, when it is below target, must be equivalent to future challenges of slowing inflation down, should it move above.	23.0	103.0
201603	2166	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	With an output gap that is basically closed, I see costs associated with trying to fine-tune inflation dynamics when the transmission mechanism from unemployment to inflation is relatively weak.	23.0	103.0
201603	2167	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	So staying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted, in my view.	23.0	103.0
201603	2168	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	A 25 basis point increase at this meeting is consistent with the economy’s fundamentals, keeps policy very accommodative, and does not preclude pausing or responding if downside risks, in fact, materialize.	23.0	103.0
201603	2169	2016-03-16	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201603	2170	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2171	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201603	2172	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201603	2173	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I’d like to say that my views align very much with President Mester’s.	23.0	102.0
201603	2174	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So everything I add to that will probably be less coherent.	23.0	102.0
201603	2175	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I think she captured my sentiments very much as well.	23.0	102.0
201603	2176	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The baseline outlook is little changed, in my view, from the time of the December meeting.	23.0	102.0
201603	2177	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	A wide range of labor market indicators—the unemployment rate, U-6, quits, and vacancies—have continued to improve and are at levels consistent with maximum employment.	23.0	102.0
201603	2178	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Survey data on the ease of either finding or filling jobs also point to fairly tight labor markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2179	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although we continue to fall short on our inflation goal, the recent news on that front has been encouraging.	23.0	102.0
201603	2180	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Incoming data show some firming of underlying inflation.	23.0	102.0
201603	2181	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oil and other commodity prices have begun to recover.	23.0	102.0
201603	2182	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The dollar has stabilized, and the continued strength of the labor market should help propel a more rapid pace of price and wage gains.	23.0	102.0
201603	2183	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, risks to the outlook appear roughly balanced, to my mind.	23.0	102.0
201603	2184	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The resilience of the economy in the face of foreign headwinds to date has been notable.	23.0	102.0
201603	2185	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mentioned this yesterday.	23.0	102.0
201603	2186	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We saw a big drag to net exports the last couple of years with the strengthening of the dollar and the decline in the oil prices.	23.0	102.0
201603	2187	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	All of those shocks started occurring in 2014 and had their full effects in 2015.	23.0	102.0
201603	2188	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yet the economy continued to grow, adding over 2.7 million jobs last year.	23.0	102.0
201603	2189	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And we’ve seen, as people commented on, a stabilizing, I think, of underlying inflation and are now seeing some signs of a firming of inflation despite the fact that we actually got hit by the big shocks.	23.0	102.0
201603	2190	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Moreover, domestically, there are upside risks to consumer and housing expenditure, and fiscal policy is set to be more accommodative over the near term.	23.0	102.0
201603	2191	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Given that these conditions are consistent with my December modal forecast, I persevere in believing that, in the modal outlook, four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this year.	23.0	102.0
201603	2192	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, I found the text of the case for alternative C in Tealbook B compelling.	23.0	102.0
201603	2193	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I thought it was very well written in terms of the description of the issues.	23.0	102.0
201603	2194	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should say that I think, at least in my interpretation—I’m kind of struggling with this a bit—the difference in my view about the policy rate path really isn’t about the baseline outlook or the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2195	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about how to evaluate the risks to the outlook and the implications of those risks for the outlook regarding appropriate policy.	23.0	102.0
201603	2196	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually don’t think that my views are that different in terms of the modal outlook than those of the median voter, or at least the median participant, of the FOMC.	23.0	102.0
201603	2197	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s really about, how to best take into account the risk-management aspects that Governor Tarullo, President Evans, and others have highlighted— what these risks really look like and what they mean for the economy and our ability to adjust policy in response to those risks.	23.0	102.0
201603	2198	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think there’s a bit of a bimodal distribution out there in the markets—and, perhaps, in our own views—where the main positive, outlook is actually one of continued solid growth, continued job gains, continued movement of inflation toward 2 percent, and all of that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2199	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that modal outlook, I think four rate increases actually are completely consistent.	23.0	102.0
201603	2200	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I disagree a little bit with what Governor Powell was saying.	23.0	102.0
201603	2201	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that, if that outlook eventuates—if we add over 2 million jobs this year and if unemployment gets down toward 4½ percent—three or four funds rate increases this year and movements of the 10-year Treasuries and things wouldn’t be that surprising to markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2202	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It would be seen as a sign of strength.	23.0	102.0
201603	2203	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think there’s a consistency in the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2204	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the real issue, again, is how to incorporate the information about this negative scenario in terms of both what’s appropriate policy in the baseline and how we’d react to that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2205	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s just explaining my own thinking in terms of the modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2206	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I am becoming increasingly concerned that we are falling further “behind the curve” on this modal outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2207	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonetheless, I do support alternative B as written today.	23.0	102.0
201603	2208	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d repeat pretty much what everybody has said.	23.0	102.0
201603	2209	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The language of alt-B, I think, is a good balance.	23.0	102.0
201603	2210	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with Governor Brainard’s way of describing that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2211	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is a good place to be at this time, and one of the reasons I come to that conclusion, despite my somewhat hawkish view of where the economy is going or where policy should be, is that in our statements in December and January, we emphasized that “the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”	23.0	102.0
201603	2212	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s a commitment we made as a Committee, and I signed on to that last December and in January.	23.0	102.0
201603	2213	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that does make a strong case for not moving in March—to collect some more data and make sure that we have a stronger conviction regarding the data both on the outlook for employment and, especially, on inflation.	23.0	102.0
201603	2214	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	To my mind, not moving in March is completely consistent with my view that we will need to raise rates on a steady path over the next couple of years.	23.0	102.0
201603	2215	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I view, basically, the decision we’re making today as completely consistent with our previous commitments to be data dependent and to assess both actual and expected progress toward our goal.	23.0	102.0
201603	2216	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in terms of looking forward, I think we’ve successfully convinced the markets that we’re not on some preordained path.	23.0	102.0
201603	2217	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the SEP, when it comes out, will show people that whoever thought we were going to have four increases this year—which I think was nobody— clearly, we’ve changed our view on that, reflecting especially the issues regarding the risks to the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201603	2218	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think that alternative B is very good.	23.0	102.0
201603	2219	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It keeps our options open to gather more data and basically honor the commitment we made in our statement to both assess and monitor actual and expected progress toward our goals.	23.0	102.0
201603	2220	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I hope the data will verify that what we’ve seen lately with the stronger numbers persists and continues, and then we can make our future decisions based on that.	23.0	102.0
201603	2221	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own view is that, if the data do come in as I expect, in future meetings we will have that flexibility to respond as appropriate to normalize policy in a timely manner.	23.0	102.0
201603	2222	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Going 13th has the advantage of allowing me to respond to other people’s comments, so I’ve done that a little bit.	23.0	102.0
201603	2223	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I’d like to respond to President Bullard’s comments about the dot plots.	23.0	102.0
201603	2224	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t agree that the dot plots were a commitment for a specific path of policy.	23.0	102.0
201603	2225	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think they never were described that way, nor have they been interpreted that way.	23.0	102.0
201603	2226	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the dot plots have changed over time.	23.0	102.0
201603	2227	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been doing this for years.	23.0	102.0
201603	2228	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	You can see the dots changing as the data evolve and as the outlook evolves.	23.0	102.0
201603	2229	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	When Glenn Rudebusch and I wrote a paper over eight years ago basically kind of making the case for interest rate projections, the whole idea really was not that the dot plots were giving you some commitment or some promise to do something.	23.0	102.0
201603	2230	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was laying out your thinking about this, and, as the data evolved and as the outlook and the risks to the outlook changed, the projections would change over time and provide information about how the expected policy rate path changes as data, economic conditions, and the outlook change.	23.0	102.0
201603	2231	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, when we were at the effective lower bound for years and years, we didn’t really see that reaction function showing itself, because we weren’t doing anything.	23.0	102.0
201603	2232	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But now we actually are showing the changes in our dots as the information changes, and I think this is a very helpful tool to give people information about our reaction function.	23.0	102.0
201603	2233	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	If our reaction function includes risks to the outlook and risk-management concerns, that’s hard to explain.	23.0	102.0
201603	2234	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with President Bullard that it’s not in our SEP.	23.0	102.0
201603	2235	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is something the Chair and the minutes and our SEP assessments of risks will explain.	23.0	102.0
201603	2236	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, insofar as the Committee is deciding to make policy decisions on the basis of the risks to the outlook, we should communicate that, and I think this is what’s going to come out of the March SEP—that the risks to the outlook are a factor in people’s decisions.	23.0	102.0
201603	2237	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	The last bit of good news I’ll mention—and this is something that I showed at the Monetary Policy Forum—is that if you looked at the bond market responsiveness to macro news, on the basis of this work that Eric Swanson and I did years ago, you saw that go way down when we were at the effective lower bound and were expected to stay there for two years or so.	23.0	102.0
201603	2238	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, the markets were sitting there saying, “Two-year yields and one-year yields aren’t moving in response to macro news,” because everybody knew that a little bit of good employment data or a weak CPI wasn’t fundamentally going to change the planned path of the policy rate for the next couple of years, as we were so deep underwater, if you will, on the zero bound.	23.0	102.0
201603	2239	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	But today, as we move to being just slightly above the lower bound, we’ve seen the market reactions—in terms of the bond rates, in terms of options pricing—move partially.	23.0	102.0
201603	2240	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	On a one-year yield, it’s responding about three-quarters as much as normal—as it did back in the 1990s—and on two-year yields, about half as much as normal.	23.0	102.0
201603	2241	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m starting to see that muscle memory coming back to markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2242	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was just asking Simon here, you get a strong CPI, sure, market expectations of interest rates are going to go up a little bit.	23.0	102.0
201603	2243	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yields are going to move around.	23.0	102.0
201603	2244	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a pattern we’re seeing.	23.0	102.0
201603	2245	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a healthy development.	23.0	102.0
201603	2246	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we have the problems that President Bullard was concerned about, that somehow our dot plots or our other communications are confusing markets.	23.0	102.0
201603	2247	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think what’s happening is that markets, now that we’ve moved away from the effective lower bound—and expectations are that we will move very slowly further away from it—are starting to react more as we want them to do.	23.0	102.0
201603	2248	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the saying that we’ve always used as monetary economists is, “Let the markets do the work”—when there’s good news, yields move up, and when there’s bad news, yields move down.	23.0	102.0
201603	2249	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I actually feel much more positive about how our communication is working and about how the markets are reacting to interpreting news in terms of our reaction function.	23.0	102.0
201603	2250	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	We still have some way to go, because we’re still pretty close to the bound—we have a lot of risks that can push us back to the effective lower bound, but I guess my own view is that we’re halfway there in getting back to more-normal market functioning associated with our rate expectations.	23.0	102.0
201603	2251	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the dot plots could be helpful in that regard.	23.0	102.0
201603	2252	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s it.	23.0	102.0
201603	2253	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I said I support alternative B, right?	23.0	102.0
201603	2254	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Did I give that out?	23.0	102.0
201603	2255	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23.0	102.0
201603	2256	2016-03-16	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201603	2257	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I heard that, yes.	23.0	65.0
201603	2258	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard’s got a two hander.	23.0	65.0
201603	2259	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, if I could just respond a little bit.	23.0	94.0
201603	2260	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I agreed with much of what President Williams said.	23.0	94.0
201603	2261	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	I do want to remind the Committee that we did actually have calendar guidance at one point.	23.0	94.0
201603	2262	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Then the dot plots were conforming with that guidance, and we were saying this is a commitment that we’re not going to do anything until some amount of time passes.	23.0	94.0
201603	2263	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	So I think to be able to transition from that kind of thinking about the dot plots to now saying, “This is no commitment out there”—that was very difficult, especially with regard to the first rate increase, and I did not appreciate how hard that was going to be.	23.0	94.0
201603	2264	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And I think you’re right, muscle memory will probably come back to markets, and everything might be fine eventually.	23.0	94.0
201603	2265	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But I think, right around this time of liftoff, I didn’t appreciate how much of an issue that might be.	23.0	94.0
201603	2266	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201603	2267	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201603	2268	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Let me start with a two-handed intervention.	23.0	81.0
201603	2269	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23.0	81.0
201603	2270	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	23.0	65.0
201603	2271	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	If you look at the language we used when we were at the zero bound, we were extremely careful not to call it a commitment.	23.0	81.0
201603	2272	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We were extremely careful to say we were predicting what we would want to do in the future.	23.0	81.0
201603	2273	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So to say we talked about it as a commitment is a bit of revisionist history.	23.0	81.0
201603	2274	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, was it interpreted that way?	23.0	81.0
201603	2275	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think so, because we argued that this was useful for achieving our objectives.	23.0	81.0
201603	2276	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So I think people read that as, the expectation that we would do that would be useful for our objectives, and therefore we wanted people to believe we would behave that way.	23.0	81.0
201603	2277	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That’s a little bit different from actually articulating a commitment, which I don’t think we did, but there’s a little subtlety here.	23.0	81.0
201603	2278	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	Well, I would dispute that it’s revisionist history.	23.0	94.0
201603	2279	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You had a theory out there, due to Woodford, that says, “This is exactly what you should do when you’re at the zero bound.	23.0	94.0
201603	2280	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	You should commit to be at the zero bound longer.”	23.0	94.0
201603	2281	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	And we talked about that.	23.0	94.0
201603	2282	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes, but that’s not how we wrote it.	23.0	81.0
201603	2283	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	We never endorsed that.	23.0	65.0
201603	2284	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	23.0	81.0
201603	2285	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t think anyone on the Committee endorsed that.	23.0	65.0
201603	2286	2016-03-16	meeting	BULLARD	But that was one of the things we talked about.	23.0	94.0
201603	2287	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	My one-hander.	23.0	81.0
201603	2288	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	23.0	81.0
201603	2289	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is yours.	23.0	65.0
201603	2290	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much.	23.0	81.0
201603	2291	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In considering the appropriate level for the funds rate target, I always think it’s beneficial to keep our eye on some relevant benchmarks.	23.0	81.0
201603	2292	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And the four Taylor rules in Tealbook B are alternative ways of encapsulating our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201603	2293	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I think they’re a useful reference to the extent that that behavior has served us well in the past.	23.0	81.0
201603	2294	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In December, those rules all recommended a higher funds rate, and we raised rates with the anticipation of several further rate increases this year to lower the gap between the recommendation of those rules and where we were.	23.0	81.0
201603	2295	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In January, we faced increased uncertainty in financial markets, and those Taylor rules uniformly prescribed lower rates than they had in December.	23.0	81.0
201603	2296	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	We paused and issued a statement signaling our concern.	23.0	81.0
201603	2297	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, however, the adverse financial market developments we saw in the first two months of the year have largely been reversed.	23.0	81.0
201603	2298	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, the turmoil has left little discernible trace on real economic data, which have largely confirmed our December outlook that there would be solid growth, and I think that’s pretty much a consensus around the table here.	23.0	81.0
201603	2299	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Inflation has moved back pretty smartly toward our objective as well.	23.0	81.0
201603	2300	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Each of the policy rules in the Tealbook now prescribes a higher rate for 2016:Q2 than it had in December, and each rule now prescribes a higher level for the funds rate—some considerably higher—than our current target.	23.0	81.0
201603	2301	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now, I would not ever advocate slavishly following any of these rules.	23.0	81.0
201603	2302	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	But, together, they capture important elements of our past behavior.	23.0	81.0
201603	2303	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	That past behavior has generally served us well, so it’s hard to think of another pattern of behavior that would be a better benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201603	2304	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The gaps between, on the one hand, the Taylor (1993) and Taylor (1999) rules and, on the other hand, the actual funds rate have grown considerably since a couple of years ago, when they both finally recommended a rate increase.	23.0	81.0
201603	2305	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	So it should be clear that we need to be raising rates over the course of the year, and I didn’t hear much disagreement with that.	23.0	81.0
201603	2306	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	I recognize that a case can be made to adjust the intercept in such rules using the estimates of a time-varying r*.	23.0	81.0
201603	2307	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Such adjustments would fall well short of eliminating cause for concern, however.	23.0	81.0
201603	2308	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Current estimates of r* are at or above zero, as opposed to the 1¼ percent assumed in the Tealbook Taylor rule calculations.	23.0	81.0
201603	2309	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The current real federal funds rate is below negative 1, so a sizable gap still remains.	23.0	81.0
201603	2310	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	The fact that we’ve been falling further behind these benchmarks leads me to think that staying put today is a risky strategy.	23.0	81.0
201603	2311	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	You’ve been articulate in public, Madam Chair, regarding the risk of waiting too long to remove accommodation.	23.0	81.0
201603	2312	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Inflation prospects can shift rapidly, and policy takes time to work.	23.0	81.0
201603	2313	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	While financial developments should always be taken seriously, the staff has noted several instances in which financial market indicators have signaled adverse developments that never materialized.	23.0	81.0
201603	2314	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	When we have waited too long in the past, it has often been in response to financial market developments that turned out, in hindsight, to be false signals.	23.0	81.0
201603	2315	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Now that there’s overwhelming evidence that the recent surge in financial market volatility is waning, I believe we should get on with the adjustments in the stance of monetary policy that we know we need to make over time.	23.0	81.0
201603	2316	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Many of you argued that, while financial markets may have calmed down, concerns linger nonetheless, and that the prudent choice would be to maintain the current funds rate target.	23.0	81.0
201603	2317	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	In view of the acknowledged need to remove accommodation over the course of the next several quarters and the risks associated with delaying that process, I’d argue that the prudent approach would be to stay the course and continue to raise rates at a gradual pace, including at today’s meeting.	23.0	81.0
201603	2318	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I favor alternative C.	23.0	81.0
201603	2319	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Yes, this might surprise market participants, but we could have—and I believe we should have—prepared markets for this choice.	23.0	81.0
201603	2320	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Keep in mind the instances in the past few years in which an announcement of new monetary stimulus seemed to be taken as a dark signal from us about the outlook.	23.0	81.0
201603	2321	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Raising rates today would be a sign of our confidence in the real economic prospects for our economy.	23.0	81.0
201603	2322	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Should we adopt alternative B, which seems pretty likely, the silver lining for me is that it leaves the door open to an April increase.	23.0	81.0
201603	2323	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	And I hope we convey that publicly, both at the press conference today and elsewhere.	23.0	81.0
201603	2324	2016-03-16	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201603	2325	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2326	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201603	2327	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201603	2328	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201603	2329	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I see four reasons why we should take a gradual approach to normalizing rates.	23.0	111.0
201603	2330	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	The first reason is inflation.	23.0	111.0
201603	2331	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Notwithstanding today’s data, inflation is pretty consistently coming up short, and inflation expectations appear to be weakening.	23.0	111.0
201603	2332	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Second, as we discussed yesterday, the improvement in labor force participation is welcome progress in putting people back to work.	23.0	111.0
201603	2333	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I think we should let that process continue so long as inflation is coming up short.	23.0	111.0
201603	2334	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Third, the outlook for the global economy continues to be quite uncertain, especially outside the United States.	23.0	111.0
201603	2335	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Finally, global policy divergence could pose increasing drag on the US economy and on our own inflation if the dollar continues to appreciate.	23.0	111.0
201603	2336	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	My last comment is, I’d like to thank the staff for their work on potential tools for providing additional policy accommodation.	23.0	111.0
201603	2337	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I found that analysis very helpful.	23.0	111.0
201603	2338	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it’s useful not only in case of another downturn, but also in case we are really entering an environment of low interest rates.	23.0	111.0
201603	2339	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	I would note that I found the options presented not that powerful, with a lot of risks and costs potentially associated with them.	23.0	111.0
201603	2340	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	So I would encourage us to continue to consider a wide range of options in case we need them in the future.	23.0	111.0
201603	2341	2016-03-16	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201603	2342	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2343	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201603	2344	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201603	2345	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201603	2346	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	My reading of the statement language is that it neither pre-commits us to a move at the April or June meeting nor rules it out.	23.0	96.0
201603	2347	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the statement is appropriately balanced.	23.0	96.0
201603	2348	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, it reaffirms our evaluation of the economic outlook in paragraph 1—that we’re still on course— while, on the other, acknowledges the fact that global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.	23.0	96.0
201603	2349	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I suppose that the acknowledgment that there are such risks might be considered new information relative to the January statement.	23.0	96.0
201603	2350	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I think this was strongly implied by the January statement’s language that we were assessing the implications for the balance of the risks.	23.0	96.0
201603	2351	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think market participants will interpret the language as indicating a greater level of concern than we had in January.	23.0	96.0
201603	2352	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, the risk-management considerations strongly support a decision not to tighten at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201603	2353	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	There are downside risks, to both growth and inflation, posed by global economic and financial market developments.	23.0	96.0
201603	2354	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Not to take these into consideration when the economy is growing only slightly above its trend rate and inflation remains below our objectives would be inappropriate, in my view.	23.0	96.0
201603	2355	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, it would not surprise me if those risks subsided in coming months.	23.0	96.0
201603	2356	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In particular, China seems to be doing a better job in communicating its currency regime and has been supporting economic activity through fiscal and monetary policy.	23.0	96.0
201603	2357	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	And commodity prices may finally be starting to stabilize and, in some cases, recover.	23.0	96.0
201603	2358	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Oil prices are off the bottom, and other commodities, such as iron ore, have shown strong price recoveries recently.	23.0	96.0
201603	2359	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Brexit probably won’t happen, so that uncertainty will likely be resolved in a favorable way with respect to the global economic outlook.	23.0	96.0
201603	2360	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	If the foreign situation improves and the US recovery remains on track, then I think that would set us up well for a tightening at a future meeting, presumably the June meeting.	23.0	96.0
201603	2361	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted yesterday, I would be reluctant to move as quickly as April, barring some unusual surprise in the US data that alters the outlook in a material way.	23.0	96.0
201603	2362	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to think that April is on the table, but the reality is, to move at a non–press conference meeting would signal a sense of urgency to that tightening that I think would be difficult to justify, in view of the relatively sluggish pace of economic growth and the low level of inflation.	23.0	96.0
201603	2363	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	But, of course, we’ll have to wait for the data.	23.0	96.0
201603	2364	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I have a few thoughts on the issue of negative interest rates in the United States.	23.0	96.0
201603	2365	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m getting a lot of questions about this whenever I speak, and I know a lot of other people are, too.	23.0	96.0
201603	2366	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that we should try to tamp down those expectations when we get those questions.	23.0	96.0
201603	2367	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Speculation and time spent on this question, I think, just reinforces pessimism about the outlook.	23.0	96.0
201603	2368	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the risk of US recession may lead to concerns about bank profitability and may lead to concerns that we’re running out of ammunition.	23.0	96.0
201603	2369	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t really see what’s gained by feeding this speculation.	23.0	96.0
201603	2370	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	How would I tamp down such speculation?	23.0	96.0
201603	2371	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I would emphasize several things.	23.0	96.0
201603	2372	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the US economy is doing reasonably well.	23.0	96.0
201603	2373	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We are making progress with respect to our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	96.0
201603	2374	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, why are you asking me this question?	23.0	96.0
201603	2375	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Most of the significant risks lie abroad, not here in the United States—and this is really important—in contrast to the financial crisis.	23.0	96.0
201603	2376	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So discussion about negative rates for the United States, at least, is at best extraordinarily premature.	23.0	96.0
201603	2377	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, if the economy were to weaken, we have plenty of tools to respond.	23.0	96.0
201603	2378	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not close to being out of ammunition.	23.0	96.0
201603	2379	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	We could cut our target for the federal funds rate, lengthen the duration of our portfolio, do more QE, and use forward guidance, all of which are options that I think most of us see as dominating negative interest rates.	23.0	96.0
201603	2380	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, given the structure of US money markets and the recent experience of Europe and Japan, it’s not obvious that we would ever turn to negative rates, even in extremis, because the costs might simply outweigh the benefits.	23.0	96.0
201603	2381	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I would remind people that when we looked at this a few years ago, when we were much further away from our objectives, we declined to push the federal funds rate into negative territory, and I think people should draw some inference from that.	23.0	96.0
201603	2382	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201603	2383	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201603	2384	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201603	2385	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we’ve had a good round of discussion on the policy issues we face.	23.0	65.0
201603	2386	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard your comments around the table about the importance of my own communications and will try to take it to heart.	23.0	65.0
201603	2387	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, let me assure you that I do intend to be positive on the US economy, to emphasize the resilience of the economy in the face of shocks, and to convey a sense of confidence that I think the outlook is favorable.	23.0	65.0
201603	2388	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	I will also try to keep all future meetings on the table but recognize that market expectations are not aligned with an April move.	23.0	65.0
201603	2389	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And, in the coming weeks, if it looks like that’s something that’s appropriate, there would remain a challenge there that perhaps I’d have to address.	23.0	65.0
201603	2390	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, with those comments, I have heard considerable support for alternative B, as worded.	24.0	65.0
201603	2391	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Brian, let me ask you to put forward what we should vote on.	24.0	65.0
201603	2392	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201603	2393	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, and it will also be on the directive to the Desk that is included on page 10 of those materials.	24.0	999.0
201603	2394	2016-03-16	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George No President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes .	24.0	999.0
201603	2395	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	Madam Chair, may I say one final thing?	24.0	96.0
201603	2396	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	24.0	65.0
201603	2397	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we owe a lot of thanks to the Chair and the staff for working on the statement.	24.0	96.0
201603	2398	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	This is the first time I can remember that the statement went through a lot of iterations, and we actually ended up with a statement for which, as far as I can tell, not one person suggested a change in language.	24.0	96.0
201603	2399	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	So kudos to the staff and the Chair, who worked a lot on this.	24.0	96.0
201603	2400	2016-03-16	meeting	DUDLEY	That was not an easy needle to thread, so, well done.	24.0	96.0
201603	2401	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	53.0	65.0
201603	2402	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	So, just a couple of final comments.	53.0	65.0
201603	2403	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	The date of our next meeting is April 26 and 27.	53.0	65.0
201603	2404	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	You might want to come to that meeting dressed to the nines, because our photographer will be taking pictures of us for future use.	53.0	65.0
201603	2405	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see—I think boxed lunches are now available, if you’d like them.	53.0	65.0
201603	2406	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	And there will be a setup in the Special Library for those of you who are staying around and have late planes to catch, if you want to watch me be grilled by the press at 2:30.	53.0	65.0
201603	2407	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, I will do my best.	53.0	65.0
201603	2408	2016-03-16	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all.	53.0	65.0
