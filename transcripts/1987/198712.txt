198712	0	GREENSPAN	 I think we are all present, with the exception of Frank Morris who, hopefully, is on his way from the airport and Si Keehn, who never was able to make it. I trust you're on the other end of the wire, Si. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	1	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I'm here with Karl Scheld and I hope you can hear us. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	2	GREENSPAN	 We can hear you quite well. I'd like to alter the order of the agenda and ask our Managers to report tomorrow morning rather than today and use this afternoon for the more generic discussions. I hope and I trust that Messrs. Kohn, Sternlight, and Lindsey are prepared. Is that okay? Without objection, I will request a motion to approve the minutes of the November 3rd meeting. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	3	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	4	SPEAKER	 Second. 	5	5	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	5	GREENSPAN	 No objection. The first topic of discussion, item number 4 on the agenda, is a discussion of borrowings and the federal funds rate as guides to open market operations. Mr. Kohn. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	6	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The purpose of the memo from Mr. Sternlight and myself was to alert  the FOMC to the pros and cons of the recent shift in the strategy for  implementing open market operations that is, greater emphasis on reacting to  the federal funds rate and less on hitting borrowing objectives. It also was  meant to raise the question of whether, under what circumstances, and by how  much the Committee would like the Desk to shift back toward the previous  strategy.  The extent of the change in strategy shouldn't be exaggerated; the  level of federal funds rate relative to expectations always played an  important role in conditioning open market operations before October 19, and  since then the Manager has continued to take some account of reserve  pressures as indicated by the level of borrowing when planning his  operations. The market has perceived some shift in emphasis, noting both  stronger reactions from the Desk when funds are trading away from an assumed  center of gravity and a flexible attitude towards borrowing.  The advantage of paying closer attention to the federal funds  rate is that you will be more likely to get the rate you expect; the  disadvantage is that this could be the wrong rate, and concerns about market  reactions and other factor may make it difficult to adjust the rate  sufficiently when appropriate. This is also a problem with borrowing  objectives, but the use of this technique did allow some limited scope for  the market to ease or tighten on its own frequently in a stabilizing  direction. This occurred in part because estimates of required reserves  tended to lag reality, but mostly because incoming information on the  economy, prices, and financial markets led to expectations of a change in  system policy.The more the Committee emphasizes a federal funds rate  objective, the less opportunity there is for this to occur. As the market  comes to recognize the desired federal funds rate, the rate will move to that  level and generally stay fairly close to it.  The problem is that this rate may not be consistent with achieving  the Committee's goals for activity and inflation. Even if it were the  appropriate rate initially, it probably soon would not be, after  inevitable shifts in the underlying forces working in the economy. The  danger would seem especially great right now in light of an unusual  uncertainties concerning the strength of demand domestically, the trade  outlook and the dollar. To be sure, discretionary changes in the desired  rate, as in borrowing targets, could be made, but there would be a certain  amount of inertia to overcome. In these circumstances, if the Committee  decides to continue emphasizing the federal funds rate in open market  operations, it may need to give special consideration to the conditions under  which it would expect that rate to be changed over an intermeeting period.  The likelihood of distortions to reserve management and financial  markets through the year end, especially in light of some residual fragility  in financial markets, will make it difficult and potentially disruptive to  shift back toward a borrowing objective over the next few weeks. But the  Committee may want to instruct the Desk to review the situation carefully in  the new year, with an eye toward finding opportunities to place more emphasis  on reserve objectives and to allow more scope for the funds rate to  fluctuate. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	7	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Sternlight, would you like to add anything to that? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	8	STERNLIGHT	" I have very little to add to either what was in the memorandum or what Don has just outlined. Maybe the one point is that, as Don just mentioned in his comments, the market is fairly well aware of this current emphasis on the funds rate in the implementation of policy, with greater weight placed on day-to-day funds rates. From comments that I hear, the market seems to be fairly understanding of it. Some of the people I regard as more thoughtful observers in the market would be troubled, I think, if they thought there was a long-term reversion to something that could be called ""pegging of the funds rate."" That's exaggerated, but I think that's what it would tend to become to be known as. That carries with it the baggage of a past association with periods of what many regarded as inadequate policy responses in times of excessive money growth. I don't think that argues that one has to go back immediately to what was being done--particularly since in the very near term, we will have all the uncertainties associated with the year-end period--but it is something to keep in mind as we look a little further at it. "	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	9	GREENSPAN	 Are there any questions for either Mr. Kohn or Mr. Sternlight?  	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	10	HOSKINS	 In your opinion, if we were to make a change, is the tenor in the market a lot different now than it was, say, right after October 19th? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	11	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I think the market has calmed down considerably from the extremely turbulent and nervous state of late October. I would hesitate to say it's totally back to normal. I think there is still some background nervousness and we are getting into a period when there's a lot of uncertainty anyway, just because of the possibility of pressures associated with the year-end. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	12	PARRY	 Well, that has been true in certain markets but in terms of demand for borrowing, things are still very different from the pre-October 19th period. In fact, it looks as though that difference now may be as great as it ever has been. Isn't that correct? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	13	JOHNSON	 Yes, I agree with Bob on that. Borrowings actually have declined under the same spread, or even a wider spread for a while. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	14	STERNLIGHT	 Borrowing has been very light, and we have scratched our heads about what the reasons for that might be. We do hear some comments to the effect that some banks are saving their recourse to the discount window, perhaps anticipating pressures around year-end. There may be some who just want to take extra pains to avoid the window because they are concerned that their own credit ratings could be coming under some review, and they just don't want to subject themselves to any additional attention that might come from using the window. Seasonal borrowing is just about at its low point. I know it doesn't stand up all that well in the correlations, but I still think that some-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	15	JOHNSON	 Just a technical question: Based on the research, which has a larger variance in normal times--borrowed reserves or the funds rate? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	16	KOHN	 Do you mean under which circumstance would the funds rate vary more? 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	17	JOHNSON	 Well, assuming that we're targeting borrowed reserves, is there more noise around borrowed reserves or the funds rate? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	18	KOHN	 It's hard to compare them; one is dollars and one is basis points. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	19	JOHNSON	 I know that, but I mean in terms of the percentage variation or standard error. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	20	STERNLIGHT	 You can get a good deal of variation even when you're following a borrowings target more closely, just because one incident can bring banks in for some special reason and you have to make allowance for that. Even on a borrowings target, I have often had to report to the Committee that borrowing was considerably higher for this or that particular reason. But--  	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	21	GREENSPAN	 I'm not even sure that you could get an answer without adjusting for the fact that there is not a unitary elasticity between the change in the funds rate on the one hand and the change in borrowings on the other. I think it is mainly the case that a percentage change in borrowings would be a lot larger unless you normalize it to the-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	22	JOHNSON	 I'm trying to think of some way to normalize it and I can't; I'm thinking apples and oranges but I'm just simply-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	23	GREENSPAN	 I think the answer is self-evident, if you think about it. It is feasible to peg the funds rate, but there is no possibility of pegging borrowing. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	24	JOHNSON	 If we are trying to hit a borrowings target, I'm just asking whether we get as much variation around that target as we get around the funds rate that results out of that borrowings target. I don't know whether there is any information there, but I still think it might be interesting to know. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	25	KOHN	 Okay. The standard deviation of borrowings around the path assumption from early 1984 through mid-1987 has been about $170 million; excluding the year-end periods, it has been about $160 million. The root mean square error of the funds rate around what the Desk thought it ought to be was about 20 basis points over that same period. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	26	GREENSPAN	 Unless you have [unintelligible] to answer that question. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	27	JOHNSON	 I don't know how you compare the two, but it sounds like similar magnitudes of variations. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	28	ANGELL	 [You could] use coefficients of variation, but it would seem to be smaller for the funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	29	JOHNSON	 The funds rate? I guess what I'm saying is that if you could hit your borrowings exactly, it's really a loose way of targeting the funds rate. There's only a certain band in which the funds rate is going to vary under a borrowings target. And I guess the question is: Can you pursue the same goals by a lot of adjustments in the funds rate versus a few adjustments in the borrowings target? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	30	BOEHNE	 You can, although pegging--or whatever word one uses--the funds rate is much more addictive than the borrowing because there is much less-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	31	JOHNSON	 Well, the political risks are fairly-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	32	BOEHNE	 But even in the decision-making process of the Committee, there is much less emotional attachment to a given borrowing level than there is to the funds rate, so it gives you a little more flexibility in the process. You're right, theoretically, that you can do it either way. But the way the decisions are made and carried out and perceived, you end up with more flexibility to change policy through this borrowing procedure than through the funds rate-- not in theory but in practice.  	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	33	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	34	ANGELL	 Don, there was one thing that surprised me. It seemed to me that after the first few weeks following October 19th banks would have had some excess reserves which they could carry over to the next period. But with $150 million to $250 million, I would presume that quite a few banks were running very heavy excess reserves and that the carry-over period for those excess reserves is lapsing, so that it's a financial cost. Is that true? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	35	KOHN	 I think that was true in only one reserve period-- right after the reserve period in late October and early November-- when there were more excess reserves than could be carried into the new period. Since then, we have not observed that. Excess reserves have varied over a wide range, but on average--mostly because of the carry-ins and carry-outs--they have not really differed substantially from what we might have expected over time. But we can't see a real effect on excess reserves, and I don't think we see banks losing. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	36	ANGELL	 So behavior will not necessarily be modified from these very low levels of adjustment plus seasonal borrowings then. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	37	KOHN	 Of course, we have tried to estimate the excess reserves that banks want to hold and have built that into the path or made allowance for it in putting out nonborrowed reserves. So, in some sense, we are trying to compensate for this phenomenon that you are trying to identify. But the excess reserve behavior has not been unusual even though the borrowing behavior has. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	38	ANGELL	 Okay. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	39	HELLER	 Well, I found it a very interesting paper and helpful to have the options in front of us, some of which we haven't discussed for the last year, at least. The current period clearly is a very important period as we are coming off pegging the funds rate. It is the same sort of thing as taking off wage-price controls. You have to ask: Where do we go from here? I was wondering why you didn't give consideration to a broader array of options such as targeting total reserves, or targeting nonborrowed reserves, or other techniques that have been used in the past. Maybe you did and you rejected them. In particular, I'm wondering about this because during the last three quarters of the year--I think at virtually every FOMC meeting--we have had projections for increased reserve growth and we have had projections for increased Ml growth and in virtually all of those cases the projections haven't come true. So, maybe there is something in our operating technique that doesn't get us where we want to go. I was wondering whether the other techniques might be more suitable to get us to the targets that we actually want to reach. Obviously, a lot of people here have been through the periods when targeting total reserves or nonborrowed reserves was the technique and, being new to the game, I was wondering why you rejected them. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	40	KOHN	 A decision to go to nonborrowed or total reserve targeting presupposes the decision to target the aggregates very closely and to accept very wide swings in interest rates, as we had from 1979 to 1982, as a result of allowing overshoots or undershoots in required reserves to be absorbed in the borrowing to keep on a nonborrowed reserve objective. We didn't have a sense that that's  what the Committee wanted to do; that was our presumption in writing the paper. Perhaps that can be discussed in item number 6 on the agenda. In discussing that item, if the Committee decided it wanted to target monetary aggregates very closely, we could come up with that kind of alternative. But an alternative of nonborrowed or total reserve targeting presupposes that you really want to hit the aggregates and you're willing to accept very wide swings in interest rates. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	41	JOHNSON	 It assumes you know a lot about money demand. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	42	KOHN	 Yes. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	43	HELLER	" Not necessarily. You can also argue that your general path for nonborrowed reserves might be 5 percent, say, but you would be willing to tolerate quite a bit of variation to mitigate interest rates swings that would be implied in following it week by week right down to the ""T."" One probably can make compromises along that line, too, but it brings in the broader issue of the Humphrey- Hawkins testimony and setting targets. Why do we go through the motions if it isn't something that we take seriously? "	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	44	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	45	CORRIGAN	 On the question that Governor Johnson raised before, it does follow that if you use borrowings as the operational target, you will see more variability in the funds rate than you would see, obviously, if you target the funds rate. But from my perspective, that's a desirable result for two reasons. One reason is that the short-run variability in the funds rate often has very valuable informational content. It may be telling you something that you don't know or can't find out if you literally have the funds rate pegged. The second reason I think it's desirable is something of an extension of Ed Boehne's point: not only does pegging the federal funds rate tend to result in people being more inhibited about moving it than they perhaps otherwise would be, but neither borrowings nor the funds rate is what we are ultimately concerned with. What we are ultimately concerned with is the economy. The experience of the 1970s--a period that was much more tranquil in many respects than the 1980s--leaves me at least with a very bitter taste in my mouth, because the implication of an approach to policy that seeks to peg interest rates is that, in fact, we can do that with great precision. But we end up with an economic result that is far, far removed from what we are after. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	46	JOHNSON	 No, my view would be that you'd only want to do that if you had the flexibility to adjust it very often in a way that met your larger goals. I think the problem before was that the interest rate got so politicized that the Federal Reserve didn't really feel it had a political-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	47	CORRIGAN	 Well, I think it's more than being politicized. First of all, as I said, I think there is an inhibition to changing the federal funds rate, quite apart from the political side of it, but there shouldn't be. And Peter touched on this: once the market knows that that's what you are doing that's what the federal funds rate is going to be. It simply loses--  	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	48	JOHNSON	 But I think that's true of the funds rate under the borrowing target. Once the market knows the borrowing target, the funds rate is going to move in a narrow range. It's only when you miss that borrowing target that you get a lot of variation in the funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	49	CORRIGAN	 Well-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	50	JOHNSON	 If you set a borrowing target, your ability to hit it depends on how good your estimates of other reserves are; if your other reserve estimates are off, then you're going to get a lot of variation in the funds rate, which is going to affect your borrowing and throw your borrowing off. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	51	ANGELL	 But that reserve estimate being off can have information in it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	52	CORRIGAN	 It can be off for a lot of reasons. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	53	JOHNSON	 Well, that's right, it can be off. One of the vulnerabilities to targeting borrowed reserves is that you have to estimate so many things in order to decide what your open market operation should be for the day. So you use the funds rate as information that your reserve estimates may be a little off. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	54	HELLER	 But, the other way around would work, too. I'm not arguing for it, but if you fix the fed funds rate and then you see the borrowing fluctuating, that also gives you information. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	55	JOHNSON	 Yes, you can do it either way. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	56	CORRIGAN	 I don't think so. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	57	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, Vice Chairman Corrigan expressed it just exactly the way I would. If there is, as I sense, a desire to return to a borrowing target, then it seems to me that the question is: How do we best get away from this situation in which the market is in danger of interpreting our actions as pegging the fed funds rate? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	58	GREENSPAN	" It's not ""in danger of"". They are making that judgment. Now the real danger is-- "	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	59	ANGELL	 Of course they are. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	60	GREENSPAN	 --how do you get off of it without creating-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	61	ANGELL	 Having them think that means that getting off of it is somewhat problematic because, in the period following this meeting, if we begin to read things differently they may assume that we have made a policy change when we don't think we have made a policy change. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	62	GREENSPAN	 That's always the case. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	63	JOHNSON	 Well, to even consider getting back to targeting borrowing, which I think is just as good an approach as targeting the funds rate, you have to have a predictable relationship  between borrowings and the funds rate. You don't have that now. You can't take any given spread right now and predict the level of borrowing that is going to result. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	64	ANGELL	 It seems to me it has been very predictable; borrowings have been very close to a $200 - $250 million range and in these weeks we have had a federal funds rate very close to 6-3/4 percent. So, it seems to me, it is somewhat predictable. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	65	JOHNSON	 Well, let's ask the experts. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	66	GREENSPAN	 Not from the context of the past. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	67	JOHNSON	 Not from what I've seen. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	68	STERNLIGHT	 These last few weeks borrowing has diverged from what we would have predicted based on experience, looking back a few quarters. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	69	PARRY	 Borrowing would have been $400 million. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	70	GREENSPAN	 Tom Melzer. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	71	MELZER	 Don or Peter, the question I want to ask is this: Other than the experience in the marketplace, do we have any evidence of a shift in the borrowings function? I think we have to look at that. The reason I'm asking is that in the most recent reserve period we missed by roughly $80 million, I believe. Isn't $220 million where borrowings came in? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	72	KOHN	 Right, relative to the $300 million [in the path]. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	73	MELZER	 Okay. If we had forced the target at $300 million, that would have meant only $1 billion to $1-1/2 billion in borrowings on the last Wednesday; I don't know that that would have produced disastrous results, being the end of a two-week statement period. Even if we had forced that level of borrowings on a Wednesday and had had that measure of volatility, generally over that period the equilibrium funds rate might still have been perceived to be 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. My question about evidence stems from this: I asked our discount officer whether he had seen anything unexpected in our District, and he hadn't in terms of unwillingness to borrow. But the issue came up, I guess, at a recent meeting of the discount officers that you might have attended. They have seen a shift in the borrowings function, but it's not really associated with October 19th in particular; it has been going on for a much longer period of time. So, we are talking about an operating procedure here that was based on the response to October 19th, and I don't think the shift we are looking at was necessarily associated with that. I should give Don a chance to respond, but I have one final comment. If we were to go back [to a borrowing target], I think year-end would be an ideal time to go back because there will be seasonal pressures, as there often are at the end of a quarter. In fact, if we didn't, and we stabilized the funds rate through the year-end, we might encounter some serious technical problems in getting those reserves back out. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	74	KOHN	 Let me address this question of the shift in the borrowing function. As I heard the reports from that discount  officers' meeting, they were discussing a kind of trend since passage of the Monetary Control Act in the way they have been administering the window over a period of time, rather than anything that had happened very recently. When our staff came back from that meeting we ran some equations trying to detect that trend and it was difficult to find. We also responded to their concerns and what we heard by trying to reinforce in their minds that there has been no change in Regulation A and that any tightening up on the supply side was inappropriate. This is a theme that we play constantly from this end. I think the most recent shift has been very large, as Governor Johnson said, relative to the $400 million to $450 million we might have expected. That really seems to have occurred very recently. I don't know if I can pinpoint October 19th, but I don't think it is related to anything that the discount officers were discussing at their meeting. In terms of what we hear or see in the data, Peter has heard anecdotally from at least one large institution and they in turn thought they knew of other large institutions that were staying out of the market and saving up their chips for year-end. Secondly, in the data, we do see that the lack of borrowing is very much at the large institutions with deposits over $3 billion. At small- and medium- sized institutions, regional institutions, the borrowing may have dropped a little but not nearly so much as you might expect, given what seems to have happened with the large institutions. That led me to think that it's not just the stock market decline, but the whole atmosphere around banks--uncertainties about their credit, quality of assets, and other such things--that has been making them be very, very careful. It's not related necessarily to the stock market; that just came in on top of a situation that was already bad. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	75	BOYKIN	 That's also what we hear. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	34.0
198712	76	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	77	PARRY	 I was just thinking that it certainly would be very desirable to get back to where we were, with the emphasis on borrowing, but it seems to me that as long as we have the demand for borrowings along its current track that will be extremely difficult to do. With the relationship between the discount rate and market rates at its present level, we are so close to frictional levels, your alternative (4) probably ought to be deferred until we see something that would be more of a traditional relationship in terms of demand for borrowing. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0

198712	79	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	80	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think there are two key questions here that we need to consider. One is whether or not the funds rate gives us the right signals if we target borrowed reserves, which has been addressed by the staff. The other is whether or not it's really easier--from a political standpoint, or to follow up on Jerry Corrigan's point, because of inertia--to [make a policy] move under the borrowed reserve procedure. Generally, the federal funds rate probably does move in the right direction to give the correct signal when we are using a borrowed reserve target. But there are times when  it doesn't. For example, in 1984, around the time of the Continental Illinois Bank crisis, Chuck Partee had to reassure the markets through an article in The New York Times that we were targeting borrowed reserves and that the rise in the federal funds rate did stem from banks' unwillingness to borrow--that it really didn't have anything to do with a tightening of policy at that particular time. Also, right before the market crash on the 19th, I think there was a perception in the market that we probably would tighten at a time when we really didn't want that to happen. In general, a borrowing target probably works [to give the right signal] but it doesn't always work that way. There's a lot to Jerry's argument that there is inertia when operating under a federal funds target; the Committee, just because it doesn't know where the funds rate ought to go, is less apt to move. There is also some substance, I think, to the political argument that it gives us a certain degree of protection if we can say we really don't control the federal funds rate, we control borrowed reserves. At least at one time I think that did alleviate some of the concerns of Congress and gave us some protection. I'm not sure that's the case much anymore, except maybe in the case of some Congressmen. The market seems to look through this and be reasonably certain that we have in mind a certain level or range for the federal funds rate. Moreover, if the borrowing really doesn't change and the federal funds rate does change, they tend to think that's really what we want. So, I would be inclined to do something like alternative (3), which is to go back to borrowed reserve targeting but pay a little more attention to the federal funds rate when it is not behaving in the way we think it ought to, and deal with it on an ad hoc basis. But my real hope is that we can do what Bob Heller suggested--if we can ever get the aggregates behaving more normally--and that is, make some institutional changes and move toward a nonborrowed reserve target, which would have certain desirable automatic features that would enable us to ease or tighten without having to take discretionary actions. I would hope that at some point we can move in that direction because now what the market gets is largely demand- determined and I think there ought to be a larger element of supply- determined in there than we have now because of the misbehavior of the aggregates. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	81	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	82	SEGER	 I'd like to think of this in two stages. One is what I think is useful in normal or typical times, if there are such things. In those times, I'm perfectly willing to support an approach that emphasizes a borrowings target, even though I have learned that because we don't have nice stable relationships, we cannot predict exactly what a certain level of borrowings will produce in the way of fed funds rates. But there are times when conditions are more unusual and abnormal, and I personally believe we are still in one of those modes at the moment. And in times like these, I think that we ought to pay a lot more attention to fed funds because the markets are very, very nervous and skittish--not as much as they were October 20th through October 26th or 28th or whatever, but I don't think it's back to normal. I would hate to see us give the message inadvertently that we were tightening or engineering a major policy change because fed funds rates shot up at the end of the year when we really didn't want to give that message. I don't think that everybody out there in the real economy and in the markets is that comfortable with what's going  on. Therefore, I would just urge us in the next few weeks to be triply sensitive, even though in two months or so we may go back to what we were doing prior to October 19th, emphasizing the borrowing targets. But I personally wouldn't feel comfortable with going back to business as usual starting tomorrow. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	83	ANGELL	 If banks are saving up to have free access to the window, would they be most likely to choose the two-week period ending the 30th or would they choose that [next] four-day period? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	84	STERNLIGHT	 The particular comment that I heard related to just that four-day period beginning the 31st. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	85	ANGELL	 So, if that's the case, then you might expect a very large jump in borrowing-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	86	STERNLIGHT	 That could be. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	87	ANGELL	 That might also mean that borrowing could be at lower numbers during the period that begins the day after tomorrow. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	88	STERNLIGHT	 Yes. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	89	PARRY	 I think it's important to know that banks have been very poor at making estimates of what their demands would be at the end of the year. Typically, it has been almost a perfect, opposite indicator of what the demands were going to be. Last year there was a large demand that some people said was associated with the new tax legislation. To assume that that's going to carry on into 1987, I think requires some-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	90	ANGELL	 But, Bob, people in the marketplace are making that assumption and have been positioning themselves for over a month. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	91	PARRY	 Well, the mere fact that they are positioning themselves, for example, in the CD market to go out beyond year-end probably-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	92	ANGELL	 That's right. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	93	PARRY	 It probably indicates that you won't get the borrowing at the end of the year. That's what I'm saying. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	94	JOHNSON	 That's right. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	95	STERN	 But if you do, it should not come as any big surprise. This is certainly one of the most well advertised potential events in a long time. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	96	ANGELL	 Then, the fed funds rate would tend to drop rather dramatically in that period. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	97	JOHNSON	 I agree with that. That's why I'm saying that, with all these instabilities, we probably need to continue to focus on the funds rate for a while until we feel more satisfied that we are back to normal. I favor going back to a borrowed reserve target when we feel more confident about the relationship between the funds rate and the discount rate spread and borrowings. But I just don't see any  evidence that we are there, and it certainly seems to me that we are not going to get any closer to it between now and the end of the year. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	98	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	99	BOEHNE	 I think a useful way to look at this question of whether you want to go back is, as Martha pointed out, to look at where you want to get to. There probably is general agreement, and I share that view, that we ought to get back to a borrowing objective. It's a question of when and how. My sense is that the longer we wait, the more difficult it's going to be. It may be a long time before we get back to normal times. While there clearly are still unusual pressures, I think the longer we wait the more difficult it will be to get back. And we have more at stake here than just the technical side of how we operate. Clearly, there are technical difficulties because it's hard to measure the demand and the relationships. But beyond that, there is this credibility issue in the marketplace; and my sense is that the longer we stay with this procedure, the more the credibility issue is going to come to the fore. Also, I think it's just good to have some specific kinds of goals, internally. So, I think we ought to begin the shift back and do something along the lines of alternative (3), which still gives a fair amount of emphasis to the funds rate but sets us on a path back toward where we want to be. That is where I come out on this for now. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	100	GREENSPAN	 I think that's right. In fact, I think we're already beginning to see the problem emerge. I have been rather struck that in the last two or three days the funds rate all of a sudden has been locked. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	101	ANGELL	 That's right. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	102	GREENSPAN	 It hasn't budged at all. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	103	ANGELL	 It's the 1970s all over again. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	104	GREENSPAN	" It's an extraordinary thing to watch the screen and see high: 6-3/4 percent; low: 6-3/4 percent; last: 6-3/4 percent. I know that the markets are not functioning. I think the more interesting question is the one that Ed Boehne has raised-- namely, that the longer you wait to effect the transition back to something else, invariably, the greater the jolt. What we have to think about is not only the question of do we, as I suspect everyone does, want to get off this procedure at some point, but also we have to figure out how we do it. If we have this very large ""add factor"" in our equations between the funds rate on the one hand and borrowing requirements on the other, the implication of shifting back before things have returned to normal is that we know what the phase-down of that add factor is going to be--unless Tom Melzer is right that this is really just a long-term trend and it's never going to go back. But, right at the moment, if we were to shift and not have the cover of the year-end period, the actual transition mechanism would have to be very subtle. And the longer we wait, the greater the length of the transition. I guess I come down pretty much where Governor Johnson does. I get the impression that we are not there yet; in other words, I think abnormal yield spreads are still there and skittishness is still there. But, frankly, I think we are now getting to the point where whatever benefits we are getting out of this funds rate  procedure are rapidly falling relative to the benefits of the stability it's creating. I think it has been very effective; it has created a great deal of stability in the market. But, very shortly, it's going to start to become counterproductive. The only question is when. "	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	105	JOHNSON	 What would you try to do as a first step? Would you try to take current borrowings and the result from the current funds rate-discount rate spread and try to target that unless something really changes dramatically? Or what? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	106	KOHN	 Well, I think that's where I'd start. It depends on the Committee's decision tomorrow. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that the Committee wanted to maintain something like current reserve conditions. I don't know what the outcome of this current two-week period will be, but I'd be tempted to write down something on the order of $250 million of borrowings, or maybe a little lower-- perhaps $225 or $200 million--and then be alert to see how things were coming in. That's very low, and I would expect it to be higher after the new year. I think you're right. Governor Johnson, that there's a lot of uncertainty; but I also think that we can interpret incoming information and adjust the borrowing objective if it looks like we are wrong. Now, there's a very fine line between that and [focusing on the] federal funds rate. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	107	JOHNSON	 I guess I'd worry that what Bob Parry is saying is right--that everybody has gone to the CD market to lock up their funds and that all of a sudden, if there is no willingness whatsoever to borrow toward the year-end, we could get extreme funds rate pressures out of that scenario. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	108	PARRY	 One of the interesting things, of course, is that 30-day CD rates are about 25 basis points higher than the 90-day rates. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	109	KOHN	 Definitely. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	110	JOHNSON	 Yes, that's right. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	111	BLACK	 Unless the uncertainty is completely behind us, I think if we were to try to go in that direction, we'd have to make a public announcement that we thought enough of the uncertainty was behind us that we were going back to a borrowed reserve target. We should do that so the swings in the federal funds rate that would probably result would not be misinterpreted. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	112	PARRY	 Don't you think the market will figure that out pretty quickly? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	113	BLACK	 Yes, pretty quickly; but the first two or three days they would read all sorts of changes in policy into that, I would think. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	114	ANGELL	 Well, this market is going to get just as fragile as we cause it to be: and the longer we cause it to believe that the fed funds rate is 6-3/4 percent, the more fragile it's going to be about getting away from there. It seems to me that we [unintelligible] variance in the fed funds rate and yet have a 50  basis point limit on it if we want. If we would like to have a 50 basis point limit on it this week, and we want it to be in a range of 6-1/2 to 7 percent, then we could do that. But at least we would get the market used to some variation. Then when we get to the first of the year the transition is not going to be nearly so abrupt. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	115	MELZER	 I think you can use the cover of year-end, as I alluded to before. I think it would be a mistake to start right after the FOMC meeting; that's how you would get the misinterpretation that Bob's afraid of. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	116	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	117	BOYKIN	 I agree that the longer we wait, the more difficult it is. I agree with going to alternative (3), which I would interpret as a gradual move back, but certainly one with enough latitude to back off if we're not getting the right reaction. With respect to how to do it, I don't know that we can be this precise--and maybe this is an oversimplification--but I would say go for alternative (3) but postpone it until after year-end. I would stay where we are for the next couple of weeks, or certainly through the year-end, and then start the gradual move. At that point, there would be enough flexibility that we could back off if we're not getting the reactions in the market that we're anticipating. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	34.0
198712	118	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	119	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As to the fundamental question of whether to stay with the federal funds rate or go to a nonborrowed or a borrowed reserve target, I think I would be one of only three or four here who sat around this table when we targeted federal funds back in the 1970s. And I can tell you that our experience was not very good, as everybody knows. There was a lot of tugging and pulling to go an eighth of a point on the federal funds rate. As a matter of fact, we even got to the point of setting a zone of indifference where the federal funds could move a quarter of a point between two established points. And the fact is that the information that came from that procedure was well behind the facts and got us into trouble, in my view. I think we have to move back to a procedure of targeting nonborrowed reserves. Also, I would join Tom Melzer in his proposal to do it, first of all, as quickly as possible, and secondly, under the umbrella of uncertainty that surrounds the year-end. I would opt for alternative (3) in the sense that we shouldn't totally ignore the federal funds rate over this next three- to four-week period. But I think the focus should be on the borrowing level and-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	120	GREENSPAN	 Well, you said nonborrowed reserves. Did you mean that? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	121	GUFFEY	 No, no, I beg your pardon, I didn't. I should not have said that; I meant a borrowing target. And I'd do it under the umbrella, or the smokescreen, of the year-end uncertainty. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	122	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	123	CORRIGAN	 It seems to me that nobody in the marketplace would expect the Federal Reserve literally to seek to  target the federal funds rate on an hour-by-hour basis over this year- end period. I think that would be a terrible mistake. I felt that we did too much even last year, in terms of the situation. So I would associate myself very strongly with Tom Melzer's suggestion that, given that people expect some movement in this period, we should take advantage of it. As I've mentioned to you before, it seems to me that one way or another we are probably going to have to remind people, no matter what we do with policy, that we are coming into a period in which we could see rather extraordinary amounts of churning and volatility in the money market. I don't think we should ever get ourselves to the point where we literally are going to run policy so as to avoid that kind of working of the marketplace, which I consider healthy. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	124	GREENSPAN	 I don't sense any desire around this table for that. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	125	CORRIGAN	 Well, if you say you're going to continue literally day-in and day-out to target the federal funds rate over the next three weeks that's what you're saying. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	126	GREENSPAN	 Well, I don't know if we physically do that 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	127	CORRIGAN	 Well, my point is-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	128	STERN	 Pumping a lot of reserves in there. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	129	JOHNSON	 We don't really know. We could see the funds rate collapse at year-end just as easily as we could see it soar. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	130	ANGELL	 That's right. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	131	CORRIGAN	 It doesn't seem to me that we would want to overreact in those circumstances either. There is at least a 50/50 chance that at some point over this interval, one way or the other, a very large aberration will set in. I don't know which side it will be on, but regardless, I don't think that the operating policy of the Federal Reserve should be to try to offset it literally dollar- for-dollar. But if we say that the funds rate is going to be at 6-3/4 percent, period, that's what we are saying, in effect. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	132	ANGELL	 Today is the next to the last day of a two-week reserve maintenance period, and the fed funds rate is locked on 6-3/4 percent. If it locks on 6-3/4 percent through tomorrow, I think we would have told everyone that's where we are. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	133	SEGER	 What if it comes in at 9-1/8 percent? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	134	ANGELL	 It comes in at 9-1/8 percent. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	135	GREENSPAN	 Everyone will say it's the last day. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	136	ANGELL	 People then say, well, it's the last day. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	137	SEGER	 Yes, but having something like that in the context of having had flat reserves since April, a declining Ml in  December, and missing our M2 targets--. I think you have to look at it as the whole ball and not just-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	138	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but suppose it comes in at 2 percent; substitute 2 percent for 9 percent-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	139	SEGER	 Yes. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	140	ANGELL	 If you don't want to go to 9 percent, then put a ceiling of 7-1/2 percent on it; or put a floor if you want to. I just want to have more variance than we have been getting. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	141	GUFFEY	 That would be the zone of indifference. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	142	ANGELL	 That's alternative number (3) as a transition back to where we want to be. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	143	JOHNSON	 It seems to me that we are arguing about pretty trivial issues. If you take a borrowing target and the possible variations of the funds rate around that--I don't know, maybe Don can help me--except in very extreme circumstances, where we grossly miss reserve estimates or something, there can't be much variation of the funds rate around that borrowing target. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	144	KOHN	 20 basis points is what we-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	145	JOHNSON	 Yes. Don has quoted you the standard error: 20 basis points. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	146	GREENSPAN	 There are some possibilities in it. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	147	JOHNSON	 Yes, but I'm just saying we're talking about angels on the head of a pin here. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	148	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	149	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, as Governor Angell was talking about the federal funds rate being what the market thought we wanted it to be, I remembered a day back in the early 1960s, which was before Peter Sternlight was Manager, when the open market wire said, in effect, that the federal funds rate was hanging at around 2-7/8 percent, or whatever it was at the time, out of respect for what the market thinks the Federal Reserve System's intentions are. That has always stuck in my mind and I think there is some of that right now. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	150	ANGELL	" Well, of course. It is because people out there are saying, ""My goodness, 6-3/4 percent is the rate. I guess maybe I'll sell funds. I'm not going to sell for less than that if that's what the rate is."" "	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	151	BLACK	 And I'm not going to get more. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	152	ANGELL	 I'm not going to get more. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	153	GREENSPAN	 Si Keehn, do you have any thoughts on this issue?  	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	154	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I think I hear a consensus for moving away from what we are currently doing and in the direction of alternative (3), and I certainly would favor that; but in my mind, it's really a question of timing. I'm a little uncertain as to how the rest of the year is going to play out and what kind of pressures will be emerging. Rather than using the year-end as a blind, if you will, to accomplish a change, I'd favor going through that period, and then as soon thereafter as possible, begin to implement the change. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	155	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think that was one of the recommendations--is that right? Yes, that after the first of the year, coming off the instability of year-end, is an ideal time to phase in, if we're going to do that. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	156	KEEHN	 I'd be in favor of that--in other words, alternative (1). Or more precisely, I guess, I favor alternative (1) for now, but moving to (3) as rapidly as we can after the turn of the year. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	157	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	158	HOSKINS	 It seems to me that we are struggling with the issue of trying to tell the markets where we are. Perhaps one way to do it--and I think Jerry has already referred to it--is simply to indicate that we are returning to an operating procedure that is more normal. There are a couple of reasons for doing that. We are trying not to give a miscue with respect to two things, it seems to me: first, whether or not we have tightened or eased policy; and secondly, whether or not we have moved to a different kind of interest rate policy. Because we don't want misconceptions out there about those two issues, it seems to me we're better off providing more information rather than less. Now, Peter did that before by protesting--by coming in early--and the market caught on very quickly. I'm not sure he can do that in reverse. So, I guess to some extent I would support Jerry. I'm not sure I caught the gist of his comments correctly, but [unintelligible] . 	9	96	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	159	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions or issues that any one wants to discuss on this question? If not, why don't we move on to item 5 on the agenda, the definition of the borrowing objective and the appropriate discussion. Mr. Lindsey. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0

198712	166	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Sternlight, would you like to add anything? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	47.0

198712	168	JOHNSON	 I understand what you said, but the only question I have is: If there is a seasonal component to seasonal borrowing of any sort, why have it in there? If it has no effect whatsoever on the variation, what is the point of having it in there unless it's just more confusing or more complicated at this stage to pull it out? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	169	LINDSEY	 Don, do you-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	170	KOHN	 Well, I think there is a certain amount of inertia. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	171	SPEAKER	 Well, it's a certain amount in a series. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	172	KOHN	 Dave commented on the original reason it was in there: It was felt that seasonal borrowing behaved a lot like adjustment borrowing in that it was sensitive to interest rates. If you have more seasonal borrowing, other things equal, then you're going to have a little more pressure in the funds market. [Unintelligible] seemed to be just as good. So, given that you had something else that was also related to the funds-rate/discount-rate spread, why not include it in the target variable? Right now-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	173	JOHNSON	 To me, that implies that you have decided that there is more of that [interest-sensitive] component to it than there is seasonal. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	174	KOHN	 Yes. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	175	JOHNSON	 If there is more of a seasonal nature to seasonal borrowing, it seems to me that you'd want to leave it out just because it's seasonal. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	176	KOHN	 Yes, well-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	177	JOHNSON	 There's a large seasonal component and whether it has any effect on the-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	178	LINDSEY	 Given the results, my view would be that the [borrowing] relationships have been just as close under the current procedure as they would have been taking it out completely. It seems to me that there is a presumption on the part of those who would advocate taking it out that the [statistical] results actually suggested it would improve things to take it out. Since the results don't show that, I think the inertia you referred to--having to do with the market misunderstanding, that they've gotten used to what we're doing, and so on--would argue for just standing pat. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	179	JOHNSON	 Okay, I buy it. I think a good argument for not taking it out is that it might be confusing to Fed watchers who  have gotten used to it being done this way. But that's the only argument I can think of for not taking it out. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	180	KOHN	" Obviously, it could be done easily; but if it were out, our reserve projectors would then have an interest-sensitive factor that-they would be projecting every week. It would become part of ""nonborrowed reserves"" the same way extended credit is. Generally, those factors affecting nonborrowed reserves aren't interest sensitive; they are market factors. Now, we would be putting a little interest-sensitive element in there and we would still end up estimating that seasonal relationship in order to help the reserve projectors make the right projections. So, I'm not sure how much you'd gain. Perhaps that's why there is no improvement on reserve things. "	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	181	JOHNSON	 Another vote for funds rate targeting! 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	182	HELLER	 Well, in view of the fact that we are funds rate targeting anyhow, we can't possibly confuse the market by changing our procedure right now. So I think that argument doesn't hold at the present time. David, I read the paper a long, long time ago. You said it targeted only adjustment borrowing and there was no significant difference in the fed funds rate. Now, I know it wasn't significant, but which direction was it actually moving? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	183	LINDSEY	 Well, actually it moved a little in favor of the present procedure. If you look on Table B-3 of the memorandum, using the spread as the variable the equation tries to explain, the R square is a little higher--.75 versus .70; and the standard error of estimate is a little lower--32 basis points using adjustment plus seasonal borrowing versus, say, 35 basis points using adjustment borrowing alone. You could argue that that only comes about because we were examining a regime that had been generated under the current procedure. You could argue that if we really had switched some years ago to using only adjustment borrowing, then there might be reason to think that result might have reversed and adjustment borrowing alone might have shown up better. But that's pretty speculative and I'm not sure it would be true. I would view these as little to choose between, really. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198712	185	MORRIS	 Are there any advantages in your mind to making it more difficult for the market to understand the significance of the borrowing levels? In other words, would there be any disadvantages to publishing a special situation borrowing number? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	186	KOHN	 Only if it were known that only one or two institutions were in the discount window and, therefore, we would be telling the public what those institutions were borrowing. It is our policy not to do that. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	187	MORRIS	 But how would they know there are only one or two institutions? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	188	KOHN	 Well, they might know that a particular bank in New York had a wire problem or that a particular bank in Oklahoma or Texas had just come in to the window. The [unintelligible] banks  would know. If there were a lot of banks involved, it wouldn't be a problem; but if a special situation involved one bank or another, I could see a confidentiality problem. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198712	190	GUFFEY	 I can tell you, Frank, having had several of these special situations, that the market knows about as early as the Federal Reserve does that a bank is in for special borrowing. They do discount it, in a sense, I think. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	20.0

198712	198	BLACK	 Well, a New York press officer does announce that there is a special situation borrowing in there without giving an exact amount. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	199	ANGELL	 So-called seasonal borrowing, it seems to me, is simply adjustment borrowing without a time limit on it for those institutions that qualify. It has all the characteristics of adjustment borrowing and it's not taken unless there is an ability to utilize the funds. That is, if banks could lock up that seasonal borrowing and sell it in the fed funds market, then it would be like extended credit. So, it seems to me, it's more like adjustment borrowing, as the statistical tests suggested. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0

198712	201	SEGER	 I just have one question as I sit here listening to comments about why bankers borrow on a seasonal basis. Do we not administer the discount window in regard to requests for seasonal borrowing in the same hardnosed manner that we do for adjustment borrowing? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	202	ANGELL	 No, no. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	43.0

198712	205	MORRIS	 Well, it's hardnosed in the sense that we have certain standards that they have to meet. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	206	KOHN	 They have to demonstrate a seasonal swing in the difference between their loans and deposits over the previous two years. And, on that basis-- 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0

198712	218	KEEHN	 No. I very much agree with Governor Angell that it has all the characteristics of adjustment borrowing, and that being the case, it's appropriate to include it. But this certainly would be an inappropriate time to be making a change. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	219	JOHNSON	 One last trivial comment: I agree that this is not the time to make a change, but is it too complicated to try to separate out the adjustment versus the seasonal component of seasonal borrowing? 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0

198712	221	LINDSEY	 Actually, in a sense, we have estimated seasonal factors for the seasonal borrowing. Presumably then, one would call that the seasonal component with the rest being the adjustment component. That's what we adjusted the total for in the tests I referred to earlier. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	222	JOHNSON	 Oh, that's what you-- 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	223	LINDSEY	 That, literally, is what we did. And when we did that, it didn't make a dime's worth of difference in the results  in terms of the predictability of the funds rate. So, we actually made a stab at doing that. 	9	96	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	224	JOHNSON	 Okay. 	9	96	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	225	GREENSPAN	 Anything else on this subject? If not, let's move on to agenda item 6, with discussion of the monetary aggregates as long-range policy objectives in 1988. Mr. Kohn. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	226	KOHN	" Two of the memoranda distributed to the Committee were intended to  provide background for a discussion of some of the issues related to the  choice of target ranges for the monetary aggregates that will occur in  February. In particular, it might be useful at this time to review the  place of the aggregates in implementing monetary policy, and whether the  Committee wishes to reestablish a range for Ml or another narrow aggregate.  With respect to the latter issue, the Committee has told Congress it would  re-examine its treatment of Ml before deciding finally on 1988 targets, and  some observers elsewhere in this city have been advocating that greater  attention be paid to Ml-A.  The experience of 1987 might provide a useful reference point for  consideration of some of these issues. The marked slowing of money growth  this year occurred despite a pickup in nominal income growth, and was  accompanied by increases in various velocity measures after several years of  declines. Most of the behavior of money and velocity in 1987 can be  accounted for by the rise in market interest rates. The process by which  this came about involved to a important extent Federal Reserve decisions to  firm money market conditions. With deposit offering rates either  constrained to zero by law in the case of demand deposits or lagging the  rise in market rates in the case of liquid retail deposit categories,  monetary aggregates became less attractive assets to hold. The System  validated the weakening in money demand by reducing reserve provision to  prevent interest rates from dropping back as demands for required reserves  declined. The reduction in demand resulting from the rise in rates is  reflected in the higher turnover of money so that income was less affected,  at least contemporaneously.  Moreover, the aggregates appear to be very sensitive to changes in  rates, as can be seen from the elasticities in Table 1 of the memo  distributed with the bluebook. The Ml elasticity over four quarters is  about twice as large as was estimated in the late 1970's and early 1980's  when this aggregate was given heavy weight in policy; the M2 elasticity also  is relatively high over the intermittent term relevant to monetary targets.  Given such responsiveness, the models can ""explain"" 4 of the 5 percentage  point deceleration of M2 from 1986 to 1987 and 6 of the 9 percentage point  deceleration of Ml with interest rate effects alone.  Of course ""explaining"" and ""assessing the implications of"" can be  two very different exercises. They are particularly so in the presence of  high interest elasticities, which in effect enables movements of the  aggregates to depart markedly from movements in nominal income when interest  rates move appreciably. In this respect, an interest elastic aggregate is  just not a very good policy guide. If for example there were an unexpected  strengthening in demands for real output, only a small increase in interest  rates might be needed to prevent an accompanying acceleration of the money  stock, while a much larger one would be necessary to rein in aggregate  demand and check the associated inflationary pressures. Adhering to a money  stock target under these circumstances could result in an increase in  velocity and considerably faster income growth than had previously been  contemplated.  Beyond the problems posed by higher interest elasticities, there  is the gap between what we can explain and what has actually occurred. Some  of this is just the inevitable noise in any estimated demand relationship.  But part of it also results from the continuing process of adaptation of the  financial sector to deregulation and innovation. In a deregulated deposit  market, the relationship between money and income depends on the behavior of  depository institutions in setting rates as well as that of the public in  reacting to the menu of rates before it. We have made considerable  progress in modeling offering rate behavior over the past few years, but it  does represent an additional area of uncertainty.  Variations in the money-income relationship can also occur if the  public changes the way it manages its financial balance sheet for reasons  other than changes in market or deposit interest rates. Something of this  sort may have been at work in 1987, when households apparently decided to  finance an unusually high proportion of their spending by slowing down asset  accumulation; borrowing by households is estimated actually to have declined  from 1986. This pattern of behavior reverses a trend of several years in  which both sides of household balance sheets were being built up. The  reasons for the reversal this year are just as hazy as those for the build  up in previous years, but the changes in incentives under the new tax law may  have had some effect.  The various factors tending to interfere with the connection  between money and income work to some degree on all the aggregates. In  comparisons among the various aggregates, Ml seems clearly to come out as  the least reliable indicator or target because of its high interest  elasticity. Ml-A looks better using the model results, but the models  themselves have not done well explaining Ml-A growth in recent years. The  pattern of model errors suggests that Ml-A is more interest elastic; these  models suggest this is consistent with its velocity movements in recent years,  and would make any comparisons less favorable. The results of some recent  work on Ml-A are based on a questionable specification of the relationship  of this aggregate to the economy, and in any case do not clearly point to  superiority for Ml-A. Thus the benefits of adding Ml-A to the array of  aggregates the Committee targets probably would be marginal.  Taken together the evidence and analysis would seem to point  toward the need to continue to interpret movements in the aggregates  carefully in light of other information about financial markets and the  economy. This of course is what the FOMC has been doing for several years.  The question is whether there is now any reason to change. Some of the  instability in velocity has been associated with the process of adaptation  to deregulation, and surely much of this has been completed as banks settle  on pricing strategies and the public finishes its initial adjustment to new  instruments. But much of the variations in velocity have been related to  the swings in interest rates. These have been associated importantly with  the inflation and disinflation process since the late 1970's. Judging by  9-1/4 percent bond yields, this is not yet viewed by the market as completed. Further sizable swings in interest rates cannot be ruled out,  especially in view of sensitive inflation expectations and uncertainties  facing the global economy. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	227	GREENSPAN	 Questions of Mr. Kohn? I can't believe he was that definitive! 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	228	PARRY	 Don, I was trying to remember a discussion that we had last February. My recollection is that the econometric work that was done by your staff, and obviously some of the other staffs, would have supported setting targets which were somewhat lower than the ones we did set and would have indicated a distinction between M2 and M3 growth of perhaps a percentage point. And, of course, that's the way things have worked out. But, the complicating factor is that the economy has changed a bit since we were looking at it at that time. Nominal growth in the economy has been higher; probably, if we had had that nominal growth when we did the analytic work, we would have expected faster growth in the aggregates. But I don't remember what we were assuming about interest rates. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	229	KOHN	 I don't think we were assuming they would rise that rapidly. My memory of the February exercise was that we said that M2 would grow within its range, but in the lower part of it. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	230	PARRY	 Right. Right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	231	KOHN	 Then, in July, I think we tried to make a strong case to the Committee that at that point there was a distinct danger that even without a further increase in interest rates the aggregates could well fall short of their ranges. And if interest rates rose-- which, in fact, they have--the chances were pretty good of their falling [below the ranges]. So, perhaps the point here is that the models are not perfect, but they generally catch the drift. And they are not bad in that they can explain most of the deceleration in M2 and most of the deceleration in Ml. So, we have a reasonably good, though not perfect, fix on the demand side; but the problem is that in order to target an aggregate, you have to know where interest rates and income are going--particularly interest rates. And, if it requires much higher or lower interest rates at the beginning of the year than you think, then you anticipate that in order to get the income growth you desire, you're going to have much lower or higher monetary aggregates consistent with that income growth. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	232	PARRY	 Well, the point I wanted to make here is that the aggregates--or at least M2, in this case--are well below their current target ranges, but I don't fault our analysis. I think our analysis was leading us down the right track, but we were in some ways reluctant to make that kind of a change in the targets--at least in February and to some extent in July--because we thought that might be telegraphing to the markets greater restrictiveness than, in fact, we were trying to accomplish. Do you agree with that to some extent?  	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	233	KOHN	 Yes, to some extent. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	234	PARRY	 Good. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	235	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	236	HELLER	 First of all, in view of all this impressive evidence, I was wondering how people used to conduct monetary policy before we had all these high-speed computers. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	237	KOHN	 Targeting the federal funds rate, I think. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	238	HELLER	 Right. I'm looking at your chart 18, which in a way talks about what you can call the efficiency with which you know of the various measures. Especially for the first year or two, or the first six to eight quarters after your shock, MIA seems to be so much more superior to M2 than Ml. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	239	KOHN	 This follows page 16 in the thick memo. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	240	HELLER	 Yes. One could argue that that is a very powerful argument in favor of MIA, especially over a horizon of a year or two. I was wondering, first of all, why you don't give a lot of emphasis to that particular measure. And, second, would you address the argument that the narrow aggregates are more closely under our control and therefore particularly suited as targets, rather than as broader indicators of what is going on in the economy? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	241	KOHN	" Okay. With regard first to MIA, I guess we haven't given it more emphasis because we really didn't trust the results. This is derived from results over the 1970s into the very early 1980s and is specific to the model; that is the period over which the model is fit. Over that period, we find that the income elasticity of demand deposits, MIA--which was Ml for much of that period in any case--was very high relative to the interest elasticity. When we extend the models out to the last few years, we find fairly large misses in the demand deposit model. Furthermore, those misses seem to be correlated with interest rates--that is, we had much more growth in demand deposits in 1985 and 1986 than the model that generated this chart would have predicted. And we had much less growth in 1987 than the model that generated this chart would have said we should have. Our conclusion was that this ratio didn't represent reality in 1987--that interest elasticities were probably much higher than in the time period that went into this modeling exercise and the historic relationships it represented. That's why we didn't put more weight on it. In addition, we did look at a more complete exercise in which we ran the whole quarterly model assuming a certain path for money growth. And that helps; that puts in some of the errors in the equation that feed back into that modeling process, more so than just comparing elasticities. And that showed MIA as better than Ml or M2, but the superiority was not nearly as clear as this. So, even within the period of fit, the errors in the MIA equation are larger, and it looks like the out-of-sample errors are even larger. That's why we didn't put so much weight on it. In terms of controllability, it seems to me that we have a tradeoff here in terms of what we can control versus what is related to income. Obviously, we can control currency and reserves very  closely, but the question is whether they have a reliable relationship to income. What we are finding is that the narrow aggregates, which I agree we can control more closely, are less well related to income. They seem to be more interest elastic than the broader aggregates, which I agree are more difficult to control. But, I do think that over a targeting period of a year, we could have hit our M2 target if we had wanted to. That is, if we had come to the middle of the year, and M2 was at the bottom or below its range and the Committee had said to Mr. Sternlight, ""Operate to hit your M2 target"", he could have done it. Interest rates would have been a lot lower. The whole world would have looked different, but we could have operated to control that aggregate if that's what the Committee had wanted to do, even though it doesn't fit with reserves very closely.

198712	244	BLACK	 Don, I think you made an excellent case for not targeting MIA or Ml for the coming year. Do you entertain any hope, as I do--although it's becoming a lingering hope, I guess--that at some point depository institutions are going to alter their pricing procedures on NOW accounts and OCDs so that they will reduce the interest elasticity of Ml and make it a better target? Or is there hope that the demand for Ml will become more stable as this adjustment process to deregulation goes further? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	245	KOHN	 Yes, but I guess the honest answer is that a year ago, I had more hopes than I have now. We have had a year of additional experience with NOW account adjustments and part of what has happened is that they continue to be very sluggish. I harbored the same hope that you did a year or so ago. And, in fact, the Super NOW accounts used to adjust more rapidly; but now those accounts behave as one big lump and tend to adjust more slowly. It could get more rapid. Or if we do get into a noninflationary situation, or back into a situation in which interest rates fluctuate over a narrower range around a lower level, then you might have a situation in which these interest elasticities are less important. But if we have swings in rates of the sort we have had over the last 7 or 8 years, then I think we would have huge movements in velocity as a result. I haven't given up hope entirely, but I have to confess I'm less hopeful than I was . 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	246	BLACK	 I will confess to this group that, with considerable pain, I share that feeling. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	247	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	248	JOHNSON	 You used the wealth variable in your demand equations too, right? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	249	GREENSPAN	 In M2. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	250	KOHN	 In the M2 demand equation that was used in this paper, which is not the same one that is used in the quarterly model, we used wealth only as a short-run adjustment kind of thing--that is, a big change in wealth will cause velocity to deviate for a short period of time from its long-run equilibrium. And, in fact, the  wealth variable that fit best here was one that didn't include stock market wealth. Now, in the quarterly model equation, which hasn't done as well as the one reported here, it builds up from Ml and adds the non-Mi part of M2 and then wealth comes into play more directly as the scale variable rather than income as the scale variable. But we have found the one reported here to be much more successful over the last few years. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	251	JOHNSON	 What wealth variable did you use? What was the one without the stock market? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	252	KOHN	 I think it was household wealth excluding land and stock market [holdings]. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	253	JOHNSON	 What kind of coefficient is on that? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	254	KOHN	 It's a very low coefficient; it's not very significant and it's very transitory in its effect. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	255	JOHNSON	 I see. But, it had-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	256	GREENSPAN	 That includes M2, then? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	257	KOHN	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	258	GREENSPAN	 And if you take the stock values out that would not be an insignificant part of the wealth variable. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	259	KOHN	 You would have homes and consumer durables; I think that probably dominates the levels of the series. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	260	GREENSPAN	 But that means [unintelligible] taking the M2 out before you do the-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	261	KOHN	 I'm not aware of-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	262	SMALL	 We have to find that. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	263	KOHN	 Excuse me, the model [expert] is here. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	264	SMALL	 I believe that's right; M2 is still in that wealth variable as it exists in the model. We have tried excluding it and leaving in the stock market in some of our equations. [Unintelligible.] I would add that that wealth variable is a little problematic, as was pointed out. It's something we would prefer not to have hanging around the edges of this equation. But, it has come in significantly [in the regressions] and until we can figure out how to handle it in a better way, in a structural sense, and figure out, for example, what is really determining money demand that isn't captured in services, food, [and other expenditures], it makes a lot of sense to leave it in and sort of-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	265	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	266	STERN	 I have a couple of comments that I'd like your reaction to. As I understand what you're saying, one of the reasons  you're uncomfortable with the narrow aggregates is that this relatively high interest elasticity makes them, in some sense, not very good as automatic stabilizers. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	267	KOHN	 That's correct. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	268	STERN	 But I guess I would ask: What is the alternative? It still seems to me that these aggregates are preferable to targeting interest rates, for example, and trying to adjust interest rates if you get a positive or negative spending shock. Secondly, I agree that the body of evidence you have here doesn't demonstrate very convincing superiority of MIA or Ml relative to M2, but I think you can turn that statement around: I don't think it demonstrates the superiority of M2 versus Ml or MIA either. In fact, I view all this as somewhat of a tossup. I was a little surprised at Bob Black's negative reaction to this because I don't see any very strong reason for preferring one to the other on the basis of all we have here. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	269	KOHN	" Ml does lose most of the horse races, however they are handicapped. But so far as MIA and M2 are concerned, I have to agree with you--there isn't much to choose from there. But the issue is whether the Committee wants to view this as a question of ""Should we target interest rates or should we target the aggregates?"" I think the exercise really [addresses the issue of] what weight we want to put on any one thing, given that we're looking at a whole array of things. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	270	GREENSPAN	 Don, if [unintelligible] implicit in both Ml and MIA is the required projection of the growth rate, which is a much larger number than in M2. Can you hear me? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	271	KOHN	 Yes, of the growth rate, you said. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	272	GREENSPAN	 In other words, the trend. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	273	KOHN	 Okay. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	274	GREENSPAN	 If one is dealing with a trend value of say 1 percent, or something like that, versus 0.2 or something close to 0 with M2, one should at least intuitively argue that the potential variation in any particular period in the trend value is more likely to be mis-estimated with the narrower monetary aggregates than a broader one. At least that's what history seems to suggest. I wasn't aware in the memorandum that that element was brought into the horse race evaluation. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	275	KOHN	 It was indirectly, in the sense that the way the horse races were run, to the extent that the trend embodied in the equation was wrong, that would show up in the error. So we simply discussed-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	276	GREENSPAN	 Unfortunately, the problem is that you can't pick that up with the particular history you are dealing with. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	277	KOHN	 I don't know that it would necessarily be the case a priori that one would have more confidence in a trend of 0 than in a trend of 1 or a trend of 1-1/2. I think in this case--  	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	278	GREENSPAN	 I would. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	279	KOHN	 In this case, it's true because the nature of the narrow aggregates has been changing, with the addition of OCDs into Ml and the deletion of those deposits that used to be in demand deposits. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	280	GREENSPAN	 It has. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	281	KOHN	 So, because of the changing character of the aggregates, I think you're right. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	282	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think what is relevant here is the time frame. If I would tell you 20 years, clearly the argument would have to be that it's more likely that the M2 trend would be more projectable than the MIA or the Ml trend. Therefore, if it's true with 20 years, then the argument really gets down to what time frame you're talking about. Well, I've always been worried about that because I was convinced that at some point or other, we would project and find out it went in the other direction. Bob Parry. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	283	PARRY	 Don, when you were talking about chart 18, you made the comment that you thought the current interest elasticity on MIA was probably greater than what showed up in that statistical exercise. That's probably also true of the other aggregates as well, isn't it? My question is: What has happened to the relative elasticities of the three aggregates and do you have conclusions on that? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	284	KOHN	 I think M2 is less of a concern because a lot of the [unintelligible] we are talking about are within M2. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	285	PARRY	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	286	KOHN	 Surprisingly to me--and I think it's perhaps a touch of luck here--we haven't done all that badly projecting the OCD component of the Ml equation, considering that it has swung around by 10 to 20 percentage points in growth rates over the last few years. If I look at the errors in the equation, the largest ones are in the demand deposit portion of the equation. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	287	PARRY	 The biggest change would be in MIA? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	288	KOHN	 That would be my conclusion. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	289	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	290	MELZER	 Well, I have another idea that I want to lay on the table. Would this be an appropriate time? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	291	GREENSPAN	 It depends if it's on this subject matter or not. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	292	MELZER	 Well, it has to do with aggregate targets. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	293	GREENSPAN	 That's about it. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	294	MELZER	" I have two comments about the environment we're dealing in. First of all, there is a lot of uncertainty about exactly  how policy is being conducted in the long run. It's not unusual, but I think this is one of those times when there are those kinds of questions in the marketplace. And the kind of discussion we are having right now is very, very healthy in terms of talking about different approaches. But, on top of the uncertainty that I perceive in the marketplace and some of the difficulties with the aggregates and with interest rate targeting that we have talked about, I'd say that we are now in a period--and I think it will be exacerbated--when there is going to be a conflict between the pressures we face domestically and the pressures we face internationally in terms of how policy is conducted. And, I think there would be no better time to have some kind of an intermediate target or guide. What I wanted to put on the table was the idea that had been mentioned earlier of looking at a monetary base target of some sort. There is no question that we can control that, and I think it's a good indicator of the thrust of policy. I don't have any delusions about the ability to pick a specific growth rate of the base and say we therefore expect nominal GNP to do ""Y"". Some of the work we have done on the base and income relationships would indicate that the relationship is no worse than M2, for example. But, that's not really what I have in mind. I think it is possible to select a relatively narrow channel in terms of possible growth rates for the base that in the long run would be consistent with satisfactory economic performance and, at the same time, preserve in the short run the latitude to react to all the various types of incoming data that we react to now. In other words, this approach I'm describing would allow for discretion in the short-run conduct of policy but at the same time--assuming we were to stick with it --it would take away some of the extremes in possible policy results in either direction: that is, very simply, either too tight a monetary policy, or too easy a monetary policy. Right now, I don't think we have a lot of confidence in the other aggregates and I don't think the marketplace pays that much attention to them. If we were to substitute some kind of a base target, first of all, I think the announcement of that would carry with it a considerable positive impact just because the market would know in general what policymakers are going to be looking at in the conduct of policy. And this channel that I have talked about would tend to eliminate uncertainty and increase credibility. I think the existence of a target like that--if I'm right about the type of environment that we are in and that we're apt to be in next year in an even more important way--could be used to diffuse domestic and international pressures, to do something in the short-run conduct of policy, particularly to influence rates. And in the long run, if pursued religiously, I think it would tend to result in more stable and more balanced economic results. So, I guess what I wanted to do was put the idea on the table. We've done some work, and I think we have to do a lot more work, but if there were any support for that kind of idea, maybe with more background work done it's something that could be discussed more thoroughly at the February meeting. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	295	GREENSPAN	 Would anyone like to comment on that? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	296	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I share Tom's longing for something like that that we can anchor our decisions to; otherwise we have nothing but a series of ad hoc decisions that are disconnected to a  certain degree. I feel very uncomfortable with that because I don't think we're really smart enough to do it. If there is something we can hang our hats on, I sure would feel a lot better. That's why I'm so disappointed that Ml has lost some of that value that it once had. I would encourage experimentation along these lines. There has to be something out there that we can hang our hats on. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	297	JOHNSON	 I'd like to comment on that. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	298	GREENSPAN	 Go ahead. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	299	JOHNSON	 I think that's right. [It would be desirable] to have a sense of credibility that we could set a target and hit it consistently. But the problem is that I don't think the base velocity has done much better than the velocity of other aggregates. So, if we consistently hit a target set on the base, we certainly would have credibility in hitting the target, but would that credibility extend to economic performance? There is still the question of where to set the target, and whether or not the target is accurately set relative to what we want to achieve in terms of the desired results for the economy. And I think there is still a big problem with a base target from that point of view. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	300	MELZER	 Well, just to repeat one thing I said: obviously, you would not use it in the short run to operate policy. But I think you probably could pick a band of something like 2 percentage points or so --just looking at data for the 1980s, for example--that you could argue would give you plenty of latitude in either direction to get satisfactory economic results, to meet your long-term objectives. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	301	JOHNSON	 Well, one of the problems is that the base is so dominated by currency; it's two-thirds of the base. We have a period right now where there's a big surge in currency; and to hit a base target, even with some variation [allowed], we probably would have to drain a substantial amount of reserves. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	302	MELZER	 Well, this is an extraordinary time. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	303	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	304	MELZER	" It may be one of those times when we wouldn't stick with the target. But we would have to announce that and we could explain it very straightforwardly; it doesn't come down to explanations like, ""Well, velocity changed"", which is not all that credible after a while. "	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	305	GREENSPAN	 But you don't know what part of that currency item is drug money or what. That used to be a joke, but I suspect that it's probably getting to be something that would require some-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	306	JOHNSON	 Would you believe it? I heard something on the radio that's just incredible: that samples of currency were taken and 9 out of 10 of them had traces of cocaine on them. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	307	GREENSPAN	 Is that right?  	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	308	JOHNSON	 Yes. Did you hear that report? It's just incredible that you can find significant traces of cocaine on 90 percent of the currency. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	309	SEGER	 See, I told you Wayne, it's too dirty! 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	310	PARRY	 That was in Berkeley. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	311	GREENSPAN	 A long time ago, before Tom dropped his bombshell, Governor Seger wanted to say something. Did we distract you or-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	312	SEGER	 No, I just had a question. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	313	GREENSPAN	 Go ahead. Why don't you raise it so we get back on track? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	314	SEGER	 I just wanted to ask Don what would happen if all of a sudden Congress saw the light and allowed interest to be paid on demand deposits. Individuals can go into NOW accounts and, in effect, receive interest on checkable accounts, but corporations or businesses can't. It seems to me that part of the problem is having these two groups treated in a different way. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	315	KOHN	 I presume there would be a surge in demand deposits at that time. Interest is paid implicitly now, to the extent that firms get credits for their compensating balances in terms of services they receive. But, it is also the case that they don't get any credits for excess balances any more; and there are a lot of zero balance accounts, where the excess is put into RPs or whatever. The incentive to engage in that kind of deposit-minimizing behavior obviously would be very much reduced if interest were paid on demand deposits. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	316	MORRIS	 Also, the Treasury doesn't collect any revenue when balances buy services. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	317	PARRY	 But that would raise the interest elasticity, wouldn't it? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	318	SEGER	 Secondly, didn't you say--I read so much for this meeting I may have just dreamed it--that within the demand deposit category most of that is, in fact, business accounts? If that's the case, then I think the interpretation ought to be different, because I've never met a big business or small business that decides to buy a new dump truck or put an addition on a building because they have more money in their checking account. I just don't think they operate that way. Maybe I would as an individual, or my cousin would, but I think we have to look at how we interpret these things because of the change in the ownership of the accounts. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	319	KOHN	 I think only about 26 percent of demand deposits now are household deposits; and before the advent of NOW accounts, it was closer to 40 percent. So, the composition has changed and I think that accounts for some of the change in interest elasticity. I guess I was never a fan of that real balance effect--that you throw money at people and they automatically spend it. It seems to me that for households as well as businesses it was part of a complex process in  which the Federal Reserve changed the liquidity in the economy, and that changed interest rates, incentives for spending and saving, and exchange rates. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	320	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	321	CORRIGAN	 I'd like to speak to Mr. Melzer's suggestion. I would have great difficulty with anything even remotely resembling a monetary base operating procedure in the immediate time frame. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	322	GUFFEY	 Could you speak up a little, Jerry, please? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	323	CORRIGAN	" I'm saying, Roger, that in the immediate time frame I would have great difficulty with anything even approaching a monetary base operating target. I say that for several reasons. First of all, I have never understood the base to begin with. I have read all the great work that has been done in St. Louis and every place else. But, to me, the thing itself is kind of a pig- in-a-poke. And since I don't really know what it is, I'm not about to put too much reliance on it as a steering mechanism for monetary policy. More importantly, in the current circumstances, I'm very skeptical that the market reaction would be the one that you are suggesting. Having said that, I certainly share the frustrations associated with the current approaches to policy. But, given all that has happened in the last few years, especially with any formulation of monetarism that I'm familiar with, including a base formulation, I think the reaction of the marketplace to a policy approach like that would be, ""Oh no! This ensures a renewed and high degree of instability in interest rates."" And I suspect that people would take to the hills rather than raise the flag, because of fears of a great deal of instability and volatility in interest rates that we haven't seen in many years. Finally--I keep coming back to this--I, too, am frustrated by the lack of a nice firm handle for monetary policy. But let's not lose sight of the fact that despite all the limitations, the performance of the economy over the past several years has hardly been something we need to apologize for. I think economic performance, all things considered, has probably been as good as it reasonably could have been. Again, that does not mean that I am insensitive to the frustration that you're speaking from, Tom; I share that completely. But I'm very dubious that the base is a way out. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	324	MELZER	 Jerry, the only thing I would say is that if you look back over the experience--and I just eyeballed it, this isn't econometric analysis--at the points in time where there were inflection points in policy in one direction or another, this sort of approach I have outlined would have been consistent with what I said. That indicates to me that, at the extremes, something like this could be helpful. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	325	CORRIGAN	" But that's, in part, because you have an identification problem. One of the reasons you see that commonality in inflection points, of course, is that when you look at the base, or at least part of the base, you are looking at the same things that people were looking at anyway--reservable deposits, as they have changed over time. I could almost argue that what you  really should do is go to the opposite extreme. I don't really believe this, but to overstate it a bit, I could make a respectable argument that something like debt--to go the Frank Morris or Ben Friedman route--actually has been more useful in many respects than any of the other money or credit aggregates in recent years. I don't really believe that, but certainly I could make a point of argument out of that. In other words, if anything--forget about debt--it should be going in the direction of something broader rather than something narrower. As I said, the big worry I have is the market reaction. I really do think that if we went out and told the markets tomorrow, ""Guys, come hell or high water, we're going to make the base grow by 5 to 7 percent, or 3 to 5 percent, or 4 to 6 percent"" the marketplace would batten down the hatches. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	326	MELZER	 Jerry, how about the European central banks that have a base target? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	327	CORRIGAN	 First of all, in the notable case of Germany, it's different; it's not the same thing. Second, if you take Germany as a case in point, right now of course, they are missing the target in a very systematic way. That is part of their problem. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	328	JOHNSON	 You can argue that they hated it being a miss. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	329	HELLER	" Yes, but I think Tom wouldn't argue that you would stick to the target in the German situation right now. He would say that if circumstances make you believe that the demand for money has increased, you would be willing to go above the target. You would set a series of short-range targets so that you would accommodate that increased demand for money--an increase in demand for central bank money, in that particular case. I think that's what I heard Tom say: to handle it not in a rigid way by saying ""here's the target and you are playing along with it"", but to adjust it in the light of circumstances as you see the economy and prices evolving, and so on. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	330	CORRIGAN	 That's what we're doing right now with the monetary aggregate targets. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	331	JOHNSON	 It's the same problem: base velocity and monetary velocity itself. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	332	HELLER	 Except that he says that some of that we can control more readily than the broader numbers. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198712	333	MORRIS	 Yes, but if it's not reliably related to income, the fact that you can control it is not very relevant to policy. I've been sitting around this table for 19 years now, and I've concluded that the search for an indicator for monetary policy that will overcome this yearning is a complete waste of time. I think history shows that there is no suitable indicator for monetary policy that is going to give you reliable nominal GNP results. It's a waste of time to look; the world is too complicated; the world is just too complicated. What we really have to do is go back to the kind of thinking that was around the table when I first came to the Federal Reserve under Bill Martin, and that is leaning against the wind. And I think the-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	334	GREENSPAN	 Then the wind becomes the target.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	335	MORRIS	 Really, leaning against the known wind when nominal GNP is really the target, except we don't want to admit that in public for very good reasons. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	336	ANGELL	 I hope you wouldn't let the public know! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	337	JOHNSON	 But it's the same problem. If you don't know how velocities behave, you still can't hit nominal GNP. You have the same problem. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	338	MORRIS	 But you know what direction you want monetary policy to move. The amplitude is where the problem of judgment comes in. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	339	BLACK	 But, if this is as unreliable as you say, suppose nominal GNP is not growing fast enough and you push interest rates down and the money supply slows down. You really haven't necessarily moved in the right direction, even though-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	340	MORRIS	 Well, if interest rates are going down, you're going to have an expansionary movement in the economy regardless of what your money supply does. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	341	BLACK	 Sometimes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	342	GREENSPAN	 Roger Guffey has been trying to get a word in. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	343	GUFFEY	 I've forgotten what I was going to say. Well, given the fact that we have to set growth targets for something under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, what has come out of this paper, it seems to me at least, is that M2 is perhaps the best of what may be bad choices. MIA may be about the same, but given the fact that M2 is better understood by the public and the markets, I would continue with M2. There's one other aspect--and I'm not quite sure that this is correct, but my recollection is that Canada has in recent years set a target over a longer horizon than one year. I think perhaps it's a two-year target with a moving base and they use that merely for the purpose of determining whether they are above or below the trend line of growth that they were shooting for. That has some attractiveness to me, and I think that may be what we should be doing with M2 over a longer-term horizon. I think Canada abandoned that, simply because they determined that it was more important for them in current times to focus on exchange rates, relative to the dollar principally, rather than to hit a monetary target, however they defined it. So, it seems to me that we are talking about two different things. One is how we would manage monetary policy in the very short run through these intermediate periods; the other is what we should be focusing on, and that is a horizon, and probably for M2, over a one-year or two-year period. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	344	TRUMAN	 With respect to the Canadians, part of what you said is certainly correct: they had a longer time period. They didn't adjust [each year]; they didn't always go from fourth quarter to fourth quarter. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	345	GUFFEY	 Sure.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	346	TRUMAN	 That is correct. They abandoned the target partly for exchange rate reasons, because it was so sensitive, but there also was the conflict between the relationship of the monetary aggregates to the economy relative to what they were [unintelligible] the exchange rates. The main reason they abandoned it was because the relationship between the aggregates and nominal GNP broke down for financial deregulation reasons. And, in fact-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	347	GUFFEY	 And, in the short run-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	348	TRUMAN	 Well, for a long period of time. They abandoned it in 1982, five years ago. I don't know if they can go back, particularly to something like an M2 target, because they have this financial deregulation in mind to play with. It is true that they had a somewhat longer horizon, though I don't think you described it exactly the way-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	349	CROSS	 They were hitting the target, but nothing else was happening right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	350	GUFFEY	 Because of deregulation? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	351	CROSS	 Probably. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	352	TRUMAN	 They had different base points. And sometimes they extended the targets longer into a year, until they changed the base, and then they went back and picked up a new base. I think it would be rather difficult for us to do that, given the structure of Humphrey-Hawkins; I suppose it might be more difficult to do it for Humphrey-Hawkins. Also, the base period could be varied--like taking the base in the second quarter and projecting up to the end of 1988. That would put you partly in the Canadian-Japanese [unintelligible]. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	353	GREENSPAN	 Tom, after hearing all those positive contributions, you may want to think about it and write a memorandum or something like that for circulation. Perhaps we could discuss it at the luncheon meeting the next time or something. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	354	MELZER	 Okay. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	355	GREENSPAN	 I think Frank Morris is right in that it's a futile exercise, but I don't think-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	356	CORRIGAN	 If you could rationalize--and this is a big if--the whole structure of reserve requirements and all the rest of it, that would make a base measure at least more understandable. In other words,-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	357	GREENSPAN	 It's the currency that's bothering you? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	358	CORRIGAN	" Well, it's partly the currency, but it's also the crazy quilt pattern of the relationship between reserves and other things because of a crazy tiering of reserve requirements, and the reserves on nonpersonal deposits and certain Euro-liabilities, and all the rest. If you had a clean, plain-vanilla kind of structure of reserve requirements that would help a bit, because one problem you get into here that complicates it further--beyond the currency  problem--is the so-called multiplier between the reserve component of the base and ""money"". "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	359	GREENSPAN	 Of course--because of the huge differences in the reserve requirements on the various different elements. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	360	CORRIGAN	 That's what I mean by the crazy quilt structure of reserve requirements. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	361	MORRIS	 But it was a politically determined structure of reserve requirements. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	362	STERN	 I wouldn't want to dismiss the base too quickly, though. We have done some of these horse races in the last several months as well; and somewhat to my surprise, in terms of the stability of the relationship to income, the base tends to win, though not by wide margins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	363	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but all horses lose. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	364	STERN	 Yes, right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	365	JOHNSON	 Some are better than-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	366	GREENSPAN	 Some lose. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	367	STERN	 I think Frank is right: we are not going to find one variable. On the other hand, if we're looking at a range of variables, I think the base deserves some consideration. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198712	368	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	369	HOSKINS	 I guess this has been a nice trip back through Federal Reserve policy in the last 10 years. I think the only term I haven't heard was RPDs. Some of you may remember that one. Do you remember that? That [unintelligible] when I left the Federal Reserve System the last time. So, it was a fascinating trip, and the debate about the base certainly brings back the old fervor for everybody. But I don't think Tom's suggestion was that we ought to install the base as a target and use it right now. I think the suggestion was that we ought to take a look at it and maybe get the Board staff to take a look at it, too, since some new work has been done. We just had a paper presented at the Cleveland Bank by Ben McCallum that you might want to take a look at. From my point of view, policy has been wise for five years, but the inflation rate has not been down for five years. Not that the base is going to cure that, but if we're looking for a long-term message or consensus on inflation, then we may want to take a look at something like the base to help us get there, not as the end-all. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	370	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	371	ANGELL	 It seems to me that the important thing that has been mentioned here is that even if we don't find something to stay with forever, it is certainly true--and we all recognize it--that price levels and inflation do have some long-run relationship to the money stock, however we define it. And I guess that's why I would  depart a bit from Frank's observations. It seems to me that it makes some sense to stay with some [unintelligible]. I get a feeling that the monetary base reflects a lot of the other, but it has a little of a true believer element to it and it may not be all that helpful at this point. The question I want to direct to Don would be this: Since the Humphrey-Hawkins Act does require, in a sense, that we think there is a long-run relationship, those long-run income and price level elasticities were very impressive, I thought. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	372	KOHN	 Well, that's partly by assumption. I am completely up front about this. In the-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	373	ANGELL	 Well, there's just no doubt; I think everyone accepts the fact that in the long run the rate of growth of the money stock is related to the rate of change of the price level. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	374	KOHN	 Right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	375	ANGELL	 And that is important. The Humphrey-Hawkins Act, as Roger Guffey mentioned, does not require us to target M3, and we have not been talking about M3 here, yet we continue to target M3. If we are going to target two aggregates, would we be better off targeting MIA and M2 or would you suggest targeting MIA, M2, and M3? What is there to be said for targeting M3 over targeting MIA? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	376	KOHN	 We haven't done as much work from the demand side on M3, which is a good reason why it doesn't get the emphasis here. That's because we consider M3 to be primarily a supply-determined aggregate [unintelligible] to the growth of bank and thrift credit. But to the extent that that credit has some relationship to underlying activity, then M3 would have some-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	377	ANGELL	 Well, I'm not all that impressed by the fact that we can hit it; I'm more impressed with the fact that if we have a money stock target that we are aiming for and we miss it, we ought to be able to explain why we are missing in the direction we are missing. I suppose commodity prices might help to explain some of that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	378	GREENSPAN	 And you miss [unintelligible]. Bob Black. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	379	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I would just like to take issue with Jerry Corrigan a little about the reserve requirement system being irrational. It is rational if you think Ml is the thing that you ought to control because all the requirements are lagged except those against Ml deposits. So, if Ml were really what you wanted to control, you would figure out how much you needed in reserves for those other types of deposits, supply that, and anything else you put out would be used to support Ml and only Ml. If Ml is your target, the only thing that would be more rational, I think, would be to have 0 percent requirements against everything that wasn't in Ml; but, if Ml is of no value anymore--although I think it once was--then it is irrational. The reserve requirement system was set up that way because at that time the prevailing feeling was that Ml was really the best of the targets. And I think it was. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	380	MORRIS	 I don't think that's the reason. The reason was that, in order to get the thrifts to sign onto the Monetary Control  Act, we had to have a system that didn't generate [unintelligible] with reserve requirements on the thrifts. And, that's the reason for the structure. It had nothing to do with-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	381	BLACK	 No, I'm talking about the fact that we lag some reserve requirements and don't lag the others. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	382	CORRIGAN	 That wasn't my point, though, in the first place. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	383	BLACK	 Okay. I thought I finally understood something and now I find out I haven't understood that either! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	384	CORRIGAN	 That's only one part of my point. My point simply is that the relationship between the reserve component of the monetary base and anything else, whether it's an M, or GNP, or whatever, is itself subject to a lot of distortion because of what I call the overall crazy quilt--not necessarily irrational--pattern of the structure of reserve requirements. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	385	BLACK	 I agree with that on the monetary base.' And when I said I had sympathy with Tom, it wasn't that I was favoring a monetary base. I meant that I had sympathy for some kind of an anchor to hang policy on, and if he could demonstrate [unintelligible]- - 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	386	GREENSPAN	 [Unintelligible] of the reserve requirements are on demand deposits. And hence, we assume that the required reserves are a proxy for demand deposits and currency in use. We have some noise, but substantially what we have now is reserves on MIA plus some reserve requirements on large CDs and a variety of other reserves on other things. It's interesting, when you take a look at the monetary base, to subtract those elements out and see whether, in fact, you're getting the MIA effect that Don was getting, or whether there is something independent there. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	387	MORRIS	 The weight of currency is much higher in the monetary base and that's-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	388	GREENSPAN	 Of course, sure. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	389	MORRIS	 That's a major difference. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	390	BLACK	 Well, I don't think the use of the base as a target will necessarily imply a steady rate of growth in that. You would figure out what non-monetary liabilities were using up in the way of reserves, supply that and then supply the amount you thought was necessary to support whatever kinds of monetary aggregates you wanted. That doesn't say to me that it has to be a steady rate. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	391	MELZER	 I think that's right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198712	392	GREENSPAN	 Si Keehn, have you any thoughts on this that you'd like to express to your colleagues? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	393	BLACK	 You might not want to ask him; he may have gone to sleep!  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	394	KEEHN	 At this point, I have nothing to add to the discussion that hasn't already been said a couple of times at least. But, hearing the conversations and reading the paper, I don't find any compelling reason to shift to MIA or to add it as a target. I would not be in favor of targeting a narrow aggregate. Jerry Corrigan made the point earlier that I think is very appropriate: whatever we are doing, we are doing pretty well. I think the economic results have been good. Utilizing, say, M2 and M3 in the way that we have has been an appropriate way to do it; the results have been good, and we ought to continue with that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	395	GREENSPAN	 Anyone else have anything more to say on this subject? Si, are you going to be able to make it tomorrow? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	396	KEEHN	 Well, while this conversation has been going on, we were told that it is snowing again and both airports are again closed. But, we're a bit hopeful that we can get out. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	397	GREENSPAN	 We wish you well. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	398	CORRIGAN	 It sounds like Ml. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0

198712	400	KEEHN	 I'm counting on you, Bob! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	401	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we do this? On the presumption that Si will be able to make it, why don't we adjourn the meeting as of now and reschedule for 9:00 a.m. Eastern time tomorrow morning, if that's okay with you. I don't know whether or not that makes it more difficult for you, Si. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	402	KEEHN	 We'll work with it. It's either going to work for us both or not. And if it doesn't, if we could again participate on the phone tomorrow, I'd appreciate that. I'm not going to know for another hour or so whether or not we can make it out. I'll let Norm Bernard know. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	403	GREENSPAN	 Okay, 9:00 a.m. it is. Thank you. [Meeting recessed]  December 16, 1987 --Morning Session 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	404	GREENSPAN	 In reconvening the meeting, the first order of business is Mr. Cross on foreign currency operations. 	6	61	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	405	CROSS	 The dollar has moved down sharply since your last  meeting, falling by more than 5 percent against most major  foreign currencies. The decline has occurred in an atmosphere of  pervasive pessimism about the currency. Market participants  continue to express deep skepticism about the commitment of the  United States and others to policies needed to promote exchange rate  stability. The dollar's decline occurred despite substantial  amounts of intervention, and despite actions by the authorities  in a number of G-10 countries to reduce global imbalances.  In early November, at the start of the period, the  dollar was under heavy downward pressure. Market participants  were concerned that Congressional efforts to reduce the United States  budget deficit appeared to be deadlocked. There were many doubts  about the official commitment to exchange rate stability  following press reports that the United States Administration was more  concerned about preventing recession than about stabilizing  exchange rates. Meanwhile, remarks from officials abroad made  the market feel that the Germans for their part were unwilling to  adjust their fiscal and monetary policy to stabilize exchange  rates.  In that environment, the Desk intervened from  November 5th through the 10th, to purchase more than $1 billion,  about two-thirds of it against marks and one-third against yen,  much of it carried out in cooperation with dollar purchases by  other central banks. Although the intervention was heavy, market  participants, influenced by the press stories concerning the United States  view about the dollar, assumed that our intervention was aimed at  slowing the dollar's downward movement rather than halting its  decline.  Thus, it was not until mid-November that the pressures  on the dollar began to subside, when this continued intervention  was reinforced by official statements--specifically a statement  by President Reagan--that began to make market participants more  confident that the United States was not looking for a further  decline of the dollar. Also, the drop in the United States trade deficit  to $14.1 billion for September, announced about the same time,  suggested that progress was being made in reducing global  imbalances. Another factor was that United States budget negotiations  appeared to be making some progress, and indications were  appearing that the German authorities were in fact willing to  pursue more expansionary measures. Over several weeks, the  Bundesbank lowered its rate on repurchase agreements with banks  from 3.8 percent to 3.25 percent.  Late in November we had news of coordinated interest  rate adjustments in Germany and several other European countries,  plus the long awaited agreement on a United States fiscal deficit  reduction program. But this provided only limited, temporary  support for the dollar. Although official commentary welcomed  these actions, market participants remained skeptical. They  questioned the magnitude of the policy moves here and abroad as  well as the willingness of the United States Administration to follow  through with other needed changes in an election year when fear  of recession was emerging as a dominant concern.  In these circumstances, the dollar resumed its decline  immediately after Thanksgiving. The Desk again entered the  market for the second period of intervention during the six  weeks, purchasing a total of $272 million between November 27 and  December 4, once again in cooperation with other central banks.  But it wasn't until the Germans and other Europeans took further  interest rate action, cutting discount rates, and the market saw  those moves supported by coordinated intervention, that the  dollar got a few days respite. Then, on December 10, when the  United States trade deficit for October was announced at $17.6 billion,  dollar exchange rates moved down another step, falling by more  than 1-1/2 to 2 percent against the mark and yen within minutes.  Again the Desk and other central banks entered the market,  purchasing dollars against both marks and yen. This was the  third episode of intervention in the period, and in the three  business days since the trade figures were announced, the Desk  has bought a total of $351 million.  All in all, the Desk has purchased more than $1.6  billion in its intervention operations since the last FOMC  meeting. Of this amount, $994 million was against marks and $654  million against yen.  The Treasury and the FOMC have operated in roughly  equal overall amounts, but the currency compositions of the two  agencies' intervention have been shifted to take account of the  currency composition of their balances. Thus, the Federal  Reserve sold $784 million worth of marks and no yen.  Looking ahead, market participants see little to break  their pessimism toward the dollar. They doubt that the United States will  do much to resist further falls in the dollar. They know that  the current account deficit to be financed next year will be  large. They know that private inflows financed the bulk of our  deficits in 1985 and 1986, but fell off sharply this year, and  that official authorities have purchased most of the dollars  covering our deficit during 1987. Indeed, data we collect on  intervention show that official purchases of dollars by the Group  of Ten and other European central banks reached more than $100  billion during the first eleven months of this year. How much  official financing will come in the next year and under what  terms is not easy to predict, but there are some signs that are  not encouraging. There are reports of shifts into non-dollar  currencies: notably, Taiwan is frequently reported to be buying  marks and yen for reserve diversification. Also, the  has in the past week shifted its market intervention  approach, and has resisted upward pressure on by  purchasing large amounts of marks (rather than dollars), even at  times when the United States and Germany were selling marks to  support the dollar. These purchases of marks by were  undertaken despite the strong protests of Stoltonberg, and  apparently in contravention of EC agreements. None of this can  make anyone feel very comfortable about the financing of the United States  external deficit next year. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198712	408	CROSS	 We have far more marks than we have yen for the Federal Reserve and the Treasury combined. We have about $11.6 billion worth of marks, but only about $1.6 billion worth of yen. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	409	GUFFEY	 That means, if we were to continue [intervention purchases of dollars] for a very long period of time, we would have to use our swaps. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198712	410	CROSS	 We would have to get some more yen from someplace; $1.6 billion is not all that big. The fact is, for example, that we did $1.6 billion in all currencies in the past six weeks. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	411	SPEAKER	 Sam, if the official intervention dries up--I don't mean totally dries up, but if it shrinks--what dynamics does that set in motion? The market still has to clear. Does it clear at a lower level by sucking in more private sources or-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	412	CROSS	 I assume it tries to suck in some financing from some source. But that raises the question of on what terms and whether the dollar would have to become more attractive both through stability and through interest rates to attract any funds, official or private. We still have a pretty big deficit; we're predicting a $135 billion deficit for next year in the current account. So, if you look ex ante and ask people how much they plan to increase their exposure to dollars next year, I doubt that it would come anywhere close to that number. Ex post, undoubtedly, somehow or other our current account deficit will get financed. It's a question of how. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	413	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	414	BOEHNE	 One of the reasons we haven't had a faster turnaround in our current account deficit is that the fall in the value of the dollar has not even come close to being matched in terms of increasing import prices. It seems to me that exporters to the United States can have shrinking profit margins and try to hang on to market share, but with the kinds of shrinkages in margins that are at least implicit in this kind of drop in the dollar-import price relationship, I think a lot of these exporters to the United States have to be hurting pretty badly. I don't know how one measures that--whether there's any anecdotal evidence or any evidence whatsoever. But do we have any sense that we might be seeing more of this dollar shrinkage showing up or coming through more in higher import prices?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	415	CROSS	 Well, I'm sure everybody has his own experience on all of this. There are these factors: obviously, people who have markets don't give them up very easily; also, a country like Japan has a big import component in a lot of its exports and, therefore, the exchange rate can affect both sides of the equation. I agree with you that when a currency falls by 50 percent--and we're just about at 50 percent of the level of the mark and the yen--that can't be absorbed through lower profit margins. The people we talked to on the export side seemed to be sounding a lot better. Now, another problem is that some of the deficit is shifting, or is covered by countries such as Taiwan. Taiwan has a surplus of $25 billion all by itself, and it's a tiny economy relative to that size surplus. So some of this deficit is coming from countries that have not had anything like that kind of change in the exchange rate vis-a-vis the dollar. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	416	TRUMAN	 We have taken a look at this question recently in trying to get a better handle on domestic production costs and how they have been moving in some of these countries over the last several years. The work that we've done suggests that there probably has been more saving on domestic production costs than aggregate measures of prices in some of these countries would suggest. That, in turn, would suggest that there has been less of a [decline in] profit margins than a 50 percent decline in the dollar would lead one to think initially, though all things working together do produce the results that you'd like. President Boehne. As a consequence, we have had less price increase and less decrease in quantity on the import side, though most of the aggregate equations have price elasticities that are close to 1. So, in terms of the trade balance and what you have to finance, it washes out. You get less price and, therefore, you get less quantity adjustment. Anyhow, the mix is a little different. As far as our forecast is concerned, partly based upon these considerations and perhaps some reluctance to project these trends in the future, as well as some factors like the rise in commodity prices, which have increased more over the last eighteen months than over the previous eighteen months, we have projected a much more rapid rise in import prices in the forecast period than we've had to date. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	417	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	418	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, told me last week that their new problem loan area is in loans to which suggests that maybe some of these countries are beginning to hurt in trying to maintain their market share in the United States market. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	1.0
198712	419	GREENSPAN	 That's a very interesting piece of new information. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	420	CORRIGAN	 Of course, a lot of those manufacturing and export companies, up until recently, were making up for their income losses in exports by their activities in the financial sector. There's no question that-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	421	GREENSPAN	 That's a euphemism; speculating is all part of the picture. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	422	CORRIGAN	 There's no question about that. That works in the same direction, of course--and land.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	423	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions for Mr. Cross? Si? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	424	KEEHN	 Sam, lacking intervention, what's the comment in the market with regard to the lowest level that the market would expect against the mark and the yen? How much more [decline] can we get here? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	425	CROSS	 In what terms? Market pressures are down, and every time you pick up a newspaper, you have more economists talking about the need for x, y, z, including some who say it needs another 10 percent; while it was 12 and 15 percent they had been saying the same thing. I think the market people are pretty agnostic about this sort of thing. They look at these trade deficits, which are enormous; and they look at the government policies, which are ambiguous in this regard. They see the pressures and the consequences are pretty clear. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	426	TRUMAN	 My sense is that the forecasts, essentially, [unintelligible]. If anything, the prognostications are for an increasing rate of decline. Last year you might have seen something projected in the 3 to 5 percent range; now you frequently are seeing it built into the international component of a blue chip business. They are talking about an expected 10 percent decline through the end of 1988, or whatever point they set, whereas a year ago they were saying in the 5 percent range. Forecasters were wrong about the turning point. If anything, in that part of the market they are projecting a more rapid decline than they had been before by maybe-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	427	PARRY	 Ted, what is the futures market saying about the yen and the mark? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	428	TRUMAN	 The rate of decline against the G-10 countries is something on the order of 1 or 2 percent over the next year. If you look at just the yen market, it's on the order of three or four percent. So that's not anything like this. Essentially, that's where we have been for the last 2-1/2 years. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	429	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	430	SEGER	 I have one comment and one question. In the last ten days, I've been at two different embassies for dinners and the dinner table talk among business people involved how they thought the dollar had actually become undervalued vis-a-vis European currencies. Now, they were not talking [unintelligible], which I thought was interesting, because it wasn't a central banking group; it was a mixture of business people and embassy personnel. My second point is a question. You mentioned the Taiwan case and their gigantic trade surplus, etc. I'm mystified as to the process of getting some of those devils to adjust their currencies. What does it take? Does the Treasury have to lock them in a room? Does it take legislation or does it take negotiation of some sort? I honestly don't know the process. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	431	CROSS	 Well, the Treasury has been working on it. I think the Treasury so far has used all of the above: they've locked them in a room and they've tried everything. There has been some movement.  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	432	SEGER	 But, it has been pretty pathetic, when you compare it to-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	433	CROSS	 This will make it 20 percent in the past year. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	434	SEGER	 What has Hong Kong's movement been then? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	435	CROSS	 Zero. But, if you look at it in terms of the surplus, Taiwan stands alone as having the largest imbalance. And, in fact as everybody knows, they have a large reserve. The three largest reserves are Germany, Japan, and Taiwan; and I think Taiwan's is higher-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	436	GREENSPAN	 Not necessarily in that order. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	437	CROSS	" No, not in that order. Taiwan, I think, is ""number two. "	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	438	JOHNSON	 Isn't it true, Sam, that the dollar did not appreciate against those currencies very much? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	439	CROSS	 That is true, it did not go up as much as they claim; it didn't [unintelligible]. Again, we are generalizing, but in terms of the Taiwanese dollar it did not appreciate as much when it was going up. But the surpluses have grown really unbelievably large. Meanwhile, there are these reports out there now that their dollar holdings have gotten to be so large that the governor of their central bank has been under enormous political pressure to get rid of these depreciating dollars and get some D-marks and so forth; and he seems to be doing that. So, that's not a very encouraging sign at all. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	440	PARRY	 Isn't the decline since the beginning of the year of the Taiwanese dollar-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	441	CROSS	 Twenty-two percent is the figure I have in mind, but it's-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	442	TRUMAN	 A little less than 10 percent against the yen. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	443	SEGER	 I still think that the trade statistics suggest that something has to be done about those currencies if we really are going to improve the situation with regard to imports without building walls. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	444	CROSS	 Well, the Treasury is working on it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	445	TRUMAN	 Including the question of [unintelligible], the closest thing to getting legislation without legislation. [Unintelligible] that Taiwan in particular enjoys, [unintelligible] all the events you have cited [unintelligible] legislation. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	446	SEGER	 I can send them some alley toughs from Detroit. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	447	TRUMAN	 [Unintelligible] Mr. Volcker's speech. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	448	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	449	HOSKINS	 You used the number of $100 billion spent for six months of this year by G-10 countries. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	450	CROSS	 No, so far [this year]--11 months. That doesn't include Taiwan which is another and a lot of other countries. It includes only those that are on our concentration network, which is the G-10 plus some assorted European countries. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	451	HOSKINS	 I'm just curious: Has anybody speculated as to what we bought with that $100 billion and where we would be had we not spent it? And, secondly, you described a situation that seems to me to be indicating some strains amongst the G-10 countries regarding the notion of further intervention. Does that imply that we are going to alter fundamentally some monetary and fiscal policies? In other words, are we not going to sterilize? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	452	CROSS	 What I was saying was that it's not going to be as easy, looking forward, as it has been in the past. Everybody has substantially higher dollar balances; countries are under pressure; there are public commentaries. For example, in London in the Financial Time s. there's an article by Sam Britton asking why the British are holding all of these weak and depreciating dollars, and saying they should be moving into marks [unintelligible] in this story. There undoubtedly are going to be pressures on a lot of countries to be a lot more reluctant than they have been to add to their dollar holdings. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	453	BLACK	 Has this switching to diversified portfolios had much downward effect on the dollar? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	454	CROSS	 Well, it is one of the elements. I don't know how widespread it is. We hear reports of a few countries here and there. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	455	TRUMAN	 President Black, President Hoskins' question is that if the intervention has no effect, then the switching from dollars to DM also has no effect, other than the effect on psychology. Essentially, if it doesn't work, it doesn't work. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	456	HOSKINS	 Well, if intervention doesn't work, to me it's obvious, then, that you can draw any conclusion you want to. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	457	BLACK	 I would say switching had to have had some effect, even though I'm not much of an interventionist. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198712	458	HOSKINS	 I'm sure it has. To my mind, it certainly has an effect. It has an effect as one country sees another country shifting away. Every time we get into periods like this, certainly there is a tendency for Latin American countries--those that have any reserves--to switch a little; some of the Asian countries have a great desire to make the best of their reserve holdings and do some switching. I don't want to exaggerate what we have seen to date but there are some important [unintelligible] as the dollar has continued to weaken. It's not surprising that you see these kinds of pressures. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	459	BOEHNE	 It has a clear effect on how we finance our external deficit.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	460	CORRIGAN	 That's the crucial point. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	461	KEEHN	 That's the main piece of it because the market discipline would have been much stronger on the United States to get the adjustment process moving forward more rapidly without this foreign official financing. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	35.0
198712	462	CROSS	 If they hadn't bought $100 billion worth of dollars then I would ask the question: How would we have financed the deficit last year? There's a big hole there somewhere. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	463	GREENSPAN	 You can't finance it if it doesn't exist. Maybe it would have been small. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	464	CROSS	 If we had adjusted and eliminated the deficit, that would be a different story. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	465	GREENSPAN	 Are there any further questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	466	JOHNSON	 Nobody really knows which way this is going but currently there is some downward [movement] in oil prices. How is that likely to affect the currency markets? Last year it seemed to have put downward pressure on the dollar relative to the deutschemark and the yen, and some downward pressure on the pound sterling, too. I don't know if you have any idea about that, given these low levels, but- - 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	467	CROSS	 It seems to have different kinds of effects. There is the fact that Germany and other countries are more dependent on oil than we are, for example. There is also the fact that oil is very heavily a dollar-financed phenomenon. So there have been times when changes in the oil price seemed to affect the dollar one way and times when it affected it another way. I would assume that the reluctance that we are seeing now might be, on balance, helpful. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	468	JOHNSON	 How is it affecting the pound? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	469	CROSS	 Well, sterling has been a little softer in the past few days. One possibility is that it has been reflecting what has gone on in the oil market but there are some other things going on, too. The British seem to have had this policy of trying to maintain the pound at 3 DM and they have held that pretty firmly and have undertaken an enormous amount of intervention [unintelligible]. Some people think that maybe the message that they are going to hold it is beginning to be accepted and that part of the decline in sterling reflects that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	470	JOHNSON	 Up until that oil price change, the pound had pretty strong upward momentum and they were really fighting to hold it down. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	471	CROSS	 Quite apart from what they did recently, There was heavy upward pressure on the pound during much of that time. And, there are questions about whether the British will, and should, reduce their interest rates.  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	472	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Cross? If not, I'll entertain a motion to ratify the transactions of the Manager since the last meeting. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	473	CORRIGAN	 So moved. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	474	GREENSPAN	 Without objection, approved. Mr. Sternlight on domestic open market operations. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	475	STERNLIGHT	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The stock market plunge of mid-October, and subsequent  market unsettlement, continued to cast a shadow over market  developments, and execution of domestic open market policy during  the recent intermeeting period. To a considerable extent, the  turbulence abated, and more normal trading patterns and  relationships were restored, but an edge of nervousness remained  as participants and analysts sought to assess the damage that  might have been done and review the outlook. Regarding specific  financial consequences to market makers, some instances have come  to light of significant damage but in general one is struck by  the absence of crippling losses that ""might have been"" given the  extent of price moves and the gaps in liquid market making. As  to the outlook, some of the instant market reassessments that  looked toward an immediate increase in the prospects for business  recession in coming quarters have been modified to call for some  slowing in the economic expansion, but on most evaluations not a  recession.  Desk operations treated reserve targets with particular  flexibility over the period, drawing substantial guidance from  the Committee's desire to see day-to-day funds rates center  around the 6-3/4-6-7/8 percent area, as well as from comparisons  of reserve path levels and projections. For the first few weeks  of the period, the paths used a $400 million borrowing level, but  lower levels were readily accepted in association with desired  money market conditions. No effort was made to push borrowing up  to that level as it became clear that doing so would entail  appreciably higher funds rates. By early December, the formal  path allowance for borrowing was reduced to $300 million, but  actual borrowing ran below that level as well, while funds  continued in the desired range. Indeed, in the two full reserve  maintenance periods since the last meeting, borrowing averaged  just $223 million, and so far in the current period the average  is about $150 million. Meantime, the funds rate averaged 6.73  and 6.82 percent, respectively, in the first two reserve periods  and also around 6.82 thus far in the current period. Today it's  around 6-1/4   thanks to snowstorms and high float.  Past relationships would have led us to expect  borrowing of $400 million or more in association with recent  funds rates. The dearth of borrowing may be due in part to a  desire to conserve window use for what could be more stressful  times, or possibly more advantageous times, perhaps around year-  end. Also with credit risk under such close scrutiny there may  be a particular desire to avoid being seen at the window at all.  A further factor, perhaps, is the current low level of seasonal  borrowing; such borrowing is typically at low ebb until late  winter. To some extent, of course, our own mode of operation  could be contributing to the low borrowing; since larger banks  typically only borrow at the very erid of a reserve period, our  actions to relieve this need for a bulge at the end of the  reserve period, in order to avoid an upward push on the funds  rate, leave borrowing low for the period. The turn of the year,  or soon thereafter, could bring a return toward a more normal  borrowing-funds rate relationship, but it would be chancy to  place great confidence in this prospect. Flexible allowance was  also made for swings in excess reserves, which moved in a wide  saw-toothed pattern over the period.  Money growth, which showed signs of rapid expansion in  the immediate wake of the stock market plunge, turned quite  sluggish in November, with no growth at all in M2 and an actual  decline in Ml. This left October-November growth of M2  appreciably below the Committee's 6-7 percent indicated pace.  Growth in M3 tracked the Committee's pace more closely as banks  appeared to take more initiative in adding to non-M2 funding  sources possibly in order to avoid costly year-end problems or  to build a cushion against the possibility of bank names coming  under pressure. Early December data suggest continued softness  in at least the narrow money measures.  The Desk met large reserve needs over the period  through a combination of outright and temporary provisions. The  large needs were essentially the seasonal increases in currency  and required reserves, with currency running a little heavier  than usual and required reserves growing a bit less than usual as  money growth weakened. The System's total outright purchases  were a little over $8 billion, thus using most of the enlarged  leeway the Committee provided. Included were market purchases of  $2.6 billion in bills and $4.1 billion in coupon issues, along  with $1.4 billion of bills and notes bought directly from foreign  accounts. Incidentally, so far in 1987, the System's outright  portfolio has increased, net, by about $21 billion including  $4 billion in bills and $17 billion in Treasury coupon issues.  (Last year's net rise was about $2 0 billion, with much more in  bills than coupons.) The Desk also made use of repurchase  agreements in the latest period, arranging either System or  customer transactions on many days, although we managed to stay  out altogether after December 4. Moreover, the size of these  temporary transactions was typically more modest than in the days  just following October 19, though heavier volume was done in the  first couple of days of December when the funds rate temporarily  flared above 7 percent.  Yields on fixed income securities, after their sharp  drop in the wake of the mid-October stock market collapse, worked  slightly higher on balance over the intermeeting period   especially late last week when the market was shocked by a  sharply higher October trade deficit and weaker dollar. Early in  the intermeeting period, yields declined further, as foreign rate  cuts and early assessments of the economic impact of the stock  market collapse fanned some hopes of more overt easing steps in  monetary policy. As the period advanced, evidence that the  economy was even stronger than had been envisioned pre-  October 19, and that the stock market plunge may not have  entirely derailed the expansion, led to more sober appraisals of  interest rate prospects. The budget deficit reduction exercise,  while considered to be better than nothing, was nevertheless  considered unimpressive and uncertain in its ultimate impact, so  it was more a neutral than a plus factor. Then, late in the  period, the huge October trade deficit and the tumbling dollar  augmented market concerns about renewed inflation and produced  further upward rate pressure. Just in the last couple of days,  though, bond prices recovered again, based at least partly on  weaker oil prices.  For the period, intermediate and long-term Treasury  rates were little changed to up about 15 basis points. The 3 0-  year bond yield is now around 9.20 percent, up from 9-1/8 before  the last meeting, and a low point of about 8.80 early in the  intermeeting period. Bill rates were volatile over the period,  swinging particularly in response to the ebb and flow of quality  concerns elsewhere in the market. Net bill rates rose about 1/4  percentage point over the period. In the latest auction, 3 and 6  month issues sold at 6.00 even and 6.45 percent compared with  5.80 and 6.24 percent just before the last meeting. The Treasury  has continued to pay down modest amounts of bills in recent  weeks, while adding to coupon issues to cover the ongoing  deficit.  In other markets, longer corporate and municipal yields  rose less than those for Treasury issues. Some shorter private  market instruments showed sharper rate increases, however,  particularly where maturities bridge the year-end period.  Many market participants have painful memories of rate  pressures at year-end last year. The general expectation is that  pressures will be considerably less this year, largely because we  don't have the tax-related bulges in credit to contend with.  There is still some concern, though, and funding for the weekend  that begins December 31 is already quoted at elevated rates.  There is also concern that some pressures could begin to build  even before year-end as indeed happened last year. That, too,  is expected to be less pronounced than last year, although some  analysts have already been saying they expect to see slightly  higher funds rates in the next couple of weeks even without any  change in policy.  As for policy expectations, market participants pretty  much see a stand-off between forces that might lead to greater  accommodation chiefly a softening economy in the wake of the  stock market plunge and forces that could work toward firming,  particularly the declining dollar and related concerns about  inflation.  On a housekeeping note, I'd like to mention some likely  primary dealer list changes coming up. We plan shortly to add  three firms to the list, one United States based, one Japanese and one  British. These would be the first additions in a little over a  year. We also expect, quite shortly, applications from two major  Japanese banks to acquire existing primary dealers. If these go  through which would entail normal bank regulatory approval as  well it would mean there'd be 12 foreign-owned dealers, half of  them Japanese. During the past year, we've been following  developments in the Japanese market closely, and believe they  have been making significant progress toward opening their  financial markets to greater foreign participation, as well as  joining others in working toward harmonized bank capital  standards. We learned this morning about the naming of  additional foreign members to TSE. There is still some distance  to go, though. Moreover, the rapid increase in their ranks as  primary dealers gives us some pause and we have in mind giving  some weight to that geographic concentration factor as we look  ahead. Near term, there may also be some deletions from the  primary dealer list, at least temporarily, reflecting  consolidations and potential sales of operations. I also have a leeway recommendation, Mr. Chairman. "	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	476	GREENSPAN	 Bring that in after [the questions]. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	477	PARRY	 I have a question regarding liquidity and quality concerns. Is central bank intervention in foreign exchange markets also a factor? And if it is, doesn't that imply that we will have to see not only quality concerns go away but also greater stability in exchange markets before we can see more traditional relationships reestablished? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198712	478	STERNLIGHT	 I think that at the short end that probably is true and that a further factor is the Treasury debt management, which has been continuing to shrink the supply of bills very slightly recently. But that [unintelligible] also. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	479	GREENSPAN	 Do you think that's a big factor involved with the quality? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	480	STERNLIGHT	 The quality concerns have been the more major factor there, I would judge. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	481	BOEHNE	 Looking ahead to year-end, how do you go about dealing with a period like this operationally? We expect much more funds rate volatility; how do you proceed operationally through this period that we have coming up? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198712	482	STERNLIGHT	 Well, it could take a certain amount of feeling our way as we go along, because every one of these periods is kind of unique unto itself. But just the way the calendar works, this time is particularly unusual. We have a maintenance period that ends December 30 and another that begins December 31. How much of the normal year-end pressures might work into that December 30 period right now is a big question mark in my mind. I think we just have to get a sense of it as we go along through that period. I'm sure there will be some particular pressure that is left for that December 31 date. That Thursday begins a long weekend. Right now our reserve estimates do not show a very large reserve need coming up to that period, partly because some of the weakness of money has brought down expected required reserve levels. We probably will have to make some allowance--maybe in the December 30 period and almost certainly in the next period that begins December 31--for additional demands for excess reserves. I think we will get clues from the money market itself as to how to respond as we go along. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	483	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	484	HOSKINS	 Given your reference to divine intervention earlier, would you figure that this is an appropriate time to think about starting option (3)? Would you be comfortable with that? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	485	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I think it's appropriate to begin thinking about it, and letting it work if it didn't cause too great a swing in money rates. I would want to be a bit leery about it through the year-end period, and maybe just let a little show through-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	486	ANGELL	 What was the question? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	487	HOSKINS	 The question was that we have a fluctuation in the funds rate on the down side, and therefore, we could perhaps begin to move toward [accepting] more volatility in the funds rate right now since it moved in the right direction for us first off. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198712	488	ANGELL	 Well, that very well may be due to the fact that we're so sensitive to any increases in the fed funds rate above the 6- 3/4 percent level and we're not sensitive about it moving below that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	489	JOHNSON	 That's not true Wayne. Earlier, when the funds rate fell below the 6-3/4 percent level, we put off reserve add needs, giving a strong signal that we didn't want it lower either. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	490	ANGELL	 Well, my view was that yesterday we had a need to take reserves out of the system and we didn't because funds were trading at 6-3/4 percent. So, we said we won't take the reserves out of the system that policy would have called for; we, in effect, put a ceiling-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	491	JOHNSON	 But Wayne, what is policy? Policy was the funds rate range around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent, not a borrowings target. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	492	ANGELL	 If that was the policy, then this morning I presume we should have gone in immediately, acting to keep it at 6-3/4 percent. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	493	JOHNSON	 Well, I think [unintelligible] postponed. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	494	ANGELL	 How did the fed funds rate get to 6-1/4 percent this morning? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	495	JOHNSON	 Float? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	496	ANGELL	 Well, I know, but if we had a fed funds policy, what would you have done if it got to 6-1/4 percent? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	497	JOHNSON	 Just what I said before: When funds were on the weak side earlier, we postponed an add need, and that was a signal in the markets that we didn't desire funds trading below 6-3/4 percent. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	498	ANGELL	 My view is that we did have some notion about the amount of borrowing that would be associated with a 6-3/4 percent funds rate and the need came yesterday to drain reserves. And we didn't drain reserves, it seems to me, because we were sensitive to having the rate go above 6-3/4 percent. Is that right, Peter?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	499	STERNLIGHT	 I think that's right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	500	ANGELL	 Okay, Peter says that's right. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	501	JOHNSON	 Wait! I think you have to ask yourself what the policy is. What's the basis for adding or subtracting reserves under these conditions? The policy is to maintain the funds rate around 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent. There's not any other independent factor deciding whether we have an add need or a subtraction need. So with the funds rate trading at 6-3/4 percent, why would you? There is no add or subtracting need. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	502	GREENSPAN	 I declare this a draw. I don't care whether or not there are Johnsons or Angells on the head of a pin! Are there any other questions for the Manager? If not, I'd like to entertain a motion to ratify his previous actions. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	503	CORRIGAN	 I will move it. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	504	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Do you want to now [make a recommendation] on the leeway? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	505	STERNLIGHT	 Mr. Chairman, current reserve projections running  through the next intermeeting period suggest that we may need  additional leeway again for changes in outright holdings this  time to accommodate large declines in currency and required  reserves in late January and early February. I would suggest  that the intermeeting leeway which was temporarily raised to  $9 billion in the latest period, remain at that level for the  next period as well.  	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198712	506	GREENSPAN	 Would someone like to move that provision? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	507	CORRIGAN	 I move it. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	508	GREENSPAN	 Without objection, approved. Now we'll move on to Mr. Prell and the economic situation. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	509	PRELL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A good number of economic data have been released since we  published the Greenbook a week ago. The fact is, though, that those  data have done only a little to illuminate the pattern of developments  in the current quarter and even less to clarify the intermediate-run  tendencies that monetary policy might have to deal with. None of the  statistical information in hand at this juncture gives us much basis for  gauging, in particular, the ultimate effects of the stock market decline  on aggregate demand.  Under the circumstances, it should not be surprising that the  latest Greenbook forecast is little altered from the one we prepared for  the Committee's November meeting. Real GNP growth in 1988 was raised by  a couple of tenths of a percent admittedly not a quantitatively  significant change, but one that is consistent with our sense that the  stock market decline has not had a devastating effect on consumer or  business expectations.  At the same time, however, we clipped a couple of tenths off  our 1988 projection of wage and price inflation. While we still are  projecting a clear acceleration of wages, it looks to us like pay  increases are coming in a little lower at this point than we had  anticipated, and the prevailing mood of caution and focus on cost-  cutting and job security are likely to continue restraining wage gains  for a while longer.  As you know, the key feature of our forecast is the marked  slowing in real GNP growth by early 1988. Basically, our thesis was  that the stock market drop would begin soon to leave its mark on  consumer spending, and that wary businessmen would move very quickly to  trim orders and production so as to avoid any notable buildup of  inventories. The available information doesn't provide many hints that  this deceleration is yet in train. Indeed, the labor market data  through November suggest substantial strength in employment and wage and  salary income, and this was the major reason why we raised our projection of fourth-quarter GNP growth from 2-1/4 percent to 3 percent.  As I noted earlier, the incoming data of recent days have not  added much to our understanding of how this quarter is developing.  Rather, they have .created a puzzle. On the one hand, the strong gains  estimated for industrial production 0.4 percent in November on top of  an upward-revised 0.9 percent in October reinforce the notion that we  had considerable upward thrust coming from a manufacturing sector that  is benefiting from improved international price competitiveness and  increased business investment.  The other data received since last Wednesday, however, leave us  wondering where all that production has been going. The November  increase in retail sales was in line with our expectations, but the  sizable downward revisions in September and October would force us to  write down a considerably deeper fourth-quarter decline in real consumer  spending than the 2 percent annual rate shpwn in the Greenbook.  The merchandise trade data for October were similarly  disappointing especially the surprising decline (on a seasonally  adjusted basis) in our nonagricultural exports. Even making due  allowance for the tremendous volatility of these numbers, they suggest a  moderate downward revision to the gain in real net exports we had  forecast for this quarter.  Inventory investment in October, in contrast, evidently was  stronger than we had anticipated but the added accumulation doesn't  seem to have been great enough to fill the gap between output and  spending. Nor does the anecdotal information give one the sense that a  very large inventory buildup is in process.  We received one additional current indicator this morning.  Housing starts were up somewhat more than we had expected in November,  at 1.64 million units versus 1.52 in October. The improvement reflected  a bounceback in the multi-family category, which had dropped noticeably  in the prior month. The decline in interest rates seems to be providing  an offset to the stock market drop in the single-family sector. These  stronger starts will, however, do little to raise current quarter construction outlays.  My own guess is that we shall see some better numbers on final  spending in the remaining data for the fourth quarter. However, it also  appears quite possible that real GNP growth will fall a bit short of our  3 percent Greenbook forecast and that a greater share of the output will  end up in inventories. 'Such a mix-shift would, of course, make more  likely the first-quarter output deceleration we have forecasted.  A poll taken by the National Association of Business Economists  recently showed 7 percent of respondents saying that the economy already  is in recession and another 43 percent saying a recession will occur by  the end of 1988. While the recession-now scenario seems unduly pessimistic, any reasonable confidence interval around our forecast certainly  would encompass the possibility of a modest downturn in activity. But,  as we perceive the outlook, even with an allowance for a significant  negative stock market effect, recession does not seem the most likely  outcome. We continue to believe that the foreign trade sector will  provide substantial support to output and employment growth. United States  competitiveness has improved, and the stronger G-10 expansion in the  third quarter and the easing actions taken by European monetary  authorities also are a source of some encouragement. The impetus from  trade improvement should, in turn, help to sustain capital spending. I  might note that the Commerce Department put out its survey of 1988 plant  and equipment spending plans. It shows a 7.3 percent nominal increase  over 1987 just a shade above our projection. The survey responses came  in between early October and early December, so they probably don't  reflect any stock-market influence.  We have continued to build a moderate further decline in United States  interest rates into our forecast, and this provides additional insurance  that the economy will be able to reestablish solid upward momentum in  the latter part of 1988, after the wealth effects of the stock market  have taken their toll on consumer demand. Should consumers not respond  much to that wealth reduction, however, the outlook for 1988 would, in  our view, be considerably more robust perhaps robust enough to result  in a noticeable decline in unemployment and rise in capacity utilization. In such circumstances, a substantial increase in interest rates  might well be necessary to temper the rise in aggregate demand and avert  a serious deterioration in wage and price trends.  By depicting these two scenarios, I certainly don't want to  suggest that a wide range of other possibilities doesn't exist. However, I believe both scenarios are well within the range of plausible  outcomes, and they point up what we perceive to be a dilemma for the  Committee: namely, given the lags in the effect of policy action, an  easing or tightening step might be appropriate now, but it isn't clear  which. This, of course, isn't an unprecedented problem, but the present  situation with its unusual overlay of international considerations   seems to involve extraordinary imponderables.. Mr. Chairman, I think I'll conclude on that decisive note . 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	510	GREENSPAN	 I thought you were going to go further. Any questions or clarifications for Mr. Prell? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	511	HOSKINS	 I have a clarification on the National Association of Business Economists survey. Mike correctly reported that nearly half of them expected to see a recession in 1988. However, that's a general question asked to them about recession. But the data with respect to questions on their own firms are inconsistent with their forecasts of recession. In other words, most of them commented that the order books in their own firms were fairly strong. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198712	512	PARRY	 Mike, you talked about the decline in interest rates and I wonder if you could give us some idea, in terms of numbers., of what kind of short-term rates you expect in the first half in that Greenbook forecast. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	513	PRELL	 Basically, we have both long and short rates declining between 1/2 and 1 percentage point by the middle of the year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	514	PARRY	 That's fairly significant.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	515	PRELL	 Given the elasticity of response of some of these sectors, that's not an enormous amount; but it's certainly noticeable in terms of the increments that we have been talking about around the table. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	516	PARRY	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	517	JOHNSON	 I have a follow-up on that particular question. My understanding is that you have a funds rate change in there of about that magnitude. Is that right? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	518	PRELL	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	519	JOHNSON	 What would the forecast look like assuming no change in the funds rate? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	520	PRELL	 We used our quarterly model to try to answer that question and, essentially, if we just held the funds rate where it is, that tighter monetary policy would chip off a fraction of the GNP growth over the coming year. Most of the effect would be in the second half of the year, so that we probably would not see a very noticeable pickup in the second-quarter rate. For the year as a whole, growth would be somewhere approaching 1/2 percentage point less, according to the model. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	521	JOHNSON	 Yes. I was looking at your linkage model estimates and I guess I would have the same sort of assumptions. Those estimates are -.6 percent for the first quarter, and that's a downward revision since the last estimate, since supposedly it incorporates trade and retail sales numbers. But I notice it has a standard error of about 3 percentage points around it, which means it could be anywhere from -3-1/2 to +2-1/2 percent, I guess; but the center of gravity is on the negative side. I was just wondering what kind of discretionary factors you have added to that to bring it up to where you are. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	522	PRELL	 I wouldn't-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	523	JOHNSON	 They have revised down and you revised up and that's why-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	524	PARRY	 What is that forecast? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	525	JOHNSON	 The linkage model forecast. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	526	PRELL	 That is just an experimental tool that has been under development for a while and we don't approach our forecasting by add factors, so to speak, to that model. That model was done with a minimal amount of judgmental add factoring and tended to be very responsive to incoming data, and we've been working to moderate that. As a matter of fact, the one that you have doesn't incorporate the inventory data we received or the housing starts released today, and it has a fairly strong short-run sensitivity to the stock market. I think that is one of the factors that yielded the negative result for the first quarter. But let me just say that, given those confidence intervals, I wouldn't want to try to distinguish very much between that reading and growth in the 1 percent neighborhood in the first quarter of next year.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	527	JOHNSON	 Sure. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	528	PRELL	 I think that model has difficulty picking up such things as incentives in the automobile market and many other things. So, I wouldn't want to make much out of that difference. As I suggested, if you apply any reasonable confidence interval around our projection, you certainly can't rule out a negative quarter in the first or second quarters. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	529	JOHNSON	 All right. On the housing numbers, I notice permits are still trending down. I realize there's not much of a correlation, but do you read anything into the fact that permits continue to trend down versus starts? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	530	PRELL	 I think that the permits number was about unchanged in November from the October level. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	531	JOHNSON	 It was down 0.7. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	532	PRELL	 Given the volatility of these numbers, that's certainly an insignificant change. Basically, the number doesn't appear to be inconsistent with the starts level running somewhere between 1.5 and 1.6 million over the next couple of months. So, I think that's very much in line with our sense of not very much going on at this point in the housing market. Our forecast doesn't show much of a movement in coming months. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	533	JOHNSON	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	534	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	535	KELLEY	 Mike, as you're well aware, there's a school of thought out there that the economy has been running on the strong growth of the aggregates of a year or a year and a half ago and that the economy is about to go downhill as a result of the much flatter growth of the aggregates in the last 9 or 10 months. If that's not your expectation, then would you assess that expectation? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	48.0
198712	536	PRELL	 I suppose it is possible, if the outcome is similar to our forecast, that people who would want to read the money stock numbers as having those kinds of implications would feel that they had been vindicated; that would be a noticeable slowing from what we have seen over the first few quarters of this year. We don't approach the forecasting process with that kind of simple connection of money stock to nominal GNP and real GNP outcome. But obviously, if we had forced money stock growth to be faster this year, then we would have had, at least for a while, lower interest rates and possibly a lower dollar, and a number of other events which might have strengthened the outlook for nominal GNP in the coming months. So I don't see an inconsistency; but we're not putting a heavy weight on that monetary deceleration per se now. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	537	KELLEY	 At what point in time would you start to give more weight to it? How long can the growth in the aggregates stay very modest without beginning to be a drag? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	48.0
198712	538	PRELL	 Well, I think much depends on money demand behavior. Our forecast is not built on an assumption that we will  continue to have that kind of slow growth. We have M2 and M3 growing at rates that are well within the target ranges tentatively set for next year. So that would represent, particularly in the case of M2, a noticeable acceleration from what we've been seeing. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	539	KOHN	 I think the related point is that the aggregates just haven't been very good predictors of what's going on in the economy in the last couple of years. I have here a simulation of the Darby model using MIA, and it has the economy slowing down. It has much slower growth for 1987 than it looks like we have been getting and a picture for next year that isn't all that different, assuming some pickup in the aggregates, from the forecast in the Greenbook. But it has much more rapid inflation both this year and next year--on the order of 7-1/2 to 8 percent this year and 7-1/2 percent next year. I wouldn't put much confidence in that, because it plays off the very rapid money growth, which we never really saw feeding through in 1985 and 1986. Those aggregates in and of themselves have not been very good predictors of future developments in the economy. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	540	GREENSPAN	 When you're looking at the monetary aggregates, I think it's important to recognize that when they were working and you could see the plumbing operating--meaning you could see the effect of changing monetary aggregates reflected in real GNP and the price level--the relationship was in sync. The problem that we have now in evaluating these data is that, essentially, we have gone through a cycle and a half in which the plumbing has been disconnected. In a sense, we're getting very significant changes in these monetary variables, but we don't see any filtering through. The argument that slow money growth will inevitably lead to a recession may turn out to be true. The trouble is that there is no mechanism which can tie it together at this stage. We're caught in a situation where I suspect that the plumbing is going to get reconnected at some point and it's going to work again. The real trick is going to be figuring out when that's going to happen. The assumption that it is already happening is not verifiable in the information, at least as I see it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	541	HELLER	 It probably happened when we started our monetary targeting, because according to Goodhart's law, anything you want to control will get out of hand. But that isn't my question. According to your projection, the deficit is going to worsen by about $20 billion to $165 billion. According to the Administration, it's going to improve by about $20 billion to $123 billion. I was wondering what would happen to your forecast if the Administration were right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198712	542	PRELL	 I don't think we have a really current set of numbers from the Administration. I suspect that if the Administration is right, in essence it would be because there is a stronger [economic] performance. That's the answer itself. I think that's largely where we differ with the Administration in terms of their mid- session review prognostication for FY 1988. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	543	HELLER	 Mike, your forecasts are quite far apart on the expenditure side, too. Some of that is cyclically related, so you wouldn't see much of a weakening of the economy if the budget cutters actually succeed in [unintelligible].  	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198712	544	PRELL	 Well, we built into [our forecast] their succeeding, in essence, in what they agreed to in the compromise session. That is a moderate restraining influence on aggregate demand in the coming year, but it's not an enormous effect. It's one more ingredient that one wouldn't want to overlook. It's a magnitude of roughly half a percentage point on GNP. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	545	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	546	SEGER	 I was quite influenced by an article I read in this morning's Wall Street Journal about Marshall Fields, where Si Keehn lives, in the suburbs of Chicago. He has to get out and do more shopping! Anyhow, it made me think about the retail sales report and your comment that the numbers were revised downward in September and October and showed only a modest gain in November. You said this is causing some downward revision in your real GNP estimate for just this quarter. You're not thinking of this as something that will spill over into the new year also? I wasn't sure I heard the-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	547	PRELL	 I tried to suggest that if indeed we get that kind of greater weakness in consumption expenditures, there probably would be some higher level of inventories, which would tend to weaken the early part of next year. At this point, given the uncertainty of these numbers, I am more inclined to think of it as enhancing the likelihood of our getting the kind of deceleration that we forecast in the first part of next year rather than influencing the [unintelligible] level we forecast. But I think we had a rather brave forecast in that we were looking for a very noticeable slowing in production growth without having any real sense that there was an inventory accumulation going on to trigger it. Basically, we have a very rapid response of producers to that incipient weakening. If it turns out that consumption is weaker in this quarter than we think it has been, it's almost certain we would get that kind of slowdown. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	548	SEGER	 That leads me to my next question. If that's happening--if there are inventories building up that are not planned-- in the past that has often led to some sort of liquidation. Maybe it is just because I've been around for a long time, but that's typically what happens at the retail level, wholesale level, etc. So, at what point might that kick in? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	549	PRELL	 As I said, we would expect a fairly prompt response in which production would slow down considerably in early 1988 if we do get that pattern. I must say, some of it would probably show up in reduced import demand, thus not affecting domestic production so heavily. But at this point I just don't have the feeling that the inventory position, by and large, is that uncomfortable. Certainly, it didn't show up in the Beige Book, which is the information from two or three weeks ago. While you hear these stories, and they vary in the retail sector, there isn't much else to suggest we're getting massive inventory accumulation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	550	SEGER	 My final question involves the trade statistics. I guess the numbers were disappointing on both sides, but the exports ran quite a bit below what we had expected. Again, at what point would you think that this might mean more serious trouble and not just a one-month blip on the screen? We have a lot of eggs in the one  basket next year--mainly an assumption of a strong trade turnaround-- in order to get the kind of real growth that we have for 1988, as I read the forecast anyway. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	551	TRUMAN	 Well, Governor Seger, as Mike said, most of the disappointment was on the nonagricultural export side. The press was disappointed by the imports, and if there was a surprise it was in the oil. That seems to build up imports of products, which seem to fall into the inventories, and I could tell a better story [unintelligible] statistical effect in the first half of 1988. The surprise was on the side of the nonagricultural exports and if that's a true indication of the trend, then obviously they are much weaker than the outlook that we have [unintelligible]. I don't think there's anything in the anecdotal evidence that suggests that month is anything other than a fluke; but if the next two months of the quarter begin to look like October, then I would be worried about the outlook. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	552	PRELL	 From my less informed standpoint, the anecdotal evidence and the manufacturing employment numbers and physical products data that go into our industrial production index just don't jibe with that kind of disappointment on the export side. I think everything is pointing to substantial export growth. In fact, that gives us some confidence that probably this will turn out to be noise and that there will be some offsets in coming months. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	553	SEGER	 It's just that I'm a cautious person, and when you put a lot of eggs in one basket I think you really have to make sure you check the assumption very, very carefully. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	554	TRUMAN	 Well, we think we will have something close to $40 billion or a bit less in nonagricultural exports, in 1982 dollars, over the four quarters of 1987; and we have a little more in [our forecast for] next year. In percentage terms it is slightly less, but with a higher base it's essentially the same pattern of growth as over the four quarters of 1987. Now, there are people who have forecasts that are much more optimistic than ours. We have tried to be a bit conservative. That's not to say that we can't have a boom in exports, but not an explosive pattern. And the forecast, while it probably is off by several billion dollars one way or the other, is a reasonable projection, I think. I am much more comfortable about making the forecast for the four quarters of 1988 than I was a year ago when I was making a similar forecast for the four quarters of 1987. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	555	SEGER	 Was $40 billion what we estimated? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	556	TRUMAN	 Essentially, we have had nonagricultural exports right on--plus or minus a few billion dollars--since the beginning of the year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	557	SEGER	 I know we expected a big turnaround; I couldn't remember the exact number. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	558	TRUMAN	 There was some slight offset in GNP terms but where we have been wrong has been on the nominal import side because we haven't had the price, we haven't had the quantity trade balances [unintelligible]. We've had more imports; therefore, the statistical GNP has been not quite what we thought it would.  	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	559	PRELL	 Just to cite the numbers: in our February Greenbook we had forecast 10 percent growth in real exports, and we have 15 percent at this point. And our confidence has definitely increased since [several] months ago. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	560	PARRY	 How much of an adjustment would you make to the fourth-quarter net export number given October's rough order of magnitude? We have $18.5 billion included in-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	561	TRUMAN	 We went back maybe about $4 or $5 billion. Now again, part of that is in oil. [Unintelligible] because consumption picked up on that side; and on the export side, if you don't take the [unintelligible] out of production, the exports going into inventories might drop by a billion dollars, in 1982 dollars, in the fourth quarter; so we have [net exports] going down from $18.5 billion to $13 to $14-1/2 billion GNP [basis]-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	562	PARRY	 With a small change like that, it might be too early to give up on that 3 percent for the fourth quarter. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	563	PRELL	 Looking at the labor market data, we could easily see 3 percent [GNP] growth. But I recall that a year ago in the fourth quarter we were looking at very strong labor input, and even after GNP revisions we only ended up with 1-1/2 percent. So there's considerable looseness in this; but there is the potential for it being strong if, as we hope, it wasn't all inventory. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	564	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Prell on substance? If not, let's now go around the table on our own views on the economy. Who would like to start off? Mr. Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	565	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, as far as the national economy, we certainly agree with Mike Prell's presentation. In our District, we're seeing some slight improvement, we think. Of course, with what little improvement we do see, we're growing at a slower pace than other parts of the country. There is considerable improvement in manufacturing employment; in fact, we're keeping pace with the national statistics in that regard. We don't see the possible $2 or $3 drop in the price of oil doing a great amount of damage to our District in terms of oil exploration, primarily because most of the planning has been done assuming an oil price of about $15. However, there are implications other than just for exploration in terms of revenues to the state and subsidiary effects that could go along with that. The peso reevaluation is probably a somewhat neutral [event] because we've had diversification along the border, with not so much reliance just on the retail side. While that does affect retail sales [negatively], it improves the myceladora, the twin plant concept. So that turns out to be somewhat of a wash. We feel pretty good about agriculture; it has been considerably better this year. Energy, so far at least, has held its own. Construction, we think, is leveling out. Granted, energy is at the bottom and nothing is going on, but no further deterioration is indicated. Manufacturing plus services are remaining fairly even, although we may see more improvement in services than we are forecasting. So, while it's not a really bright picture, I do think and hope that, aside from the situation of our financial institutions, we are at the bottom and that there is improvement coming along.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198712	566	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	567	CORRIGAN	 Mr. Chairman, I don't have any particular new insights on the immediate outlook, but I have become more and more preoccupied with the longer-term question of how to deal with these fundamental imbalances in the world economy. What I've done, for a change, is ask myself the longer-term question rather than what's going to happen next quarter. And the way I went about that with my colleagues was to say, let's take the 1988 forecast as is--and there's no great difference between the Board staff and the New York staff forecast--but then superimpose on that by assumption, different patterns of behavior over the 1988 through 1991 period to see what kinds of conditions in that overall period can get us out of the box we're in. And there are really four questions that seem to me important: (1) Can we get out of that box without a recession? I think the answer is yes. (2) Can we get there without entailing very, very clear risks on the inflation side? I think the answer there is no. I'll explain these answers in a minute. (3) Can we get there with the current exchange rate structure? And the answer to that is yes. (4) Can we get there without a long period of subpar growth in domestic demand in the United States economy, and by implication, a slower rise in the standard of living than we've been used to? Unfortunately, the answer to that question I think is unambiguously no, we can't. No matter what you do, all scenarios that I can visualize involve, among other things, a large increase in United States market share abroad and also a large increase in our external financing requirement over the period. With my colleagues, the way I tried to get a fix on the dynamics of the long-term problem was to just take a couple of simple arithmetic examples and work back. The first is one that simply postulated a trade deficit of $50 billion in 1991 and then asked what it takes to get there given a 1988 forecast like that in the Greenbook. What it takes is something like this: growth in United States domestic demand of about 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent over the entire period; growth in United States GNP of about 2-3/4 percent, growth in foreign domestic demand of about 3-1/2 percent and growth in foreign GNP of about 3 percent. And by implication, it will require, over the entire period, United States manufacturing output increasing by 4 percent and growth in capacity of plant and equipment in the United States from year-end 1988 levels of something like 3-1/2 percent. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	568	GREENSPAN	 That's annual? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	569	CORRIGAN	 Yes. Achieving either one, in the context of the kinds of things that have been going on, is a long shot. But to put up an argument, even if all of those things worked right, the end-of-period situation, by assumption, would still leave a trade deficit of $50 billion and using very conservative interest rate assumptions, a current account deficit of $77 billion, or 1.3 percent of GNP. Our net foreign indebtedness at the end of the period would be $900 billion, or 15 percent of GNP, and a country with a net foreign indebtedness of 15 percent of GNP--other than in war time or in the early stages of development--is quite unusual indeed. That's the kind of gradual adjustment scenario. Incidentally, that case also assumed no change in the real exchange rate from current levels. Another way to think about it is to impose a constraint on our current account balance by the end of 1991, again assuming no change in the standard of living which means, among other things, no  change in the real exchange rate. In that case, United States domestic demand kind of by assumption is 2-1/2 percent but real GNP would have to be 4 percent. Now, here's the killer: foreign domestic demand would have to be 6.6 percent and foreign GNP would have to be 6 percent. The point, of course, is that I don't see any conceivable way to get from here to there under those kinds of assumptions --that is, maintaining domestic demand growth and expecting that the whole adjustment, in effect, is going to take place externally. That kind of scenario would require growth in United States manufacturing output of about 5-1/2 to 6 percent and growth in physical capacity of about 5-1/2 percent. Again, I just don't see how that could happen. But it would result in a trade surplus at the end of 1991, a $25 billion current account balance, and our net external debt would be about $785 billion, or 12- 1/2 percent of GNP. The third approach that one can think of is something that combines a little of both: to superimpose on case 1, if you will, a 10 percent further devaluation [of the dollar] that is front-end loaded-- in other words, it comes mostly in the early part of next year. Then again, if the constraint is a current account balance in 1991, in order to get there, United States domestic demand growth would have to be something like 1.2 percent; GNP growth, 2.5 to 2.6 percent; foreign demand growth, 3.5 percent; and foreign GNP growth, 2.9 percent or so. That would require manufacturing output growth in the United States of about 4- 1/4 to 4-1/2 percent and capacity growth again of about 4 percent. That would also get you a current account balance in 1991. These estimates are obviously nothing more than an exercise in arithmetic and there's no suggestion that they are anything more than that. Obviously, one could quibble with any one of them, or all of them, but I think the broad profile that emerges from that kind of an exercise is right. That broad profile says to me that any way you cut it, we have a situation involving a huge unfunded external liability sitting out there that is going to have to be attended to. It says to me that domestic spending, at least by historical standards, is going to have to be restrained and that there is considerable force to the argument to stabilize exchange rates sooner rather than later. I can see very little to be gained by further instability in the exchange markets and further downward pressure on the dollar. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the risks of further downward pressure on the dollar are rather asymmetrically on the side of making things worse, not better. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	570	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman. Do I assume, incidentally, that implicit in that is that if we are going to [unintelligible] some of these very large external funding liabilities, we may have to do it in currencies other than the dollar? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	571	CORRIGAN	 If things started to rupture, that's right. There's a lot of risk, and I should say that right now, at this precise point in time, I think the risks are on the financial side. I regard those risks as a matter of particular concern. What I am trying to say is that, as great as those concerns are right now, I think the longer-term problem remains; and, in order to try to deal with the problems today, we need to do it in a way that recognizes what we are up against over a long period of time.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	572	PARRY	 A point of clarification: Are you saying that policy today ought to be directed at preventing the dollar from declining? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	573	CORRIGAN	 I didn't quite say that. But the question is what kind of policy would produce that result? I don't think that is totally within our control. I think it has a lot to do with the attitudes of the United States government as a whole. But if I had no constraints, and you asked me if my preference would be a policy that puts heavy weight on stabilizing the dollar, my answer is yes--not exclusive, but heavy--yes. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	574	BLACK	 Would you go so far as to say that recession is almost inevitable to get a desirable result? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	575	CORRIGAN	 No. In my mind, that's the value of doing this kind of exercise, because it does tell me that we can avoid a recession. It tells me that we have a very thin line to walk and very little maneuvering room. But the comforting thing is that it does say to me that there is a conceivable set of circumstances over a period of time that can produce a desired result without a recession. If we make too many mistakes, one of the biggest risks in this long term is that it involves a lot of inflationary pressures over a long period of time. Obviously, if those inflationary pressures escape us, that is one of the things that increases the risks of a recession. But the comfort I draw from this is that it does suggest you can get through this without a recession. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	576	GREENSPAN	 Where are the inflationary pressures coming from in this arithmetical scenario? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	577	CORRIGAN	 Well, part of it is what's already built in. But when you have growth, say, in manufacturing output, in the ranges that are implied even in the gradual adjustment scenario, and the need to increase plant and equipment spending in sufficient magnitudes - - 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	578	GREENSPAN	 [Unintelligible.] 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	579	CORRIGAN	 That's true, but we're talking about a pattern of behavior over a number of years with a starting point of an unemployment rate of 6 percent, when the starting point in terms of capacity utilization-- and in this scenario we use the rate forecast for the end of 1988--is 82-1/2 percent. The overall rate is [projected to be] up to 82-1/2 percent, but there are about 8 or 9 two-digit SIC industry groups that are big exporters where those capacity utilization rates are already pushing de facto full utilization. So, it does take a not inconsequential amount of hard investment to be able to sustain that kind of export-driven output in manufacturing. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	580	GREENSPAN	 Do you make use of sources and uses of investment and savings in this study? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	581	CORRIGAN	 What it implies is that the budget deficit comes down in proportion to the reduction in the current account, in rough order of magnitude, so that in the so-called gradual adjustment case the budget deficit in 1991 is down around 1 percent of  GNP. But it also implies that the saving rate comes up more in line with early to mid-1980s experience as opposed to the experience of last year. Of course, if either or both of those things don't happen, then you have problems because if the saving rate doesn't come up, and then you superimpose a higher level of consumption spending than what it is already, then your domestic demand -- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	582	GREENSPAN	 Then you won't get the adjustment in unemployment. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	583	CORRIGAN	 That's right. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	584	HELLER	 What are your inflation rates? You said they were increasing? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198712	585	CORRIGAN	 In this? The inflation rate in this is basically held stable at 4-1/2 percent by assumption. That's one of the things that permits an orderly interest rate outlook here. Again, I want to emphasize this is just arithmetic; it's not a model or anything like that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	586	GREENSPAN	 It's not exactly, but you do have relationships between foreign demand and United States exports. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	587	CORRIGAN	 Oh, yes. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	588	BLACK	 Is business saving rising as well as personal saving? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	589	CORRIGAN	 Excuse me, the overall saving rate- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	590	TRUMAN	 Mr. Chairman, the one thing I want to say about this is that it's got 1 percent more growth abroad than any foreign official is prepared to target. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	591	CORRIGAN	 That's right. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	592	TRUMAN	 And, if you put their growth not at 3-1/2 percent, but at 1-1/2 to 2 percent--which has been the experience so far--then I think you get a very different set of scenarios. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	593	GREENSPAN	 I hate to admit this but I find the scenario that the Vice Chairman has been outlining more benevolent than any of them that I've been contemplating. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	594	CORRIGAN	 It's not without risks. But, Bob, to answer your question, it's not all that precise. The overall saving rate goes up, almost by assumption; it's the only way you can get that result. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	595	GREENSPAN	 But that is only arithmetic. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	596	CORRIGAN	 That is right. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	597	GREENSPAN	 Because, if you start with the GNP that will relate to income, you have a consumption element fit in-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	598	CORRIGAN	 It has to go up.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	599	BLACK	 You almost have to have a rise in business saving as well as personal, I would think, under that scenario. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	600	GREENSPAN	 I think that's probably right. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	601	CORRIGAN	 Well, as Alan said before, in this scenario--assuming there's no generalized outburst of inflation driving up wages--presumably the profitability in manufacturing would be fairly robust in these circumstances. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	602	BLACK	 That's what I was implying: that you would have rising capital consumption allowances and profits. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	603	CORRIGAN	 But, there's a whole bunch of things that have to work right. As Mr. Truman said, even this gradual adjustment case assumes foreign domestic demand growth of 3-1/2 percent and foreign GNP growth of 3 percent. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198712	604	BLACK	 That's what really bothers me more than anything else, I guess. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	605	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	606	BLACK	 I really don't have much to say. I think the staff did an exceptionally good job on the Greenbook, and Mike really covered all the caveats that we now are throwing out. I'm sympathetic with what Governor Kelley said about worrying about the aggregates. To use your metaphor, Mr. Chairman, we don't know if the plumbing has been reconnected or not; but I do strongly suspect that it will be reconnected before we know it has. And I'm wondering if these could be flashing danger signals. But, on the other side of that, the employment [outlook] from the National Association of Purchasing Managers report was extremely strong. We went back and telephoned the contacts that we usually talk to when we produce the Beige Book to see if we could find any evidence that there were changes in expectations or sales. We looked at 25 retailers, for example, and 18 said that recently their sales definitely had been running well above what they were last year; only three said they were down. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	607	SEGER	 What is well above? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	608	BLACK	 Well, Martha, I was going to get to this in a minute, and say you were spending more than Si Keehn, because the in Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia, said that sales were exceptionally strong. In Washington, they were running 16 percent ahead; in Baltimore 13 percent ahead; and in Philadelphia 18 percent ahead. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	609	HELLER	 Is that dollars or volume? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198712	610	BLACK	 Dollars. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	611	PARRY	 Probably volume as well. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	612	BLACK	 There's a lot of discounting, so I don't know if it's more or less. If there's more, then that means that you have  more volume, really, than these figures would imply. We also looked at our industrial-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	613	SEGER	 Is that for one month? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	614	BLACK	 It's since Thanksgiving, which is really the beginning of the Christmas season. She was very optimistic, much more so than But it was really amazing to us that we couldn't find more evidence; nobody had scaled down estimates of what would happen next year. In looking at the industrial contacts it's pretty much the same sort of thing. So I guess you can just summarize their responses by saying that going into the details just didn't show any real signs of weakening at this point. So, for what that's worth- It makes me feel better than I thought I would feel at this time following the crash on October 19. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198712	615	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	616	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, looking ahead to 1988, I too definitely think the October events [unintelligible]. I agree with Bob on that. While obviously those events were hardly positive, they have not had a fundamental effect on the economy as I had thought they might, at least as yet. Therefore, our outlook is not at all inconsistent with the staff forecast. We may be a touch on the more positive side. I have just a couple of specific comments. On retail sales, I certainly agree with Bob Black. I talked to somebody Monday who has important operations in the Midwest and, for the Christmas selling season so far through Sunday, their sales have been 5 percent over last year; and he thinks that for the balance of this Christmas season their sales will improve over that. The outlook for retail sales appears really quite positive at this point. Capital spending programs have not been cut and I've talked to an awful lot of people about that over the last two or three weeks. Most companies have contingency plans in place and they are taking a very careful look. They have a cautious attitude but, so far, nobody is reducing their plans and they are really carrying on with them in a pretty good way. There are two dichotomies here that I have a hard time understanding: first, on inflation, I keep hearing these anecdotal reports about very significant price increases for a variety of raw materials, steel in particular. I have heard some huge numbers on steel from some people--30 percent increases on an annual basis; and I have heard of paper products and chemical products also moving up pretty rapidly. But these are offset by comments of other people. I have met with major companies, and one very, very large manufacturing company that I talk with pulled out their material prices for me. For 1987, excluding steel, their material prices have only gone up .7 percent; and for next year they are forecasting an increase of .5 percent. For steel for this year, they in fact had a price decrease of 1.8 percent; for next year they are expecting an increase of only 0.4 percent. So, there is this tremendous difference between large companies that have big power and the smaller companies that really don't. Certainly, the increases are not showing up in the inflation numbers. On the labor side, the news continues to be very good. Three-year contracts, at least in our District, are very standard. In some cases, annual increases in all costs are under 2 percent and certainly, 2 to 3 percent is quite standard. The productivity work  rule changes have been very important. Therefore, the productivity increases for some companies have been very impressive, so that unit labor costs indeed are coming down. So, with regard to the inflation problem, at least as I talk to people, certainly the pressures at this point are not nearly as great as I would have expected last summer. In fact, at least some of the heat has come out of this problem. The other dichotomy, which we have talked about a little, is this trade balance issue. A lot of people I have talked to are really getting much better results on their exports; they are operating at high levels in some specialized industries but, at the current level of the dollar, they can easily compete in Europe and the Far East. But again, this is not universal. There are other people who are not having a similar kind of experience. I am reminded by people that when the dollar was so very high, dealer and distribution networks really came down very significantly; and those who were dependent on such networks are having a bit of a problem re-establishing them. But for the long run, I do agree with Ted Truman and Mike Prell that the fundamentals have to be very, very good and that, at some point, we're going to begin to see these improvements on the export side. On net, given the reduction of the dollar, and if the foreign markets hold up and indeed begin to improve, I think that we are going to see this increase in exports. If the consumption numbers hold up--and certainly I have this early look that they are moving along better than I might have expected--I think the staff outlook is a little soft on the consumption side. I do think the outlook for 1988 continues to be positive and not inconsistent with the results that we've had this year. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198712	617	BLACK	 It's the sort of scenario that would worry Jerry Corrigan. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0

198712	619	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	620	BOEHNE	 As far as the overall Greenbook forecast, I think it's reasonable. In our own District, we continue to see strong employment gains. And in those areas where we've seen some slowing in the growth--Delaware, for example--I think it is more because of supply constraints than demand constraints. We've been seeing the same thing that Si Keehn has: the manufacturing sector is picking up handsomely and I think that's largely attributable to improved exports. Growth in construction, while slowing, still is at a fairly healthy level, particularly in the nonresidential area. On retail sales, we've been picking up; as I've heard around the table, they are doing really rather well. Our retailers say that they are holding up to pre-stock market crash expectations and it is very hard to see the effect of the stock market on retail sales. So, in a nutshell, the regional economy continues to do well. I would like to piggyback very briefly on this adjustment process issue that Jerry brought up because it seems to me that we have to view the economy and the outlook a good bit differently with this overhang of the adjustment process than we ordinarily would. In the past, we've gone through periods where inflation was a problem and we've had to make some adjustments. We've gone through periods where aggregate demand was too weak. We've had recessions and we've had to  make adjustments. I think this is the first time that any of us has gone through an international adjustment process of this magnitude with the United States because I don't think we've been in this kind of a situation. We'd have to go back to before the World War I period. We may get this shift from consuming more than we produce to producing more than we consume; we may be lucky and get that magnitude just right. We may get the changes in exports and imports so that we can keep aggregate demand going along at what most of us would consider an acceptable growth rate. But we may not be so lucky; we probably won't be. There are a lot of scenarios here, but my sense is that we are going to have to be prepared to accept slower growth than we would otherwise think of as being desirable in the interests of this international adjustment process. Some of this slower growth may be forced on us by market discipline of the kind we were talking about earlier. We may have to begin to settle our foreign liabilities in other currencies rather than the dollar. But, I think there will come a time--probably sooner rather than later--when monetary policy decisions are going to have to be increasingly influenced by this adjustment process. We can lean toward helping the adjustment process or we can lean against it; but I think we are going to have to think more in terms of what we can do to lean in the direction of helping it. It just may mean that we will have to accept growth rate increases that are less than we ordinarily would in order to do that. But I think it is better for us to get ourselves in that kind of thought process rather than have the market disciplines coming down on us very hard, which they will if we don't. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198712	621	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	622	STERN	 With regard to the regional economy, as some people have already suggested, it remains quite difficult out our way to find any pronounced negative effects as a consequence of the stock market decline in October. Most sectors in our District continue to do reasonably well. Anecdotal evidence is generally positive, particularly with regard to manufacturers and what they are seeing in terms of trade and international competitiveness. It leaves me, at this point, with very little doubt as to where we are going in that direction. I'm not sure that this continuing strength in domestic demand is all to the good at this point, as Bob Black already commented. As for my view of the national outlook, I'm going to echo Ed Boehne here to some degree. The Greenbook may be certainly a satisfactory outlook, and it may be about as good as we can expect. I happen to think that we are probably in the midst of this transition to an economy in which growth will be driven by growth in trade and, for a time at least, in inventory building and that domestic final demand will be subdued. I'm not sure that we can go through this kind of adjustment process, this transition, and avoid a recession. It seems to me that that's a risk that we have to run and that we may not have much choice about it. I have been struck that--at least until what's been happening with OPEC the last several days--the bond market, as far as I can read it, has been reacting to declines in the dollar kind of the way it was back in April and May and again in August and September. That's one form of the market discipline that would be foisted upon us if we don't take steps to promote the transition ourselves, or at least to allow it to occur. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198712	623	GREENSPAN	 President Morris.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	624	MORRIS	 Well, Mr. Chairman, after looking at the surprisingly strong October-November employment gains, it would seem that when the stock market decline hit us we had an economy with a very strong head of steam, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Perhaps the stock market drop will turn out to be a blessing in disguise in that it has taken at least a little of the speculative euphoria out of the system. The only impact we see in New England from the stock market decline is changed expectations as to the growth rate of the financial services industry, which had been growing very rapidly in New England, particularly the mutual fund business. Looking at the forecast, it seems to me that the risk is that the economy will grow more rapidly than we are forecasting, particularly in the business fixed investment sector. I know that the current quite modest projection is in line with the forecast, as Mike Prell said. But if we keep moving in the direction of greater utilization in manufacturing capacity, which I think is in the cards, I wonder whether the rate of growth of business fixed investment in 1988 may turn out to be substantially higher. Then we could have a situation in which the economy is growing faster than we can afford to see it grow. Maybe we could grow at a 2-1/2 percent rate without generating acceleration of wage increases. But if growth is much beyond 2-1/2 percent, I think we run the risk of making a fundamental change in this benign wage environment that we've had. So, I don't see that we have a lot of room to maneuver here. And I think the risk in the forecast is that we forecast too low a rate of growth in business fixed investment. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198712	625	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	626	MELZER	 In our District, the real strong point is employment. Non-ag employment has kept pace with national growth rates. And we've seen particular strength in manufacturing employment; in the three months before October, that was up over 4 percent. Construction has been notably weaker in both sectors but for a long time it was stronger than the rest of the economy. I would say that the retail sales situation is a little more moderate than described in other areas. I talked to a major national retailer about two weeks ago and they were disappointed with their November results. December started off better, but their profit plan for February through August has been nudged down significantly; and they're taking about 10 percent, or $75 million, out of their capital spending plan for next year which, in a sense, doesn't surprise me. This individual also mentioned that apparel manufacturers are talking about double digit price increases for the spring line and he does not see that that's in the cards at all, based on his outlook of demand. Adding to what Jerry Corrigan and Gary Stern said about the adjustment process that Jerry was describing: it seems to me that the big risk--and I'm talking in the broad sense, not about monetary policy specifically, though it certainly fits into the picture--is that if we are perceived as not pursuing underlying policies that are consistent with that adjustment process, then it will trigger prices in exactly the way Sam Cross was describing before. As I said at the last meeting, I don't believe in defending the value of the currency; but the fact of the matter is that I perceive that we are in a financial situation where we just don't have a lot of room to ignore it. I wouldn't put my view in the context of specifically defending the currency but I do think that we have to run policies that are consistent with that adjustment process. That gets back to Ed Boehne's point that we have to be  looking at lower demand growth than we might otherwise be willing to accept. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198712	627	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	628	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the generally healthy Twelfth District economy has experienced few significant changes since the stock market decline. The firms we surveyed indicated that they were going ahead with planned capital spending projects for next year. Moreover, retail sales appear to be holding up well, according to representatives of several major department store chains. from September to date, which of course, is the most important part of the Christmas period up to this point, his sales were up 13 percent. He has had no price increases so that is basically a volume increase. Evidence from the mortgage market in our area is mixed but, on balance, activity in the residential area appears to have weakened slightly in the wake of the stock market decline. One little vignette in terms of exports comes from a large lumber company. He said that, unless there is a significant decline in the demand for lumber domestically, there is no room for further exports of lumber; capacity in the industry is not going to be added to significantly for the next two years, and you just can't count on lumber exports at a higher level unless there is a significant decline in domestic demands. Our economic forecast has a little more strength in activity next year and the same rate of inflation as the Board staff's forecast. The slowdown that we have in the first half, of course, is a result of the negative effects of the stock market decline. It is important to point out that both our staff's forecast and that of the Board staff--and I think a lot of the forecasts that have been mentioned around here--have included a fairly significant decline in interest rates in conjunction with the slowdown. It would also appear that those forecasts imply an easing in policy in the near term. Now, I want to emphasize the point that the forecasts all assume the negative effects of the stock market. And it seems clear to me, at least at this point, that as yet there haven't been any signs of such slowing. The second-half pickup, which is a little stronger in our forecast, results from the dissipation of the adverse wealth effects. In addition, the decline in interest rates in the first half has a role in causing the economy to grow more rapidly in the second half and, finally, the recent sharp drop in the dollar also adds strength to the second-half growth rate. Finally, although short-term prospects for inflation appear comforting, I don't think I could describe the expectation of 4 percent inflation next year, following a similar increase this year, as comforting at all. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198712	629	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	630	SEGER	" I have just a couple of comments. A few weeks ago I met with the chief financial officers of about 125 Fortune 500 companies. One of the things that I asked them about was their reaction to October 19, both individually and corporate-wise. Basically, they were sort of frozen in place. They hadn't dealt with that kind of situation before so they hadn't recommended dramatic changes in plans to their CEOs nor had they changed their profit plans. Most of them were right in the middle of the profit-planning season for 1988. Because most of them hadn't been through this  experience before--and, unlike us, they didn't have models that would predict the impact when there hadn't been a similar event--they were playing it by ear, I would say, and trying to get readings on what the sales of their companies were doing, and so forth. They were going to continue to look at them and there might be changes forthcoming; but, at that point, they were simply not sure. They said the biggest impact was on the bonuses and the value of the stock options. As one fellow said, one of the biggest shocks was having to get his CEO out of a board meeting and tell him that their stock had stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange. That shook things up quite dramatically. The one company that really has reacted to this, though--and I think I mentioned this before--is They have done such things as: cut back on a major plant modernization job; pushed the completion date into the future for an addition that was going on at a similar plant and delayed a new tech center they were going to be building out in Also, they continue to fiddle with their pension plans, building more liquidity, raising cash, and cutting back on holdings of stock and also of long bonds. In addition, they continue to fiddle with their production schedules. As you know, Ward's announced that the auto industry as a whole was planning for production for the first quarter of about 14 percent below the first quarter of this year; but is making plans that are more pessimistic than that. Also, I was told by them that some of the other auto companies probably would be cutting their first-quarter plans more deeply and that, therefore, the Ward's number would probably turn out to be a little overly optimistic. Also, the inventory situation in autos is really, really severe. As of November 30th, the days' supply was 86 days as compared with 73 days a year ago. At the end of December, they think it will be 98 days. That certainly is consistent with the idea of cutting production because these incentives that they have tried to use for the last year and a half have less and less ""oomph"" every time they drag them out. And so, they just have to do something else. The final point is that there is great concern about the deterioration in consumer confidence, looking both at the University of Michigan survey and also the Conference Board's. One of the points made to me was that averaging the results of these two surveys, the latest number showed the lowest reading in this recovery after registering the highest level for this recovery in September. So, they are concerned about what that will do to future consumer purchases of their products. If you want a group that isn't rolling in the aisles with optimism, I would recommend that you talk to some of these people. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198712	631	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	632	HOSKINS	 The manufacturing side of the Fourth District is strong and it is strong based on the dollar. From what we can tell, it is strong in steel, chemicals, and capital goods. The emphasis on the customer side has been more on delivery times as opposed to price, which implies some increase in price of very [unintelligible] commercial side. It is very consistent with respect to not bringing on [line] a lot of old plant; they want to wait a while longer to see if the demand lasts. On the retail side, it's very much the same as everyone else has reported. Higbee's, May's, and Federated all have reported strong sales gains since Thanksgiving. None of the weakness that we've all been anticipating has shown up, to date. In terms of the longer-term forecast, we have no really major differences with the Greenbook forecast. In terms of the adjustment  process we were talking about, I suspect surprises in the future rather than disappointments will be on the side of a quicker adjustment rather than a slower adjustment than we have seen lately. And the reason for that has to do with what is going on, at least in some companies, with respect to their profit margins. The profit margins of foreign companies are being squeezed; they are holding market share, as everybody has discussed. But they are doing the same thing that the Americans did six or seven years ago: they are putting plants in place in domestic markets or buying plants in domestic markets to retain their market share. So, they are going to suffer a profit squeeze for a while, and then they will be up and running with domestic plant production which would then imply less imports from abroad. So, I have some view that the adjustment process, at least as forced by the marketplace, is going to go a little faster than perhaps we are expecting at the moment. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't worry about the things that Jerry Corrigan and everyone else are worrying about. But my emphasis would be that, obviously, we don't have a lot of control over all of those variables. One we do at least have some influence on is price stability. And I would find a consensus around the table for moving more towards zero over the next four or five years more comforting than 4-1/2 percent. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198712	633	GREENSPAN	 Vice President Guynn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	634	GUYNN	 This is my first time here, and this process is fascinating. Economic development in the Southeast appears to be very similar to what I've heard others comment on in the national picture. Manufacturing and trade-related activity--and in our case that includes textiles and chemicals--clearly are doing better. In Texas and Oklahoma the oil and gas industry is finally showing some signs of life. Yet, I think there's a little concern that some of the projects that are still on the shelf and that haven't been restarted could be discouraged, or at least put off further, if the price of oil does fall back or stay at lower levels. So, that's a minor concern in that oil patch of ours. in the paperboard packaging business, reports backlogs have grown and he can't even shut his plants for normal maintenance. So somebody, somewhere, thinks that business is going to be good. Very much like I've heard others say around the table, our retailers also report that their sales have come in close to expectations. But we've had a number of people point out that they had scaled back their expectations for the last half of this year even before mid-October, so I don't think we would use words like strong. We've even had a few retailers, as Tom Melzer indicated, point out that they have a little concern about the early part of next year, after we get past the Christmas season. Finally, with regard to the region, at our last board meeting a bit of uneasiness about the early part of next year was expressed from Tennessee, which has become kind of a mini- Detroit with a lot of automobile and consumer durables-related businesses. But Tennessee has done well and they are looking through that and see that it is only a temporary problem with a little disappointment perhaps in their minds for the early part of next year. Nationally, we, too, are comfortable with the Greenbook forecast; our differences are marginal. We might see modestly less improvement in the trade deficit but we see the prospects for manufacturing investment perhaps being even a little stronger than indicated, as Frank Morris suggested; so, those tend to balance out.  Overall, we are reasonably comfortable that we will get moderate growth in 1988. I am a little concerned that perhaps the downside risk in the early part of next year might be a little stronger than the upside risk. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198712	635	JOHNSON	 I agree with a lot of the comments. I'm picking up the same thing: that the export side of things is very strong. You don't hear anyone complaining about orders coming in and their ability to compete at these exchange rates and the activity of their businesses at this stage, so I think that on the production side things do look very solid at the moment. What's starting to trouble me a little though--and maybe I'm smoking something because I seem to be a bit out of sync with some of the other views--is certainly not on the production side right now but on the sales end of things. We got revisions on October and September retail sales, which were down considerably and down relative to the Greenbook, if I remember right. We have revised down the retail sales figures even [for the period] before the stock market crash; our view of domestic demand is weaker going into the stock market crash than in fact we thought before, relative to the forecast. Now, I agree with everyone else: I haven't seen the impacts of the stock market decline on consumption at this point. Retail sales were actually up modestly in November; automobile sales seem to be holding up, although that's mainly an incentive issue. But we haven't seen a really severe hit to domestic consumption since the stock market crash. What I'm worried about a little is that we may not quite be seeing it yet but, given the fact that sales are running below what we anticipated them to be before the stock market crash, there's a little more downside risk, in my mind. I think some circumstantial evidence is that we have seen weak credit demands in November. How you translate that, I don't know; but it's the first time in a while that we actually have had a decline in overall credit demands for the month of November. I don't place a lot of emphasis on the aggregates but the fact that we are now projecting an actual decline in Ml growth in December, when we were hoping for an increase, is a little bothersome. I can't really explain it and I don't want to have just a knee-jerk reaction, but it bothers me that I can't rationalize it either. So I think there is some near-term risk, but I agree overall with the longer-run view that we have to see consumption run lower than we have in the past to get the adjustment we need. I think the external adjustment is taking place; exports look very strong, and even adjusting out oil imports, non-oil imports don't look bad at all. But my concern is that things don't sneak up on us on the domestic demand side--that while we are expecting slow domestic demand and we are sort of looking the other way, the numbers go down sharply. I don't want to get caught in that side of things. We do have to resist a strong expansion in domestic demand or we have to have a very conservative expansion in that area or maybe even almost flat; but that's different from a sharp decline. But, once again, I don't see the sales numbers sharply weaker since the stock market crash. I'm worried more that we went into that on the weaker side than we thought. That's sort of where I am on the adjustment process. What I'm worried about, though, is that if we end up with a sharp downward reduction in consumption as the adjustment mechanism, we're just simply going to replace private sector demands for financing with public sector demands for financing, because we are going to see a huge swelling in the budget deficit. I'm not sure that our needs for foreign capital flows are going to  improve under that adjustment process at all, substituting government financing needs for private financing needs. And the interest rate implications of dependence on foreign sources of capital flows are pretty scary. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198712	636	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	637	ANGELL	 My outlook and the staff's are very, very similar. There is only one modification and that is that I see as strong an economy as the staff sees only without the 1 percentage point decline in interest rates. I guess that would mean that I see an underlying strength of capital spending that would be able to accomplish the contribution that the staff has laid out even without getting the interest rate decline. That adjustment, I think, can still give us strength. There are three uncertainties that we are all faced with: consumer spending; the impact from net real exports and the dollar; and the foreign exchange rate/capital market adjustment problems. Let me mention, first of all, consumer spending. It seems to me that the consumer spending effect of the episode of October 19 and the days following is less than the impact of the exchange rate and interest rate changes that have occurred since then. That is, consumer spending is not apt to be affected in a worrisome way, given what has already happened. If we do not have another event, it seems to me that, of course, we will have employment effects in some of the financial service industries and that would be consistent with some slowdown. But I would note that personal consumption expenditures for the third quarter 1987 over the third quarter 1986 contributed about 1.5 percent out of a 3.1 percent economy. So, Jerry, I think this adjustment you're talking about is really already under way. My view, Jerry, is that it's helpful to lay out before us, as you did, the kind of adjustment scenarios. But it seems to me that there's just no question that these adjustments are going to take place. We are not going to be able to operate with the kind of imports of capital and the kind of balance of trade deficits that we've had; the market is going to bring some adjustments. The question is whether the adjustments come in the way we would like them to come or in a way that would be very unfavorable and maybe close to disaster. I was very pleased to hear Tom Melzer, Bob Parry, and Lee Hoskins all mention the fact that inflation of 4 percent is not satisfactory. Of course, if we have low wage rates and high inflation rates, that's one way we could get an adjustment. I would join them in saying that's not a satisfactory way of getting an adjustment. Our real net exports, as you know, have been increasing in a rather dramatic way. I guess, Martha, I'd be on the side of calling the November numbers a fluke or a one-time occurence. I'm not willing to rely on that as compared to twelve months of movement in the other direction. When we look at third-quarter rates of 18 - 19 percent on real exports, it seems to me that one of the problems we are faced with is that real exports are growing at such a dramatic rate. We pick a high [unintelligible] exchange value of the dollar and we say we don't want to tie monetary policy to that. I understand why, but we may have overlooked the fact that that foreign exchange value of the dollar is producing a real export role and a crowding out of manufactured imports at a rate that's going to be difficult to maintain, even given the heavier capital spending taking place there. So, it seems to me important for us not to make any gesture in the direction that would tend to exacerbate that problem. I tend to  think, as Jerry Corrigan and Sam Cross and some others do, that that's the real factor that could give us the recession that everyone is worried about. I don't think it is going to come because of slow money growth. The money growth path that we've had, it seems to me, is not a Federal Reserve starvation growth pattern. It isn't because we shut off reserves. If that were the case, I think we would see some other factors occurring: I'm sure that the foreign exchange markets would show more evidence if we really were being that stringent on reserves; that the Treasury yield curve would show it; and that we would be getting some declining commodity prices. But I do believe that the real risk that we face is a foreign exchange rate upset that could, in a sense, give us another financial market episode in equities. I understand why the monetarists argue for floating exchange rates, but you just don't get something for nothing. If we have floating exchange rates, then we'd have to accept floating interest rates also. And it would scare me as to what a precipitous move in exchange rates might do to United States interest rates. Frankly, I think that the stock market episode and the recent oil price move have simply given our bond markets some opportunity not to face the real consequences that a continuation of the dollar on this course would mean. It's in that context that I've been, I suppose, oversensitive to any tendency on our part to peg the fed funds rate. I'm just afraid to peg the fed funds rate in an environment in which we would not have interest rates responding to those real forces. I share the view that letting the dollar go is a recipe for disaster. We're not getting the kind of help we ought to be getting on Capitol Hill, but it seems to me we either have to take some steps in that direction, or we're going to get an experience that none of us wants. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0

198712	639	HELLER	 I was quite surprised to hear the high degree of optimism from all parts of the country expressed around the table here. I was surprised because an awful lot of people talked about their agreement with the Greenbook. And if you look at the Greenbook, the next quarter's GNP is down 1.1 percent: consumption is negative; durables and nondurables are negative; industrial production is down to a 1.0 percent increase; housing starts and auto sales are at the lowest levels since 1983. Yet everybody is extremely optimistic. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0

198712	643	HELLER	 The optimism is also in contrast to what I would almost call a barrage of visits and letters that have been coming in here during the last couple of weeks and days. Curiously, many of the remarks by those representing the national associations--often of the industries that some of you were talking about--were very much on the pessimistic side. Obviously, we have some problem here of looking at the trees versus the forest. And, having lived off Coricidin for the last three or four days, I really don't know how to sort it out. I come down with Mike Prell, who says I see a lot of good things and I see a lot of bad things, and I really don't know which way the evidence is pointing. But there is a marked contrast between the optimism that seems to be being picked up in the anecdotal evidence  and the outlook that I would argue is not at all optimistic, according to the Greenbook. Also, if you look at some of the monetary statistics, we have a real money supply that has been falling now since May, and reserves are flat. So, if all that optimism is out there, I'm still curious why people don't hold that money. Those are also some of the remarks I seem to be hearing, at least from our Desk people. They say, well, the demand for money just isn't there. So, I'm puzzled. Obviously, I hope it will turn out the way the vast majority here describe it to be, but I think that there are a lot of reasons for unease in that optimistic outlook, because I think some of the more macro forces may not be all that sanguine. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198712	644	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	645	KELLEY	 Well, I'm glad to follow your speech, Bob, because I think I'm coming from very much the same place. I have some concern, too, because I'm getting somewhat different reports than I'm hearing around the table this morning. In fact, the reports I'm hearing around the table this morning encourage me greatly from where I was when I came in here. My suspicion is that we are getting this adjustment, as Governor Angell suggests; and I also suspect that it may be this very slow aggregate growth and reserve growth that Bob Heller was talking about that's doing it. I'm not confident that retailers are doing that well. The sales I hear about across the country--when they started and the extent of them--make me wonder how strong things are. Indeed, there are a lot of reports coming in from associations that are not as strong as we are hearing here this morning. Martha, you were quoting from I had a visit from an economic consultant who works with and this fellow is telling that the economy is going to fall off the cliff in the first quarter on account of the growth in the aggregates. That may be part of what's going into their planning. In short, Mr. Chairman, to go back to your analogy about plumbing and Bob Black's comment on it, I wonder if the plumbing may not be beginning to work again. In any event, I suspect it will work a while before we realize it is working. Given that the retail economy is as important as it is to the overall picture, I think that we should be very alert to the state of the plumbing--what the aggregates are doing and what effects that may be having. I would be very happy with the staff forecast for 1988, and I basically agree with it. But that's where my concern about it would lie. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198712	646	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey, do you want to say anything? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	647	GUFFEY	 Well, it's getting late, Mr. Chairman. I would just add to the optimism in a sense, particularly from the District perspective, although we are lagging the national recovery both in terms of employment gains as well as personal income gains. Nonetheless, looking back from where we started, in energy, agriculture, aircraft, and so forth, things are looking much better. That's particularly true in the agricultural area, where things such as agricultural real estate values actually have increased in the second quarter--very modestly to be sure, but nonetheless there is an increase. Energy rig exploration is something in the neighborhood of 35 percent greater than a year ago. However, given what's happening now with the potential fall in the oil prices, I'm not sure that will continue. With regard to retail sales, the report that we have is  that they are modestly higher, some 5 percent higher, than the same time last year, with a lot of sales and discounting, which means volume should be moving through those retail elements. As a result, I guess I would say we feel better than we did a year ago, and better than we did six months ago. The clouds on the horizon might be a drop in energy prices as the result of OPEC's problems and/or a change in the agricultural subsidy provisions from the federal government, both of which would impact the Tenth District. However, looking at 1988, the latter would suggest that it will be a fairly good year, given current commodity prices--if they hold up. Agricultural exports are very encouraging to the people in our area. Those are mostly government-subsidized exports, I might say, but the inventories that built up in the last couple of years are being worked off. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198712	648	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we take our break at this time and continue with Don Kohn's report. [Coffee break] 	2	2	1.0	1.0	47.0
198712	649	GREENSPAN	 Don, why don't you get started? 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	650	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A major issue for the Committee in considering its short-run  alternatives is the interpretation of recent monetary data and its  implications for the economy. Monthly data have been distorted by the bulge  in demand deposits that followed the stock market crash. The run-off of that  bulge was a major influence on November growth, especially for Ml. But  weakness has persisted into early December. Indeed, information received over  the past two days suggests that Ml will decline again in December, and that  the pickup in M2 growth will be less than had been projected in the bluebook.  Taking account of our new projections for December, and averaging through the  ups and downs of recent months, we now project that Ml will increase at around  a 1-1/2 percent annual rate over September to December, M2 at around a 3-1/2  percent rate and M3 a little over 5 percent. This would represent a shortfall  from expectations at the November meeting, and, especially for Ml, a further  slowing from the pace previously recorded this year.  Part of the shortfall arises because the staff had built some  heightened liquidity demands into its projections last time, and these haven't  materialized. In the absence of such demands, fairly slow growth is not  entirely unexpected. Interest rates had risen through mid-October, and the  same forces that have been restraining monetary expansion through the year  undoubtedly have been at work in the fourth quarter. In fact, on a quarterly  average basis, growth in the fourth quarter is not far different than would be  predicted by the models, which see earlier increases in interest rates as  still damping money growth. And it is close to expectations at the September  meeting. The major surprise continues to be in demand deposits, which are  projected to be dropping substantially further in December. While demand  deposits have been weak at all types of banks, the very largest money center  banks have experienced a disproportionate decline this year. The weakness in  these deposits tends to feed through into M2, since it probably does not  reflect shifts into other M2 components. Unfortunately, I have had no new  insights on this subject overnight. Committee members may remember that we  were equally puzzled by the strength of demand deposits in 1985 and 1986, and  conducted several special rounds of follow-up calls to banks and their corporate customers. The answer we received most consistently referred to interest rate effects, especially on compensating balances. And the concentration  at largest banks suggests that this type adjustment of business accounts  remains an important channel. A further factor we uncovered in the process of  assessing rapid demand deposit growth was the role of mortgage prepayments,  which, because of certain regulations in the mortgage market, tend to be  lodged in demand accounts for a time. The rise in prepayments as interest  rates fell likely boosted demand deposit growth in 1986, and their slackening  probably has contributed to weakness this year. For all these rationales, the  question remains as to whether the decrease in the demand deposits and shortfall in broader aggregates is signalling a fundamental tightening of liquidity  in the economy that will lead to considerable restraint on economic activity.  Collateral evidence in financial markets on the thrust of policy in  the most recent period presents a mixed picture, as interest rates rose and  stock prices fell on balance, but the dollar dropped sharply. While the  decline in the dollar might be consistent with an expectation of a weakening  economy and prospective declines in interest rates, the response of the bond  market suggested that the drop in the dollar was seen to arise from other  sources, and concerns were more that the lower dollar would be strengthening  the economy and prices over time. The yield curve retains a fairly steep upward slope, which generally indicates that the market, at least, expects that  the trend in policy is more likely to need to be toward restraint than ease.  The bluebook paths have built into them some pickup in money growth  over the next several months. Basically, this strengthening arises from the  lagged impact of the decline in interest rates in late October. Under alternative B, which assumes that rates remain about where they are, the pickup is  only expected to bring money growth about in line with income, in part because  the decline in interest rates after October 19 merely brought them back to their  levels of August. Thus, without further rate declines, the impact on money  demand also is modest, essentially undoing the effects of previous increases  since August.  Whether such an outcome is satisfactory, or how the Committee would  like to calibrate the Desk's response to additional information over the  intermeeting period, could depend on a weighing of the risks in the outlook.  Alternative B may not be sufficient to assure a satisfactory expansion of the  economy if the stock price decline does have a substantial impact on demand,  as in the staff forecast. As Mike has mentioned, that forecast, and in particular the pickup in activity the second half of the next year, depends in part on  an assumed further easing of policy, indexed by lower interest rates and more  rapid money growth than under alternative B especially if the unchanged conditions of that alternative were maintained well into next year. If the risks  were seen on this side, but the Committee did not want to ease until trends  were clearer, it could tilt the intermeeting adjustments in the directive in  the direction of ease. In this context, a failure of money to pick up substantially could be seen as adding to, or at least signalling, a shortfall in  the economy. If this were a concern, the Committee could indicate that in  judging the need for intermeeting adjustments the Desk should put a little  more emphasis on incoming money data, especially if it continued to come in  weaker than expected.  On the other hand, the effects of the recent dollar decline could be  seen as shifting the risks more to the inflation side. Especially if  the decline in the stock market did not seem to be having very marked effects  on domestic demand, slow money growth in this context would be needed to damp  domestic demand to reduce pressures on capacity and prices as the impact of  the lower-dollar showed through. Under these circumstances, the Committee  would not want to lean toward ease, and might need to consider the possibility  of tightening should the dollar decline seem to be gathering momentum.  With respect to the directive, the draft in the bluebook moves back  toward the standard language in use in recent years, but retains some sense of  the need for special flexibility. It is sufficiently general to fit most  choices the Committee might make about the strategy for implementation over  the coming period, except perhaps for either extreme that is, a complete and  immediate return to borrowing targeting, or a further and more permanent shift  to looking exclusively at federal funds rates. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	651	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, Mr. Kohn. What I would appreciate everyone doing in the process of expounding your views on policy is to first address the issue of whether or not we should be shifting to some other basis, in the context of our discussion yesterday. What I'd like to do is merely reiterate the four different options that were outlined yesterday and ask that as part of your exposition you stipulate where you would like to be in those various options. As you may remember, option (1) was to retain the current emphasis at least until markets calm further and borrowing behavior returns more to normal; (2) was to place even more emphasis on achieving a predetermined federal funds rate or a narrow range; (3) was to shift back toward more emphasis on achieving the borrowing objectives, but with greater flexibility and attention to the federal funds rate than before October 19th; and finally, (4) was for the Committee to return to the previous emphasis on borrowing and reserve pressure objectives. In the context of that, it also would be useful to indicate your general view on where you think the funds rate should be as well as the borrowing objective. Also, in expressing the borrowing objective, differentiate between the current borrowing levels, which are subnormal relative to the funds rate, and the normal borrowing levels so that, in the event the relationships started to return to normal, the Desk could make the appropriate adjustments in the context of the wishes of this Committee. At the moment, I would gather that the abnormal spread is approximately $100 million to $150 million. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	652	KOHN	 Yes, I think it is. I think it'd be fair to say that the normal borrowing for a funds rate of about 6-3/4 percent would be in the $400 million area. As we said in the Bluebook, we expect about $300 million after year-end, allowing for some downward shift, but not as much as we've been getting recently. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	653	GREENSPAN	 So you'd say it's a $100 million shift?  	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	654	KOHN	 After year-end. Right now I'd say it's probably closer to $200 million, but I'm guessing that some of that is saved up for year-end. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	655	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I have a question. If we specify what we want the level of the fed funds rate to be will that then go into the minutes? I'm assuming that if we come up with a fed funds level that it would be appropriate for that to be in the minutes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	656	GREENSPAN	 Well, it will depend, I think, on the answer to the first question. If it is the consensus of the Committee to target the funds rate--if we go with, say, either option (1) or (2)--then I think probably that's appropriate. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	657	ANGELL	 Okay. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	658	GREENSPAN	 If we go with option (3) or (4), I would suspect not. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	659	ANGELL	 I agree with you. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	660	JOHNSON	 How was it done last time? We went to a funds target last time. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	661	KOHN	 Well, we did it sort of by analogy with the borrowing. We never mentioned the borrowing specifically in the policy record. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	662	CORRIGAN	 It sounds like we didn't go quite as far as we apparently went, either. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	663	JOHNSON	 Yes, I agree. I didn't think we-- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	664	KOHN	 We didn't mention a specific funds rate. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	665	PARRY	 I think it would be a real mistake to indicate that we're following a funds target for the short term because I think it will really confuse the market, particularly if we intend to switch when things become more normal in a couple of weeks. I think handling it the way we did before is a better -- 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198712	666	GREENSPAN	 Well, I misspoke. I really meant if we did (2) . 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	667	PARRY	 Yes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	45.0
198712	668	GREENSPAN	 We actually did option (1) and we didn't put the funds rate [in the policy record]. So it's only if the Committee chooses option (2) that I think it will require that. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	669	ANGELL	 I wouldn't agree with that. If we do (1), it seems to me that we would have to report that in the minutes. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	670	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we do this. Let's actually see what evolves, and then we'll deal with it. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	671	ANGELL	 Okay. And then we'll look at that question.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	672	GREENSPAN	" Let me just open up by commenting that in listening to this discussion I was surprised, in a way, about the spread that exists between the Board members on the one hand and the presidents on the other. I suspect that's a short-term phenomenon because the real world is going to impinge on us very shortly and push us together. The trick is to figure out where. I must admit I'm somewhat surprised at the strength of the economy. You can see it in the orders and you can see it in the burgeoning capital goods markets, which in many respects have been getting less emphasis here than the retail sales figures because in one respect, it's pretty easy to forecast retail sales. They're going to be dull and the reason they're going to be dull is that the saving rate is very low and it's very difficult to come up with an optimistic scenario on retail sales no matter how you play the game. Fine tuning the Christmas selling season I find is a wonderful experience fraught with failure. The reason is that customers go to the best deal. Unlike the numbers for capital goods orders which, if you get a sample of five or six major capital goods producers in a particular industry no matter where they are in the country, would all look the same because they're arbitraged; retail sales don't arbitrage. You don't get the same retail sales pattern in Boise as you do in Atlanta and as a consequence, you need a very large sample. What all of the data suggest to me is that none of us has been able at any time in the pre- Christmas season to get enough of a sample to give us a really good judgment. I suspect no matter how Christmas comes out, it's going to surprise us, either plus or minus. And we really won't know what Christmas sales were until February, probably. In any event, I think we have to assume that the retail markets are dull and that basically nothing is going to happen there. The crucial issue is going to continue to be the basic plant and equipment numbers. It's becoming fairly obvious why the stock market has not had the effect that a lot of us were concerned it might. I guess the best way [to describe it] is to draw the analogy of the market going up 500 points in one day then going down 500 points the next day; it's unlikely to affect anybody's behavior. I think we're all aware of the fact that if we had had a 500 point drop back to levels of 5 years earlier, we would have had some really significant effect. But the issue is that we have wiped out a substantial amount of unrealized gains; what we were not aware of was that nothing was heavily committed; the extent of leveraging against the stock market gains was apparently really not all that large. I think that's the answer, but I must say at the moment that I feel uncomfortable with it. I still do not believe we are out of the woods on the market; I don't think all of the yield spreads have gotten back to where they were. All objective measures of stock market levels suggest that, if anything, we are still above normal and that we are vulnerable to a significant decline. Consequently, even though under normal circumstances I would say that in this type of environment we probably should be in something of a tightening mode, if rates go up under these conditions I suspect the stock market would go down, and I'm fearful of the extent of that particular decline. On the other side of this, I feel uncomfortable about the money supply figures mainly because, as Governor Kelley said, we don't know when the plumbing will be hooked back in and something could give at some point before we know it. More importantly, despite the 4-1/2 percent inflation rate, the debt levels, the aggregate levels, are all performing reasonably well now even though the Ms are all over the  place. If we take the inflation is in the pr one could argue--and I easing from here. But soft exchange rates, I huge holdings of dolla heavy central bank ace been other than a net ever had private holde effect would be a real down and that would cr sort of come out for a •72- oil price decline rea ocess of easing.

198712	682	GREENSPAN	 This is on the normal part. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	683	MELZER	 On the normal relationship. I would expect that to be associated with a 7 percent funds rate and I would be symmetrical in terms of the language. As to the other--I guess I should have done that first--I would favor alternative (4). I wouldn't go back to it abruptly; I think I'd use the year-end as a cover, but I would get back to that relatively promptly. I really don't know what (3) means. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0

198712	688	PARRY	" I would favor alternative (3) and probably would move in that direction after year-end. With regard to the alternatives, if I were to follow the analysis of my staff and that in the Greenbook, I think it would lead to a recommendation that monetary policy soon be eased in response to a significant expected slowing of the economy in the first half of next year and the accompanying declines in interest rates. However, to date, I haven't seen the signs of the negative effects of the stock market decline. Consequently, I would support alternative ""B"" with asymmetrical language providing us with the flexibility to ease before the next FOMC meeting should that become necessary. With regard to the specifics of the funds rate and the borrowing, I'm completely satisfied with the work that the staff has done in the Bluebook. It seems to me that the 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent funds rate is reasonable. In light of what we've seen with regard to the demand for borrowings, I also would accept their $300 million borrowing number, expecting that it probably would be below that between now and year-end. Conceivably, we could get to the $400 million level after that, but I don't know how fast. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0

198712	690	HELLER	" I'm essentially for ""B"" but a bit split as far as the timing is concerned, maybe along the lines that Bob Parry was just talking about. Through the year-end, and as long as the dollar is under pressure, I would stick to the fed funds rate at 6-3/4 percent. If the pressure on the dollar eases, and once we get through the choppy weather of the year-end, I would switch more towards a (3) type policy with emphasis on the borrowing again. I would be asymmetrical in the easing direction, too, so that might allow the fed funds rate to drop a bit. Probably a normal borrowing target of $300 million would be appropriate for that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	691	GREENSPAN	 Actually, that is three that would be consistent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

There's a chance that the markets are going to do something unusual. There will either be pressure or maybe a lot of excess reserves around, depending on how people position themselves. I don't think we want to sit there and work real hard to try to offset all that. But it seems to me to be a logical time, maybe an unavoidable time, to start. As I said, whether the borrowing that would be associated with that is $300 million or $400 million, I'm really not quite sure. I would start with the intention of keeping the federal funds rate roughly where it has been; but as the period develops, obviously, I wouldn't expect that it was going to stay there precisely. And I would prefer a symmetric directive. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198712	704	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	705	HOSKINS	" I guess I'd go with alternative ""B"", with some reluctance, over the concern about the aggregates and the continual downward revisions. That causes me some concern about going forward. Obviously, the optimism we see right now is related to some events that have already happened, if we believe in lags. So, I'm concerned about going forward. If we're going to look at an aggregate, I would try to pay a lot of attention to M2 and whether we're going to get the growth there or not. If we get continued shortfalls in that, then I'd be concerned more than I would be otherwise. I'd want to go with option (4) if we're going to use the announcement. I don't see any reason not to announce to the markets that we're making a change. We're sitting here looking for year-end cover and all that kind of thing; it seems to me we can get where we want to be very quickly with less misinformation or miscues by making an announcement. If we're  not going to do that, then I'd worry a little more about markets and go with option (3). "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198712	706	GREENSPAN	 Symmetrical? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	707	HOSKINS	 Symmetrical, and $400 million borrowing. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198712	708	GREENSPAN	 $400 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	709	HOSKINS	 That's as good a guess as I can come up with. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198712	710	GREENSPAN	 No funds rate? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	711	HOSKINS	 7 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198712	712	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	713	BOYKIN	" I would go with option (3) and begin the movement when it seems appropriate. I'd go with alternative ""B"" and probably a $300 million borrowing assumption. I would assume that it could be adjusted up the same way it was adjusted down in the interim between our meetings. And I would have symmetric language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198712	714	GREENSPAN	 Do you want to say anything about the funds rate? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	715	BOYKIN	 About where it is now. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198712	716	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	717	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, I would maintain our basic policy stance that's indicated by a federal funds rate centered on 6-3/4 percent. I think we ought to continue the present operating procedures for the period immediately ahead but I'd like to take advantage of some of these year-end pressures to allow the funds rate to begin to move around a bit more than it has. Then as we move into the new year, I'd like to go to alternative (3) whether or not there's an announcement effect, as indicated in Don's and Peter's memo. I guess that would call at that time for about $400 million in borrowing. I would keep the asymmetrical language unless we remove the sentence that says, ""still sensitive conditions in the financial markets."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198712	718	GREENSPAN	 So, you're saying you would stay with symmetrical or what? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	719	BLACK	 No, I'm saying I would keep it asymmetric, as it now is, unless we remove the reference to still sensitive conditions. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198712	720	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	721	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, I'd also be in favor of alternative ""B"". With regard to the other four alternatives, I kind of like all of them in proper order other than alternative (2) which I do not like. Certainly between now and the end of the year, I think it would be appropriate to keep current procedures in place until we are satisfied that we've come out of that particular adjustment period; then I would shift to alternative (3) but lean toward alternative (4).  Specifically, a fed funds between now and the end of the year at 6-3/4 to 6-7/8 percent would be appropriate, with a borrowing level not unlike what we have now. But I think as we come out of that year-end period, we would want to get back toward alternative (3) and then move from alternative (3) to alternative (4) with a borrowing level of about $400 million. I wouldn't necessarily want to judge a federal funds rate that would be appropriate for that borrowing level; I'd rather let the market determine what would be appropriate. In terms of the language, I would be in favor of symmetric language. But I'd also pick up on the same directive language that Bob Black mentioned with regard to sensitive market conditions. I think that phrase ought to be dropped and I would use symmetric language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198712	722	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	723	KELLEY	" Mr. Chairman, I like Si Keehn's concept of moving in the right order from (1) to (3) to (4). I would go to (3) after the first of the year, moving toward (4) later on. And I would encourage some sort of an announcement at a proper time. I favor alternative ""B"" with probably a $300 million borrowing target and asymmetric language on the easing side. I'd keep the funds rate about where it has been, calling that 6-3/4 percent, tending on the downside rather than the upside from there. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198712	724	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	725	SEGER	" Thinking back to the market reactions early in December when the fed funds rate passed 7 percent going north, I'm convinced that market participants are very sensitive to what happens to the fed funds rate on particular days. So, I would prefer, short- term anyway, to stick with option (1) which really watches the funds rate very carefully. If there's a decision to tighten that's one thing; but if there isn't, then I think the message that comes from a fed funds rate hitting 7 percent or higher is one of tightness and I'd be now very cautious about that. Eventually, I certainly would be willing to go (3) or even (4), but I don't think that now is the time to do it. And it may not even be the time to do it until we get to the February meeting. In terms of the choices facing us here, I guess I'm going to be a nonconformist and go with ""A"", which gives us a slight easing. I certainly hope that the exports stay very strong but I just feel that there is some risk there. Also, I remember how difficult it has been in the past to read consumption events and consumer behavior. It seems to me it was back in 1980, when I wasn't here but some of you may have been, when the credit controls were put on in March of 1980 because consumer demand was so terribly strong. Of course, later on we learned that we were already in a recession. And I think back in 1974 a similar thing happened when we handed out ""WIN"" buttons and that encouraged people to slice up their credit cards and so forth only to find again that we were already in the recession. So, I am really concerned about misreading the retail sales reports. We're all hearing different stories--some of strength, others of weakness. And consumption is a big chunk of GNP, as we all know; so I think there is some risk here. I also feel that maybe there's more of an inventory problem out there than we have yet identified. And I'm impressed with the fact that the inflation numbers look far better than any of us thought they would if we go back to our discussions in the spring or even in the summer. I think inflation psychology has simmered down. The Dick Hoey survey, which I  didn't believe then and probably shouldn't now, nevertheless, for those who follow it, does show some cut in the inflationary expectations going forward. So, I think that's good. I'm not a monetarist but I am paying close attention to what's happening to the reserves and the monetary aggregates; and I think that is something to be slightly concerned about. Having said all that, I would like to go with the modest easing identified as alternative ""A"". "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	726	GREENSPAN	 What's the borrowing with that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	727	SEGER	 Well, because of the sloppiness of the relationships, I'm not sure what that would be. I guess I would just concentrate on a fed funds rate of somewhere between 6-1/2 and 6-3/4 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	728	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	729	MORRIS	" Mr. Chairman, I think you're right that, at least temporarily, we're really locked into a no-change policy, which I would interpret as alternative ""B"". I would make the directive symmetric. With regard to operating procedures, I would stay with our current stance of trying to stabilize the funds rate over the next few weeks in the 6-3/4 - 6-7/8 percent area. But once the Desk has concluded that the year-end adjustment is over and the relationships appear to be moving back toward normality, I would move to option (4), our pre-October 19 operating procedure, with a borrowing level of $300 million. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198712	730	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	731	JOHNSON	" I would choose alternative ""A"", I think, if I weren't somewhat concerned about the potential effect on the exchange rate and the fragility of the financial markets right now. I still lean that way, but I guess I would be happy with something like alternative ""B"", with asymmetric language toward ease if events unfold in support of that. Like Frank Morris, I would prefer current operating procedures in terms of emphasizing the funds rate. So, I'd support alternative (1) until we see a stable relationship develop. Once we see that, I'm for going back to our old procedures. In other words, I'd stay with (1) and, when we are sure that we are back to a traditional relationship, go to (4). So, I'm at alternative ""B"", with the 6-3/4 - 6-7/8 percent range on the funds rate, and asymmetric language. I have no real borrowing number because I don't see how we can decide on that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	732	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	733	CORRIGAN	" I have a multitude of problems. My first problem is that, going back to the last meeting, I frankly did not realize, or did not fully appreciate at the time of the meeting, how far we seem to have gone in terms of an operating strategy that so narrowly pegs the federal funds rate, as indeed emerged over the period. It may be that I missed the nuances of the discussion, but I certainly didn't view policy quite in that strict light of literally resisting even one-eighth of a percentage point wiggles in the federal funds rate. As I said yesterday, that approach to policy, even on a very short-term basis, is one that I find very, very troubling. So, on the strategy question, I would favor going back to (4) as fast as  possible. I don't think I would condition that on a stable relationship because there has never been one and never will be one. The whole idea is that part of what we're providing is room for the market itself to play a role in the process. So, moving back to (4) promptly is something that I put some importance on. I don't want to beat a dead horse here, but it seems to me that doing so at year-end is the perfect way to do it. The Chairman could say in testimony or in the question and answer [session] at the end of this week that we expect, as always, some volatility or churning in the markets at year- end, so don't read any policy significance into it, because there's none there. In my judgment, that provides the easiest way to get back to (4), but I think that is your call, Mr. Chairman. If you prefer to do it otherwise, I could live with (3) over the next couple of weeks. But getting stuck on something like what current policy has turned out to be would be a very big mistake, I think. As far as the basic thrust of policy is concerned, were it not for the proximity to October 19th, I would actually favor tightening policy right now on the grounds that I regard the current exchange market situation as perilous. I recognize that there are risks on both sides. The exchange market could trigger a blowout in the stock market; or, the other way around, a blowout in the stock market could trigger a blowout in the exchange market. But what lies beneath both of those concerns, at least in my judgment, is a great deal of agnosticism or skepticism or cynicism about the thrust of United States economic policy in general. And I don't think that is going to go away very easily. However, I can't ignore October 19th, and I don't want to throw out the baby with the bath water, so I could live with an alternative ""B"" that would have borrowings, depending upon what we want to do with the strategy question, at $400 million, at least after the year-end. I would associate that with a federal funds rate roughly in the range of recent experience, but I would define recent experience in somewhat broader terms than an eighth-of-a-point spread. On the language of the directive, I have no trouble with a directive that is asymmetric toward easing in a context in which the pattern of economic statistics is distinctly weak. On the other hand, I would strongly favor a directive that is at least potentially asymmetric to tighten if we run into another rout in the exchange market. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	734	GREENSPAN	 That's basically symmetric. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	735	CORRIGAN	 Well, it's not because if the circumstances are not significant-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	736	ANGELL	 But, you could say it symmetrically both ways. You could say that if your weakness-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	737	GREENSPAN	 Well, I know [unintelligible]. In other words, it's not the list of items that we have to determine how we are going to behave; and we have both of those in the instructions. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	738	CORRIGAN	 The difference is that the only condition under which I would be willing to ease would be because of the economy itself. The ideal order [in the directive language is a problem]. In other words, I wouldn't be persuaded by--  	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	739	GREENSPAN	 I understand what you are saying. The only argument seems to be, I would assume, that everyone who was talking about symmetry would not have the same problem. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	740	ANGELL	 Do you want a tilt to tightness? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	741	GREENSPAN	 No, he doesn't. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	742	CORRIGAN	 No. The condition under which I would tilt to ease is only one and that is decisive weakness and evident weakness-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	743	GREENSPAN	 Evident weakness. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	744	ANGELL	 But all of us who favor symmetry would have that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	745	CORRIGAN	 No, that's not what this says. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	746	ANGELL	 Well, we can get the directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	747	GREENSPAN	 The directive says: depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchanges as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	748	CORRIGAN	 I've always interpreted that to mean you'd ease depending upon any one of those. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	749	ANGELL	 No. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	750	GREENSPAN	 Well, I've always interpreted it to mean that each individual who talked about asymmetry would be willing to tighten or ease depending on how any of those four behaved. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	751	ANGELL	 Correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	752	GREENSPAN	 I can't seriously believe that we'd all put the same weight on all those variables; it's inconceivable. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	753	CORRIGAN	 That's my point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	754	GREENSPAN	 Yes, I've always assumed that--unless I'm naive as a newcomer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	755	CORRIGAN	 I get hung up on the language, so let me stress the point that I'm trying to make. Under what conditions would I be willing to tighten? There are several conditions under which I would be willing to tighten: the exchange market or strong economic numbers or a buildup in inflation or-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	756	GREENSPAN	 But only one in which you would ease: the economy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	757	CORRIGAN	" But only one where I would be willing to ease. That's the distinction I'm trying to make. That's a long-winded ""B"".  "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	758	GREENSPAN	 I'm going to put you down as symmetric because that's the way I interpret it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	759	CORRIGAN	 Well, we'll see what the language says, 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	760	GREENSPAN	 Vice President Guynn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	761	GUYNN	 Basically, I favor no change in policy at this time, although I must confess that I have a nagging gut feeling that we could be in for a little disappointment in growth in 1988. Because of that, I have a very mild preference to tilt the directive very gently to suggest that we would ease more quickly than we would tighten. I don't profess, after one meeting, to know whether maintaining policy is $300 million to $400 million borrowing in normal times. I, too, would favor shifting back at the first opportune time to targeting borrowings rather than fed funds. If that can be accomplished around year-end, I would be in favor of that. I assume that would imply some tolerance of more fluctuations in the fed funds rate, but I would not want to let the fed funds rate gyrate to a great extent over year-end. We have a great deal invested in trying to keep things calm and stable; if that means stretching out the adjustment back to borrowings into next year, I'd be in favor of that. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	762	GREENSPAN	 I think that we're missing President Guffey. Do you want to give us a summary? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	763	GUFFEY	" Well, the summary would be very short. I would favor alternative ""B"", with a symmetric directive. With respect to the operating procedures, like several others, I would like to move to alternative (4) as quickly as possible. I'd do it under the cover of the year-end uncertainty. Alternative (3) has some attractiveness to me, but it seems to me that this Committee ought to be making the decisions rather than putting that burden upon you, Mr. Chairman, and Peter on a day-to-day basis. As a result, I think alternative (4) ultimately is where we should be. And with regard to alternative ""B"", I'd associate that with a federal funds rate in the range of 6-3/4 to 7 percent, with whatever borrowing is commensurate with that, which I assume would be around $350 million to $400 million. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198712	764	GREENSPAN	" As I add these numbers up, there's a majority for (3), and alternative ""B"" with $300 million borrowing seems to be prevalent. There's one alternative ""A"" and, in this type of analysis, I'd put that as asymmetric to ease, which makes four. So we come out with symmetric language on ""B"". We didn't specify the directive range on the funds rate but I would read that, to the extent that it's relevant, as 4 to 8 percent. Is that what we had? Do you read that pretty much the same? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	765	ANGELL	 Right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	766	GREENSPAN	 The language for the operational paragraph then reads: In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the degree of pressure on reserve positions. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	767	KOHN	 It should say the existing degree.  	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	768	BERNARD	 The existing-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	769	GREENSPAN	" Okay. Several individuals, but not all, raised the question about that ""still sensitive"" portion. In view of the fact that most did not, I infer that that was acceptable. Those of you that did not mention it and would prefer that that be deleted, I would appreciate your speaking up. If not, I will assume that the sentence remains as is. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	770	ANGELL	" We could take the ""still sensitive"" out and leave the ""uncertainties"" in. It seems to me you might leave in the reference that uncertainties may call for a special degree of flexibility; that would be consistent with (3) rather than (4). "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	771	GREENSPAN	 In what sense do you mean? The words still sensitive imply a bit more emphasis on certain fragilities. There are always uncertainties in the economic outlook. I don't think the word uncertainties captures it. It is saying something different. I inferred from what I was hearing that there was no objection to that remaining in, although a couple people did raise the question. I want to make certain that it wasn't inadvertence that-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	772	ANGELL	 Well, I didn't mention it and I would like it out. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	773	GREENSPAN	 Okay. Let's quickly run down the members of the Committee and poll on this. Just say in or out. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	774	BERNARD	 Vice Chairman Corrigan. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	775	CORRIGAN	 It's hard to answer that question without knowing what else is going to be in. I guess I'd say out. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	776	BERNARD	 President Boehne In President Boykin In Governor Heller In Governor Johnson In President Keehn Out Governor Kelley In Governor Seger In President Stern In 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	777	GREENSPAN	" Well, the ""Ins"" clearly have it. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	778	ANGELL	 You were correct, Mr. Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	779	GREENSPAN	" One never knows. [The language would read]: ""The Committee recognizes that still sensitive conditions in financial markets and uncertainties in the economic outlook may continue to call for a special degree of flexibility in open market operations. Taking account of conditions in financial markets""--I would tentatively read that as ""somewhat lesser reserve restraint would or somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable depending on the strength of the business expansion, indications of inflationary pressures, developments in foreign exchange markets, as well as the behavior of the monetary aggregates. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and  M3 over the period from November through March at annual rates of about--"" What are we using for these? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	780	KOHN	 About 5 and 6 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	781	GREENSPAN	" ""5 and 6 percent, respectively. Over the same period, growth in Ml is expected to remain relatively limited. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	782	SEGER	 But is that really what's going on? We put this broad range in there and it sounds-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	783	GREENSPAN	 We have that question at virtually every meeting. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	784	SEGER	 Oh, I know that. For 3-1/2 years I've-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	785	GREENSPAN	 If we were targeting federal funds, I would say that would be irrelevant. The trouble is that in this context everyone is used to that language and I'm not sure they take it very seriously any more. If we were to change it, it might be a slippery thing. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	786	SEGER	 I was just wondering whether there couldn't be some way to suggest that there might be situations where consultations would be helpful even if the fed funds rate were in the range. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	787	GREENSPAN	 I think that's generally implicit, Governor. If such a situation arises, I think the Chairman would call-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	788	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, if we're going to (3), and that does involve a transition, it seems to me that we do not know at this point how the $300 million on borrowing that we've specified will turn out. Would it be appropriate for a telephone conference call to take place at the first of the year to get a better feel of that so that we would not have eased inadvertently in going to that number. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	789	GREENSPAN	 Well, (3) itself has language in it that provides for increasing flexibility on the borrowing level, as I read it. Is that correct? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	790	KOHN	 Well, increasing flexibility around the funds rate 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	791	GREENSPAN	 Using a borrowing objective' 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	792	KOHN	 Right. It does still suggest that the Desk would be attempting to hit the borrowing number but would be willing to adjust if it looked like the relationship were way out of whack. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	793	ANGELL	 In other words, if the fed funds rate were moving down decidedly, you might not pursue the borrowing objective as precisely as you did before October 19?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	794	KOHN	 Well, as the Manager saw that that was consistent with market conditions-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	795	ANGELL	 But you would be pursuing the borrowing as your primary operating strategy? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	796	KOHN	 I see (3) as moving in that direction. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	797	ANGELL	 Yes. Now, my question relates to the transition from where we are to that. If the transition entails an acceptance of $300 million of borrowing and that turns out to be easier than we thought, would it be appropriate for us to have a conference call? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	798	GREENSPAN	 I think it probably would. Even though we have what seems to be relatively firm language here, we are in an environment in which the potential volatility that exists is far greater than normal. And I think it is incumbent upon us to seek guidance from the Committee if something rather different than what is currently in the economic environment or the financial environment begins to emerge. It's quite possible that when we get into the beginning of the year things will look different. If so, I would say that some sort of consultation would be desirable and advisable. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	799	MELZER	 Could I ask a question? I had a similar question last time. How will the policy record reflect what happened here? I think some people interpret the $300 million as kind of where we were and as no change in policy; others interpret it as a change in policy in that we're moving the borrowing target down from $400 million to $300 million, albeit under that flexibility arrangement. If somebody reads the policy record next time and the directive talks about the existing degree of reserve restraint, where does it get memorialized that the degree of reserve restraint was changed, if in fact it was? How will that be read? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198712	800	GREENSPAN	 Well, it really wasn't changed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	801	ANGELL	 No, it hasn't been changed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	802	GREENSPAN	 It wasn't changed, but the particular borrowing objective number came about largely because as the Desk read the directive in conjunction with our appraisal, which was pretty much the same--although I guess it's different from Jerry's--the emphasis was on the funds rate and secondarily on the borrowing target. Thus, when the divergence occurred, we stayed with the funds rate as distinct from the borrowing target. But in no way was the Desk trying to [unintelligible] what was inferred and was the directive of this Committee as the extent of pressure in the markets. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	803	CORRIGAN	 Leaving that aside for a minute, I interpret the combination of a consensus for number (3) and the consensus to leave in that second sentence on still sensitive conditions in the context of your remarks still to be consistent with an operating strategy (3) and a prompt move to (4). That, in turn, means that before we get to $400 million on borrowing we are not, even in the next couple of days or weeks, slavishly seeking a federal funds rate of 6-3/4 or 6-7/8 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	804	GREENSPAN	 Well done.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	805	CORRIGAN	 Pardon me? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	806	GREENSPAN	 What you're saying [unintelligible]. That's correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	807	CORRIGAN	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	808	MELZER	 What would be the equilibrium borrowing assumption? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198712	809	GREENSPAN	 Let me put it this way: If the relationship between the funds rate and borrowing objectives goes back to where it was, I would interpret this to mean $400 million, not $300 million. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	810	ANGELL	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	811	MELZER	 Fine. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198712	812	HELLER	 Then borrowing at $400 million could be associated with fed funds trading above 6-3/4 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	813	CORRIGAN	 If it worked the way we thought it would work, that would not be the result. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	814	HELLER	 It would not be the case. Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	815	SEGER	 What if it does come to that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	816	ANGELL	 Well, it does; and if it goes below it, it goes below. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	817	HELLER	 Well, there was quite a consensus, though not a total consensus, for symmetry; there was a very substantial minority that was asymmetrical toward easing. Implicit in that view was [an understanding] that the fed funds rate would come down from the 6-3/4 percent level rather than go up as we move to a borrowing target. That was implicit, at least in my mind. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	818	ANGELL	 That wasn't a majority though, was it? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	819	HELLER	 No, but which way are you moving? As you get up to the 6-3/4 percent and you move to a borrowing target we all figure that the 6-3/4 percent is associated roughly with $300 million, right? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	820	GREENSPAN	 Currently. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	821	HELLER	 Currently. And, as you move toward the $300 million-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198712	822	ANGELL	 Let me ask a question. I thought we had assumed it to be $300 million before the end of the year, but would assume it to be maybe $400 million after the end of the year. Is that right, Don? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	823	KOHN	 No, I don't think so, Governor Angell. Peter and I had extensive conversations on this, I would add, and we were equally uncertain about it. But our presumption was that some, but  not all, of the reluctance to borrow would go away because we still would have a sensitive economic environment. We would have the Bank of Boston situation and a lot of things going on which might make banks a little reluctant to be seen at the discount window. So, our presumption was that $200 million was more appropriate now and that would rise to $300 million after the end of the year; but there would still be a margin below the $400 million. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	824	ANGELL	 Well, I think Tom Melzer has a very good point: that the FOMC has not voted at any time to take an easing step and we ought not to get a translation of this into an easing step without a vote to ease. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	825	GREENSPAN	 Let me put it this way. I think you're correct in raising the issue. If the issue becomes ambiguous and if, in fact, Peter and Don are wrong about the judgment as to where the relationship between borrowings and funds would be at the end of the year, in order to make a judgment with respect to how it is played then I think it would be advisable to come back to the Committee for a judgment at that point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	826	CORRIGAN	 Good. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	827	STERNLIGHT	 Just a footnote on Don's comment: If it turns out that a number of banks borrow on December 31, on that long weekend, that could throw the borrowing number for that particular period into-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	828	GREENSPAN	 Let me put it this way: I will stipulate further that the judgment as to whether that is happening is yours. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	829	MELZER	 He likes you too, Peter. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198712	830	GREENSPAN	 Today--oh, yes, a good point. In this context, how do you read the issue you raised about-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	831	ANGELL	 I feel satisfied that with the $300 million to $400 million that we not go through the process of mentioning it in the minutes. I would not have felt satisfied before because there are people in the market who do read these minutes on a belated basis very carefully, and I would feel a responsibility that if we ever make such a move that we should let the markets know. I believe the markets work best when people have accurate information. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	832	JOHNSON	 If we make it into what? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	833	GUFFEY	 Well, this number doesn't appear in the policy record or the directive; it's not in either one. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198712	834	MELZER	 No, but the language on reserve restraint-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198712	835	GUFFEY	 Yes, but it only talks about the level of the borrowing target. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198712	836	ANGELL	 No, I feel satisfied that it's not the end under this specification.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	837	GREENSPAN	 Peter is [unintelligible] this. Can we get a vote on the directive? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	838	CORRIGAN	 Can I just ask one other question? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	839	GREENSPAN	 Go ahead. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	840	CORRIGAN	 I want to come back to this dollar business--not that it's necessarily directly relevant to the vote, but let me raise the question anyway. In the circumstances that we face right now we literally have risks all over the table. And everybody is talking about this. There are very few things that we can influence directly, but I continue to be deeply concerned about our ability to have any constructive influence on any of this so long as it is perceived to be the policy of the Federal Reserve on the one hand and the United States Government on the other hand to be indifferent, to the point of embarrassment almost, about the exchange rate in the circumstances that we face right now. If there is anything that can be done--through G-7, G-5, G-10, or any other mechanism available--to try to stabilize that situation, that is something I want to be strongly associated with. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	841	GREENSPAN	 What specifically do you have in mind? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	842	CORRIGAN	 Do you mean if I had my druthers? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	843	GREENSPAN	 No. What I'm trying to ask is: Do you mean some joint venture by the G-7 in which the basic purpose is in that direction? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	844	CORRIGAN	 That's correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	845	ANGELL	 Do you mean specifically the use of monetary policy to add to exchange rate stability? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	846	CORRIGAN	 That was the point I was making before. That's implicit here under certain circumstances, but I don't think that's enough. I think what is needed is going to have to go beyond that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	847	SEGER	 Are you talking about a discount rate hike? I'm a little confused. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	848	CORRIGAN	 No. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	849	JOHNSON	 No, Jerry's talking about fiscal policy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	850	SEGER	 I thought you meant monetary policy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198712	851	CORRIGAN	 I'm also saying that I do think there are things that can be done in the G-7 context that would be compatible with that objective. And unless, or until, there is some movement in that direction, the risks that we are running in terms of these massive unfunded liabilities constitute, in my view, the largest single risk of the many risks that are in front of us right now. And if push comes to shove, whether it's monetary policy or not, the answer is going to come in the form of higher interest rates with or  without monetary policy. What I'm trying to avoid is getting there the hard way. There's no choice here. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	852	JOHNSON	 You say unfunded liabilities. I agree that they are unfunded to the extent that they're financing the deficit for consumption purposes. They're not unfunded if they're private sector investments; they are funded. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	853	CORRIGAN	 Prospectively, they're unfunded. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	854	JOHNSON	 If there's a rate of return included in the interest rate it's not unfunded. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198712	855	GREENSPAN	 Let me ask you this: Is this relevant to the vote that we're-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	856	CORRIGAN	 It's relevant to my reservations about the vote, yes. Even though I have to vote-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	857	ANGELL	 You're just talking about what the minutes say then? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	858	CORRIGAN	 No, I'm-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	859	ANGELL	 You're not talking about the minutes? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	860	CORRIGAN	 I don't care about the minutes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	861	ANGELL	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198712	862	GREENSPAN	 The reason I asked is that we can have a formal discussion on this if you want. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	863	CORRIGAN	 Fine. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198712	864	GREENSPAN	 Let's vote. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198712	865	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Boehne Yes President Boykin Yes Governor Heller Yes Governor Johnson No President Keehn Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor Seger No President Stern Yes 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198712	866	GREENSPAN	 Do you want to reopen this? 	23	23	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	867	CORRIGAN	 Well, as I see it, we're on a tightrope and I'm at the point where I think that a real effort should be made to try to stabilize the exchange market. By that I mean that the dollar has gone down enough. What policy tools are available to do that? The problem is damn few. We're not going to get anything more on the fiscal side or elsewhere. We could tighten monetary  policy, including raising the discount rate, but that entails all these risks in terms of both the real and the financial sides of the economy. Or we could try to paste together some kind of a Louvre II agreement backed up perhaps by using swaps or some foreign currency borrowings. But I'm dubious that that by itself, without some kind of policy initiative, would be convincing. On the other side of the coin, if the skepticism about policy continues and if we have a renewed run on the dollar, it seems to me that that's going to produce precisely the kinds of things that we're all so afraid of, including a further break in the stock market. And that's the dilemma. But in order to solve that dilemma, there has to be some movement someplace. And I ask where? And this is the thrust of my argument: that at this point some of that movement has to come from the United States. As I said, there are several ways to do it; but with the vulnerabilities that I see right now, it is a very high-risk approach and I don't like it. I think it's very dangerous. 	23	23	0.0	1.0	31.0
198712	868	ANGELL	 I would like to associate myself, as you probably understand, with the remarks that Vice Chairman Corrigan just made. I believe it's a high-risk approach. And I also believe that a very clear-cut policy on the part of the United States Government and the Federal Reserve would not require as much interest rate cost as we otherwise will have to bear. It would be more consistent with lower interest rates and faster money growth than our ignoring the exchange value of the dollar. 	23	23	0.0	1.0	43.0
198712	869	GREENSPAN	 Does anyone else want to address this issue? 	23	23	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	870	JOHNSON	 There's not enough time. 	23	23	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	871	GREENSPAN	 If not, I just want to confirm that the next meeting date is February 9 and 10. I will entertain a motion to adjourn. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198712	872	JOHNSON	 I so move. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	44.0
198712	873	SEGER	 I second it. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	40.0
198712	874	GREENSPAN	 No objection. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
