198809	8	CROSS	 At the time of the August FOMC meeting, the.dollar was  still under strong upward pressure. Reports on United States economic  activity indicated that our economy was growing strongly, and  market participants were of the view that the Federal Reserve  would take additional measures to counter any buildup in  inflationary pressures. The prospects of high United States interest  rates and favorable differentials prompted good investor and  commercial demand for dollars and encouraged traders to bid the  dollar higher. Thus, when you last met, the dollar had risen by  about 14 percent against the mark from the levels of late spring.  Our exchange rate was proving to be extremely resilient, and the  dollar seemed poised to move even higher in the short term.  In response to these upward pressures, the United States and  other monetary authorities intervened actively. On our part, we  sold around $1.3 billion between August 17 and August 23, the  first week after the last FOMC meeting. The Bundesbank at the  same time sold in active intervention (plus  in rechannelling) and other central banks'  coordinated sales totaled more than $600 million. The market was  impressed by the degree of coordination among the central banks,  and the operations appeared to send a clear signal to the market  that the authorities would see a higher dollar as a potential  threat to the adjustment process. The peak for the dollar  against the mark during the period was reached on August 22, when  it rose to just over DM 1.92.  In late August, however, the dollar's upward momentum  either ended or at least stalled. The market became wary about  trying to push the dollar higher in light of the increasingly  active intervention operations and the fact that these operations  were reinforced by official commentary both here and abroad  expressing dissatisfaction with any higher levels of the dollar  against the mark. Then, in an important move on August 25,  several European central banks acted to raise their official  interest rates, an action which promised to narrow those  differentials which had helped to support the dollar throughout  the recent period. Although these European interest rate  increases were in part prompted by domestic considerations, the  markets saw the moves as clearly aimed at supporting the European  currencies. In the case of Germany, the increase in the discount  rate was accompanied by a strong statement from Bundesbank  President Poehl promising to do whatever was needed to support  the mark exchange rate, in terms of intervention and policy  moves, and to show they were serious, the Bundesbank immediately  and forcefully sold within three-quarters of an hour  right after Poehl's statement.  In these circumstances, the upward pressures on the  dollar eased, and eased further as economic data from the United  States suggested that the economy might be growing at a less  rapid and more sustainable pace than had been thought before.  This view was reinforced by the release of employment data in  early September which showed a slower growth in employment and  less pressure on wages than the market had previously  anticipated, and which led to an easing of the exchange rate.  The dollar has shown a smaller rise against the yen in  recent months than against the European currencies. Thus, over  the course of the summer the yen strengthened against the mark  and its associated continental currencies, even though the  Germans acted much more forcefully to support their currency  through intervention and through increases in official interest  rates. In part, this difference seems to reflect a market view  that Japan has adapted more- successfully than others to the rise  in its currency over the past several years and also a feeling  that over time a stronger yen is inevitable given the structure  of the world economy and the widespread belief that Japan must  undertake a large share of the needed international adjustment.  By early September the dollar had eased back from its  highs against both the mark and the yen, and had started to trade  in relatively calm markets. There was no United States intervention in  the three-week period after August 23. Economic statistics  released here and abroad during that period did not seem to point  to a need for significant policy shifts. The dollar traded  within a relatively narrow range throughout much of September.  Last Wednesday it threatened to push above this trading range  when the market received the favorable news of the smaller than  expected United States trade deficit during July. News that the trade  adjustment was continuing led some market participants to bid the  dollar up sharply. In order to show a continued presence and  concern, the Desk intervened on the day of the announcement after  the dollar popped up by several pfennings and approached levels  at which we had seen intervening before. We did not enlist a  cooperative effort for the intervention at that time; we  intervened alone and not aggressively, and sold a relatively  modest $130 million against marks. Since then, the dollar has  been trading comfortably and relatively quietly, around the  middle of its trading range. I think market participants have a  sense that the factors that were causing the upward pressure  earlier are now much less evident; also that the central banks  are committed to fostering stability and will seek to limit any  major rate change by intervention and policy moves.  I would like to seek your approval for the sale of $718  million against marks, which is the Federal Reserve's share of  the intervention activity during the intermeeting period. In  other operations, the Desk bought $32.1 million equivalent of  Japanese yen from customers on behalf of the Federal Reserve to  augment yen reserves. The Desk also purchased $500 million  equivalent of Japanese yen from for the  Treasury and half of that amount was later purchased by the  Federal Reserve.  A further $1 billion of yen will be purchased from  in two installments, this month and  next month, and one half of  that will also be taken by the Federal Reserve. I would further  like to report that the Bank of Mexico repaid all of its  outstanding obligations under the swap agreements with the United States  Treasury and the Federal Reserve, repaying the full amount of  $700 million to the Federal Reserve and $300 million to the United States  Treasury. The Central Bank of Brazil repaid $232.5 million of  its swap agreement with the United States Treasury on August 26. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

198809	13	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Mr. Sternlight, would you bring us up to date on domestic open market operations? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198809	14	STERNLIGHT	" Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Domestic Desk operations saw relatively smooth sailing  since the last meeting of the Committee. Intended reserve  pressures remained unchanged, with the borrowing allowance  holding at $600 million, and actual borrowings came in very close  to that level. Individual weeks were no more than $50 million  off the mark and two-week averages were even closer, setting a  standard we probably can't maintain. The associated expectation  for Federal funds trading was a range of 8 to 8-1/4 percent, and  here, too, actual experience fell into a very tight band perhaps  too tight a band, lest it foster unrealistic expectations with  statement period averages clustered within a few basis points of  8-1/8 percent. Market sentiment did undergo some shift, though,  as business news starting with the August employment report on  September 2, tended a bit to the softer side. This led market  participants to back away from anticipations of immediate further  policy tightening moves and caused most yields to decline  somewhat. Still, the prevailing underlying sentiment seemed to  be that the economy remained strong, the inflationary threat was  still there, and restraining moves were still likely to be  needed, albeit with some delay. Monetary growth, meantime, was  moderate over the period, with the M2 and M3 measures running a  shade below the June-September pace specified by the Committee,  and Ml slowing sharply in August and early September after a  strong gain in July.  Reserve needs were moderate through most of the period,  and were met largely through repurchase agreements. A few  occasions of over-abundant reserves were handled through matched  sale-purchase transactions in the market. Ordinarily, greater  and more durable reserve needs would be showing up at this time  of year, but in part the need has been met by the System's  foreign currency acquisitions both from occasional market  intervention and from some special transactions arranged with  foreign monetary authorities. Moreover, the subdued growth of  money, especially transaction balances, meant that required  reserves showed little change. A greater reserve need has  developed in the last few days, though, accentuated by the post-  tax-date rise in Treasury balances at the Fed, and this has  caused us to buy some bills outright from foreign accounts (about  $1.2 billion from just after Labor Day through yesterday), and to  arrange larger injections of reserves through repurchase  agreements. The large reserve need is seen as abating quite  abruptly once we get into October, however, so we have not  undertaken the sizable outright purchases in the market that  often have come at this time in past years.  In the early part of the period, interest rates showed  no pronounced trend. Activity was quite light, reflecting both  seasonal slack and investor caution in the face of reports that  mainly seemed to emphasize strong expansionary momentum in the  economy. In part, the market reacted day-to-day to small moves  in the dollar, mainly showing strength, but falling back when the  dollar weakened after a series of foreign rate increases on  August 25. The August United States employment report, released just  before the Labor Day weekend, suggested a blunting of the  economy's momentum, with a sizable downward revision of nonfarm  jobs in July, an August job gain that was moderate by recent  standards, a decline in hours worked and virtually no change in  hourly earnings. These data produced a one-day burst of demand  for securities that encountered thin street supplies and caused  prices to jump nearly three points on the day. Subsequently,  demand abated but prices essentially held their higher ground in  light of two-way trading, as profit taking was offset by some  fresh demand in response to other indications of more moderate  expansion or slackened inflationary push. After the employment  report, participants eagerly awaited the July trade data released  September 14. This report also lifted prices, as the market took  heart from the smaller deficit and especially the big drop in  imports, but the market impact was soon muted by a rise in oil  prices after big declines earlier, and by somewhat stronger than  expected reports on industrial production.  For the whole period, yields on most Treasury coupon  issues declined by about 25 to 45 basis points, with the larger  declines in the longer maturities. This left the 30-year bond  yield in the neighborhood of 9 percent. This morning it is about 9.06 percent. The Treasury added about $6-1/2 billion in coupon-  bearing debt over the period. One factor that may have added to  demand at the longer end is the recently increased amount of  coupon stripping. Foreign demand was said to be quite good for  stripped issues. A lingering uncertainty throughout the period  has been the fate of the Treasury's long-bond authority. Pending  bills to provide technical adjustments to recent tax legislation  would remove the 4-1/4 percent rate ceiling on bonds that has  hobbled Treasury financing efforts for many years, but there is  no consensus on whether the Congress will get to this legislation  in the few weeks remaining before adjournment of the current  session. If they don't get to it now, it could well keep the  Treasury out of the bond market until next May.  In the Treasury bill market, rate changes were mixed  over the period, with longer maturities down slightly but shorter  issues notably the three-month area up about 15 basis points.  The rise in short bill rates reflected a changing balance of  supply and demand. After an extended period of paying down  bills despite the large deficits the Treasury has been adding  to weekly bill issuance this past summer. Also, some short-term  cash management bills were sold in late August. In all, total  bill supplies were increased by about $15 billion over the  period. Meantime, with the dollar remaining fairly strong there  were occasional sales of bills by foreign central banks  supporting their currencies. In yesterday's auctions of three""  and six-month bills the average rates were 7.17 and 7.34 percent  respectively, compared with 7.05 and 7.51 percent at mid-August.  Turning briefly to the market in securities of  federally sponsored agencies, particularly those related to the  thrift institutions, the recent period was perhaps notable for  the absence of any significant change in spreads over Treasury  issues, which some observers might have looked for given the  growing perception of the size of the thrift problems. Federal  Home Loan Bank and FICO issues retained their spread  relationships to Treasury issues as investors and dealers  apparently consider these securities ultimately to have some  degree of Federal Government backing however hard it is to pin  down precisely to the satisfaction of lawyers and accountants.  Yet another area that might have been jolted in the  recent period was that of high-yield or ""junk"" bonds. The long  expected SEC charges against Drexel Burnham and several of its  key employees have been received fairly calmly in good part, I  believe, because the firm is perceived to be financially strong  and able to weather a tough and lengthy fight. There is also the  feeling, to be sure, that if Government charges can be proven it  will have a very severe impact on the firm but that could be a  long way off, and the outcome is considered quite uncertain.  As to what the market looks for now from the economy  and from monetary policy, I think the preponderant expectation is  for further expansion and greater inflationary pressure, but with  some recent respite of pace seen as calling for no immediate  policy move. Most observers expect that, when changes do come,  they will continue on the restraining side. "	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198809	15	GREENSPAN	 Any questions for Mr. Sternlight? If not, I'll entertain a motion for approval of the actions of the Desk since August the 16th. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198809	16	SPEAKER	 So moved. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198809	17	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. Now we'll go to the economic situation, Mr. Prell. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	18	PRELL	 Thank you. I can be relatively brief, Mr. Chairman, for the incoming  information since the last meeting has not caused us to make any  substantial changes in our forecast.  In the Greenbook write-up, we emphasized that we had relatively  few new data, and that those we did have had been so volatile that it was  almost impossible to extract the signal from the noise. However, we did  feel we should trim a bit off of GNP growth in the current quarter, largely  on the basis of the weaker than expected labor market report for August,  which showed a sharp drop in production worker hours and a rise in the  unemployment rate.  Since the Greenbook forecast was completed, we have received a few  more pieces of data   most notably those on merchandise trade and retail  sales. The trade release showed an even sharper decline in the deficit in  July than we had expected, but from an upward revised June level. In  contrast, the retail sales release showed a softer July-August picture than  we had anticipated, after a strong, upward revised June gain. All told,  and with due allowance for the statistical reliability of these monthly  figures, we would not be inclined to change our forecast appreciably at  this point.  As we see it, the basic story is that the nonfarm economy probably  is starting to decelerate from the strong pace of the first half. However,  it does not appear likely that growth will move below the 2-1/2 percent  trend of potential output until early next year. And, absent some  unanticipated development in the next couple of quarters   for example,  the emergence of a significant inventory overhang   it appears to us that  interest rates will have to rise further in order to hold nonfarm output  growth below 2-1/2 percent through next year. Otherwise, strong   though  slowing   export demand, and the attendant buoyancy of domestic capital  spending, might well keep the economy moving along at a pace that would  maintain or increase the pressures on productive resources.  As I noted last month, if we were to change our monetary policy  assumption and hold the federal funds rate at the present level, rather  than allowing it to move into the 9 to 10 percent range, we would project  that the unemployment rate would fall next year to something like 5-1/4  percent. He think that would bring substantial inflationary pressure.  As it is, with the jobless rate running in the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4  percent area over the next year or so, we believe it likely that wage and  price inflation trends will be edging higher. Unfortunately, the recent  data on wages and prices haven't done much to illuminate the degree of  inflationary pressure implied by current levels of resource utilization.  The increase of but 0.1 percent in the hourly earnings index for August was  in striking contrast to the recent pattern, but it is too early to declare  an end to the upward trend in the rate of increase for this measure.  Rather, we view the August number as a source of reassurance that we are  correct in projecting a much milder pickup in wages over the projection  period than historical patterns might suggest is in prospect.  On the price side, the latest numbers have been buffeted by  gyrations in food and energy prices. Excluding food and energy, the  producer price index rose 0.3 percent in August after increasing 0.6  percent in July, and the trend in this measure of inflation clearly is  still up. The July CPI, ex. food and energy, was up 0.3 percent after  rising 0.4 percent in June, and the trend for this measure has been  essentially flat since late last year, at around 4-1/2 percent.  The incoming evidence, however, has caused us to raise our near-  term forecast of food prices. We had expected a fairly prompt response to  the drought   indeed, prompter than most outside forecasters. But the big  jump in food prices in the July CPI, in particular, has led us to increase  our projection noticeably in the current quarter. Assuming better supplies  of grains, fruits, and vegetables next year, however, we have food price  inflation slowing more now over the course of 1989.  For energy, the outlook obviously is extremely uncertain, with  great dispute about the implications of the Iraq-Iran cease-fire. We've  lowered our oil price path in light of recent market developments, but we  recognize the possibility of decidedly lower or higher prices than the  $15.50 average that we've built in for oil imports in 1989. A deviation of  $5 per barrel from that level might mean a difference of 3/4 percent in CPI  inflation next year, factoring in both direct and indirect effects. But  while a drop in the oil price would, in effect, shift the short-run  Phillips curve in a favorable direction, that shift would not be permanent.  Unless resource utilization were lowered, as in our current forecast,  inflation would tend to reaccelerate in 1990. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	19	PRELL	 I might note that this morning the Commerce Department released revised second-quarter GNP figures where the second-quarter growth rate was revised down from 3.3 to 3.0 percent.  That would still leave, after the drought effects, growth in the nonfarm economy in excess of 3-1/2 percent in the first half. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	20	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Questions for Mr. Prell? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	21	BLACK	 Mike, could you give us some of the details of the revision in GNP, including the deflator and the fixed-weight deflator. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198809	22	PRELL	 Sure. Both the deflator and the fixed-weight price index were revised upward. The fixed-weight price measure was raised from a 4.7 percent to a 5.0 percent increase. The deflator largely reflected this; it was up from 5.1 to 5.5 percent. It's a little bit of an unfavorable mix shift. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	23	GREENSPAN	 What was the composition of the change in the fixed-weight? What additional information did they have? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	24	STOCKTON	 It appears that most of the upward revision of the fixed-weight index occurred in the service category. That's an area where, in addition to using some information from the CPI, they also bring to bear additional information. For instance, they use wage rates of hospital workers to help estimate the medical care costs and information they're getting from the banking industry to estimate banking margins. So they do get some additional information in addition to the CPI. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	25	GREENSPAN	 That's a rather large increase for a second shot at the fixed-weight. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	26	PRELL	 We don't have the full detail yet, and we haven't had a chance to talk to people about enough of the details. We're flying a bit blind at this point. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	27	BLACK	 Do you know which components of GNP were revised down? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	7.0
198809	28	PRELL	 Yes. There were, of course, small revisions in c number of categories. The most dramatic revision in growth rate was in nonresidential structures. As we had noted in the Greenbook, the construction-put-in-place showed a substantial revision in June. So this isn't a shock. There was a modest upward revision in consumer spending. There was a small change in net exports. There were just small changes sprinkled around. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	29	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	30	PARRY	 I have a question about your forecast of net exports. There's a very substantial improvement in the net exports over the period. I get the impression that if one were just to look at the model forecast, assuming a relatively moderate decline in the value of the dollar, that you wouldn't get that significant an improvement. Am I correct in assuming that your forecast has a large judgmental component; and if so, is that sort of the opposite of what we saw when the dollar was going down? When the dollar was going down, the model predicted a more quick response in terms of net exports. Now that the dollar has gone up, are we assuming that has a  delayed response as well--in terms of slowing the improvement in net exports? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198809	31	TRUMAN	 There's only two things to say about the model over the forecast period. One is that in talking about trade these days, we have found that you have to sort out the effects of business machinery on both the import and export sides. On the export side in the model, we may be slightly more--well, actually, not even that much more--optimistic than the models we use. Taking the second quarter as a base, we have improvement of $40 billion in the volume of non- agricultural, non-business machine exports; and the model that we use has just improvement of $36 billion. So, the order of magnitude is quite small on that side and I think it's roughly the same on the non¬ petroleum volume. It's about the same in terms of the changes that we produce. The other thing that's going on is that, starting from the second quarter of 1989, you get improvement on the volume side in the agricultural exports--which gives you a boost in this period when we total these figures. That's a special factor. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	32	PARRY	 So you don't know. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198809	33	TRUMAN	 We don't have a lot of optimism. In part, the optimism that we have is built into the level that has been associated with the first half of this year. We have to acknowledge that perhaps the first half has performed better than the models would produce for the year. And we had chosen not to take [unintelligible]. In that sense you have maybe more of a catch up with the [unintelligible] the first half of the year. To say one more thing: On the import side, we have increasingly tried to relate business machinery, which is quantitatively very important in GNP terms, to the forecast for business fixed investment in general. So that's driven in large part by that forecast and our assessment of a large portion of that [unintelligible] is sort of how the world markets for computers seem to be developing. [unintelligible] 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	34	PARRY	 Yes, thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198809	35	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	36	HOSKINS	 Let me just follow up on Bob's questions. Since the last forecast session, many of the major economies in the world have had upward revisions in their real growth forecast for the rest of this year and also for 1989. I'm wondering, how do you factor that into your export numbers? Or did you? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198809	37	TRUMAN	 Well, we didn't. The official forecasts have been revised up; they lagged way behind the data. We have not changed our forecast. In fact, this morning the Japanese GNP number came out for the second quarter, which shows a decline of 3.9 percent at an annual rate; That is largely statistical. We had built in a decline of 2 percent at an annual rate. So that's a [unintelligible]. Our sense is that, if anything--although we have about the same outlook over the six quarters of the forecast--it is at a materially subdued rate relative to what we've seen. And that's largely because we have a tighter monetary policy picture for most of these countries, and most of the countries are moving in the direction of fiscal restraint. Germany, the UK, and Japan are basically moving in the direction of  fiscal restraint over the forecast period. And then you have that tightening monetary policy move. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	38	HOSKINS	 Mike, could you refresh me on what the interest rate increase is--the assumption based on your forecast. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
198809	39	PRELL	 We still have the federal funds rate rising to something in the vicinity of 9-1/2 percent by next spring. We have the long Treasury bond rate moving a bit above 10 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	40	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	41	MORRIS	 I have a question for Mr. Truman. I note that you're expecting a better than $25 billion deterioration in net investment income this year as compared to last year. But you show no further decline in 1989. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	1.0
198809	42	TRUMAN	 That's largely a function of the capital gains effects. You had net capital gains in the current accounts--I don't remember these numbers, but on the order of plus $15 billion--last year because as the dollar declined you had a favorable valuation effect on foreign investments. And this year, with the dollar appreciation, we are estimating a loss of $4 billion. The swing is essentially $20 billion in capital gains for this year versus last year. And that swing is what generates the investment income. Next year, with a much milder decline of the dollar--although we have a smaller positive factor--the swing is not nearly so important. There are some other special factors this year, including the fact there has been a tax ruling on foreign investments in the United States that requires them to report them as income deferred tax liabilities. That will generate a reported increase in income this year, and that's already in the third quarter. And that shows up as an outflow last year and will reverse [unintelligible] a bit next year when you get a positive net effect. And that's the main-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	43	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	44	SEGER	 I have basically two questions. One is, if we don't get the dollar coming off from existing levels, what will that do to our ability to produce these kinds of net exports? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	45	TRUMAN	 You said there were two questions. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	46	SEGER	 Do you want to do them one at a time or do you want to do several? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	47	TRUMAN	 The decline in the dollar is fairly gradual over the course of 1989. There's very little effect--essentially zero--in terms of the forecast of the real economy coming from that factor. It will begin to have an effect as you go off into 1990. Even the forecast of the dollar that we have using conventional models. You can have essentially an improvement in the trade balance falling out as you go into early 1990 if you just stop the exchange rate where it would be in the fourth quarter of 1989. If you stopped it where it is today, we would fall out earlier. That's something in the trade balance of around $100 billion, depending on what happens to growth differentials--if things turn around and begin to deteriorate, or if our growth is approximately the same as that of the rest of the  industrial world. But the forecast itself is not heavily dependent in this time horizon on the course of the dollar. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	48	SEGER	 Some business people are concerned about their ability to be competitive at existing levels, but maybe that's not a predominant view. My second question is one involving a statement in the Greenbook that staff continue to believe that additional pressure in financial markets would be required to slow the expansion, etc. And I guess this goes to Mike: Do you think you've seen the full impact of the tightening moves that we've had to date? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	49	PRELL	 No, but our thought is that even after we have absorbed those, that we will not open up enough slack, so to speak, or reduce the pressures on the economy enough, to relieve the inflationary pressures. Therefore, we need to hold growth below potential for a period of time. What we have in our forecast is a very slight shortfall of actual growth from potential and very slight easing pressures on resources. And we think that, given the underlying tendencies in the economy, we are going to need a bit more restraint to keep things under control over the last two or three quarters of 1989. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	50	SEGER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	51	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	52	ANGELL	 Yes, Mike, I'd like a follow-up question to Governor Seger's questions. Apparently, you have an optimum growth rate in mind, let's say, over the next four quarters. What would that optimum growth'rate be? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	53	PRELL	 I don't know that we have an optimum growth rate. Basically, we sense that the pressures on resources are too great at this point to hold the inflation rate down to recent levels. And we feel some easing [of those pressures] is necessary. We believe the trend of real output growth is somewhere around 2-1/2 percent. Therefore, we believe that we've got to grow something under that in order to ease those pressures. We recognize the uncertainties about where the natural rate of unemployment is, if that's the operative concept. We recognize that the composition of activity can make a difference of--. This is a rough judgment, ultimately; I don't want to get too precise about it, but basically we think we need some additional restraint to get the economy below potential, and we believe that that probably is necessary. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	54	ANGELL	 But, Mike, precision is helpful in communication. I can take the time to pry the number out of you by asking you a series of questions, but it would save some time if you'd simply tell us. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	55	PRELL	 I think I cited a number of 2-1/2 percent, Governor Angell, as what we believed potential GNP growth is. Therefore, it depends how fast you want to get the inflation rate down. If-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	56	ANGELL	 What would you think would be the optimum adjustment process? I mean, do you like 1-1/2 percent better than 2-1/2 percent?  	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	57	PRELL	 Well, you're asking me to make a policy judgment, a subjective judgment about the short-run costs and benefits of a policy you have in mind. What we have tried to make is a positive statement: That if you want to avert some acceleration of inflation, we need to reduce the pressures on resources. The more that is done, the greater the chances are you will see no acceleration at all in the underlying inflation rate next year and that you will be able to tip it down noticeably in 1990. I think it will take more than we have built in here to make a decided move towards restoring a disinflationary trend by 1990. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	58	ANGELL	 But, Mike, there's a policy assumption involved in the interest rate forecast and I am just not sure whether you'd prefer 1-1/2 percent real GNP growth or a 1/2 percent GNP growth or a negative 1/2 percent. I'd like to have some better understanding of what you think it would take in order to get this best adjustment. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	59	PRELL	 Again, I don't feel I'm in a position to declare the best adjustment. I suspect, going around the table here, the policymakers would have some different views about the risks they would want to take and how rapidly they would want to move to bring down the inflation rate. If I were to aim at the kind of inflation trajectory that you've outlined--declines of 1 percent a year in the inflation rate--I would suggest that you would need a substantially greater tightening. You would need to bring growth down substantially from what we have in order to get back on that track. I don't think we're on that track now, and I think you'd need substantially greater restraint--probably close to or even into recessionary conditions--in order by 1990 to have an inflation trend down to 3 percent at an annual rate. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	60	ANGELL	 Thank you. The last statement finally answered the question. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	61	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	62	JOHNSON	 Mike, what did you say your federal funds rate forecast was? Lee asked, and I forgot. Did you say 9-1/2 percent? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	63	PRELL	 We're looking for around 9-1/2 percent. Again, I don't want to be too precise. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	64	JOHNSON	 Yes, I know. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	65	PRELL	 A significant increase from where we are. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	66	JOHNSON	 And you're saying about a proportional move up in the long-run rate to 10 percent? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	67	PRELL	 Just about. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	68	JOHNSON	 The only question I have about that is that we haven't seen that kind of trend with our moves on the funds rate this year. We've had a 1-1/2 percentage point increase in the funds rate and actually a sharp flattening of the yield curve. Long rates stayed about where they were, maybe going up some, but much less than proportionally. I think the yield curve has flattened from about  2-1/2 percentage points down to less than 1 percentage point. What if that trend continues? What would the forecast say if the move to 9-1/2 percent on the funds rate was not accompanied by a proportional move in the long bond? What kind of differential effects would that have? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	69	PRELL	 As you know, some of this extreme flattening is a very recent phenomenon. Earlier in the year, you were getting more substantial increases in long rates as short rates rose. I guess underlying this projection, at least in my mind, is a sense that the markets may have overdone things recently and that part of this may be the lack of long bond authority and unusual tightness in the long end of the market at this point. But we do have what would be a fairly substantial rise in long rates along with the short rate increases in this forecast, partly on the presumption that the market will be surprised to some degree by what it takes in order to damp inflationary pressures. They would come around more to our view; there's a strict internal consistency in these forecasts. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	70	JOHNSON	 No, that's okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	71	PRELL	 If the rates don't rise--, they might not rise as much for a number of reasons. One could be a change in inflationary expectations. We may have had some of that recently, where the apparent willingness of the Fed to move earlier than some would have thought may have helped to hold down long-range inflation expectations. To the extent that that's going on, you're perhaps not getting a significant real rate effect and thus the damping influence on demand. If events transpire that cause real rates not to rise as much as we would anticipate in this forecast, then we might have a different outcome where investment demand may be sustained a bit more than we have [in the forecast]. There are innumerable scenarios that one could draw where the movement in long rates would have different implications. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	72	JOHNSON	 I understand. What I'm saying is, let's assume it's inflationary expectations being adjusted, and that's why the long rates haven't gone up. Say that continues to be the case, but the funds rate goes up to 9-1/2 percent without much change in the long bond due to improvement in inflationary expectations or something like that. What would be the differential impacts of that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	73	PRELL	 You're saying that if the flattening occurs entirely because of reduced inflation expectations-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	74	JOHNSON	 Okay, entirely, let's say, to debate the extreme. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	75	PRELL	 It would depend in the short run in part on whether it was a change in the long-run perception of what inflationary trends would be and in part on whether it was a reflection of a sense that the economy might be headed toward recession. Clearly, in other historical experience we've seen a marked flattening of the yield curve just before downturns in the economy. If we were to move up short rates as much as we're talking about here and the long rate didn't rise at all--that would be a very steep downward slope. And I suspect it would only occur in  circumstances where people would perceive that there was a significant likelihood of a near-term weakening in the economy. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	76	JOHNSON	 Your view is, though, that these expectations will be revised in the near future and that the long bond will move back up? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	77	PRELL	 That's basically what we're assuming. It's very difficult to psych out the market at this point. One can come up with a number of alternative hypotheses about why the market has behaved in just the way it has recently--in interpreting recent news and so on. Another factor is the dollar situation, in terms of our longer-run external position and what we think ultimately we need to correct that. That's probably a factor that's going to be less favorable as we move along in the projection period. And, as I suggested, we're presuming that the market will perceive that a greater degree of restraint is necessary to rein in inflationary pressures than perhaps it currently is. They will come around to [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	78	JOHNSON	 And if that's the case, then the long bond would be surprised into further upward moves. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	79	PRELL	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	80	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	81	BOEHNE	 Mike, you've made I think a rather persuasive case both in your written comments and your oral comments this morning that we will need some additional restraint to hold aggregate demand to the level that's more consistent with reducing inflationary pressures. I wonder if I could get you to put yourself on the other side of that question. I wonder if you could help a slow mind this morning and articulate the case that maybe we won't need the kind of restraint that you're talking about to get the job done. In other words, I wonder if you could admit to where the cracks might be in your argument and the things that might happen that would say that while we might need a touch more restraint, maybe we've done much of the job that we need to do. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198809	82	PRELL	 I hope I wasn't too persuasive because there is a range of uncertainty about our forecast. For example, one of those areas of uncertainty obviously is the sensitivity of investment demand to what has already occurred in interest rate movements and the dollar. There's been some perception already that the future competitiveness of some United States industry will be less than people thought previously; perhaps the momentum of investment might not be as strong as we have in this forecast. Fiscal policy we have interpreted as providing a degree of restraint on aggregate demand. That is always difficult to interpret and it's conceivable that our underlying policy-action assumptions could turn out to be wrong. And we could have a greater degree of restraint being applied, damping activity more than [unintelligible]. Consumer spending has fairly consistently surprised us in this expansion by its strength, and as this has occurred, consumer debt levels have risen. We've outlined for you what we think the cash flow consequences are of rising rates on households. We feel this isn't a big problem, but again one would have to admit the possibilty of some surprise there. The oil price situation is something imponderable and that's a very difficult  situation to sort out, because it has underlying aggregate demand effects if we were to get a change in the price from our assumption. I feel reasonably comfortable with the inventory situation, but there too, there may be some pockets in the retail level that could exert more of a drag on output in coming months than we have [assumed]• But I don't see that as a very great problem. So, I think there are any number of areas across the economy where conceivably things might turn out weaker than we have. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	83	BOEHNE	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198809	84	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	85	KELLEY	 Mike, if you would for just a second speculate on the other side of the suggested policy recommendation for taking federal funds up to 9-1/2 and 10 percent--the possibility that that might induce a recession somewhere along the line. What would be the implications of a recession let's say in late 1989 or early 1990 if you began to see the federal deficit burgeoning and so forth? What would be the broad brush of a scenario of a recession, given the larger picture of where we are on the deficit and the new president in place trying to get new policies established and so forth? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	48.0
198809	86	PRELL	 Well, I'm not sure that that recession would appear soon enough to greatly affect the discussions about the 1990 budget. But it's conceivable that, in your hypothesis, the picture could change and then one has to make a political judgment. There are many people, obviously, who would question the ability of the Congress to institute significant further deficit reduction measures if the economy appeared to be weakening. And the actual budget deficit in those circumstances could become very large in 1990, which in effect would exacerbate the long-run problem by adding further to the level of debt. So, it's a pretty dicey situation. I think it's clear that they will have an easier time putting together a budgetary package that makes substantial ongoing progress in reducing the deficit in an environment where the economic outlook appears to be reasonably satisfactory. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	87	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	88	STERN	 Mike, a few minutes ago you alluded to inventories as a possibility of adding a little bit to the downside. But I have the impression that your inventory path is really pretty conservative. Is that a fair characterization? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	41.0
198809	89	PRELL	 Basically, if we strip away farm and strip away autos, which are in good shape now--though there may be some accumulation over the remainder of the year. But I think that's a sort of a separable situation. Outside of that area, we're looking for a bit faster accumulation than we saw in the spring over the remainder of this year and then some slight tapering off. It's not a dynamic factor in this projection. And as the Chairman has pointed out, in an environment where business activity is fairly robust and capacity is getting tighter and prices are rising fairly rapidly for materials and so on, it's not inconceivable that at some point manufacturers will become more aggressive than we've put into this forecast. We have manufacturers increasing their inventories over the coming months; but there could be an outside risk, as I noted in my  comments, that if things got out of hand on that score it could add perhaps to greater near-term strength in the economy. But it would set us up perhaps for more of a shakeout later on in 1989. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	90	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	91	LAWARE	 Mike, I'm having difficulty understanding the consistency between your interest rate forecast and the forecast for further downward pressure on the dollar. Help me with that one. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	50.0
198809	92	TRUMAN	 Maybe I ought to do that. The forecast for the dollar is largely driven by the view that ultimately you have to have substantially smaller trade and current account deficits than we have now. The exchange rate adjustment will be part of what brings that about. We don't have any strong view about when we're going to get it, but it would be over the next five years, say. So in building the forecast we have tended to put in a moderate decline in the dollar as a background factor, which does not have a big role in the short run but it is the direction of where we think the pressure is going to be, as I said in my answer to the question from Governor Seger. In producing the forecast we tried to, in some sense, trim that longer- term view by what our assumptions about monetary policy here and others [unintelligible]. Over the past several meetings of the Committee we have tended to adjust up our forecast of the dollar; we have less of a decline in the dollar cumulatively over the period for basically two reasons. One is that the trade performance has been better than we--and I think a lot of people--expected. Therefore, in some sense, the amount of adjustment you need in this process is less. So you don't have to build much into the medium-term framework. We have moved the dollar up because the presumed stance of monetary policy has been somewhat tighter. But over this immediate horizon, we have the dollar flat, essentially, over the balance of this year. That is associated with a view that there's a perception of policy as being tighter. But as we move into 1989, there inevitably will be some slowing in the pace of current account adjustments from what we've had over the past three or four quarters, and we would expect to get some reemerging pressures on the dollar despite the increase in the interest rates that we have had. We have tried in a very crude way to talk about what it would take to stabilize the dollar, and it is a difficult question to answer convincingly--as I explained in the first part of my answer--if you view the dollar's course as being driven by medium-term factors. But the answer comes out somewhat like the answer to Governor Angell's question: That you need more than monetary restraint in the short run [unintelligible] the dollar. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198809	93	LAWARE	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	50.0
198809	94	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Prell? If not, we've come to the general discussion where the individual members will give us definitive forecasts of the outlook. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	95	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, I'll lead off. As far as the Eleventh District economy is concerned, we're looking at what's happening or might happen in energy--which over the past year or so is showing a little bit of improvement and turning into more of a neutral factor for us. As far as the outlook for the economy generally, the overall mood of the people that we've talked to very recently has been  a little more positive, although it's difficult for them--or for us-- to point to specifics that show that something's happening. If we do get a sustained price for oil in the $14 range, that would probably indicate that we have no growth at all in our District economy, whereas we currently have a forecast of sluggish growth of something around 1 percent or less for next year. We are getting reports of substantial capital investments that are planned or that are under way in petrochemicals, particularly in Houston--the upper Gulf Coast area. And they are, of course, benefiting from the lower price of oil. We were fortunate over the last several days to have missed some of the rather devastating effects of Hurricane Gilbert. Although there were tornadoes and there was some damage, it wasn't anything close to what had been anticipated. The real estate area continues, of course, to be the biggest drag that we have. And I do have a real- -as opposed to an anecdotal--comment on that. About five years ago, we had our bank property appraised in connection with a study that we were doing. The appraiser came up with a value in excess of $30 million, which a couple of our directors --particularly our then- Chairman who was in the real estate business--felt was low. We've just had our property reappraised in connection with another study we're doing. The same professional independent appraiser group did it this time. They're telling us that our property now is worth between $6-1/2 and $8-1/2 million. You know, that's something else. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198809	96	BLACK	 What did you do to it? Did you take care of that place? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198809	97	ANGELL	 Bob, it sounds like quite a bargain, doesn't it? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	98	BOYKIN	 Well, there are special factors. The key--and this is not the place to make this statement --but I'll make it anyway. What they're saying is our building is totally used up in terms of its usefulness. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198809	99	GREENSPAN	 Over the last five years! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	100	BOYKIN	 But I thought that was very, very significant. Granted, we have special circumstances; nevertheless I have a better appreciation of what the commercial banks have been having to deal with as they get new appraisals and reappraisals. And I don't believe anybody knows what real estate is worth any more. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198809	101	GREENSPAN	 Well, conversion in terms of barrels of oil isn't that bad. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	102	BOYKIN	 That's all I have. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198809	103	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	104	FORRESTAL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry I don't have a real estate study to talk about this morning. Let me turn first to the national economy. I have very little problem with the Board staff's Greenbook forecast; in fact, if we were to build in roughly the same kind of restraint that's in the Greenbook we'd be very close indeed. I think all forecasts these days are a little bit  cloudier than usual because of the statistical difficulties with the drought, so I think we need to be a little careful about forecasts generally. I'm very happy to see the recent deceleration, although I wouldn't want to put a lot of credence in a couple of months' data. But I think the thing the markets perhaps are not focusing on is that we are still growing beyond our potential. And that is really what's guiding my thinking and my judgment at the present time. In response to Governor Johnson, there was a discussion about the yield on the 30-year bond and long-term rates generally, and it seems to me that the market may very well be underestimating the strength of the economy and thus reducing its inflationary expectations. I think there is generally a tendency among market participants and business people that I talk with to feel that a slowing economy is a slow economy. I think we've gotten used to large numbers over the past several quarters and the focus is not really on the potential of the economy. So, I not only agree with the forecast, Mr. Chairman, but I agree with the analysis of the staff that unless the economy slows appreciably, we will have to restrain growth further--take additional [steps of] monetary restraint--by the end of the year. I don't think I need say very much about the District because not a great deal has changed since the last meeting. Growth in the Sixth District remains fairly spotty. The manufacturing tradeable goods sector is doing quite well, but the service sector--particularly in urban areas--is not doing well and is really quite sluggish. Construction is off. We used to report pretty regularly, as I said last month, that almost every state with the exception of Louisiana was doing better than the national average. That has really turned around. I think Florida now would be the only state that I would characterize as doing better than the national average. The unemployment rate in all of our states except Florida is now above those in the rest of the country. The good news part of that, I suppose, is that there's very little pressure on wages in this kind of a market. I probed a lot for that among our directors and other business people; and while you hear a little bit of concern about entry-level people and trying to attract them with higher wages, basically we're not seeing any wage pressure at all. The same thing is true generally of prices. The price increases, where they have occurred, have been kind of spotty and in industries that are really going flat out--paperboard, paper, and so on. The good news in all of this is that Louisiana and Mississippi are doing better than they were. That's basically because of some chemical production that is now occurring in Louisiana as well as the pickup in ship building. Although they are doing better, we have to remember that they're coming from a very low base and they would still have to be characterized, I think, as negative growth areas. On the agricultural side, higher prices for some agricultural commodities are going to improve farm incomes since the crop yields were not as affected in the southeast as they were in other areas of the country. That's all I have, Mr. Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198809	105	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	106	KEEHN	 With regard to the national economy--with some modest adjustments for the fourth quarter of this year and the first  quarter of next year due mainly to agriculture--our outlook is quite consistent with the staff forecast in the Greenbook. With regard to the District, there's really very little that's new to report. With the obvious exception of agriculture, I think the economy continues to be really very strong. But there are just a few signs of moderation-- nothing pronounced. I think there are somewhat slower growth rates in a couple of parts of our economy. Retail sales, for example, were much weaker in the summer months than earlier in the spring. And construction activity is down a bit. Another example is paperboard, which of course has been so very strong; after a string of almost two years of record monthly shipments, last month's shipments were down just a bit there. It's too early to tell if these early signs are indicative of a trend and if they're going to be sustained. It's entirely possible, I think, that the trends--particularly in some of the areas that I've mentioned--are the result of the exceptionally hot weather that we've had. Since the turn of the weather, I'm told by retailers that the flow of traffic in their stores is back up to more normal levels. So some of these things may have been very weather related. Perhaps the lack of any significant changes could be a good thing. Anecdotally, at least, I don't sense a continuation of the upward pressures on prices that were so very evident earlier this year. I still think that the risks are very much on the side of greater inflation. But I am beginning to hear some comments about the leveling of prices for a variety of materials--or certainly that more moderate increases are taking place as opposed to the big numbers that we had earlier this year. And at least one major manufacturer that I talked to the other day is forecasting that raw material purchases next year will be level with 1988--really no increase at all. Surprisingly, consistent with what Bob Forrestal has just said, I don't sense any deterioration on the wage front. Wage rates do not at this point seem to be accelerating. Also, there doesn't seem to be a hardening of attitudes on the part of labor. I'm told that the attitude of organized labor continues to be very constructive, given the continued progress on work-rule changes. So I think the news there continues to be pretty good. Companies are not losing ground on unit labor costs but, as a caveat on that, there are two major contracts out there that are currently reaching the final stages of negotiations. We'll just have to wait to see how those work out. Again, I think it's too early to tell whether these early signs of moderation will be sustained. But certainly they are favorable, and for now it just could be the case that things are falling into line pretty well. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0

198809	108	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District economy appears to be growing at a relatively brisk pace, and I'd say that the outlook for the District generally is favorable. A very strong order book for aircraft should assure strength in the Seattle area for a couple of years. That also boosts prospects in the aircraft industry in southern California. Prospects for the growth of exports are reasonably bright for such things as agricultural products, specialty products, and also transportation and electronic equipment. Agriculture in the west appears as though it may actually be  benefiting somewhat from the drought as a result of the higher prices that more than offset the effects of very mild reductions in yields in the west. At this time, signs of weakness in the District are really quite spotty. And they're only concentrated in a few states--Alaska, Arizona, and Utah--and a very few industries as well. Residential construction is weak. Dairy and livestock are rather weak as a result of the fact that they're paying higher costs for feed. And aluminum and forest products are weak due to capacity constraints. It's rather interesting that even where you have weakness, it's in areas that are pretty much up against capacity constraints: in residential construction, for example, that's solely a result of extremely strong export demands for lumber. Weakness may intensify in the District if the very recent sharp slowing in retail advertising in California-- which looks quite pervasive--is a precursor of softer retail sales. If I may turn to the national outlook, it's my view that it's premature to conclude that the recent softening of economic statistics is indicative of a trend that will persist through 1989. Rather, it seems more likely to me that if interest rates were to remain at present levels, growth of the nonfarm economy would probably exceed the growth of potential over the entire forecast period. Thus, prospects for the underlying rate of inflation still are a concern, though obviously we're going to see actual inflation rates buffeted by many special factors. If this expectation in our forecast is correct, then it seems to me that the process of tightening probably is not over and will have to be resumed sometime soon. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198809	109	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	110	CORRIGAN	 Mr. Chairman, our forecast at the Bank is one that I think is close to the other side of Mike's coin. We do not have a significant increase in interest rates built into our forecast; we have a bit of an upward drift. But for that reason and for others, it's a forecast that ends up, on balance, with a phenomenal GNP growth rate--a percentage point and a half or so above what's in the Greenbook. And because of where we are relative to potential, a good part of that excess shows through in terms of higher inflation. Indeed, by the end of the forecast period, our forecast would have a very significantly higher inflation rate than what's in the Greenbook. That is not a testimony to any one forecast, but I think it's very vivid testimony to how much of a razor's edge we are on, in terms of what does or does not happen in the economy. I don't have a great deal of conviction per se about any one forecast, but I must say my instincts continue to be very similar to Bob Parry's. I'll just briefly share [some comments] with the Committee, Mr. Chairman, partly because this is such a very difficult period to read. In the first two weeks of September, we talked to a couple of dozen firms to try to get a more systematic anecdotal appreciation of what's going on. Now, a systematic approach to anecdotal reports is in no way a survey for purposes of 0MB or anybody else. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198809	111	SEGER	 Can't be or you'd get in trouble. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	112	CORRIGAN	 With that in mind, I'd like to touch on just a couple of the highlights. The firms that we talked to  included about a dozen or so very prominent manufacturing firms with headquarters in the Second District, some smaller manufacturing firms, and some very prominent retail firms. As of right now, what comes through is that the export sector is literally still booming. Export sales were very strong indeed, with increases in volume terms typically well into double digits. There was only one case where that was not true, and that particular firm didn't seem very concerned about it because they have a very large backlog of orders--orders that haven't even formally been booked yet for jet engines that are ultimately destined for overseas markets. On the question of the current level of the dollar, none of the firms expressed any concern about the current level. Indeed, the impression was that even at current exchange rates, United States firms were quite competitive except in apparel and clothing categories. There were two small firms that did say that a yen/dollar of 140 was kind of a threshhold for them. But generally speaking, there was no concern expressed in terms of current exchange rates and the ability of this strong export performance to continue. But perhaps even more interesting is that we see here for the first time, in anecdotal terms, a number of clear cases of capital goods shifting away from foreign suppliers to United States suppliers. I don't want to suggest that that was the universal pattern, but of the major firms, about an equal number reported that positive shifting was taking place. None said it was getting worse, with the exception of one company that was doing more sourcing from Mexico--which in some ways is a good thing, of course. In addition, quite apart from capital goods, there were also a number of firms--and we haven't heard this for a long time either-- that were also reporting gains in domestic market shares in general, relative to imports. In other words, they are actually now displacing imports in the domestic marketplace. Again, the major exception to that is all of the clothing and textile firms--apparel-related things. That area is still lousy throughout, both at production and retail levels. But in other areas there are some distinct changes. In terms of domestic sales performance, with only one or two exceptions, these firms reported current trends I think that were really quite strong, often in double digits. On the output, wage, and capacity side--again, none of this is very scientific and I don't want to put the wrong cast on it. But it's really interesting because about half of the big firms--and these are the manufacturers, of course--reported no capacity constraints to speak of or nothing they couldn't cope with. Whereas another half reported some problems --and these were typically in the areas that we would expect. When it got to the particular question of input problems, in terms of price, delivery delays, etc., again it was about half-and-half. About half did report that they were having input problems defined either as rapidly rising prices or delivery lags. Those patterns were clear in steel, plastics, computer chips, aluminum, paper, and surprisingly, in some Japanese component parts. But the other side of it is that about half of them didn't report particular problems of that nature. On the labor question--and this is very interesting--the responses broke almost straight down the line based on size. The large firms did not report any particular problems in terms of labor shortages; the small firms did. The same was more or less true in terms of wages in general. The overall impression that I get, not  just from this but from listening to our directors and others, is that there is some upward movement on the wage side but it's not significant yet. That's defined in terms of maybe a 1/2 percentage point type of thing. But the conclusion that I draw from all this impressionistic data is consistent or compatible at least with my own thoughts and instincts--that the risks are rather asymmetric in the direction of greater pressures on domestic output and resources, at least over the near term. On the other hand, it may also be consistent with the view that while the inflation genie isn't perhaps out of the bottle, it's by no means clear that the cork is firmly in place. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198809	113	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	114	SEGER	 The most intriguing information I've had since the last meeting didn't come from an economist or businessman but from a psychiatrist who happened to be sitting next to me on an airplane coming back from Boston. He was writing madly and I could see the word depression, so I thought he was one of the crackpots who writes the doom-and-gloom books about the end of the economic world. After a few minutes we got to talking, and I discovered that he is a psychiatrist specializing in depression. But the useful information to me was that as he counsels people, one of the first things he asks them is for information about their spending habits, particularly the spending that they do using little pieces of plastic. And what he's discovered is that this is one of the early signs of depression--that people go out on these big spending sprees. They buy cars--no, seriously--that they can't afford. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	115	GREENSPAN	 I know; I've done that! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	116	SEGER	 I'm not smart enough to make this up. They buy cars they can't afford, do all this spending, and run their cards right up to the limits--and this is just before they go over the edge. So we decided that based on what he saw and what I had seen in the statistics that there are a lot of psychos running around. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	117	STERN	 Another problem for the Federal Reserve. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198809	118	BLACK	 Another problem for him; he can [profit?] from that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198809	119	SEGER	 Yes, that's right, he's doing okay. In that con¬ nection, though, anyone I speak with other than him suggests that consumers as a whole aren't on a big spending spree. So I guess my view of the economy is a little less optimistic than the staff's. Also, on the housing side, some of the realtors I've spoken with suggest, first of all, that the recent increases in mortgage rates haven't all been felt; and, secondly, that consumers are beginning to react to the high prices on new homes. Also, in certain parts of the country, like Mr. Parry's enlightened California, there are these tremendous restrictions on growth; and it's very difficult to get lots on which to build houses despite the whining about the housing shortages. So I think that our forecast on housing starts might be a touch high.  Finally, as I think I hinted in my discussion with Mike Prell and Ted Truman, I'm a little less certain that we're going to get the export improvement that we are forecasting. I would certainly like to see it because, while certainly some companies are still competitive at existing exchange rates and in [scenarios] that involve a slightly cheaper dollar, I don't think everybody is. And that concerns me. So those are the three areas where I guess I differ from the staff. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198809	120	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	121	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think every point I wanted to make has been made by someone--but some by one person and some by another. Let me just summarize briefly. We agree very closely with what the staff has suggested in the Greenbook. We see the same signs of moderation, partly because of the employment figures and other national figures, and also because of the grass-roots reports that we've getting from our directors, particularly in textiles and furniture. But I'm glad to see this, because I thought the economy was growing way, way too fast and the risks were all on the upside. This suggests that maybe they're less on the upside now than they were before. But like most of those who have spoken, I still think that the risks definitely are skewed more towards the upside and that there's a danger that the economy might overheat. These figures showing moderation have been around for only a month or two at most, and apart from housing, there are no real large parts of the GNP accounts or significant sectors that show any signs of a great or sustained weakness. And then, if you look at the figures in section II of the Greenbook, they show that there is some upward pressure on both wages and prices. Mike has just reported that the figures on the implicit price deflator and the fixed-weight deflator for the second quarter were worse than we thought they were, based on the initial reports. So in short, while I feel a little bit better than I did before, because there are some signs of slowing, I don't think we're out of the woods yet. And I would think that the staff's prognostication that somewhere down the line we'll need to tighten further is probably still right, although now might not be the time to do that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198809	122	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	123	STERN	 There's very little new to report on the District economy. I'll try to dispense with that very quickly. As I've commented before, most of the District economy is and remains very strong. The obvious exception is the areas affected adversely by the drought; otherwise, the economy in the District is in good shape. As far as the national outlook is concerned, I find myself in substantial agreement with the Greenbook forecast. I don't know how much of a further rise in interest rates might be required to stem building inflationary pressures, perhaps not very much, but I think the Greenbook does appropriately identify where the risks are. As I look at the latest statistics, I think they do suggest some slowing in the pace of expansion in the last month or two--a  slowing that, as several people have already commented, is welcomed, in my judgment. But I find that there's maybe a little tendency to exaggerate this. Even though I wouldn't try to construe the August labor market report as very strong, it's still a 200,000 increase in payroll employment--2-1/2 million workers at an annual rate--which is not a trivial increase in employment at all, especially given the tightness in labor markets that already exists. And, as I already suggested, inventory/sales ratios look, if anything, on the low side to me. So I think we may see more strength, at least in the near term, coming out of inventories than the Greenbook forecast anticipates. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198809	124	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	125	BOEHNE	 The region continues as it has been: It's operating at high levels, although there is some moderation; labor markets are very tight; and, wage rates are higher than the nation as a whole. As far as the national economy, I subscribe to the view that the economy is moderating, but that more moderation is needed and additional restraint is probably also needed. While the risks are on the side of too much demand, I think we need at this point to keep a very open mind and shouldn't rush to judgment on it for the reasons that were articulated nicely by Mike Prell. I'd like to watch the economy closely and be prepared to tighten if necessary. But I wouldn't rush into it at the moment, just because I have enough doubts to think that a little patience is in order. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198809	126	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	127	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, we in Boston agree very strongly with the staff's long-term conviction that the economy is so strong-- its strength stemming from net exports and capital goods--that the job of the Federal Reserve would be to try to keep this economy from going beyond capacity levels and generating a new inflationary cycle. And we agree that substantial increases in interest rates are likely to be required to produce that. We're seeing a little evidence of a slowdown recently, but this is the kind of flow that you often get in a very strong economy. I don't think we ought to get it in our minds that we've reached a level of growth which from now on is going to be compatible with price stability. I think it's a very short-term phenomenon we're talking about. And I think our financial markets have been impacted in the last couple of months by a very special factor--a nonsustainable special factor--which is that private foreign capital inflows have been coming into this country at rates substantially in excess of the amount of our foreign account deficit. Of course, the counterpart of that is very large sales on the part of central banks, including ourselves. This I think has greatly strengthened our bond market; but it's not a factor that we can count on being sustained for very long. We've seen foreign exchange markets in the past couple of years turn on a dime. And I suspect that sometime in the next few months the appetite of private foreign investors for United States assets is not going to continue to grow at the present rate. And when that happens, you're going to see many long-term bonds go up by 50 basis points, and  perhaps more, overnight. I think we're living in a special financial world here which is not sustainable. Could I comment about the meeting schedule for next year since I can do so in an objective manner since I won't be here? You know we - - 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198809	128	GREENSPAN	 In a way in which you will choose now to comment. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	129	MORRIS	 We set up this eight-meeting schedule at the time we went to targeting the monetary aggregates. And the idea was that, since we're controlling Ml and presumably not paying attention to anything else, why do we have to meet every month? It seems to me that the Committee would be well advised to go back to a once-a-month schedule because we're in an environment in which I don't feel comfortable that we're not having another meeting until November 1st. It's such a rapidly changing world that we live in that I think an eight-meeting schedule is too few. It's true that we can handle problems in conference calls, but that doesn't quite substitute, in my mind, for the discipline of gathering around this table. I know the staff won't like it because it increases their work load, and a lot of the presidents won't like it because of travel requirements. But I don't think those considerations should be paramount. And I would strongly advise you to at least think about going back to the once-a- month schedule because it seems to me that the volatility of the world we live in isn't well suited to this Committee meeting every five or six weeks. As far as the New England economy is concerned, we're continuing to grow at about half the rate of the national economy, simply because of the shortage of labor. The only state in New England which is growing as fast as the national economy is Maine, which has a very high unemployment rate of 4 percent. And it's the only surplus labor area in New England, so manufacturing industries are tending to push farther and farther north into Maine and threaten our little enclave at Lewiston, Maine. That's a very low-wage RCPC; it has the lowest unit labor costs of any check processing center in the country, and my successor may not have that distinction for very much longer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0

198809	131	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	132	MELZER	 I want to make a couple of comments on projections based on a money-driven model and just what that looks like. Essentially, I'd say the projections are very similar to those of the Board's staff. There are some differences between the second half of this year and next year, but I would characterize the pattern as one in which inflationary pressures are contained, but not significantly reduced, over that 18-month period. The projections I'm talking about are based on an assumption of 4 to 6 percent Ml growth. And I guess the conclusion that I reached from looking at that--and obviously, this is the model output and then, just as the Board staff does, some subjective judgments are made--was that I'd be much more concerned about, say, money growth in June and July of 9 percent, than  I would be about August of less than 1 percent. I think the general pattern is such that the same conclusion comes out in this sort of model--that the risks are more on the upside than the downside. As far as the District goes, the report is essentially the same as last month. We're still showing weakness relative to the rest of the economy and in some areas, particularly in industries like textiles and apparel, there are employment declines. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198809	133	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	134	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to the Tenth District, there is not a great change from last time. To summarize, we are still trailing the growth rate of the national economy. But in all areas, including energy and agriculture, there is some improvement--to be sure, improvement from a very low base. Manu¬ facturing is doing very well; retail sales have been holding up but not very vigorous. By and large, the Tenth District is continuing on a trend to recovery, but a bit slower than the national rate. With regard to the national economy and the projection con¬ tained in the Greenbook, we would be very close to that except that the pattern we have is a bit different. If I understand the Greenbook forecast, the drought effect has largely run its course by the end of the year, whereas we would find the effect to be fairly even in each of the four quarters from the second quarter of 1988 to the second quarter of 1989. Notwithstanding that minor difference, it still seems to me that we are projecting a very vigorous growth well into 1989. And, given the comments around the table and what we hear in the Tenth District with respect to wage and price increases not really showing up yet, it is still a matter of major concern that, on the national level, we're putting considerable pressure on our resources. I guess my view is that there is going to have to be some greater restraint in the future in order to get the kind of pattern over the longer term that we'd like to have. I would also like to add, if I may, that I happen to agree with Frank Morris--as painful as it is personally because of the travel--that going back to a monthly meeting schedule makes a lot of sense, given the way we're operating at the moment. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198809	135	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	136	HOSKINS	 The District overall remains pretty strong, particularly in manufacturing. We have some slow delivery times in particular industries, and we have some price increases coming across, but nothing that startling at this point, particularly in the capital goods area. Wage demands on the manufacturing side have remained moderate, but we're concerned that because of the strength in the service wage component--they're in the same labor markets--that in fact, they'll begin influencing each other and then we'll see sharper wage increases across the board than we're currently seeing. Retail sales ex-autos have been flat and construction has been rather lackluster. As you know well, our directors have felt very strongly about the strength of the economy, except that at the last go-around they were not quite as adamant, as you probably noticed; I saw some deterioration in their concerns about inflation. Nevertheless, there's still great strength in the District.  As far as the national economic outlook, I guess I really don't have much reason to disagree with Mike's projections. However, if I were to estimate an error on it, I would say the error is probably going to be on the upside in terms of strength and inflationary pressures rather than on the downside. We've seen the inflation rate move up a 1/2 percent or so each year. And, as you know, that is the wrong direction from my perspective. I think we ought to gear policy to that long-term objective, which implies we'd probably have to face more tightening--perhaps more than the staff has in place. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198809	137	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	138	ANGELL	 I'm very pleased with the present state of monetary policy and conditions in the economy. That doesn't mean I like the 4 percent rate of inflation. I just didn't believe that we could make the exchange rate adjustments that were so necessary to make--[along with] the rebound of oil prices from those lows and some rebound in wage rates from what I would call somewhat unsustainably low nominal rates--without having some temporary bounceback in the rate of inflation. I have no reason to think that the staff's real economy forecast is not within the range of that which is likely. I would tend probably to have a slightly higher net export figure, Ted-- closer to what you had in the June Greenbook than those that you have in today--but there's not enough there to argue much about. I think if anything is different, consumer spending might be slightly softer, but it's very difficult to predict. The pleasing aspect of policy at this point in September 1988 is that, as far as I can see, we've returned the growth of the monetary aggregates to the pace that was occurring in 1987--and I thought the rate we had in 1987 was appropriate to provide a soft landing for the dollar. And it's very encouraging to me to see that, after the monetary aggregates responded to the somewhat easier stance we maintained during the fall and winter, the aggregates have responded the way they have to our attempts to be serious about not letting M2 rise above the top of the target at the first of the year, even though we had a somewhat distorted base level. And now it looks as if M2 is going to end the year in the fourth quarter below the midpoint and could very well be as low as 4-1/2 to 5 percent at the end of the year. Don Kohn shakes his head a little bit at that. I think we have to keep in mind the time lag between interest rate changes and response in those monetary aggregates. In June, as you may remember, I talked a little bit about the hint of changing commodity prices, and I think I was kind of reading tea leaves at that point. But we've had further evidence that the monetary restraint in place is having an impact on commodity prices-- and even though we've had, it seems to me, a peaking of commodity price rises earlier in the year, the drought gave us a kind of a double-peak effect. But the commodity price picture does look much improved. I believe that the fight against inflation is a long one and one that we must sustain over a long period of time; and I would be willing, of course, to accept very low growth rates in the monetary aggregates, but I would really suggest that zero may not be desirable. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198809	139	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	140	HELLER	 Thank you. Let me take a little bit longer perspective on the current situation. In 1986, we had 15-1/2 percent Ml growth and almost 10 percent M2 growth and that, I think, is reflected to some extent in some inflationary bulge, which is now working its way through the economy from producer prices slowly down to consumer prices. By the way, I think that lag is exactly what the textbooks tell us it is--18 months or thereabouts, counting from the 1986 area to slightly over the middle of 1988, with some variance around it. Then, following what Governor Angell just said, in 1987 we saw a very substantial slowdown in monetary growth and I think that slowdown is starting to make itself felt in the real economy, which we are observing right now. As I think many people pointed out, there is some moderation in the economic growth picture in the Greenbook forecast. There's more of that weakening, especially in the coming year. Personal consumption next year is forecast to be 1-1/2 percent; residential construction is negative; and there isn't one single sector which is growing above the 2-1/2 percent growth rate that was described as optimal--except for domestic investment and exports. And I think it's absolutely essential, if we worry about growth constraint, that we keep domestic investment growing at a solid rate. It is somewhat disconcerting, however, that even the growth rate in that sector is forecast to be cut in half for the coming year. So, what we're about to do here is kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. We can't talk about a growth constraint being relevant for policy when the one factor that can ease that growth constraint, which is domestic investment, is being cut and restrained. I also agree that exports have to be maintained. I'm happy to see the higher export growth rates. The current level of the dollar, I think, is entirely appropriate. We're below purchasing power parity; therefore, we do have a competitive advantage and we can make further inroads into foreign markets. The scenario that was outlined by Mike Prell in response to Governor Kelley's questions is the really scary one--the black box, the Pandora's box, that the new President would have to face if growth falters, if we have the higher interest rates that we're talking about, and if the tax revenues are not coming in. So I see the downside risks as a very unpalatable combination of factors indeed. The upside risks I see as rather minimal, because of the items that Governor Angell has outlined already. In my view, we're seeing essentially a moving through the economy of that inflationary bulge. If you look at the beginning of that process, you'll see very positive signs--the commodity prices being maintained, the flattening of the yield curve, and also the strong dollar in international markets. All are good portents of rather subdued inflationary expectations. So, basically I like the economy the way it is running right now. I think we're exactly on the right track and I would like to do everything possible to keep it moving that way. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198809	141	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	142	KELLEY	 I wanted to very briefly express something very similar to what Governor Heller just expressed, and I won't repeat it. I'll simply say I'm coming from the same place that he is. I had expressed before my concern about what could happen in the 1989-90 time scenario. If the black box kind of thing begins to happen and we  slide over into a recession before we have a chance to adjust further the fiscal/monetary mix and the trade/consumption mix and so forth, I'll continue to have those concerns. I have a very low level of enthusiasm for running a high risk of inducing a recession in the near future. Hopefully, we do have some slowing going on and to quote Ed Boehne from a few minutes ago, I think that this is not a time to rush to judgment. So I would prefer to watch and wait a little bit and see how things go. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0

198809	144	JOHNSON	 I really don't want to add much to any of that. I think everything has been said. We've seen recently some signs of slowing as everyone has pointed out. That seems to have had a moderating effect in the financial markets and I don't know whether that's going to continue or not. All I know is that it looks pretty good right now and certainly doesn't lend any weight to overreacting. So I support what others have said. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198809	145	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare, do you have any comments you'd like to make? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198809	146	LAWARE	 No. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
198809	147	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we, then, go to relevant policy decisions. 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	148	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the financial markets, the intermeeting period has been  marked by a considerable slowing in money growth and, as Peter has already recounted, some declines in interest rates particularly in the  longer maturities.  The deceleration of money over August and early September was  largely anticipated; monetary expansion was a little less than had been  projected, but not by more than would fall within the usual margin of  error. Even with the slowing, M2 is in about the middle of its annual  range and M3 still in the upper portion of its range. The behavior of  money seems to be explainable through the impact of previous increases  in interest rates, rather than an unanticipated shortfall in income.  Using the staff GNP projection, velocity is estimated to have increased  at a 2-1/2 percent rate in the third quarter, which is more than accounted for by interest rate effects, according to our models.  The bluebook alternatives embody the staff expectation that  money growth will continue to be quite damped over coming months. Under  alternative B, M2 is projected to grow at only a 3 percent rate on average through yearend, placing it somewhat below the midpoint of its long-  run range. This reflects not so much developments in the economy, which  is assumed to follow the track in the greenbook, but rather the lags in  adjustments to previous increases in interest rates both by depository  institutions in raising offering rates and by depositors in rearranging  portfolios to take account of changes in opportunity costs. As a consequence, velocity is projected to increase again in the fourth quarter,  and by a little more than in the third.  Time deposit offering rates have already adjusted to a considerable extent, so most of the weakness in the fourth quarter would be  in liquid deposits. In addition, demand deposits could be depressed by  corporations squaring up compensating balances before yearend. Consequently, we expect very little growth in Ml on balance over coming  months. M3, which is less affected by interest rates in the short run,  is anticipated to grow at a 5 percent rate through yearend, remaining  above the midpoint of its annual growth range.  Were M2 to continue growing at a 3 percent rate over a very  extended period, nominal GNP growth of similar magnitude with substantial disinflationary pressures would likely be the result. But this need  not occur over the short- or intermediate-runs. And, even a shortfall  from the 3 percent M2 path would have to be evaluated in the light of  other data before it could be taken as signalling a similar shortfall in  income or activity relative to expectations. At the last FOMC meeting,  there was some discussion of a more normal behavior of money relative to  income. The staff is preparing an assessment of money demand and velocity behavior for the next FOMC meeting. At this time it may be sufficient to note that while there may be very little long-run trend in M2  velocity, and consequently a firm relationship between money and prices  over time, the demand for M2 relative to income can still vary quite  substantially over periods as long as several quarters, mostly owing to  changes in interest rates, but also due to random disturbances and reasons that are not well understood. Just this year, velocity has already  swung from minus 1-1/2 in the first quarter to plus 2-1/2 in the third,  and in the past few years it has varied from minus 4 percent in 1986 to  plus 2-3/4 percent in 1987.  In the staff forecast, M2 growth is expected to remain in the 3  to 4 percent area in 1989 and velocity to increase substantially further. This relationship of money and income is the result of an assessment of the underlying pressures in the economy, and a monetary policy  that, as a result, is viewed as involving further increases in nominal  and real interest rates if demands are to be sufficiently damped to restrain inflation. As Mike noted, the rise in short-term rates has not  been reduced in the staff forecast by the incoming data. But, judging  from the movements in interest rates, and some other market indicators  over the intermeeting period, a significant number of market participants do not share this view. Indeed, going back a bit further to late  spring, a number of financial market and related indicators, including  long-term interest rates, dollar exchange rates, and some commodity  prices, seem to suggest a levelling off in concerns about inflation.  While these and related measures can be useful, and encouraging, indicators of market sentiment, interpretation of their implications for future monetary policy is subject to a number of caveats.  1. The measures are volatile and can turn around rapidly in  response to new information. Those of us privileged to be President  Guffey's guests in Jackson Hole heard ample evidence that prices in  financial markets fluctuate more than would seem to be indicated by  underlying fundamentals.  2. It is not clear to what extent the recent behavior of these  measures reflects an assessment that underlying demand pressures have  already subsided or whether they are also reflecting expectations that  monetary policy will be tightened in a timely way as pressures emerge.  For example both may be accounting for relatively flat commodity prices  in the face of continued economic expansion in the industrialized world.  An important role for United States monetary policy in this outlook is indicated  by the firm tone for the dollar, even before the recent trade data,  despite increases in interest rates abroad.  3. Although market expectations differ from staff expectations  about the course of short-term interest rates, markets still seem to be  anticipating that they will increase. The nominal yield curve, while  flatter than a few weeks ago, is still upward sloping. Expectations  about the course of real rates are more difficult to discern. The most  recent inflation expectation surveys do not indicate a remission in  near-term inflation expectations in fact, they suggest expectations of  inflation rates above 5 percent for the next year. Such expectations  imply real rates in the one-year area of only about 2 to 3 percent,  roughly in line with their long-term average. Long-term inflation expectations and real rates are even more problematical. The one survey  available suggests some edging down of longer-term inflation expectations, which may account for some of the recent behavior of bond yields,  and lower expectations over the long- than the short-run. This is  consistent with the notion that real as well as nominal rates are  expected to rise.  4. Finally, even if one could discern the level of real interest or exchange rates embodied in the markets, there is no assurance  that these are appropriate to accomplish the objectives of the Federal  Reserve. This will depend on an assessment of the various factors  affecting the outlook for the economy and prices, and views on these  naturally will differ. That's why there are alternatives in the  bluebook. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	149	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. With that we'll take our usual break. 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	150	ANGELL	 Are there going to be questions? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	151	GREENSPAN	 I'm sorry. I thought we might do questions after the break. We can do questions now, if you like. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	152	ANGELL	" Don, we have in the Bluebook, the M2 and other forecasted growth rates. What happens in 1989 quarter 1 and quarter 2 with, let's say, alternative ""B"" and what would happen in quarter 1, quarter 2, and maybe in quarter 3 if you put in the staff's interest rate forecast? "	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	153	KOHN	 I can answer the second one more easily because I have a table in front of me. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	154	ANGELL	 -Okay, that's fine; that's the most important. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	155	KOHN	 We have about 3-3/4 percent growth of M2 over the year 1989 consistent with the staff's interest rate and GNP forecast. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	156	ANGELL	 1989 over 1988? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	157	KOHN	 Q4 1988 to Q4 1989. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	158	ANGELL	 Okay.  	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	159	KOHN	 And that embodies slightly lower growth rates in the first half of the year than in the second--on the order of 2-1/2 percent in the first two quarters--and that's because we've assumed that interest rates continue to rise through the first half of the year. And then things level out. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	160	ANGELL	 So that means you need almost a 5 percent growth rate in the second half of the year to get 3.7? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	161	KOHN	 That's correct. Now, let's suppose interest rates were flat. I don't have a direct table here, but I do have a sense from our model simulations that to those 2-1/2, 3 percent growth rates for the first half of 1989, I would probably add about 1-1/2 to 2 percent per quarter if interest rates were kept flat. So I would have more like 4 to 5 percent. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	162	ANGELL	 Okay, so the 2.8 percent rate that you have for quarter 4 would tend to rebound in quarter 1. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	163	KOHN	 It should. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	164	ANGELL	 If we did not have other increases. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	165	KOHN	 Absolutely--with the increase in interest rates through August. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	166	ANGELL	 And it could rebound to 4 or 4-1/2? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	167	KOHN	 Yes, in the first half; and I would expect it to rebound further in the second half as-- 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	168	ANGELL	 Thank you. That's very helpful. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	169	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions for Mr. Kohn? If not, we'll have a recess. [Coffee break] 	2	2	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	170	GREENSPAN	 Following up on Peter Sternlight's remarks about the borrowing requirements, I think that policy generally over the intermeeting period has required very little in the way of adjustment. In fact, it's very rare that the outlook seems to change so little over so short a period. One thing that worries me about the current economy is that it is vaguely reminiscent of a sag that occurred in 1976--which everyone assumed was the beginning of a decline, and it was a pause which sort of disappeared. That was a bit more in the way of a real slowdown. And I think we've got to be a little careful that we're not looking at a false dawn. Export orders, unfilled orders are still very high. I see no evidence of any deterioration, even though there's been some slowdown in actual deliveries over the last three months. Capital goods markets remain quite strong. The order structure, appropriations, does not seem to be deteriorating. It is true that there is some marginal weakening on the edges in a lot of different areas--the textile-apparel complex, I think, being the most obvious and the most important so far as size is concerned. I think the crucial issue, which bothers me about the presumption that we would be in any way  accumulating a softening from here, is that the inventory situation has actually softened some. And I suspect that's in part the cause of some of the overheating or preceived overheating being offset. I'm a little concerned about the numbers, because whenever you get this high in operating rates, seasonal adjustments for July and August often tend to be a problem. The classic case is the steel industry, which normally shuts down for a couple of weeks as an ordinary seasonal, but in times of peak demand, such as now, it doesn't shut down. Then what you get is a seasonally adjusted sharp rise, unless somebody has the good sense to cut it. And it comes right back down. I think that's a part of the surge that appeared to be a real acceleration in June and July and an easing in August. I suspect--at least looking at the initial claims figures which I think are really relevant to this situation--that basically, the economy probably continues firm, although not as aggressive as I think some of us feared somewhat a little earlier in the summer and in the late spring. Corporate profit figures look quite good. The report this morning was showing that profits continue to move forward in a reasonably good fashion and that usually is a precursor of underlying capital investment--domestic capital investment --being supported. So, in general, I think it is very difficult to visualize any really significant change in the outlook. I think we're neither accelerating nor decelerating. As a consequence, I must say I would feel comfortable with just taking the last directive, changing the dates and a couple of numbers, and going with it. It is essentially a no-change scenario, asymmetric towards tightness, which I think is probably right. My only suspicion is that we're not going to see anything that will require moving in a tightening direction in the intermeeting period. But I find the possibilities of easing just about as remote as I think they can get. I see no particular problem in continuing to be concerned about acceleration but I think that, unless and until we actually see the events as they emerge--until we get some evidence that this is in fact the type of pause which, frankly, I think it's likely to be--it would be premature at this stage to tighten further. Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	171	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, I can certainly go with your suggestion. I, too, believe that we're more likely in the intermeeting period to need to tighten than we are to ease, but I would not take that to mean that there's not some circumstances in which we might be surprised. If there's a 60 percent chance that we would not need to make any move at all, and a 30 percent chance we might need to tighten, I think there are some circumstances that might develop--, that conditions might change in an economy with certain kinds of financial bankruptcies occurring and certain kinds of uncertainties. But I can-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	172	GREENSPAN	 If you're saying 60, 30, 10, I buy that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	173	ANGELL	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198809	174	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	175	PARRY	" If that's in the form of a motion, I certainly would second it, particularly with the asymmetric language. I would point out, though, that I really do doubt that we're going to be lucky enough to get through more than a meeting or two without further  tightening. I think there are pressures on the underlying rate of inflation that are likely to intensify. And I think that some of the potentially favorable developments associated with the price of oil and the rising dollar--as far as inflation is concerned--could easily be reversed. At this time, given the uncertainties, it seems to me that alternative ""B"" is probably the appropriate path. But given my concerns, I would very much favor the asymmetric language that was incorporated in the previous directive. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198809	176	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	177	BOEHNE	 Second the Chairman's suggestion. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198809	178	PARRY	 Third. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198809	179	SPEAKER	 Third. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198809	180	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	181	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, as I had tried to suggest in my earlier comments, I think the risks continue to be on the upside in the economy. I think we should not be lulled by this softening at the fringe, as you put it. So I would very strongly support your recommendation, particularly with respect to the asymmetric language. I think that we do have a period in which we can pause and take stock of what's been happening. And particularly with respect to the dollar, I think if we were to initiate additional tightening moves at this time we might get another increase in the dollar, with the danger of a ratcheting upward of rates around the world that would not be appropriate at this time. So I would strongly support your recommendation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198809	182	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	183	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, I agree with Mr. Parry that the Committee is going to have to be taking other moves toward tightening in the not-too-distant future, but the timing is not right for the moment. And I would agree with your position. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198809	184	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	185	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I agree with your position too. The only thing I would add to it is that these rates of inflation projected by the Board's staff, as indexed by the fixed-weight deflator, are way too high. So, I wouldn't be completely satisfied with that outlook, although that may be the most it's reasonable to expect. I would go right down the line with you on it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198809	186	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	187	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I also agree with your recommendation. I would add only one thing to it in terms of the operations of the Desk. If what we're doing would suggest a federal funds rate of, say 8-1/8, I'd certainly be more comfortable with a slightly higher rate than I would with a lower rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198809	188	GREENSPAN	 Further comments?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	189	GUFFEY	 I'll join. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198809	190	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	191	CORRIGAN	 I, too, agree with the prescription you've put on the table. I guess I would be more in the Bob Parry camp in terms of what I think the likely pressure points are going to be in the intermeeting period. If I could, I'd just like to add a quick comment on the point Governor Kelley and Governor Heller made about the dangers of a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit in the intermediate term. That really is pretty ugly in terms of a setting, not just for monetary policy, but more generally. But I think that of the things that could produce that result, one of them clearly is a rise in the inflation rate in the shorter term. If added inflationary pressure does begin to show through more than it has to date, to be certain that is a recession in the making. So if we're really concerned about a recession-induced rise in the budget deficit, that's just double reason why we should be especially sensitive about any further upward movement in the inflation rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198809	192	GREENSPAN	 I think we're still ahead of the curve. And that's extraordinary, if we can hold that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	193	BLACK	 Except that the fixed-weight did hit 5 percent last quarter. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198809	194	GREENSPAN	 Well, I'm a little suspicious of that. Until I disaggregate it, I don't know what to make of it, because all the other price indicators don't capture that number. Further comments? President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	195	HOSKINS	 I think if we're serious about the inflation objectives, over time we're going to have to face further tightening. That's what I suspect right now. There's been a flattening in the yield curve; there's been some improvement in commodity prices; and, I think that needs to be recognized. But if I push forward, it looks to me like we've got more to do. I am encouraged by the moderation in the aggregates relative to the past trend that Governors Angell and Heller raised. I'd have a lot more comfort I guess if, when we did see the signs of inflation picking up, we could move aggressively. But, I think, given the sentiment of the Committee, I can certainly accept your recommendation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198809	196	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	197	MELZER	 I'm in agreement with that proposal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198809	198	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	199	BOYKIN	 I would just express agreement. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198809	200	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	201	KELLEY	 Include me in. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198809	202	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	203	SEGER	 You can include me, too. I just want to mention one other thing that I haven't heard commented about this morning, and that is the risk to the thrift industry. That industry is already very weak, with many institutions on their backs. And a further significant upward movement in interest rates, as the Board staff presentation yesterday showed us, would add significantly to the number of insolvent institutions around. So I think that's just another good reason for sitting tight. Thank you. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198809	204	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	205	HELLER	 I agree with your recommendation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198809	206	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	207	JOHNSON	 I agree with the recommendation. I'll just add a response to what Don was saying earlier about the financial markets and some of the caveats that go with it. I think that's right. I think to some extent that the good behavior of financial markets has a lot to do with the credibility that we've established with our actions. And I think that if there are signs of market wavering-- thinking that we are not credible on policy--then it'll show up and that's the time when we should consider further actions. But I think now the signs look good, and we don't want to lose that credibility we've established with the financial markets. I think clearly this is the right type of policy for now. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198809	208	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198809	218	GREENSPAN	 Technically, we have produced the following operational paragraph. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198809	219	BERNARD	" The operational paragraph would read: ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve  restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from August through December at annual rates of about 3 and 5 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent.""
