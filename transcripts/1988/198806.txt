198806	0	GREENSPAN	 Good afternoon, everyone. Before we get started, I think you're all aware that all of this paraphernalia around here is for our once-a-decade picture. So I presume everyone's hair is appropriately combed or constructively disarrayed. Secondly, we have dinner this evening at the British Embassy and I assume that everyone has [arranged] transportation appropriate to their needs; if not, shout, and we'll get that all done. Well, let's get the minutes of the May 17th meeting out of the way. Would somebody like to move them? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	1	CORRIGAN	 I will move it. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	2	GREENSPAN	 Do I hear a second? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	3	SPEAKERS	 Second. 	5	5	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	4	GREENSPAN	 Without objection, I assume they are approved. Sam Cross usually has very little to say, but today I suspect he's got a lot on his agenda. Sam? 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	5	CROSS	" Well, it's been an interesting period, Mr. Chairman. From the time of your last meeting until the Toronto summit,  the dollar traded steadily but with an increasingly firm  undertone in the light of improving trade figures, some better  economic statistics and tighter Fed policy. But the market  believed that the Group of Seven (G-7) monetary authorities would  act to limit any significant increase in the dollar, as well as  any decrease, and that helped keep the dollar trading in a fairly  narrow range. However, on June 21, the Summit communique and  accompanying statements by officials were interpreted as  indicating that the G-7 might tolerate more of a rise in the  dollar than the market had previously anticipated. At that point  the dollar's uptrend gained momentum as market participants  scrambled to adjust hedges and cover short dollar positions that  had been built up since late last year. By this week the  exchange rate had risen to levels that led to substantial central  bank sales of dollars. Dollar rates today are around 6 to 7  percent above the levels at the time of the May FOMC meeting.  Going back to the time of your last meeting, the exchange  markets at that point were sensitive to indications that  international adjustment might be undermined by inflationary  pressures in the United States. There were concerns that  capacity constraints might limit further improvements in our  trade balance and lead to inflationary bottlenecks. By early  June, however, some of these fears began to dissipate, at least  in part because statistics on the domestic economy suggested that  these pressures were not developing as rapidly as expected.  Equally if not more reassuring was the evidence that the Federal  Reserve was already responding to the early signs of inflationary  pressures. Indications that the Fed had tightened its stance  appeared to provide considerable comfort to the foreign exchange  market, and a widening of short-term interest differentials  supported the dollar.  Meanwhile, the market was becoming increasingly impressed  with the dollar's continued ability to trade within a fairly  narrow range. Participants seemed convinced that the Federal  Reserve and other G-7 monetary authorities would keep the dollar  reasonably stable. Investors world-wide became less concerned  about exchange rate risk and more willing to respond to  attractive interest rate differentials. We started to hear  evidence of outflows from the German mark and from other  continental currencies going into assets denominated in the  dollar and other high-yielding currencies.  As these capital flows intensified in late May and early  June, the market wondered how the Bundesbank and other foreign  monetary authorities would react to the dollar's rise. The  Bundesbank felt itself in a difficult situation. With German  monetary aggregates already swollen by last year's intervention  sales of marks and continuing to grow more rapidly than targeted  this year, the German central bank became more and more troubled  by the inflationary consequences of a weakening exchange rate.  By early June, officials of Germany and a number of industrial  economies were also openly expressing concerns about rising  commodity prices and a potential rise in inflation worldwide.  Thus, although market participants responded favorably to  better United States statistics and signs of Federal Reserve tightening in  early June, they began to anticipate that foreign monetary  authorities would take advantage of increases in United States interest  rates to raise their own rates, and they continued to feel that  officials would take action to contain the dollar's rise through  intervention.  Reports had begun to circulate in the markets beginning in  early May that the Bundesbank was selling substantial amounts of  dollars. In fact, during May and early June the Bundesbank had  quietly sold all of its interest earnings and other dollar  receipts accrued since the beginning of the year. Then the  Germans started then to sell dollars visibly at the Frankfurt  fixing, and subsequently in the open market. In total up to the  time of the Summit meeting the Bundesbank dollar sales amounted  to about $5-1/2 billion. The market proved able to absorb these  dollar sales in an orderly fashion and, once the market began to  realize this, the dollar gained further strength.  At the close of the summit, the communique issued by the G-7  repeated the precise words of the last December's G-7 communique,  that is, ""either excessive fluctuation of exchange rates, a  further decline of the dollar, or a rise in the dollar to an  extent that becomes destabilizing to the adjustment process could  be counterproductive by damaging growth prospects in the world  economy.""  But though the same words were repeated in the June  communique, suggesting that some rise in the dollar was more  tolerable to the G-7 than any decline, the response this time was  different as conditions were in some ways different. In  particular, at the time the June communique was issued,   First the dollar was 8 percent higher in terms of DM than  at the time of the December G-7 statement, so that tolerance for  a higher dollar started from a higher base.   Second, the previously bullish sentiment towards the yen  had begun to weaken, and prospects for yen bond and stock prices  had deteriorated.   Third, banks' customers were sitting on large short dollar  positions which had been established since late last year to  protect them from dollar declines but which would result in  losses if the dollar were to strengthen much more.  Thus, when many in the market interpreted the Summit  communique, along with reported comments of various G-7  officials, as reflecting greater tolerance toward a higher dollar  than they had expected, a scrambling to cover short-dollar  positions set in and dollar rates moved up quickly for the rest  of last week. On Monday this week, the buying pressure was again  intense and the Desk entered the market, buying $170 million  against marks in operations that began in the morning and resumed  later in the day. On Tuesday, the Bundesbanks sold almost $750  million and other Europeans joined in. Together the European  central banks sold $1.4 billion that day. The Desk was at first  reluctant to follow up on these European operations lest the  market believe the United States was actively trying to push the dollar  down. But when later in the day the dollar moved up to levels  that exceeded those of Monday, we reentered the market to sell  $150 million against marks. On half of the United States dollar sales on  Monday and Tuesday, or $160 million, was for the Federal Reserve,  and I request your approval of these operations.  Today we did not enter the market in an open and visible  way, as we did Monday and Tuesday, but we did purchase  dollars, _ for $200 million, discreet  agents so as to avoid detection. We made purchases only as the  dollar was rising, and mainly at levels higher than those we had  seen in recent days and weeks. We think it is very useful to  accumulate these balances to provide more resources for future  needs.  The Desk has not operated openly in the market in Japanese  yen. The dollar has risen about 5 percent against the yen since  the December G-7 meeting as compared with a rise of about 12  percent against the mark. The Desk has continued to take the  opportunity to buy small amounts of currencies from customers for  the Federal Reserve. We purchased $8.7 million equivalent of  yen, as well as $1.5 million equivalent of Deutsche marks in this  fashion.  In other operations during the period, the Argentine central  bank repaid $160 million of its swap agreement with the United States  Treasury. The United States Treasury and the Bank for International  Settlements, on behalf of its member central banks, provided $250   million in short-term credits to the National Bank of Yugoslavia.  The National Bank of Yugoslavia drew the $50 million of its swap  with the United States Treasury on June 15. "	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	6	GREENSPAN	 Are there any questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	7	BOEHNE	 I have a couple of questions. What kinds of consultations and cooperation, or lack of cooperation, currently exist among major central banks of the world on these recent interventions? And a related question is what are we trying to accomplish with what we're doing or what we're not doing? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198806	8	CROSS	 We have had consultations with the other central banks and we've talked with them quite frequently every day. But we don't always have the same view of what's happening in the market or what should be done in response. I mentioned in my report that the Germans specifically had been quite concerned about the decline in the exchange rate for the mark, which they feel has inflationary implications for them, particularly with what they see as excessive liquidity in their economy. They think it is neither good for them, nor for the monetary system more broadly, for the mark to be declining as it has been declining under the circumstances. The dollar/mark rate has changed from its low point in January by about 26 pfennigs, which is more than 15 percent. And as a surplus country, they feel as though they should not be in a situation with the mark declining; they're a bit concerned about that. Our own activity has been aimed not at trying to drive the dollar down; no one wants to do that. But equally, it seems to me, we do not have an interest in seeing the dollar move up to unsustainable levels and then see it fall again. Our view is that a substantial amount of what is going on now is indeed a covering of shorts. We hear a lot of talk about what's happening in the options market. We hear a lot of talk about hedging operations by investors here and  elsewhere. And we think that a lot of this is a covering of short positions which were built up over the past several months at the time when the market view was that the authorities would not let the dollar rise. And therefore, [market participants] could pretty well have a one-way bet on which way to hedge. Once this gets cleared out, we still have a huge deficit, and we still have all these other factors that have to be dealt with. I don't think anybody thinks we're out of the woods at this point. So our efforts in the intervention activities and the other activities we've undertaken have been partly to give ourselves some more currencies. Those currencies could become very useful in future months when we could very well be needing them in order to help support the dollar. [The intervention sales also were undertaken] to show some resistance to the rise in the dollar, so as not to let it get to levels which are simply going to be unsustainable--because service problems could well disrupt the market again. That's how I would [unintelligible]. We have operated, as I say, only in deutschemarks, not in yen where the movements have been much less. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	9	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	10	CORRIGAN	 Just a further comment. From my own perspective, in this period of the last week or 10 days or so--leaving aside any particular exchange rate question--I regret that we have not taken greater opportunity in these circumstances to accumulate balances in yen or marks or both. If you take a long view, it's awfully hard to see that the fundamentals have changed in any material way. The trade deficit is still there; the current account deficit is still there. We still are going to have to finance, over the next 4 years or 5 years, cumulative current account deficits of $400 or $500 billion. And to the extent there are risks over time, I think they still lie elsewhere. I personally regret that we have not taken the opportunity--even if we choose not to use them--to accumulate some balances in this period. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	11	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's actually what we're trying to do. We would be in yen now if the Ministry of Finance were favorably disposed to our doing that. But I think, as Sam Cross points out, in this type of market, which is essentially a short- covering market, one would have to react downward; the [unintelligible] of the rise probably delimits the extent of the subsequent decline. And any accumulation of currencies puts us in a position where we don't have to swap or obtain foreign currencies by other means. I personally would like to see us pick up a couple of billion dollars a year. I'm not sure that we can; and I'm not sure that we can without having other market effects. But to the extent that there's a lot of short covering and rapid runups, rather than all of the central bank sales of dollars occurring other than from the United States, I think it's useful for us to get at least a part of that. And I think we're trying to. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	12	SEGER	 I think this question is related. I'm never quite sure about the decision-making process. Is the quarterback on these decisions the Secretary of the Treasury? Are Treasury officials the ones who decide the point at which to go in, or were we doing it based on the suggestion of the Bundesbank? I just missed that.  	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	13	GREENSPAN	 Technically, it's a joint venture. In principle, the interpretation of the Constitution puts the Secretary of the Treasury as essentially speaking for the President-- as the quarterback, as you put it. However, in the huddle, so to speak, we get a lot to say. And in many instances we recommend the plays. And I would think that we've been pretty much on line. In other words, if Sam Cross has a particular point of view--if he likes a specific strategy--more often than not we can convince Treasury that that's appropriate to do and get the authorization. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	14	SEGER	 Thank you. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	15	GREENSPAN	 Lee. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	16	HOSKINS	 Is the perception by central banks that this is a technical problem, rather than a change in trade balances that is a surprise or a change in monetary policy? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	17	CROSS	 Well, there have been changes in monetary policy which were intended to support some moves that have taken place. But certainly we hear a great deal to suggest that a large part of this is indeed short covering in one form or another--be it dehedging by investors. All of last year Japanese investors bought a lot of United States dollar-denominated assets, but they hedged a lot of dollar-denominated assets. And some of those hedges have been eliminated. Also, we've been hearing for a long time that corporations have been holding off entering the market. As the rate has moved up, there has been the need to buy some dollars in order to meet their needs and their requirements. But certainly it's our view that a very large amount of this is of the nature, in one form or another, of covering options and other hedging. The holders of those short dollar positions became worried at times when they saw that the dollar was moving up. And when they detected that, they did decide to short [unintelligible] immediately to keep the dollar from rising. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	18	JOHNSON	 You say they didn't decide to short? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	19	CROSS	 Well, because it has become costly. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	20	JOHNSON	 Because the dollar was under upward pressure, right? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	21	CROSS	 The dollar was under upward pressure, and also there was a view that the dollar could go up farther and that the authorities would not hold it. I think it was, in part, a change in their perception about what the authorities' attitudes were going to be. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	22	JOHNSON	 I'm just saying that some fundamental-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	23	CROSS	 If the dollar hadn't risen, then there wouldn't have been any need to short [unintelligible] . 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	24	JOHNSON	 Well, that's the point I meant. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	25	CROSS	 Sure.  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	26	JOHNSON	 Something caused that to happen. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	27	CROSS	 No, as I said at the beginning, there has been a firm undertone to the dollar because of some improvement in the trade figures embedded in the changes and a changing view of Federal Reserve policy. There already was a firm undertone, but this view about what the authorities would do popped up last week. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	28	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	29	PARRY	 Up until the recent change in [official] rates by the Germans and also the English, hadn't the change in relative [market] rates in support to our dollar grown stronger? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	30	CROSS	 If you look at the change in short-term interest rate differentials, the differentials have gotten much narrower vis-a- vis the mark since the last meeting. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	31	TRUMAN	 I think you're right. The first part of the period and before the last meeting they were moving the other way. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	32	CROSS	 That's right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	33	TRUMAN	 And they moved back over the short and long ends in the last couple of weeks. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	34	GREENSPAN	 Particularly since they moved-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	35	TRUMAN	 To some [extent] that's a reaction of the market--the other side of what's going on in the exchange market. It's difficult to disentangle the movement that's essentially the [unintelligible] from the exchange rate expectations. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	36	PARRY	 I guess the point is that there is some fundamental basis for what happened to the dollar. I mean it's not-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	37	CROSS	 I wasn't trying to suggest that nothing has happened in the dollar. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	38	TRUMAN	 We're just distinguishing between the period up to the Summit, if you want to put it that way--during which there was a gradual movement--and what came after that, whether kicked off by the Summit communique or other factors or sort of a general sense of reassessing these factors and what they implied for longer-term trends. But we've had the phenomenon of short covering, and that in itself could-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	39	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	40	GUFFEY	 Maybe a structural question, Mr. Chairman. Do we have any limiting factors as to how much foreign currency we can accumulate ourselves as opposed to for the Treasury? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	41	CROSS	 We have a limit. I think we're way below that. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	42	GUFFEY	 Well, isn't it-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	43	TRUMAN	 We have these informal limits of 12--  	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	44	CROSS	 $12 billion. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	45	TRUMAN	 $12 billion, but because the evidence-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	46	GUFFEY	 Set by this Committee? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	47	CROSS	 Set by this Committee, right. It's an informal understanding set by this Committee, so it is formal [in that sense]. But we are well below those numbers and we're not likely to-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	48	GUFFEY	 Is there a limiting factor as to how much the Treasury can accumulate? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	49	CROSS	 Only just that they--the classes of [unintelligible]. But they've got to have-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	50	GUFFEY	 Money? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	51	CROSS	 That's right, to offset the foreign currency counterpart. But there are ways of doing it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	52	TRUMAN	 They could work-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	53	CROSS	 There are innumerable ways to work out arrangements whereby both the Treasury's and the Federal Reserve's foreign currency balances could be increased. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	54	TRUMAN	 There are also [unintelligible], of course, the Committee's Procedural Instructions, which limit the amount of operations within daily and-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	55	CROSS	 We have daily currency limits, intermeeting period limits, and all of those. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	56	TRUMAN	 It works on both sides. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	57	CROSS	 We haven't reached any of those during this period. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	58	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	59	ANGELL	 Sam, you didn't mean--and I presume President Corrigan didn't mean--when talking about the fundamentals, that there isn't a change in fundamentals when for 18 months the monetary aggregate growth rates in the United States have been approximately 1/2 of the growth rates of other major G-10 countries. You would call that a fundamental that might be showing through, would you not? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	60	CROSS	 What I was saying was that, obviously, there have been a lot of changes that have occurred in the period, including what has happened to our trade [balance] and all the rest. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	61	ANGELL	 So you would include the fact that the trade balance does seem to be moving in the right direction as a change in the fundamentals, wouldn't you? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	62	CROSS	 I would indeed. But all I was saying was that even with that improvement, we still have very, very large trade and  current account deficits that have got to be financed. It has changed; there's no question about that. It has shown some improvement. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	63	ANGELL	 But you would also conclude, I presume, that the interest rate differentials that are necessary in a period of sustained dollar depreciation would be quite different from the interest rate differentials necessary if market expectations [changed] in regard to either the rate, a change of depreciation, or perceptions of stability, would you not? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	64	CROSS	 I don't know--I'm not sure how to answer your question. Obviously, interest rates are a factor in determining the strength of the dollar. And changes in differentials--certainly I wouldn't say they are not significant as well. I think they are-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	65	TRUMAN	 Actually, Governor Angell, I think implicitly in his report Sam said that, because there was a growing sense of exchange rate stability during the first part of the period. [Funds] were, therefore, then moved into the higher interest rate currencies. This is consistent with your proposition--if there was exchange rate stability it [unintelligible] shift from pressure on one or more rates. You would expect to see some adjustment in interest rates and that's simply what Sam is saying in response to President Parry's question and yours. The question is how firmly held those expectations are and how long they're going to be sustained. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	66	ANGELL	 I did not mean my questions and accompanying comments to indicate that I did not believe that there cannot be an overshooting in regard to a rebound from a previous situation. It would seem to me that one would expect that such sustained rates of depreciation of the dollar against other currencies over such a long period of time would not be followed by a period of everything stabilizing, but by some period of volatility. So I don't mean to suggest that I am out of step with the notion that maybe it would be appropriate to accumulate some balances if one can do that without creating the impression that the dollar's upside potential is very, very low--which could recreate this one-way bet that we've seen for such a long time. I think it's a very delicate matter. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	67	CROSS	" We've been trying to operate so as not to give an impression that we are capping the dollar, and we have been urging the Europeans to operate in a way which would not give an impression that we were putting caps on the dollar at a particular level. We have been offering some resistance, but we've been trying to do it in a moderate way. There's an old Scottish golfer's prayer, you know, ""May God give me the strength to hit easy."" It's an effort to try to resist, not to absolutely assure that we're trying to cap the exchange rate. That's certainly not what we're trying to do. "	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	68	ANGELL	 Indeed, you've done that. And my comments are not at all a criticism of the Desk's actions. I just couldn't quite sit still with some of the comments I heard. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	69	CROSS	 Yes. But it's certainly true that during the period when the dollar has been stable, as Ted said, the investors have become very conscious of interest rate differentials and the attractiveness not only of the United States dollar, but the Canadian dollar,  the Australian currency, and various other currencies where the nominal interest rates are quite attractive. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	70	GREENSPAN	" I think he's trying to say, ""Don't shank"". "	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	71	FORRESTAL	 Sam, there was an article in The New York Times either today or yesterday which suggested, as I read it, that there was really a pretty deep cleavage between the European central banks on the one hand, and the United States and Japan on the other, with respect to intervention. Reading between the lines, I wondered whether the European central banks are really urging us to cap the dollar. Do you get any sense that-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
198806	72	CROSS	 Well, I think the Germans in particular are much more troubled about what they see as the problem of a depreciating mark. They're very conscious of that. And they think the inflationary implications of excessive liquidity at home, which they think [unintelligible] plus a depreciating currency are very bad. They think it is bad from the point of view of international adjustment to have a big surplus country like Germany having a depreciation in its currency. They're very conscious of that and they view the problem from that perspective. We view it from a different perspective. Inevitably, we're going to have those differences of view. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	73	GREENSPAN	 Any further questions for Mr. Cross? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	74	HOSKINS	 Just a comment. I guess I'd feel remiss, since I complained on the downside of the dollar that I didn't see the gains from intervention, if I didn't make the same complaint with respect to the upside on the dollar. That's no criticism of the operation of your Desk, it's more a question about what we're trying to do with policy in terms of currency intervention. My concern is as to uncertainty in the market rather than smooth outlooks and also that we might convince ourselves, perhaps, that we can do more than we really can do. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	75	CROSS	 Well, I don't think we're under any great illusions about the extent to which intervention can or cannot make fundamental changes. Certainly, our effort has been to try to deal with instability rather than to add to it. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

198806	81	STERNLIGHT	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In carrying out domestic open market operations since  the last meeting of the Committee, the path allowance for  adjustment and seasonal borrowing was raised in two steps, by a  total of $150 million to a level of $550 million. First,  directly in line with the May directive, the borrowing allowance  was increased from $400 million to $500 million on May 25 about  a week after the meeting. It was anticipated that this step-up  in borrowing pressure would be associated with a move in the  Federal funds rate from the neighborhood of 7 percent to around  7-1/4 percent. As it worked out, the implementation of this  change, interacting with market expectations and to some extent  with seasonal reserve pressures, tended to produce funds rates  closer to 7-3/8 - 7-1/2 percent by mid-June. Against this  background, and also in light of the ""asymmetric"" May directive  and the continuing flow of information suggesting well sustained  economic growth, it was deemed appropriate to accept or validate  the slightly higher funds rates that had emerged in the market by  increasing the path level of borrowing a little further, to $550  million as reported to the Committee at the June 22 conference  call. This level of borrowing was expected to be associated with  funds trading continuing in the 7-1/2 percent area.  Borrowing levels have run fairly close to path during  the intermeeting interval. The greatest deviation came in the  first maintenance period when borrowing bulged over the Memorial  Day weekend and produced about a $580 million two-week average   compared to the $500 million path level set midway through that  period. In the next maintenance period, ended June 15, with the  path at $500 million, borrowing was about $480 million. For the  two-week period ending today, borrowing has averaged about $515  million thus far with the path again having been adjusted midway  from $500 to $550 million.  While borrowing was close to path, Federal funds tended  to run a bit higher than expected over most of the interval.  Even in the first reserve period, when funds averaged about 7-1/4  percent, that reflected a first week around 7-1/8 and a second  week, which followed the rise to a higher borrowing path, average  slightly over 7-3/8 percent. The 7-3/8 percent average persisted  through the second maintenance period, ended June 15, while in  the final reserve period, ending today, trading has more  typically ranged around 7-1/2 percent, and even higher in the  last couple of days as we were up to the quarter end. Some of  this added firmness apparently reflects seasonal pressures  associated with the June tax date and quarterly statement date.  In addition, market expectations have worked in the direction of  anticipating some snugging of policy in response to signs of  sustained economic growth and potential inflationary pressure.  Desk operations were confined to temporary reserve  adjustments during the period. Apart from routine exchanges of  maturing issues there were no outright transactions, as the  zig-zag pattern of needs to add or drain reserves did not present  significant opportunities for sustained moves in either  direction. For about the first week of the interval, reserves  were over-abundant and were drained through several matched-sale  purchase transactions in the market. Starting May 27, the Desk  was on the add side, providing temporary reserves on most days  through repurchase agreements. Until June 23 these all took the  form of customer repos of varying size. In the last several  days, the projected size and duration of needs were such that we  undertook some multi-day System repurchase agreements as well.  Responding to higher money rates and short-term funding  costs, most short-term market rates rose about 15 to 40 basis  points over the period. Treasury bills rose about 15 to 40 basis  points, with longer bills showing the smaller increases. Three-  and six-month bills were auctioned last Monday at 6.59 and 6.75  percent, respectively, compared with 6.28 and 6.50 percent just  before the last meeting. The Treasury continued to pay down  bills modestly during the period a net $1.6 billion but is now  reaching a point where they will start building up bill issues  again. In fact, yesterday, the Treasury announced a small  increase in the weekly bills to be sold next week. In  moderation, some build-up in bill issues would be welcome in the  market, relieving scarcities that have tended to distort usual  rate relationships as official holdings (Federal Reserve and  foreign accounts) have tended to absorb rising proportions of  weekly bill issues in recent quarters. Rates on private short-  term instruments such as Cds and commercial paper also rose about  30 to 45 basis points over the period, while there has been some  anticipation that a rise in bank prime rates may not be far off.  For intermediate and longer-term issues, it was a  different story with a variety of cross-currents and much day-  to-day volatility leading to little net change in the  intermediate area and declines of about 10 to 25 basis points at  the longer end. Initially, the long-term market was set back  when the March trade deficit was reported with its sharp rise in  exports, as this was read as implying inflationary pressures  ahead. The first reported upward revision in first quarter GNP  to nearly 4 percent reinforced this impression. The long bond  yield climbed as high as 9.36 percent from 9-1/8 at the start of  the period. But by late May prices began to turn around. For a  time the rally was considered merely a ""technical"" move in a  ""bear"" market, and some would still hold that view, but over time  some investor buying did develop. It was encouraged by hints of  moderation in the economy's advance, still-moderate behavior of  broad price measures, a reduced trade deficit for April with  particular attention paid to a reduction in imports and, of  increasing importance as the period progressed, a markedly  strengthening dollar. At one point, the Treasury's long bond  yield came down to about 8.80 percent, only to push back above 9,  and then fluctuate day to day to end the period roughly around  8.90 percent. Even with bond prices showing net gains, investor  participation has been spotty and lacking in real conviction,  from what we hear. Moreover, to some extent, the strong  performance of the long bond, with its net yield decline of about  20 basis points reflected a growing expectation that the Treasury  would lack sufficient authority to sell more bonds in August, or  perhaps for even longer. The Treasury's 10-year note came down a  more modest 12 basis points or so over the period and now yields  just a whisker less than the active long bond. Meantime, the  Treasury raised about $6-1/2 billion in the coupon sector.  While news on the economy tended to suggest some  slowing of growth and broad price measures remained moderate,  inflation concerns were by no means put to rest. The economy was  still expected to be strong enough to continue pressing against  capacity in a number of lines, and there is widespread sentiment  that the rate of price increases will drift higher by perhaps a  percentage point or so over the next 6 to 12 months. Higher  commodity prices, while recognized as largely reflecting the  drought situation, also kept price concerns alive, though the  market did not get quite as wrapped up in commodity prices as it  has in some recent past times. Against this background the  market has rather anticipated and even welcomed a sense that the  Fed was tugging a bit on the reins and indeed this may have been  an additional factor imparting some strength to the longer  maturity issues.  As to where the market currently perceives policy to be  centered, ideas range around $500 or $500-600 million for  borrowing, with funds expected to be around 7-3/8 to 7-1/2  percent, or perhaps more evenly centered around 7-1/2 percent.  The rates above 7-1/2 in the last couple of days are widely  regarded as temporary products of quarter-end pressures. There  is little anticipation of dramatic further policy moves on the  immediate horizon, but there is a sense among many participants  that policy will continue to edge to the firmer side as the year  progresses.  Finally, a couple of words about Desk dealer  relationships: Around the end of May, the Desk began trading  with three additional firms CRT Government Securities, Lloyds  Government Securities, and Nikko Securities. All three had been  added to the primary dealer list about six months earlier. With  those additions, we were trading with 40 of the 42 primary  dealers. In mid-June First Interstate Capital Markets withdrew  themselves as a primary dealer because of the pending sale of  their dealer operation, and then just a few days ago we added  three other firms to the primary dealer group: Dillon Read, S.G.  Warburg, and Wertheim Schroeder. This brings the published  primary dealer list to 44. The press has noted that no new  Japanese dealer names were added to the primary dealer list   although the latest list does show a name change for an existing  primary dealer to reflect its new Japanese bank ownership. While  not saying so publicly in so many words we have in fact deferred  consideration of another Japanese dealer firm that might well  have qualified at this time in order to allow more time to see  additional complementary actions by the Japanese in opening their  financial markets, and especially the Japanese Government bond  market, to United States firms. In the past, it has been possible to  point to such complementary actions when adding new Japanese  names and we'd like to continue this approach to encourage the  further opening of their market.

198806	82	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Mr. Sternlight?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	83	BOEHNE	 We went through some trouble several years ago to wean the markets from the notion that an eighth of a [percentage] point variation in the funds rate made a significant difference. Along came October and we essentially went to a funds rate target and an eighth of a point did make a difference. Through changes in language in the directive we've tried to move away from that, yet it seems to me that the last couple of weeks have indicated that an eighth of a point does make a lot of difference in our own thinking and the thinking of the market. My comment is not directed at the substance of policy; I think the snugging that was done was appropriate for policy reasons. But it does seem to me that we ought to be working against the notion that an eighth of a point makes a lot of difference, because I think that if we have to make adjustments in policy--when the Treasury balances don't work out right or for a whole number of other reasons-- that could cause us to box ourselves in. It seems to me that over the longer term, we ought to get to the point where the markets can see some movement up and down in the funds rate and not overly emphasize the substance of that in terms of policy. I don't think our actions in the last couple of weeks helped us in moving in that direction. I guess my question, if there is a question, is did it make any difference that we took out the sentence in the directive last time, and watered it down the time before, that we were going to allow a little more movement in the funds rate in the implementation of policy? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198806	84	STERNLIGHT	 I think it did make a difference, President Boehne. I think that's how it was able to unfold that in undertaking a change in the borrowing which we thought would be associated with a 7-1/4 percent funds rate, it got us to something more like 7-3/8 percent, or even 7-1/2 percent with the addition of some seasonal pressures here. I've heard a number of times the commentary back from the market that they perceive us as operating now very much more on reserve numbers and not as much on the funds rate. So, I wouldn't share your evaluation of recent weeks. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	85	JOHNSON	 It's 8 percent today. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	86	BOEHNE	 It's a Wednesday, too. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	33.0
198806	87	BLACK	 Your borrowed reserve figure is below target, too . 	6	62	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	88	GREENSPAN	 There is another issue here. There is a general concept in the market--which I think we want to reinforce and have been trying to reinforce--that we are gradually moving. I think the one thing we don't want to communicate is ambiguity on that question. I think that's what has been crucial, in a sense, as distinct from an eighth or a quarter [percentage point on the funds rate] . 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	89	MORRIS	 Mr. Chairman, this is a minor matter, but I find it rather curious that Lloyds, at about the time they're recognized as a primary dealer in the United States market, dropped out of the gilt market. I wondered what the--  	6	62	0.0	1.0	1.0
198806	90	STERNLIGHT	 Well, that gave us a little pause, too. We quizzed them quite a bit about that because we look for lasting commitment. But I think they're quite different markets. It was pretty obvious from the word go that the primary dealer group in the London gilt market was overpopulated and that firm along with several others did choose to opt out of that market. We thought they made a plausible case to us about the difference in conditions in the two markets. And they have performed satisfactorily, in our judgment, in the United States securities market.	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

198806	93	JOHNSON	 You mentioned that bond yields could have been affected by some expectation that there wouldn't be long-bond authority? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	94	STERNLIGHT	 Right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	95	JOHNSON	 Recently, though, I've also seen speculation that the House is going to issue long-bond authority. And to some extent, I think the bond market today can be reflecting the reverse of that. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	96	STERNLIGHT	 We were hearing that Governor Johnson. The [long] bond has declined in price today on reports that maybe that proposal would be put into this technical bill on adjusting the tax measure. From my conversations with people at Treasury, my impression is that they would not be at all surprised to see the additional bond authority put into that bill, but they have rather little expectation that it will work its way through the legislative process in time for the August refunding. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	97	HOSKINS	 Peter, have you heard much discussion on the street about a discount rate change? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	98	STERNLIGHT	 Maybe a week or so back there seemed to be sporadic comment of that nature. I would say there is not all that much of it right now; I would say it is not a widespread expectation at this point. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	99	HOSKINS	 What would you think the impact on the funds rate would be if the discount rate were to be changed?  	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	100	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I think if we're keeping the borrowing level about the same, there would be a tendency to have virtually the whole of it pass through-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	101	HOSKINS	 Oh, the whole change would-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	102	STERNLIGHT	 To the funds rate. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	103	JOHNSON	 I just thought about one other thing I wanted to ask, which was mentioned by Bob Black. The funds rate was generally trading slightly above even the narrow range that was suggested would be associated with a flat $50 million [increase in the] borrowing number. And we haven't really been around that borrowing number very much. I still sense that there is a bit of a problem with the borrowing function relative to what we might expect. If we were to run at $550 million of borrowing consistently, would we see slightly higher funds rates than what we would ascribe to $550 million? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	104	KOHN	 I think it's a little hard to say, because we had these technical factors, as Peter mentioned--the corporate tax date and now the quarter-end pressures. It's true that in the second maintenance period we had a relationship which suggested that borrowing was a little low. But in the first maintenance period it was high--that was reversed. So the more recent evidence might indicate to some extent that the borrowing was low relative to the funds rate, but there are so many other things going on. I don't think you could conclude that a further shift--now this would include in our calculations the additional shift that we saw last fall--that another $100 million downward shift in the borrowing function [has occurred]. We've just carried that through; that certainly has [not] gone away. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	105	JOHNSON	 Okay. Actually I guess that's still with us in your • 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	106	KOHN	 Absolutely: yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	107	JOHNSON	 Okay. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	108	MELZER	 I noticed in one of the recent daily wires that staff were somewhat surprised about the increase in demand deposits and the reserve data. I guess it's in this current period. Any feeling as to what that's associated with and what's driving the-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	42.0
198806	109	STERNLIGHT	 We did get that big upward revision in the path a day or two ago. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	110	KOHN	 In the demand deposits, it could be a problem with this tax date because the surge in demand deposits is in this week of June 20th, which includes the tax date for both the individual non- withheld and the corporate taxes. Whether our seasonals capture that right [is a question]. The preliminary data that came in yesterday and today suggest a runoff, though not a runoff of the entire amount. But the $3.7 billion increase in the June 20 week offsets a decline of $3.5 billion in the previous week. So demand deposits generally have been running a little stronger than we expected but are highly  volatile. A lot of the volatility, by the way, is at the very largest banks, so it may be associated with things like the tax dates. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	111	SEGER	 Picking up on one of Manley's questions--if we hadn't done this recent +$50 million on the borrowing target, where would you -;hink the fed funds rate might be today? Would it still be hitting 8 percent? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	112	STERNLIGHT	 I think to the extent that where it is now is largely a function of these quarter-end pressures, I would think it would be very close to that anyway--shade an eighth off maybe-- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	113	SEGER	 But I thought we took that move because we were worried that in the next few days the fed funds rate would decline below 7-1/2 percent if we didn't do it. I guess that's what confuses me. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	114	STERNLIGHT	 I think there was that concern that as a longer- 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	115	SEGER	 Did we not expect these special factors or-- 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	116	STERNLIGHT	 I think as a longer-term matter our judgment then was that staying with the $500 million could tend to push the funds rate back down. Then the question was whether that was really appropriate in light of the kind of directive that had come out of the May meeting. But I think it kind of got overwhelmed by these seasonal pressures as the month went on. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	117	SEGER	 Those seasonal influences were greater than we had originally expected them to be? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	118	STERNLIGHT	 They seemed so to me, yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	119	SEGER	 Okay. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	120	KOHN	 I do think the funds rate could have come under some downward pressure at the end of last week. I remember the phone calls we had Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and then Monday when funds were trading between 7-3/8 and 7-1/2 percent. I think if we hadn't made that change things could have tended more toward [unintelligible] and then they would have firmed up this week. So, with the quarter end, I do think there was a possibility--toward the end of last week, maybe early this week--of having a different situation in the interim. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

198806	126	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. We now move to the report on the economic situation with Messrs. Prell, Slifman, and Truman. 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	127	PRELL	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We shall be referring to the materials labeled ""Staff Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee."" We shall be referring to the materials labeled ""Staff  Presentation to the Federal Open Market Committee.""  The first chart outlines the key assumptions in the staff  forecast. As regards monetary policy, we have based our projection on  the premise that the System would place a priority on avoiding any  deterioration in underlying inflation trends a deterioration that we  think likely unless aggregate demand decelerates considerably. On the  fiscal policy side, we are not anticipating that any additional  restraint will be applied, beyond what was mandated in the Budget Summit  agreement last fall.  Under the circumstances, we believe that interest rates  probably will be trending upward, at least into the first half of next  year. As you know, it has proven difficult in recent years to get even  the direction of rate movements right; with that caveat, I note that we  have built into our forecast an increase in market yields of something  over a percentage point. Such a rise should induce an appreciable  increase in M2 velocity; consequently, we expect that M2 growth will  slow in the second half, producing an increase of around 6 percent for  this year and 4 percent for 1989. The velocity of M3 is less sensitive  to interest rate movements, so M3 growth should exceed that of M2. On  exchange markets, the dollar is projected to come under pressure again  and to decline moderately on balance by the end of r.ext year.  Chart 2 provides an overview of our economic forecast. As you  know, the Commerce Department released revised first-quarter numbers  after the Greenbook was published. However, because those revisions  didn't change the picture materially, we didn't attempt to incorporate  them in this presentation. Real GNP, the black bars, is now estimated  to have risen at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the first quarter rather  than 3.9 percent and we have projected only a modest slowing to  3-1/4 percent in the second quarter.  In our forecast, output decelerates noticeably this summer and  growth averages just a touch above 2 percent from now through 1989.  Although a decline in auto assemblies explains a part of the near-term  slowdown, another major factor is our assumption that drought will  substantially reduce farm output and that the national income  accounts will put a large portion of that effect into the third  quarter. Were it not for this stab at assessing the effects of the  drought, we would have had a bit more growth in the second half of this  year, and a bit less in 1989. As indicated by the red bars, domestic  spending is projected to continue lagging output growth, mirroring the  ongoing external adjustment.  Consistent with the below-trend output growth we are  forecasting, we are anticipating a small increase in the unemployment  rate, as depicted in the middle panel.  On the price side, data through May indicate a considerable  pickup in inflation in the second quarter, and we see that higher rate  of price increase persisting until the latter part of 1989.  A major element in our projection of weak overall growth in  domestic demand is a continuation of sluggish consumer spending, shown  at the top of chart 3. Over the six quarters ended in March, real PCE  rose at an average of only 1-1/2 percent per annum. During the  projection period, spending is expected to rise at that same rate. As  you can see, we have outlays tracking disposable income quite closely.  Real income expansion is constrained by two influences: slower  employment growth and a continuing erosion of nominal wage gains by  relatively rapid consumer price increases. This weakness in real income  is symptomatic of the terms-of-trade loss associated with the lower  exchange value of the dollar.  As indicated at the right, we are projecting that the personal  saving rate will remain around the higher level recorded since the stock  market break. To be sure, this is still a low level historically, but  there are no signs that consumers are on the brink of a further notable  retrenchment. The ratio of household net worth to income, shown at the  middle left, has recovered the ground lost last fall, and while we would  anticipate lackluster stock market performance in the projected economic  environment, the overall financial position of the sector should hold up  well. Consumer sentiment seems to be quite positive at this time; both  indexes shown at the right have rebounded smartly since last fall.  Higher interest rates will be a deterrent to household spending  on big ticket items and the item with the biggest ticket is, of course,  a house. We believe that the drop in housing starts to less than a 1.4  million unit rate in May was something of a fluke, but we expect that   after a near-term rebound starts will move back down to that level by  early 1989. The slide in construction activity occurs in the single-  family sector as mortgage rates push upward; high vacancy rates will  work along with rising financing costs to damp multifamily building, but  we think that this segment is at or near a bottom nationally.  One volatile area, and thus a point of risk area in any  forecast, is inventory behavior. As may be seen in the top panel of  chart 4, nonauto inventories the red bars rose at a brisk pace in the  fourth and first quarters, and we have estimated a further sizable  addition in the second quarter. To date, most of the accumulation seems  to have been voluntary. With sales trends improving and supplies  becoming harder to get, it is not surprising that manufacturers have  been building inventories. Moreover, as the middle left panel shows,  given the upswing in prices, the real carrying cost for stocks of  materials and supplies has declined sharply over the past couple of  years.  At the right, you can see that stocks generally remain lean in  manufacturing. Such excesses as there are seem to be in the trade  sector. The bottom panel highlights a few features of recent inventory  developments. Manufacturers and wholesalers have accounted for the bulk  of the accumulation since last fall, and much of the increment to stocks  in those areas has occurred among firms involved in producing or  distributing capital goods or industrial materials, for which demand has  been robust. In contrast, a lesser part of the accumulation has  occurred at retailers. Although apparel stores are widely reported to  be burdened with unwanted inventories, their stocks apparently haven't  changed: weak demand has held their stock-to-sales ratios at a high  level. Among general merchandisers, on the other hand, a combination of  sluggish demand and inventory increases has elevated stock-to-sales  ratios.  We've already seen the retail inventory situation feeding back  to some softness in consumer goods production recently, and that likely  will continue; but, in other sectors, the recent pace of stock  accumulation is in excess of a sustainable rate of final sales growth,  and we're expecting that, by the end of this year, a broader desire to  moderate inventory growth will begin to damp output significantly.  We're also looking for growth in capital spending to taper off  by early next year. As indicated in the top panel of chart 5, we have  projected a substantial further increase in real business fixed  investment over the second half, in line with the readings of recent  surveys of spending plans. In 1989, though, less favorable financial  conditions and what might be called the decelerator effect of slower  overall spending growth take hold to damp investment.  Equipment outlays are likely to continue to be by far the  stronger component 'of capital spending; although burgeoning exports make  the orders data somewhat trickier to read, the uptrend shown in the  middle left panel points to solid near-term gains in domestic  investment. We also expect to see some growth in industrial  construction, given the higher capacity utilization rates now  prevailing, but the trend in contracts shown at the right doesn't bode  well for total spending on nonresidential structures.  The bottom panels are -intended to convey some sense of what the  economic projection may imply for corporate finances. If price  increases and profit margins are constrained in the way we are  anticipating, then our forecast of business spending points to a rather  sizable corporate financing gap. Moreover, interest coverage seems  likely to deteriorate further, and these numbers bring to mind again the  financial risks that may be lurking out there as a result of the heavy  leveraging activity of the past few years.  Turning now to the final exhibit in this segment of our  presentation, the top panel of chart 6 summarizes the federal budget  picture. Our forecast puts the fiscal 1989 deficit above both the $136  billion Gramm-Rudman target and the $146 billion trigger for  sequestration. We can readily envision OMB coming up with a deficit  estimate that is below the trigger. However, Administration spokesmen  have been making less optimistic statements, and it could be that there  is more going on here than simply an effort to discourage the Congress  from adding to expenditures.  Be that as it may, we've assumed neither a sequestration nor  any other new deficit-reducing action, and even so, the outlook for real  federal purchases, in the middle panels, seems to be one of restraint.  We appear now to be witnessing the effects of earlier cuts in defense  appropriations, and nondefense spending is leveling out as well.  At the same time, there is financial pressure at the state and  local government level, too partly as a result of the oil patch  economic difficulties, but also reflecting in some cases a  miscalculation by states of the effects of tax reform. Despite the  substantial backlog of infrastructure requirements, we have projected  slow growth of real state and local purchases. This should move the  sector back into marginal surplus on an operating and capital accounts  basis.  Ted Truman will now discuss the outlook for the external  sector.Chart 7, after the divider, provides an overview of our forecast  for the external sector. As can be seen from the red line in the top  panel, the deficit for real net exports of goods and services has been  riarrowing since mid-1986, and we are projecting a continuation of this  trend. As is shown in the lower panel, real exports of goods are  projected to continue to increase rapidly this year and next at about 18  percent. The increase in imports of goods is projected to slow to the 3  percent range.  It is these trends, combined with the higher levels of resource  utilization now prevailing in the United States economy, that produce the tension  in the staff's forecast between inflation and adjustment. Pressures are  being exerted on domestic resources from the ongoing process of external  adjustment; the issue is the manner in which they will be manifested:  to what extent will they result in higher inflation; alternatively, to  what extent will restraint be exerted on domestic demand through other  channels.  That is the bad news; the good news, shown in the black line in  the upper panel, is that the current account deficit in nominal terms has  finally begun to narrow. We also expect this trend to continue over the  forecast period, although the pace of adjustment will be slower in  nominal than in real terms.  The more definitive evidence of improvement in our external  accounts is undoubtedly one of the principal factors underlying the  firmness of the dollar recently. As is illustrated by the red line in  the top panel of the next chart, the foreign exchange value of the dollar  in terms of the other G-10 currencies on June 28, yesterday, was about  7 percent above its average level in December of 1987. While the  recovery of the dollar this year has been substantial, it is not much  larger than the temporary recovery that occurred between May and August  of last year.  Although the riarrowing of the United States external deficits appears to  have been the major factor behind the performance of the dollar so far in  1988, the stance of the Federal Reserve and the relative rise in United States  real long-term interest rates, vfaich is approximated by the red line in  the bottom panel of the chart, also have been important.  However, we believe that the expected further progress on  external adjustment and relative restraint in United States monetary policy will  not be sufficient to prevent a further moderate decline in the dollar.  As Mike Prell noted earlier, we are projecting that the dollar will  resume its decline against the other G-10 currencies. To be more  precise, we have incorporated into our forecast a nominal depreciation of  the dollar in terms of the currencies .of the other G-10 countries at a  7-1/2 percent annual rate from the average level in June. That implies a  somewhat faster rate of depreciation from the June 28th level plotted on  the chart. Because of the higher rate of inflation projected for the  United States, the projected depreciation in real terms is only about 5  percent at an annual rate.  Chart 9 presents the staff's outlook for economic activity  abroad. Growth in the major foreign industrial countries over the past  year or so has been somewhat more rapid than had been expected. That  growth has been associated primarily with various categories of  investment spending and, to a lesser extent, with consumption purchases.  However, special factors such as unusually good weather and the  statistical influence of leap year may have boosted the figures actually  recorded for the first quarter of this year.  We continue to see a difference between the pace of economic  growth in Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom, shown in the upper left  panel of the chart, and that in France, Germany, and Italy, shown in the  right panel. Over the forecast period, we expect the expansion of total  domestic demand   the red lines   to continue to exceed that of real  GNP   the black lines   in both groups of countries. However, we  expect growth to slow over the balance of 1988 and into 1989 under the  influence of tighter monetary and fiscal policies.  In Japan, the package of fiscal measures introduced last year  successfully stimulated domestic demand, and we do not expect further  expansionary actions, given the buoyant level of activity achieved and  the rapid growth of money. In Canada and the United Kingdom, the  authorities are clearly concerned about a buildup in inflation pressures  and are moving to tighten monetary policies. In Germany the unemployment  rate remains high, but with monetary growth above target and given  previous pledges to return to fiscal rectitude, the expansion in economic  activity that extended into the first quarter provides a rationale for  the move toward restraint that is already under way. Despite the  persistence of high unemployment, France and Italy have little scope to stimulate their economies, given their growing external imbalances.  Growth in the developing countries is also expected to be lower  on average in 1988 than was recorded in 1987, especially in Latin  America. However, a pickup in 1989 should help to sustain the average  growth of economic activity in all foreign countries, shown in the lower  left panel, at about the same 2-1/2 percent rate as this year. Such an  average rate of expansion of foreign real GNP next year would be about a  1/2 a percentage point higher than that shown in the lower right panel  for the United States, reversing the pattern of 1987 and 1988.  The behavior of cxammodity prices, illustrated in the upper left  panel of the next chart by the staff's experimental index excluding crude  oil, is one of the background factors contributing to somewhat greater  caution in policymaking in other industrial countries. At the same time,  this trend in commodity prices is a source of strength for exporters  among the developing countries. On the basis of the index shown and most  other broad indexes, dollar prices of commodities on average now exceed  the previous peak for this recovery. Although much of the recent run up  in commodity prices has been associated with the adverse impact of  drought conditions in the United States, commodity prices had been rising  on average for more than a year prior to their latest surge.  An additional factor underlying moves toward greater policy  restraint in the major foreign industrial countries is the smaller margin  of excess manufacturing capacity now prevailing in the world economy. As  is shown in the upper right panel, in the first quarter of this year  capacity utilization rates in manufacturing on average in the six major foreign industrial economies exceeded the previous peak at the beginning  of 1980. For Japan and the United Kingdom, one has to go back at least to the early 1970s to find similar rates of capacity utilization.  Meanwhile, as is shown by the red line in the lower left panel,  wholesale prices in the major foreign industrial countries have been  rising, on a year-over-year basis, since the middle of last year.  Because of the construction of some of the foreign wholesale price  indexes, the influence of increases in commodity prices is larger than in  the United States PPI for finished goods. Nevertheless, the trend is indicative  of an end of the deflation of recent years and of the emergence of an  environment in which inflation is more worrisome.  This trend can also be seen in the gradual acceleration of  consumer prices shown by the red line in the right panel. Consumer price  inflation in the major foreign industrial countries is projected to rise  a bit further over the forecast period. However, as I noted earlier in  connection with my discussion of the outlook for the dollar, on average  foreign inflation is expected to be substantially less than in the United  States.  Against the background of expanding demand abroad, rising rates  of capacity utilization, and the increased price competitiveness of United States  goods, the volume of United States nonagricultural exports has been growing  rapidly, as shown in the upper left panel of Chart 11. As you can see  from the data in the table, growth in the volume of such exports  accelerated over the past year, and it has been broadly based, though the  pickup in exports of business machines and other capital goods has been  particularly pronounced.  Moreover, the value of our nonagricultural exports to all major  markets has been expanding at annual rates of 20 percent or more, much  more rapidly than the expansion of aggregate demand abroad. This  suggests that the dominant factor underlying the growth of exports has  been our improved price competitiveness. However, rapid growth in  domestic demand in the Asian NICs and Japan has boosted exports to that  area relative to the overall average.  As can be seen in the right panel, we are projecting a continued  strong expansion in the volume and value of our nonagricultural exports  over the forecast period. However, the growth will be at slightly less  than the exceptional rate of the past four quarters, in part, because of  a drop off in aircraft deliveries in the second half of this year.  Turning to agricultural exports, the lower left panel, we have  experienced a significant recovery over the past year in this area, as  well. In late 1987 and the first half of 1988, shipments to the Soviet  Union and China have been substantial. However, the backlog of contracts  for deliveries to these two countries has been largely eliminated. By  itself, this would contribute to a dropoff in agricultural shipments in  the second half of the year. In addition, we have incorporated into the  forecast an adjustment for the effects of the drought on available export  supplies.  Thus, as can be seen from the red line in the chart, the volume  of agricultural exports is projected to drop off, but the reduction in  value   the black line   is expected to be substantially smaller  because of higher prices. Next year, an anticipated recovery in the  volume of agricultural exports and only a modest easing in prices over  the course of the crop year are projected to generate about $42 billion in agricultural exports   close to the record level of $44 billion  tallied in 1981.  The situation with respect to oil imports is summarized in the lower right panel. Over the projection period we are assuming that the  availability of OPEC supply is not materially changed from the current  average of about 1.5 million barrels per day in excess of the agreed  level of OPEC quotas, and we are projecting that the average price of  imported oil will recover after the dip to $15.25 per barrel in the first  quarter of this year. We expect the price to climb back to $17 dollars a  barrel by the fourth quarter. This level of prices would be more in line  with OPEC's official average price of $18 per barrel. For next year, we  are projecting a further increase of $1 per barrel.  With domestic demand projected to rise about 200 thousand  barrels a day next year and domestic production projected to decline by  about the same amount, oil imports should rise to almost 8 million  barrels a day by the end of 1989. Their value will be around $50 billion  at an annual rate.  The next chart deals with non-oil imports. As can be seen in  the bottom line of the table in the upper left panel, the average price  of non-oil imports increased by more over the four quarters ending in  March than it had over the previous four quarters. However, much of the  increase has stemmed from increases in commodity prices as reflected in  the prices of imported food and industrial supplies. Nevertheless,  prices of all the categories of non-oil imports, aside from business  machines, have continued to rise more rapidly than the general price  level.  As can be seen in the table in the right panel, this has led to  a marked slowing in the growth of the volume of non-oil imports, with the  notable exception of imports of business machines and other capital  goods. These two categories, which account for about one third of the  total value of our non-oil imports, have been stimulated by the higher  investment demand in recent quarters.  The lower left panel shows our projection for the average price  of non-oil imports. We are projecting that the average price, measured  by the fixed-weight index, will increase about 10 percent this year  before slowing to about 7-1/2 percent next year under the influence of  the projected slower rate of depreciation of the dollar and more moderate  increases in commodity prices.  As is shown in the lower right panel, the expansion of the  volume of such imports   the red line   is projected to be moderate  over the entire period, consistent with the slowing of overall domestic  demand as well as with higher prices for imported goods. The small  increase in import volume in our forecast is entirely accounted for by  business machines. However, the value of non-oil imports will continue  to expand rapidly because of the continuing rise in their prices.  Chart 13 summarizes the staff's projection for the external  sector.  The trade balance   the black line in the top panel   is  projected to resume its recent trend of improvement after a pause in the  second half of this year produced by the fall-off in agricultural exports  and the pickup in oil prices. I might also note that our projection  assumes that the trade deficits in May and June were substantially larger  than that recorded for April. In any case, by the end of next year, the  trade deficit is projected to narrow to almost $100 billion at an annual  rate, compared with $144 billion recorded in the first quarter of this  year.  The improvement in the current account deficit   the red  line   is projected to be about the same. This improving trend in the  United States current account is expected to generate an almost imperceptible  slowing in the deterioration of the United States international investment  position, depicted in the lower panel. As a rough approximation, the  United States trade deficit would have to be eliminated entirely in order to  stabilize the ratio of our net indebtedness relative to nominal GNP,  which might be viewed as a sustainable condition. Such considerations  underlie the staff's view that the dollar will continue to come under  downward pressure and will at some point depreciate further in real  terms.  Nevertheless, the projected improvement in our external accounts  over the forecast period is substantial, and the issue is whether an  improvement on the scale we are projecting can be accomplished smoothly  while avoiding excessive pressures on domestic resources and an  acceleration of inflation.  Larry Slifman will now continue our presentation with a  discussion of the inflation outlook.As Mike noted earlier, the drought has had a noticeable effect  on our projection for GNP. It also has altered our price forecast. As  shown in the upper panel of chart 14, we expect consumer food prices to  rise rapidly over the remainder of this year. In quantifying the  drought effects, we have relied in part on the signals from the  commodity markets. Of course, if the weather turns out to be even worse  than the markets thus far have anticipated, the near-term outlook for  production and prices would worsen considerably. Next year, however, we  assume more normal weather patterns and an easing in government acreage  set-aside requirements. This generates more production, and in  response, food prices are projected to rise at a slower rate than  overall inflation.  We recognize that beef prices will likely move in a different  direction falling in the near term as cattle are sent to slaughter and  then rising sharply next year. Nonetheless, past experience suggests  that, overall, retail food prices tend to rise at the time the drought  affects crops, reflecting fairly prompt changes in prices of products  most directly associated with grains for example, cereal and bakery  items, poultry, and vegetable oils.  In contrast to food prices, we think energy prices will be  quiescent over the next year and half. As Ted noted earlier, we expect  the price of imported oil the middle panel to climb to $18 per barrel  over the projection period. Given this path, and looking at retail  margins and other factors, retail energy prices are projected to be a  moderating force on overall inflation.  In terms of non-oil import prices, the effects of more than  three years of dollar depreciation have become increasingly pronounced.  The lower panel shows a measure of import prices that excludes not only  oil but also business machines, in order to eliminate a distortion  caused by the fact that for computer imports the current practice at the  Commerce Department is to actually use a price index for United States produced  computers. Although we expect the rise in prices of imports to moderate  somewhat, it is large enough, in combination with some lagged effects  from earlier increases, to account for about half a percentage point or  so of overall consumer price inflation in both this year and next. The  effect on domestic output prices would be smaller for example, about a  quarter of a point on the GNP fixed-weight price index.  Your next chart addresses the issue of supply problems in the  industrial sector. To date, most reports of capacity constraints or  product shortages have been confined mainly to materials. To assess the  seriousness of the problem, the top panel compares the percentage of  materials-producing industries currently operating well above normal  utilization rates with the numbers in earlier periods. Eighty-nine non-  energy materials industries have been classified into four groups: the  heavy black bars are for those operating well below normal that is,  with utilization rates more than one standard deviation below their  industry long-run averages; the lightly striped black and red bars  indicate those operating at close to average rates; and the heavy red  bars denote those operating more than one standard deviation above  average.  As can be seen by comparing the two sets of bars on the left,  since late 1985 and early 1986 when pressures in materials markets were  almost non-existent slack has disappeared rapidly and the distribution  of utilization rates has shifted considerably, with nearly a quarter of  materials industries now operating at rates significantly above their  long-run averages. By way of comparison, in late 1978 and early 1979,  when prices were rising very steeply, some 34 percent of materials  industries were operating well above normal.  This same story of rising pressures in materials markets, but  short of previous peaks, is indicated by data from the survey of  purchasing managers the middle two panels. As you know, purchasing  managers are asked to identify industrial items in short supply. We  have gone through the reports for the past decade, and divided the items  mentioned into 21 broad categories. Currently, items are being reported  in short supply in 43 percent of the categories.  Another indicator of possible supply problems is the report on  lead times for ordering production materials. As shown in the middle  right panel, average lead times have moved up only moderately since late  1985 clearly a less ominous picture than that painted by the short  supply list.  On balance, the evidence suggests that the economy is not  facing major supply constraints, despite a few specific problem areas.  Nonetheless, reduced overall slack in materials markets already has been  associated with higher prices for many industrial commodities. In terms  of the outlook, although materials inputs generally are a relatively  small part of overall production costs, these price hikes likely will  have some noticeable effects on aggregate inflation.  As shown in the lower panel, there is considerably more slack  in the advanced processing industries. But even in that sector,  operating rates have been moving up for the past year and a half   especially in those industries benefiting directly from brisk export  growth. Given our projection of relatively slow growth in domestic  demand, the utilization rate in this sector is projected to level off  soon and then edge down, thereby avoiding any serious supply  difficulties. However, should this slowing fail to materialize, while  the external sector continues to strengthen, capacity pressures  undoubtedly would begin emerging before too long.  Your next chart focuses on the influence of labor costs on the  inflation outlook. As shown by the red line in the upper panel, the  acceleration of consumer inflation in 1987 cut sharply into real  compensation per hour, reflecting the tendency of wage increases to lag  price increases. Looking forward, we are forecasting little change in  real pay rates. Labor markets currently are relatively tight, with  reports of hiring difficulties in scattered areas and occupations.  However, in our forecast, unemployment rises a bit, and this, in  combination with continuing competitive pressures in many industries, is  projected to hold nominal wages to an increase no larger than that of  consumer prices.  The offset to accelerating nominal wages from productivity  gains is projected to diminish. As shown in the middle panel, during  the initial phases of the current cyclical expansion, productivity grew  rapidly as businesses were able first to utilize more fully their  existing staffs and then re-employ or hire the most able workers. The  result was that output per hour rose rapidly, moving well above its  longer-run trend. But with the margin of slack in many labor and  product markets relatively narrow, the quality of new hires probably has  deteriorated, and they may be working (at the margin) with less  efficient capital. Consequently, productivity is anticipated to drift  back toward its long-run trend line over the next year and a half,  rising at less than a 1 percent annual rate on average.  Reflecting these wage and productivity developments, unit labor  costs shown in the bottom panel are projected to rise at nearly a 4  percent annual rate. Thus, while price developments in the food and  energy sectors should be favorable next year, unit labor costs will be  providing some momentum to overall inflation.  Mike will now conclude our presentation.The top panel of the last chart presents an alternative to our  Greenbook forecast, designed to give you some idea of what the projected  rise in interest rates is doing to the economy. Because the lags tend  to be long, we extended our projection, in a tentative way, into 1990.  With interest rates probably easing back some from the 1989 highs, the  extension of the Greenbook forecast labeled as the """"baseline"""" points  to continued slow growth, with little change in the unemployment rate.  Inflation edges off slightly in 1990 partly because of some carryover  of the late '89 deceleration of food and import prices.  I might note that, in formulating the Greenbook projection and  the extension into 1990, we have adopted what might be viewed by some as  a fairly optimistic view of the implications of the current level of the  unemployment rate for inflationary pressures. We are, in essence,  assuming that, whatever its explanation, the recent tendency for wages  to behave better than most models would have predicted will persist.  The lines labeled """"stable rates"""" represent a model-based  estimate of what would happen if the federal funds rate were held fixed  at the current level through an easier monetary policy. In the staff  models used as in most other models wages and prices adjust slowly to  demand shocks, owing to backward-looking expectations and to contractual  rigidities. Consequently, an easier policy yields noticeably more  output and employment in the next couple of years, and the additional  inflation begins to become visible only late in the period. The drop in  unemployment to around 5 percent by the end of 1990 probably would imply  an appreciable further divergence of the two inflation paths in 1991.  Finally, the bottom panel presents your forecasts, lined up  against those of the Administration and the Board staff. The range of  FOMC forecasts is broad, but the central tendencies are well defined.  There is little difference between the central tendencies and the staff  projection, except that the staff shows somewhat more inflation and a  touch higher unemployment rate over the remainder of this year. The  Administration, on the other hand, differs substantially in its view of  1989, showing a good deal more growth, but no more inflation than is in  the central tendency forecast. You will recall that the Humphrey-  Hawkins Act requires the Board to tell the Congress whether there is any  conflict between the monetary ranges adopted by the FOMC and the  Administration forecast. Since the Administration's nominal GNP figures  are only a little above the FOMC consensus and within the full range of  FOMC forecasts, there does not appear to be a glaring inconsistency. It  is interesting to note, however, that in the Adminstration forecast  interest rates decline over the next year, which might imply a decline  in M2 velocity rather than the rise anticipated in the staff s  projection.  Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentation. [Secretary's note: No transcript exists for the remainder of the afternoon session, which presumably included questions to staff following this presentation.] [Meeting recessed]  June 30, 1988--Morning Session """	11	11	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	128	GREENSPAN	 Good morning, everybody. As you may recall we left off at the point when we were about to go around the table on comments on the economy. Anyone like to start off? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	129	FORRESTAL	 Well, perhaps I could start, Mr. Chairman. Before I turn to general business conditions I thought I might give you a brief•report on the drought situation in the Southeast. We heard some such reports about other parts of the country last evening. The first thing to say is that not all areas of the Sixth District are being affected. The southern portion of the District, particularly Florida, has enjoyed almost normal rainfall. And so far there has been very little direct impact from the drought, but the situation is getting increasingly serious. Winter wheat yields are 40 percent higher than a year ago because of the dry spring. The soybean crop, I think, can still be salvaged if we get some rainfall during July. As in other places, we are seeing cattle producers marketing their herds ahead of time and we also are seeing the use of hay that would ordinarily be used next winter for feed supply. The poultry producers seem to have a little more latitude, but I think they, too, will be under increasing pressure. One other issue that's being raised by grain dealers in our area is a fear that the Administration might try to limit--or even have an outright ban on--exports if the drought severely reduces domestic food supplies. I don't know whether there's really any basis for that fear on their part, but they are expressing it to us. And since they've only just begun to get a foothold in foreign markets they are, of course, concerned about their ability to meet export demand and to maintain their credibility as a predictable supplier. The drought is having a very bad impact in Atlanta and places north where the rainfall is anywhere between 50 and 75 percent below normal levels--not because there's so much agriculture up there, but because the streams and lakes feed some of the water supplies in downstate areas. I think the other important thing to mention--and it doesn't get a lot of play in the press--but in addition to the farmers and agriculture generally, a lot of businesses are being affected because of a short supply of water. This is a very serious situation not just because we are having a drought in 1988, but because in the Southeast this is probably the 5th or the 6th year out of the last 7 or 8 that we have had below average rainfall. So, it is a serious situation and we'll undoubtedly have adverse effects if it doesn't clear up. Looking at the region generally, we are seeing a slowdown in economic activity across the region, and generally that has been going on since the beginning of the year. Most of the activity that is positive is in the manufacturing area. The service area seems to be slowing down a good deal. We have lower retail sales; housing is not as buoyant as it has been. We're also seeing the adverse effect of a 40 percent reduction at the Lockheed plant in Atlanta which is, of 1. Secretary's note: Mr. Forrestal and other Federal Reserve Bank presidents commented on economic developments in their regions at a dinner at the British Embassy.  course, having a rippling effect through the economy. And just yesterday it was announced, as you may have heard on the news, that TVA is laying off a number of people--25 percent, I think, was the number. Looking at the national economy, our forecast is somewhat stronger for both 1988 and 1989 than the Board staff's. We also see some slower growth in the second part of this year, but our deceleration is not as marked as the one shown in the Greenbook. Our outlook shows more strength in personal consumption expenditures than the staff's, especially in 1989. I think the difference is that the stronger expansion we see in 1989 is due to a smaller rise in interest rates than was assumed by the Board's staff. Because of that forecast we don't see much of an increase in the unemployment rate, although looking at the CPI--I will stay away from the deflator, Mr. Chairman-- we would see stronger inflation than the Board's staff. While I'm happy that we're going to continue to have growth, on the other hand, since we are basically at full employment, I suppose I am concerned that we're growing at a rate that's beyond the economy's potential. That suggests to me that if inflation does worsen over the forecast horizon, rising prices, and perhaps wage pressures, will become embedded in expectations. So, my general feeling is that we should not risk a possible overshoot in growth. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198806	130	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	131	CORRIGAN	" Mr. Chairman, in terms of the kind of anecdotal and impressionistic points of view that reach us, I would say they are essentially unchanged in that the main thrust of what we hear is still decidedly upbeat and [unintelligible] in terms of orders, especially in the manufacturing sector. We took an informal survey just in the past 2 weeks of about 8 or 10 very major companies on a particular point of capital goods imports and substitution of domestic sources for capital goods imports. And while the results of that survey were not decisive, they certainly were suggestive of the fact that there is now some evidence that even in the capital goods sector there is some substitution going on in terms of domestic versus foreign sources, although that's mainly in components. There clearly are important instances of, say, heavy machinery, in which foreign sources are for all practical purposes the only source. Nevertheless, at the margin, there are some signs of a better [unintelligible], especially in components, in the capital goods sector. The two other things that are a bit different impressionistically--and this is a bit surprising--are that some of the commentary coming out of upstate New York, even the Buffalo area, is more upbeat than it has been, and that there's a bit more commentary here and there about labor market tightness and scattered signs of pressures on wages. But insofar as the forecasts themselves are concerned, I think that one thing is pretty clear--they have to be approached with some humility. If you go back 6 months ago, for example, and look at what has happened, compared with what was being talked about, then that humility is well earned in the sense that the performance over the first half of the year--regardless of exactly where the second quarter comes out--clearly is going to have been a great deal stronger than was widely expected at the turn of the year. I still remember your own comment at the time, Mr. Chairman, when you said [of the  forecast] that it might be an interesting thought but something was going to be wrong with it. What was wrong with it, of course, was that the economy was stronger rather than weaker. So, I think we have to take any forecast as kind of a broad-brush profile of what might emerge rather than with a great deal of precision. Again, the question is: Where are the risks and what are the consequences of the risks in those forecasts? As I look at it in that light, I think the risks are decidedly asymmetric on the side of an upward drift, or worse, in the inflation rate over the next 6 quarters, given current policy. Without making a big deal out of this, if you look, for example, at the New York staff's forecast, unlike the Board staff's forecast, it essentially assumes current interest rates over the period as a whole. Our staff forecast shows a real growth rate over the next 6 quarters in a range of 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent. But--and this is a very big ""but""--that result emerges in a context in which the New York staff's forecast has a smaller gain in net exports and has inventories declining in every quarter of the forecast period. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198806	132	GREENSPAN	 In inventory investment? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	133	CORRIGAN	 Yes. Hence, the implied growth in final domestic demand in our forecast is, in fact, a good deal stronger than the Board staff's forecast. Not surprisingly in that setting, the inflation numbers that fall out of our forecast are significantly different in that we end up with a fixed-weight deflator in the 5 percent plus range and a CPI in the 5-1/2 to 5-3/4 percent range. Again, I take those numbers with a grain of salt, but what I do not take with a grain of salt is that if the inflation rate, however measured, were to get in the area of 5 percent or more, just getting it back to 4 percent--much less price stability, whatever that means--is going to involve enormous costs to the economy. So, I think that is where the greatest risk lies. I ask myself the question: Well, how do those risks translate in terms of where we are now? And, particularly, what weight should be given to the changes that have already been made in policy insofar as that broad sweep of an outlook is concerned? I certainly agree with the thrust of the staff's Greenbook and Bluebook commentary to the effect that domestic demand growth is going to have to be further curbed over this period. I myself am not sure how much weight to give to the rise in interest rates that we've seen over the last couple of months, because in fact, that rise is rather modest, I think. Indeed, if you look at real interest rates in Ted's chart 8 in the book yesterday--or in any other formulation of real short-term or long-term interest rates--I think you can make a case that not a whole lot has changed. Certainly, the level of real interest rates now is not wildly different than it has been for the last 3 years. So there is a question in my mind as to how much difference the current policy posture makes versus where we were, say, 8 or 10 weeks ago. The bottom line as I see it, is that if--for policy reasons, or faith, or whatever--it turns out that growth is somewhat weaker for a quarter or two or three, I certainly don't view that as the end of the world. In fact, I think it's not altogether bad. It works in the direction of prolonging the expansion in general and it actually helps the external adjustment process. On the other hand, if inflation  crosses whatever threshold one chooses to worry about--I pick the 5 percent threshold--I think the costs of that are going to be very, very great indeed. And that's how I essentially come to the conclusion that the risks, at least in my judgment, are decidedly asymmetric. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198806	134	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	135	PARRY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but the pace of growth appears to be slowing. The region does continue to benefit from increased foreign trade; and high-tech industries are facing strong demand, particularly in the aircraft area. Also, wage pressure is building in such industries as forest products, aircraft, and food processing. We believe that capacity constraints are becoming a concern in the fastest growing areas of the District, particularly the Pacific Northwest. Business investment is high in plant and equipment, but firms are not expanding what we would consider to be aggressively, and we are noticing that delivery times are lengthening. With regard to the drought, it is not having much of an impact on the District's agricultural industry, although Idaho and Utah and also eastern Washington are threatened by drought conditions. Subpar yields are expected in much of the District because of unseasonable weather, which ironically is associated with unseasonable rains. But current high prices will make the farm income of the District actually rise. Turning to the national economy, if short-term interest rates move up about 100 basis points over the next year or so, we expect growth to average about 2 to 2-1/2 percent--perhaps toward the lower end of that range--over the forecast period. And we also would expect that the slowing in growth would produce only a slight increase in the unemployment rate. Without factoring in any implications of the drought for inflation, I believe that the labor market conditions, and also a falling dollar, will cause an acceleration of inflation to about 4-1/2 percent next year, as measured by the fixed-weight deflator. And I would also associate myself with the comments of Vice Chairman Corrigan as far as the risks are concerned. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198806	136	GREENSPAN	 Bob, did I hear you correctly? You said that the Twelfth District is slowing? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	137	PARRY	 The rate of growth is slowing somewhat. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198806	138	GREENSPAN	 Where is it slowing? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	139	PARRY	 Well, I'd say it's fairly general. We've seen some slowing in retail spending. We've checked with retailers and there seems to be less spending across the board in the retail area, although concentrated I'd say in apparel and, to some extent, automobiles. Even lumber, I think, is not growing as rapidly because they've hit a constraint. If you look at some of these [developments], it's basically consistent with the slowing of the economy from what we can see. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198806	140	GREENSPAN	 It's characterized by both supply and demand constraints, am I right?  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	141	PARRY	 Yes, but taking the retailer, it's clearly demand. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198806	142	GREENSPAN	 Yes. President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	143	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, with regard to the District economy--except for agriculture, and I'll comment a little later on that--I think, broadly, conditions in our area are pretty much unchanged from previous meetings. I've commented before on the steel industry and industrial equipment. Those types of activities are continuing to be very, very strong. And I think the improved export market has really had a very positive effect on the manufacturing part of our District. There are some industries that have been selling almost exclusively on the domestic side that are now beginning to export products, and this is a very positive thing. And I think the value of the dollar will continue to provide good export opportunities and also improve production on the domestic side. In machine tools, for example, where imports as recently as a couple of years ago had about a 60 percent participation in the machine tool business domestically, that number is now down to about 3 7 percent. So, there's been a very significant positive shift in the machine tool industry. And from all of my contacts on the manufacturing side, the tone out there is very positive; everybody has a good expectation that the expansion will continue. On the drought picture, I can add little to what was said last night or to what Bob Forrestal said. I think we are continuing in a period here where we have a bit of a window. I keep hearing about the 10-day window; it keeps moving out. But I think we are at a point where if we do get some rain the [unintelligible] can be pulled out of the bag here. If we get rain--and there was some rain earlier this week--I think the corn crop probably will be down by some 10 to 25 percent. For soybeans, there's still enough time that if we get some rain that could be a normal crop. But having said that, if we don't get as much rain as we'd like, even under the worst of circumstances, the component of commodity prices in the final retail value of food is such that we would not expect that this drought will have that dramatic an effect on food prices. I think the number that Mike suggested yesterday is very much within the range that we would forecast. I've been worried about the effects of this on the banks as much as anything. We did a quick survey of some of the ag banks earlier this week and I, frankly, was very reassured. I would have expected that some of these problem loans would begin to reemerge. The banks that we talked to said ""no,"" that's not the case--that the weak borrowers were really shaken out over the past few years. The strong borrowers are now those who remain and they have the strength to sustain a bad year such as this. That's not the case, as I understand it, with the nonbank lenders--the FMA, FHA, and the FMHA. There are apparently [unintelligible] some problems in loans to developers. The banks at this point feel adequately collateralized; they're not taking that much collateral. They seem to have plenty of reserves built up for this and they think they can handle the problem without an onslaught of additional problems. I also checked with the exchanges. I was concerned that we've gone through a period here where the margin calls were pretty  heavy. And the exchanges say that there have been no particular strains. The volume of margin calls has been high, but so far they have been met. The banks that deal with us are not experiencing any shutoff in terms of the credit that they're granting. So the exchanges, I gather, are coming through. Finally, with regard to inflation, our forecast of the deflator is a little lower than the staff forecast for both '88 and '89, but I think we may revise that somewhat. Nonetheless, it's clearly the case that we are on an accelerating trend line here and I think all the signs do point toward an increase on the inflation side. Capacity utilization for many of the industries in our District continues to be at very high levels and I am sensing some upward movement with regard to [unintelligible] prices. Markets have been pretty sticky in the past, but I think there's a little more give in this. A little more positively, I do think there is something of a changed attitude with regard to some prices over the last two or three weeks, in nonferrous metals and chemicals particularly. They have had a very significant roll up. I have talked to a number of people who have the expectation that such prices will stay about level for a while--not go down, but not continue the kind of increases that we've experienced over the last six months or a year. On the wage side, I think there is a hardening attitude developing in the wage contracts. Admittedly, the results are coming in very favorably--the numbers look positive--but I just sense that in the bargaining process labor has a harder attitude than they have had in the past. So far the unit labor costs have remained in check because the [unintelligible] changes have been good; productivity increases have been pretty good. But I think, intuitively, the risks on the inflation side just have to be on the upside. And certainly, the agricultural picture only adds a little pressure--yet to be determined how much--but a little pressure on the upside. So, I'd agree with Vice Chairman Corrigan that the risks here on inflation are very much on the upside, not on the downside. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198806	144	GREENSPAN	 I'd just like to interrupt for a minute, because a very crucial issue seems to be emerging here, and I was wondering whether we could just retrace for a second. Everyone is commenting explicitly that while the wage data don't show this, there's a subliminal sense of changing wage demand pressures. Could we go back--does anyone want to address this specific issue? Because I think it's a very important question as to whether, in fact, that Wall Street Journal article, which I thought was a little overdone, is anywhere near correct. What can you give me more than just your feeling? What's the evidence that you're-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	145	KEEHN	 That's the problem; there is no evidence. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198806	146	GREENSPAN	 But you're obviously speaking to people who are on the firing line. It's not just a guess; something is happening because you do hear-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	147	KEEHN	 I am talking to people--chief executive officers of companies--who are continually going through the wage bargaining process. Job security has been the number one issue and continues to be very high priority. And labor has been very reluctant to go on strike. I don't think there's necessarily going to be a change in  that. But they are just getting a harder attitude, because they are concerned that the increases they're getting are not keeping pace; and they feel they have a stronger position than they have had. It hasn't shown up in the numbers and I think that's the mystery in all this. That we've gone through the process-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198806	148	GREENSPAN	 Let's recycle those who have already talked on this issue and then I hope that those of you subsequently who have some insight on this will address this question. Bob? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	149	PARRY	 Two specific comments on that issue. First of all, in the state of California, the minimum wage goes up tomorrow by a little more than a dollar an hour to $4.65. I think there's no question that that's going to have an impact. I think most people are expecting that to have some impact. I'm not saying a lot of people are working at that low minimum wage, but it just has a ripple effect through everything. Another example I'd give is that there is a big strike in the lumber industry at the present time. It actually has been expanding in terms of the number of workers involved and it does involve wages. What seems to be on the table is a proposal which I think is around 4 to 5 percent over a four-year period, which would bring them up to where they were a couple of years ago--but that's sort of irrelevant from the viewpoint of what it does to inflation at the present time. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198806	150	GREENSPAN	 Jerry? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	151	CORRIGAN	 Well, I guess I'd make two points. First, I think that if you take all wage and related data as a whole, you can make a case that there may be a bit of an upward tilt already evident there. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198806	152	GREENSPAN	 I think there is. It's a lot less than one would get from any of the analytical equations or from history. The question is--as I hear this conversation emerging--is it more than that? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	153	CORRIGAN	 As I said, I was going to make two comments. One is that I do think you could make a case that there is a bit of an upward tilt already there in the wage data taken as a whole. In terms of the anecdotal stuff, again it's quite common for businessmen, small and large, these days to talk about the difficulties they're having in terms of attracting and retaining good quality workers at all levels. You hear comments, for example, that they have had to selectively bid up starting salaries. And at least in New York State, both upstate and downstate, for example, we have had in the recent past a couple of very, very large wage settlements in the public sector. This is the type of thing, school teachers and the like, which in a macroeconomic sense is literally a pimple. But they are very, very high profile and high visibility types of things. So again, I think Si is right when he says that it's something that is in the air; but I think it's here, at least a little, in the numbers, too. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198806	154	GREENSPAN	 Bob, do you have something? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	155	FORRESTAL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, in the Sixth District I can't really point to any hard evidence. I think you're quite right  in being concerned about that because it just isn't showing up in the data. When I talk to my directors at the head office and at the branches--and that covers a lot of territory--they say they're not experiencing any wage pressures in their own industry, but they have this subliminal fear, as you put it, that there is going to creep into expectations-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198806	156	GREENSPAN	 Something is causing that and I think it's important to figure out what it is. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	157	FORRESTAL	" Yes. And it's very hard to put your finger on it. I was with a group of business people in Nashville the other day and I specifically asked this question about wage pressures either in their own business or in others that they might know about. And the answer I got was ""no, but with prices increasing, and with the sense that inflation is on an upward path, that ultimately is going to be translated into higher wages."" So I think it's a fear that perhaps is ahead of the data. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198806	158	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	159	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, in the Eleventh District, not a great deal has changed. I think I reported that we had some improvement in the Eleventh District economic picture over the last half of last year. It seems to have flattened out over the last several months--at least that's what our statistics are saying. It's a little confusing, though, because in talking with business people around the District I'm probably hearing more optimism, other than in banking and real estate, than I've heard in the last couple of years. I think expectations are pretty [unintelligible] in the Houston area, and there the expectations, as well as the statistics, are becoming more consistent than throughout the rest of the District. Looking at the District and trying to project ahead, we think possibly we are poised to resume some upward movement. Our portions of New Mexico and Louisiana are both showing some growth, but I think for the states as a whole, most of that growth really is in Roger Guffey's and Bob Forrestal's parts of those states. Manufacturing has leveled off and that's where we were getting most of our improvement last year and fairly early this year. That seems to have peaked a bit. Energy has been stable. We've seen considerable job loss in retail trade and financial services; and, of course, construction remains our weakest sector. We're having a little negative impact from the drought, but it's not anything compared to what's happening in other parts of the country. We have some dry spots, although judging from reports earlier this week the dry spots in our District have all had pretty good rains; and those that have had pretty good rains were missing them, so it's kind of evening out. The drought, though, is pretty much of a regular feature down our way and our people know how to handle it and prepare for it and expect it--so maybe we're not quite as exposed. I did meet with a group of investment bankers and nonbank lenders last week and they confirmed what we've b->en hearing otherwise, and what the statistics have been shoving--that there's really little or no new lending to the small and medium sized  businesses. And we think that this capital shortage is likely to be an impediment to the continuation of even the weak recovery. So, that is a matter of concern. On the wages, I really have no insight into that, Mr. Chairman. In fact, it's not something that I'm hearing discussed too much down our way. Job security and hopefully trying to get a little more job growth are what we're hearing about, as opposed to conversation about pressures or moving wages. On the national picture, we're pretty close to where the Board staff is on that. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198806	160	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	161	MELZER	 I don't think the local District numbers provide a lot of insight; they're very much in line with what's going on nationally--somewhat stronger manufacturing growth, somewhat weaker residential and nonresidential construction. But, particularly in the nonresidential sector, we were late to adjust; it was quite strong while national figures were turning down. On the wage side, the only thing I have to add pretty much mirrors what Bob Forrestal said. I got this from a major consumer durables manufacturing firm, and it really is that people see CPI numbers that begin to approach 5 percent. His anticipation is that the pressure won't be very strong from labor; he's not seeing it yet. And in my judgment, that would be the reason for this, here on the wage side. Nationally, our forecast is based on our St. Louis model. And what we've done is pick monetary growth--I don't know whether you call it appropriate monetary policy or likely monetary policy--that's consistent with what we've seen in '87 and in the first half of '88, which is Ml growth somewhere in the 4 to 6 percent area. What that throws off in terms of numbers is something that's very close to the Board staff's forecast for the second half of this year. But for next year we're considerably higher--about a percentage point--in terms of nominal growth and somewhat higher in real growth; we're a good 7/l0ths of a point higher in terms of inflation, which is troubling, I think, particularly because of the kinds of things we're seeing now in terms of the behavior of the dollar and financial markets and so forth. There's a risk that in the short run we could get lulled to sleep. I think we need to be very mindful of that problem. But having said that, I guess I also have to say that in comparing this period, say, to the late '70s and early '80s, we're dealing with monetary growth rates that are roughly half of what we were dealing with at that time. So, I'm not sure in a longer-term context that we have to do as much to accomplish the longer-run inflationary goals. I guess I'm saying, in part, that I think what's showing through in our forecast are the effects of some earlier monetary policy actions going back perhaps to '86--some temporary effects and so forth. And I think that the process of dealing with those building inflationary pressures in the longer-term sense has to be a gradual one. In other words, it doesn't require the same kind of response necessarily that it would have in the late '70s and early '80s. And I suppose we've seen that in terms of our actions now, because very timely, relatively modest, actions have had a considerable impact. I'm not saying that it isn't going to take more  of that to deal with this problem we perceive of this temporary inflation getting built into wages. But that's what our forecast shows. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198806	162	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	163	STERN	 Well, let me talk a little about the District first. I commented on the drought last night and I really don't have much to add to that situation. Exclusive of the drought, although it's hard to do this in any rigorous sense, I think that District economic growth is actually accelerating. We have continued improvement in the mining economy, continued strength in pulp paper, wood products, and so forth. And it is turning out to be a good to a very good year for tourism, even though it has been too hot to catch any fish. In Minnesota, which in terms of economic activity is the heart of the District, if it weren't for the drought, I think you'd almost have to describe the situation as a boom. Unemployment in Minnesota now is down to just a touch over 3 percent. All the metropolitan areas, where the economy is reasonably diversified, are looking at very strong economies. So, that's a description of the situation. As far as wage pressures go, what we've picked up anecdotally from some of our directors and advisory council people is this: one of our manufacturers, whose entry level wage is $6 to $7 an hour, reported that he just can't keep people at that wage at all. It's like running an employment agency. They'll hire somebody in the morning; [the new employees] work a couple of hours and if they don't like it, they just walk out the door at the first break and apparently go across the street or go do something else. It's a very tight labor market in that sense. We do have reports, certainly, that minimum wage jobs are going vacant in the District. Our own experience has been that it's certainly taking longer, considerably longer, to fill entry level clerical jobs than it did as recently as a year ago. Another one of our manufacturers indicated that now he's just starting to have problems with the union. Now, I don't think it has translated into higher wages or anything like that yet, but my impression is that the union is just starting to get more aggressive. At least that's what he has reported. As far as the national economic situation is concerned, I find myself largely in agreement with the Greenbook outlook. And the Greenbook, at least in my view, does point to the right issues that we have to confront here. I think it might well be difficult without some further policy actions to keep the rate of increase in the deflator at or below 4 percent over some sustained period of time. Whether we'd do that in any quarter-to-quarter PERIOD, I wouldn't try to forecast. But I have a hunch that that's where the risks lie. And I think international considerations are going to turn out to be important, perhaps increasingly important, in this situation because I am struck by the fact that it's not just our economy that has grown more rapidly over the last several quarters, but a number of important foreign economies. Other things equal, I think that does add to demand pressures. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198806	164	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	165	BOEHNE	 On the District and the question you raised about wages, the concern about higher wage costs is certainly there in an anecdotal sense. I've tried to pin it down as best I can. I think to a large extent it's a state of mind, but when I ask for specifics, these are the kinds of things that I'm told: It appears that the greatest pressure is at the starting salaries at lower levels. For example, someone who runs a very large supermarket chain in our District told me that he had to raise his starting salaries about 25 percent--now that turns out to be about $1 or $1.25 an hour. But then, when you work that up to the people who have 6 months to a year and a year and a half of experience, you get a kind of stair-step increase. Another place where you hear of this is at services institutions. For example, at financial institutions, whereas a year or so ago they were talking about wage budgets with increases in the 5 to 6 percent range, we hear more right at 6 percent, and now I'm hearing talk of 6-1/2 percent. Another thing we hear is that this 5 percent number on the CPI seems to be one of special concern. While there aren't as many COLA clauses in union contracts now as there were several years ago, where they are in contracts, 5 percent on the CPI seems to be a trigger point. Since we've been getting pretty close to that in recent months, I think there's concern that the COLA may be triggered. Now, that will have an impact. Generally, most of the concern about [wages is coming from the] non-union side. I think this is not surprising in our District because, if there's one unifying theme among almost everybody you talk to throughout the District, it's very, very tight labor markets. Otherwise in the District, we have reports of very strong manufacturing and some moderation in retail sales--the same kind of things that you find in some other Districts. At the national level, Jerry Corrigan said a lot of what I wanted to say in terms of [unintelligible]. [On the inflation side we] see this accelerating trend. For example, the consumer price index the last 3 months was 4.9 percent versus 3.9 percent the previous year. The producer price index in the last 3 months was 6.2 percent, and in the previous year, 2.2 percent. If you look at the intermediate [level], crude goods in the producer price index rose at a rate of 8-1/2 percent in the last 3 months and 5 percent over the previous 12 months. And industrial raw materials are really at about their highest level during the expansion since the '79-'80 peak. So, I think that it's not just that we're fearful of an economy running up against supply constraints and inflation in the future. I think that we are seeing some very tangible signs that we're on this accelerating trend. And it's much less costly to try to keep inflation from accelerating than it is to unwind it later on. In the chart show yesterday, as I heard it, essentially the basic message was that what we have to do is slow real growth from something like 3 percent plus down to 2 percent or a little more. And I agree with that in general. The idea that that can be done with a 1 percent rise in interest rates over the next year--I hope that's right. But I suspect there would [not] be a very large kick from that small of an increase in interest rates. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198806	166	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	167	MORRIS	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I think the data for the last two months are pretty close to ideal. We've had a slowdown in consumer spending and an increase in exports, and we've had moderation  in the growth of orders since December. I was quite alarmed at the rate of growth of new orders for durable goods and capital goods last year. That was clearly something that was not sustainable. And so the inflection toward slower growth that we've seen since December is welcomed. We're seeing the first signs of the impact of a slowdown in military spending. General Electric laid-off 800 people from a defense electric factory. It's the first layoff in the defense industry that I've seen. So I think that the military budget stimulus to the economy has peaked and will probably be a somewhat negative influence in the next few years. And that will perhaps give us a little more breathing room in the industrial sector--breathing room we need very much. I think we're at a point now where the economy really can't sustain a growth rate of more than 2 percent without generating inflationary pressures. And I think we've got to lean against any period of growth in excess of that. I sense that there has been a deceleration in recent months and I hope that continues. I've been going around New England on a private campaign to avoid a future commercial building glut in our District. We have the kind of euphoria in commercial building now that they had in Texas in earlier years. And I think there's not a proper recognition that the New England economy from this point really is going to be a very slowly growing economy. That's the speech that Mr. [unintelligible] referred to yesterday. We're at a 2.9 percent unemployment rate. In addition to that, we've got a slower natural growth rate of the labor force than the rest of the country because our birth rate has been relatively low. That's compounded by the fact that our labor force participation rate is substantially higher than the national rate. We're running about 2 percentage points higher in the participation rate for men and about 3-1/2 percentage points higher for women. So, the only way we can grow as fast as the national economy is by having a very large in-migration of population. So the arithmetic of the New England economy is very clear. We're going to be a slow-growing--prosperous, but slow-growing-- economy for the next decade. But I see the commercial developers making plans on the assumption that we're going to grow as fast as we have in the past 15 years. That's why I'm out trying to generate a little caution among the lenders, because I think the history of Dallas and every other place is that as long as the lenders will provide the developers money, they're going to build. I can remember very well the time a couple of years ago when Bob Boykin expressed his dismay at the fact that a new office building was just getting started in Dallas despite the drop in the price of oil and despite the fact that the vacancy rate was over 20 percent. So we're trying to do what we can to have a building boom that doesn't end in a glut. I'm not sure we'll be successful, but we're trying. In the regional area, we have an expectation of a rising rate of wage increases for which we can't provide any documentation either. Steve McNees generated a wage forecasting model a number of years ago and it performed very well until the last few years where the model says that wages should have been going up much faster than they have been. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198806	168	GREENSPAN	 That's true with every model.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	169	MORRIS	 Yes. And I think that is really the basis for our concern, because you really can't look at the data and say we're at an inflection point. I think that may be the basis for concern generally. Wages should have been growing more rapidly for a 6th year of expansion than they have, and ergo, they will be growing a lot faster. I think quite clearly our job is to keep a sharp eye out for the growth rate in the economy and to lean against it if it gets [too high]. I don't know whether the 2 percent guideline is the proper one; I'm inclined to think that, given the arithmetic on productivity and labor force growth, we can't come out with a number a lot higher than that. I really question, unless we get a much better productivity performance than we've had, whether the 2-1/2 percent the staff is using is not too high--whether two percent may be more realistic. But I think we're at a point now where we've got to lean against any rate of growth in excess of 2 percent. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	1.0
198806	170	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	171	JOHNSON	 Well, let me just say that I see things that are similar to many of the presidents. First, on this growth issue, clearly the pace of growth we've had has shown itself to be too strong to be sustainable without an acceleration in inflation. But what kind of growth is necessary to keep inflation from accelerating--or even to allow it to decelerate from current levels--I have no idea. I would hate to get into trying to fix on any number to shoot for to set monetary policy. I think what we ought to do is take action until we see the response we're looking for in terms of financial market expectations and the environment for decelerating inflation, regardless of what the growth rate consequences happen to be. But, like everyone else, I think the economy has certainly looked strong, with manufacturing at a high level and exports near a boom. But I acknowledge exactly what Frank was saying: that this year so far we've seen a leveling off and a beginning of a slowing in manufacturing; and orders have started to trend down. Payroll employment growth rates have slowed. We still have significant growth in employment, but it has slowed. The housing market is certainly at lower levels. Domestic demand is continuing to grow at the slow pace of '87. So, I think we're getting the kind of domestic demand growth performance that we've been seeking with our policy, and that's very encouraging. The markets themselves are starting to acknowledge the effectiveness of our policy, in my opinion. We have finally, I think, seen the financial markets start to react to the firmness of our policies. And in my opinion, we've seen a fundamental shift in the exchange rate, and it has been acknowledged in the bond markets to some degree. That could all turn around if we get a whole set or series of bad trade numbers and if things don't look like they're continuing to progress some on the external side. Nevertheless, I think that we've gotten the kind of response in the financial markets that we've been seeking with our policy. One of the things that concerns me a little and makes me want to be cautious at this stage is the fact that because we're getting that response, and the dollar has strengthened, and the yield curve has flattened out--all of which I think are desirable characteristics and exactly what we want to see from our policy--this response is  nevertheless going to put pressure on foreign central banks to tighten up their own monetary policies. The Bundesbank raised the discount rate this morning. I think that's probably desirable given the fact, as Gary pointed out, that some of those economies have been growing at a faster pace. Nevertheless, it's going to have the effect of damping domestic demand abroad. So, I think the stronger dollar in the United States and the response by foreign central banks to tighten, to shield themselves from the potential transmission of inflationary pressures there, are going to damp foreign domestic demand. The combination of our slow domestic demand and a more damped foreign domestic demand, I think, is what we want; but it's in the works. There's going to be a lag there, and I think that we have to be very careful not to go the point where we're going to combine our fairly slow domestic demand growth with a decelerating foreign domestic demand and leave ourselves without a trade adjustment. And I think there is some risk of that, although we can always get the trade adjustment by dramatically weaker United States domestic demand for imports. But I think that's not what we're looking for. So, I think the lagged effect of our policy action is in the works and what we're seeing on the inflation side now is to some extent--as has already been mentioned--the lagged effect of past policy actions. And what we've done in the recent past now is going to show through with a lag. The financial markets, I think, are showing confidence in the fact that we have been effective in our policies; otherwise, I can't imagine why the long bond markets and the dollar would be behaving as well as they have. It's true that commodity prices have been accelerating sharply. I attribute a lot of that to the drought conditions and they are less forward looking than the others; commodity futures, I think, only go out a couple of years. And they can turn on a dime. We've had two sharp declines--to the limit--on the CRB index the last couple of days just because of a little rain in the Midwest. So I think we have to be fairly careful at this point because there are lags and we have to take them into account. On the wage side, once again, I don't see any acceleration in wages from the [published] numbers. There are some slight curves in the numbers, but those don't look any wavier than they have since 1983. But I do sense some more nervousness. We're 6 years down the road in the expansion and there's no doubt that industry is more nervous about the progress on the wage front from this point on. But the Conference of Chairmen met here recently, and without exception, they all said that they saw no pressure on wages, just like you have all said. Yet there was a sense that, if workers felt they were going to fall behind relative to price pressures and their real wages were to deteriorate for another year, you might see a much more militant labor situation. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	172	JOHNSON	 I think pointed out in that conference meeting that he had been expecting wage pressures in '87. They thought that they were going to arise because of the upward pressure on oil prices, which caused the CPI to grow faster than nominal wages that year.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	173	GREENSPAN	 He's the head of the 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	174	JOHNSON	 He said he was surprised that the pressure didn't materialize. And I think that's what is going wrong with the models, for some reason. I don't know how long you can get by with that, but the fact is, the wage pressures are not yet there. But I think another year of accelerating prices relative to nominal wages might be a problem. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	175	GREENSPAN	 I think the wage models don't have in them the ratio of imports to domestic demand, if you're going to do it that way. Because that's clearly what's doing that'. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	176	KELLEY	 Manley, excuse me for interrupting you, but went further than that. He said there will be no inflation pressures generated by wage pressures. He made that flat statement. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198806	177	JOHNSON	 Yes, I think that's right. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	178	BLACK	" Well, one thing to bear in mind is that he have been taking a big share of the business down there. Yesterday, I talked to him and he closed the conversation by saying ""I'm getting extremely worried about inflation."" "	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198806	179	JOHNSON	 He is. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	180	KELLEY	 That's a fast turnaround in two weeks. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198806	181	BLACK	 He doesn't expect his own or his associates' [wages to go up], but he's worried about the inflationary pressures emanating elsewhere with no increases in salaries or wages for his own people. That's one of the problems. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198806	182	JOHNSON	 Right, he is. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	183	JOHNSON	  	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198806	184	BLACK	 No, he is very responsible; I respect his judgment. So, on the wage front, once again I say there's nothing yet, but you do get the feeling that something is out there. At the same time, I think all of the strong good feelings going on now are a cumulative effect of the positive growth we've seen in the past. And where we go from here, I think, is going to be the lagged response to what we've been doing over the last 6 months or so. And so we've got to be careful. I do think that probably the risks are still more on the upside than the downside as well. But I think that we need to be very careful from this point on that we pay attention to the lags that are taking place in the forward-looking markets where we have been effective in my opinion. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198806	185	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	186	BLACK	 Turning to the District, Mr. Chairman, I think it's safe to say, in summary, that our grassroots contacts don't  really see any slowing in the expansion, in contrast to what the national figures seem to be showing. There are widespread reports of extremely high levels of capacity operation in textiles, furniture, chemicals, paper--that sort of thing; difficulty in hiring workers; upward pressure on wages--and our most concrete example is in the case of the fast food industries where they have had to push their wages up well above the minimum in a number of places; and also reports of shortages of chemicals in certain areas. For example, and his suppliers of certain [raw materials] that he uses put him on quotas so he can't produce enough to satisfy his demand. In the case of housing, all of you in Washington are familiar with what has happened around here. They can't keep up with demand. And pretty much the same sort of thing has happened in the Richmond, Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh, Chapel Hill, and Durham areas, where the economy is really booming. Home prices in Washington in the last couple of years have gone up about 1/3 and pretty much the same sort of thing is true in Richmond. That's what they seem to feel, but I think Frank is right in saying the statistics do show some slowing there. Insofar as our particular projections are concerned, there's not a lot of difference in what we've projected and what the Board staff has done, except that we do expect more inflation next year than they have put in [their forecast]. Interestingly enough, Tom Melzer and I ended up with exactly the same amount of additional inflation for next year. The most important thing, I think, in the staff's analysis is their assumption that we need to have some tightening actions in order to bring about the results that they're projecting. An analysis we have conducted at our own Bank reaches the same sort of conclusion. My guess is that if there's going to be an error, I would come out about where Jerry Corrigan and some of the rest of you did: that the Board staff's forecast--and ours as well--might be actually forecasting less inflation than we're apt really to have. At the rate we're going, the Greenbook shows a very smooth transition from this expansion driven by domestic demand toward one driven by foreign demand. Except for a brief upswing in the third quarter, the rate of growth in gross private domestic purchases is expected to slow down significantly as the result of a weakening in consumer demand and business fixed investment. And, of course, that's a perfectly plausible scenario, and it would be a very excellent one if it works out. But, as I'm sure everyone would have to agree, it's far from a safe bet. I guess we would conclude that business fixed investment in particular, given the high levels of capacity utilization, is apt to be somewhat stronger than we're thinking. So, in short, while we think the Greenbook forecast is very reasonable and very defensible, that's probably the best that we could hope for; and our fears are that we're not going to do that well on the inflation side. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198806	187	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	188	HOSKINS	" Let me start with the labor issue. We don't have any specific information, at least that I've generated, on it. But in the Fourth District, particularly in Cleveland and Pittsburgh, we have very large manufacturing firms where over a period of years  I've heard a number of them say directly that ""We've learned our lesson with respect to wages and inflation and we won't repeat that mistake."" I think that might explain partially why you see lags the way you see them. People--labor and management--are still working in Cleveland to insure that they gain market share and retain jobs. However, I don't think that can go on forever and we're liable to see a snapback rather quickly when we get to that limit. But I don't have any information from these people that we're at that limit today. I haven't asked specifically, but the fact that they haven't brought this up in conversations, I think, is indicative that they're not overly concerned at this particular point in time. Overall, the District continues to be very strong in capital goods and also very strong in exports. The stainless steel strip indicator, which is something that I casually follow, was up around 35 percent in terms of new orders against a 5-year average in the last 3 months. Lead times haven't lengthened, however. The price increase in the last 18 months in that particular product has been 80 percent. And exports in stainless, at least from this company, are up 65 percent. So a lot of things are working now correctly in the District. Some aren't working out so well. As in other Districts, retail sales seem a little softer and construction is softer. I guess I'm a little uncomfortable in analyzing, or going through what seems to be kind of a Phillip's curve framework here, when we talk about resource constraints versus inflation. I think Governor Johnson put it back on the track. Our concerns, or at least mine, focus around the fact that we have had a couple of years of 4 percent inflation. We don't seem to be making much progress toward [reducing] it. And I think that's the real focus, at least in my view, for monetary policy. As we look ahead, even the Board staff's forecast, with a substantial tightening in it, produces another 4 percent next year at the very minimum. The Board staff's forecast on CPI ex. energy and e_x food is 5 percent. So that leaves me with the position that says I think we have to be very concerned about inflation. I don't know how much we may have to move again; I'm not sure how much we really have moved in the past 6 months. I know where interest rates are, but I don't know how much the market did to put them there versus policy moves. So, I think what it boils down to is that expectations are important for us right now. And what we signal to the markets, I think, is important. I'm not sure of the magnitudes that we ought to be signaling, but I certainly would err on the side of moving earlier rather than later. So, I see strengths across the board but not a boom; and I do continue to worry about the errors on the international side being somewhat higher in terms of real growth than we think at this point in time. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
198806	189	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	190	ANGELL	 It seems to me that in the last 6 months we've had a rather noticeable shift, at least on the part of the staff. I felt that 6 months ago the staff were not sure about the Board's and the FOMC's resolve on inflation. And I'm very appreciative of the fact that the staff have read this resolve of the FOMC in regard to inflation and that they have given us a monetary policy projection that's somewhat consistent with that. As I look at the Greenbook numbers, I don't focus on the number you focus on, which is real GNP targeting. I'm somewhat like Lee Hoskins and Manley Johnson in that  regard. But there is one number here in the Greenbook that I do believe is a very desirable forecast, and that's nominal GNP. And I point out to you that our nominal GNP numbers in the forecast show the kind of decline that seems to me is consistent with our ultimate goals. It just seems to me it's somewhat dangerous for us in a policy context to be focusing on real GNP when we can focus on nominal GNP. When you look at the numbers there, you see that after 1984 we've only had one year in which the nominal GNP has been in the 7 percent range, and that was 1987. All right, we have in the staff forecast a 6.7 for 1988 and a 6.0 for 1989. It seems to me that if we can have a forecast bringing nominal GNP back down to the 4.5 percent that we had in 1986, that the right medicine is the monetary policy that brings that nominal GNP on down. I don't see how we get into trouble if we bring the nominal consistently down. So I'm somewhat satisfied with that kind of a policy background. I'm going to hand out some charts here in regard to commodity prices. I do that somewhat reluctantly because I do not believe commodity prices are as good a signal as exchange rates are. I just believe that it's more politic to talk about commodity prices than it is to talk about exchange rates. And I think in some ways we're talking about the same thing. But, since the staff did get the experimental index into their chart show, I thought at least we ought to have a little background in regard to that experimental index. Now, first of all, the experimental index was designed to show the flow-through capabilities of commodity prices to the producer price index and to the consumer price index. And this index is a consumption-weighted index. Now, the chart that you have is a chart of the index without oil. A consumption-weighted index has oil very, very high; whether we're doing it or the IMF is doing it or anyone else is doing it, we end up getting very high weights for oil. What our staff work has shown--and there has been some excellent work on the part of the Board's staff in this regard--is that year-over-year rates of change in commodity prices have been successful in leading changes in the rate of change in the CPI on the same year-over-year basis, and that most commodity indices tend to do that with a 7- to 9-month lead time, which seems to be superior to what the leading index does for the real economy. So, the first page that I've shown you there is this commodity index without oil in it. As you can see, this index has shown a downward movement and now is showing an upward jag. That upward jag is the drought effect. Now, I don't know what this index would have looked like without the drought. I can only suspect what it might have looked like. The second page shows the full index--I mean the index as it was designed. And the year-over-year rate of change clearly shows a turning point in this index which would be consistent with the CPI year-over-year rate of change peaking about September of 1987. If this proves not to be the case, then this constitutes a clear false signal. I don't know; it may very well have constituted a false signal because we have the full index saying one thing and the index without oil saying something else. So, I think it's a very uncertain case. Ed Boehne gave us some data on the CPI and the PPI; and there again, I tend to look at the year-over-year rates of change. The CPI year-over-year peaked out at 4.6 or 4.7 last fall; it was down to 4.4 in December; it crept on down to 3.9 and stalled. I'm somewhat suspicious that the index may move back up above 4 again. With the  drought effects on food prices, I think that's quite likely. Now, the last page shows the commodity index, the full index with 1982 consumption weights. This one just happens to have a strange base of January 1986 in it. But for those of you who would understand what that might mean for some of us, that index gives some indication that monetary policy was successful in holding the deflationary environment that was occurring in 1986 . It seems to me it does give some evidence of that, although the recent trend in 1988 is very suspicious; if you're a chartist and you draw the lines from 1988, you can say we have a problem. And, of course, I think we ought to lean against that wind by [adopting] the monetary policy prescription that the staff has outlined. Now exchange rates, it seems to me, are showing something else in regards to the scarcity of money. I will not dwell on that item, but I would point out that even the staff, who apparently believe that the exchange rate in December '88--if I read the report correctly--will be about the same as it was in December '87--. Is that correct, Ted? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198806	191	TRUMAN	 No, I think it's down a little, to 4 percent. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198806	192	ANGELL	 Well, I thought we had had a 7 percent rise from December and you're projecting a 7-1/2 percent fall from June to the end of the year. So it's approximately-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198806	193	TRUMAN	 I think you're probably right as far as December is concerned. You may remember that October, November, December had a considerable decline in it. So from the December level you're probably right, but from the aggregate in the fourth quarter-- 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198806	194	ANGELL	 Okay, I'm just saying-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198806	195	GREENSPAN	 They were talking about a 7-1/2 percent annual rate of decline. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	196	TRUMAN	 Annual rate. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198806	197	GREENSPAN	 So it's half from June to the end of the year, I guess. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	198	ANGELL	 Well, okay. Whatever your projection is, I'm comfortable with the decided change that that shows. It does seem to me that exchange rates do respond to real monetary scarcities. And I think the automatic gold standard always worked if everyone wanted to make it work because it did alter the monetary growth paths for countries with balance-of-trade deficits. I don't know about the drought. Some people seem to think that the drought is going to add to inflationary forces. I think there's a danger there that has to be guarded against. But I think the drought can possibly have deflationary impacts in the long run if we get past these first 6 months of it. What Gary Stern said last night struck me: that for those people in the Midwest where that drought is concentrated, there is a feeling that does have something to do with expectations.  One other thing I would mention is in regard to defense spending. I picked up anecdotal evidence which says that there are many small defense contractors around the nation who are not permitted to make any bids for any government contracts or to engage in any new projects of any kind due to the fact that they're dealing with a representative or lobbyist in Washington who is tainted. And I understand this to be a rather widespread phenomenon. The final comment I'd make is in regard to the money markets. It just seems to me that in the last five months the money markets and bond markets have responded so well to the policy moves we've made. Some of you may not think they were policy moves, but it does seem to me that we've been attempting to lower the growth path of the monetary aggregates, and I would consider that to be a policy move. I think the bond markets have behaved so well because they have seen us responding in a pattern that they didn't expect and I think they believe that our timing has been appropriate. And I think it's important that we keep in mind the kind of timing that we've had. It seems to me that the Chairman has indicated a very [unintelligible] in carrying out the FOMC's views in regard to the tilts we've placed in [the directive]. And I guess I'd expect that to continue. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198806	199	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	200	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to economic activity, particularly in its relation to the Tenth District, as you know, we're dominated by agriculture, energy, mining, and manufacturing. Three of those activities--agriculture, energy, and mining--have been at very low levels. Agriculture has revived in the sense that it's on the recovery path, with evidence such as agricultural land prices continuing to increase 4 to 5 percent in a quarter, for example. Having in mind the impact of the drought, however, it isn't clear that that's going to continue. And if the drought does worsen--and that's a very iffy situation in the sense that a week or two of rain could wipe out virtually any impact of the drought in our District and would turn the pessimism back to optimism; and I think agriculture would continue on the recovery track. Energy, on the other hand, is flat because of OPEC's indecision and the softening of oil prices. Drilling rigs have decreased in total numbers over the last month or two, although they're still about 8 percent or so above year-ago levels. Mining is in a recovery stage, but certainly not very brisk. Manufacturing is dominated largely by the auto and aircraft industry in the Tenth District. Because of production cutbacks, most auto plants--the ones that haven't been closed--are operating on two shifts. But that's far from being flat-out production. Aircraft, on the other hand, is booming--from the standpoint that both commercial as well as military orders are very great. And as a result, that industry is looking up. With respect to your question about wage inflation or price inflation generally, we simply do not have any good evidence that has emerged that would suggest that that's present now, although I would agree with those who suggest that the feeling is right under the surface. People we talk to keep talking about inflation, although they can present no real evidence that it's accelerating. It seems to me that it may be one of those situations in which things have gotten better, both nationwide and in my District. And as things look pretty  good then--and we can't stand prosperity--you begin to look for those things that can destroy what you think is good today. And that may be what we're experiencing right now. The real risk, obviously, is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. We do see some wage increases in the public employment sector and particularly in the health [care] sector. Nurses, for example, are in very short supply nationally. Their wage demands are astronomical and they quite likely are going to get them simply because of the shortage in the supply of nurses. With regard to the Greenbook forecast and the outlook for the next six quarters, we don't have any great divergence from the view that has been presented by the staff. I think our view would be that inflation would be a bit less in the remainder of 1988 but would indeed be greater than the staff forecast for the year 1989 as a whole--roughly 1/2 of a percentage point fourth-quarter over fourth- quarter. Some of that comes from the projected impact of the drought on prices. Our view is that there will be an uptick; it won't be a heavy impact unless the drought worsens very much in 1988. I think the staff would say that that would all kind of roll out early in 1989, but we think there will be an uptick in 1988; we see that continuing in 1989. And as a result, inflation from that component alone would be a bit higher than the staff forecast. But by and large we'd accept that forecast as being reasonable. I would agree with the earlier statement of Jerry Corrigan that the risk is on the upside and monetary policy will become a bit tight. Inflation will rear its ugly head. Vigilance! I quit. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0

As far as wage pressures are concerned, my own wage hasn't changed for 1-1/2 years but the Board seems to-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0

198806	206	HELLER	 It won't change next year either, thank you. But the President seems to have some trouble filling empty seats on the Board. But, after a year and a half search, he seems to have succeeded now, although there are still some obstacles in the way. Now, let me point to the national picture. I think the only forecast I can really follow is the Greenbook forecast. And while I'm a bit more optimistic than the Greenbook forecast, I think there are some features in it that are already feeling pessimistic. The Greenbook has the growth rate dipping a year from now--that's the second quarter of 1989--to 1.7 percent. Domestic purchases at that time will be growing at a rate of 0.3 percent; the unemployment rate is up to 5.8 - 5.9 percent; investment is growing only at 1 or 2  percent; both the personal as well as the industrial structures are solidly in the minus column; the Federal Government is solidly in the minus column; capacity utilization is dropping. With all that happening, plus the low monetary growth that we've seen in the last year--and as I pointed out yesterday, we're still below the bottom end of last year's target cone--I don't see the big surge in inflation that some people expect. Governor Johnson has already pointed out very clearly what I think is happening: that past monetary policy really has helped to break that inflationary impetus that we have seen building up. Governor Angell, I think, said the same thing. The yield curve is flattening, long rates are coming down, the dollar is going up, and you see two sort of opposing trends in commodity markets. On the one hand, you have the effect of the drought; on the other hand [unintelligible] prices have been dropping very sharply in the last couple of weeks and that's often a fairly good inflation indicator, too. So, to sum up, I think we are already on slowing trends. We see the results of the tightness of policies that we instituted last year and in the early part of this year. And I would expect that inflationary expectations are on a downward trend. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198806	207	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198806	208	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, let me, if I may for just a moment, bring a slightly different point of view to this thing. My main concern is that we need to have a good economy in 1989 and forward from there. I'm asking myself what is liable to be the economic forecast forward from the second quarter of next year. And the reason for this is I think it's very important that the next President, whoever he is [unintelligible]-- [Secretary's note: The transcript of Mr. Kelley's remarks ends in mid-sentence; in addition, there is no record of Ms. Seger's comments on the economy. However, a general statement of their views is contained in their dissents from the policy decision at this meeting. Those dissents were included in the policy record of the meeting that was published several days after the following meeting. The transcript resumes with Mr. Kohn's report on the long-run policy alternatives.] 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198806	209	KOHN	" At this time the FOMC is required both to reconsider its 1988  ranges for money and credit and to establish on a tentative basis ranges  for 1989. I will be briefly reviewing the 1988 situation, before  discussing some of the issues the Committee may want to consider in  assessing the 1989 ranges.  With respect to 1988, M2 and M3 are now in the upper halves of  their target ranges, though well below the upper ends of those ranges.  The strength in M2 relative to income reflected in the 3/4 percent estimated rate of decline in its velocity in the first half of the year is  partly attributable to the drop in interest rates from October through  February, and also perhaps to some special factors boosting M2 demand.  In any event, the rise in rates over recent months seems already to be  damping the quantity of M2 demanded and would be expected to lead to  slower M2 growth in the second half of the year than in the first, even if  interest rates were to remain at current levels. This would leave M2  close to, though possibly a little above, the midpoint of its range. M3  growth is expected to remain well above the midpoint of its range, given  the tendency for rising rates to encourage borrowers to favor the short-  term and floating rate obligations issued and held by depository  institutions, but it is not seen as threatening the upper end of its  range. Debt is running around the middle of its range and should remain  in that general area.  Under these circumstances, the staff saw no need to propose  alternatives in the bluebook to the existing 1988 ranges. Reducing them  seemed inappropriate at a time when the money aggregates are running high  in their ranges, and raising them, say for M3 to more symmetrically encompass the expected outcome, would seem to send the wrong message about the  Committee's intentions for policy in 1988 and for money growth over time.  Moreover, any tendency for money to accelerate to threaten the upper ends  of the existing ranges might well signal unexpected strength in the  economy that the Committee would want to react to rather than to accommodate.  Consideration might be given to narrowing the ranges. Being  halfway through the year, it ought to be possible to give a more precise  idea of where one wants to end up than is true in February. This should  be especially true this year, given the unusual uncertainties in the  outlook earlier in the year associated with the effects of the stock  market crash. However, the Committee has never before chosen to take  advantage of the information at midyear to narrow the ranges though it  never before had 4 point ranges. And, the most logical narrowing would  seem to involve raising the lower ends, especially for M3, which wouldn't  appear on the surface to be consistent with an anti-inflationary stance.  For 1989 the bluebook presented three alternative sets of ranges.  Alternative I; which would retain the 1988 ranges, is more consistent with  a view that the risks in the economy are not tilted toward greater infla-  tionary pressures and that the ranges should provide about as much scope  for an easing of policy, should that prove needed to support growth, as  for a tightening. A more even distribution of risks than in the staff  forecast might be seen, for example, if strength in the dollar were to  retard improvement in the trade balance, or if fiscal policy turned out  tighter than expected. This alternative might also be interpreted as  allowing for more rapid expansion of nominal income than the other  alternatives, on the thought that the structure of labor markets would  permit the accommodation of one-time increases in some prices for  example, for imports without entrenching them in wages and in a more  general inflation process.  Alternative II would reduce all the ranges by 1/2 of a percentage  point, suggesting a concern about restraining income growth to a degree  and moving toward money growth ranges over time that are more consistent  with price stability. However, although the staff is forecasting about  4 percent growth in M2 in 1989 for the income and interest rates in the  Greenbook, some model results, plus the possibility of surprises in money  demand, suggest that the 3-1/2 percent lower end of alternative II for M2  might be uncomfortably constraining, if the Committee wishes to damp  inflation over 1989 and underlying demands on the economy turn out to be  as strong as in the staff forecast. At least, given the interest responsiveness of M2, alternative II allows essentially no room for greater  restraint than assumed by the staff. The likelihood of a shortfall for M3  or debt would be much smaller, given their lower interest sensitivities  and expectations that they would be near the middle of the alternative II  ranges under the staff forecast.  Alternative III would allow a little more room for policy  restraint or for a sharper than expected rise in M2 velocity. The full  one percentage point reduction in the M2 range has a recent precedent in  the one point reduction in the midpoints of ranges between 1987 and 1988.  Also, the higher range for M3 than for M2 is consistent with the long-run  relationship of their velocities; reflecting this relationship, in the  past, ranges for M3 have on occasion been above those for M2. The 7 percent upper end of the M2 ranges under this alternative is low compared  with M2 growth rates over the 1970s and most of the 1980s. For the most  part, however, those growth rates were registered when nominal income and  prices were increasing fairly rapidly, or when the economy was in  recession and interest rates were falling. Alternative III definitely is  geared toward a situation in which the risks are seen more on the side of  strength in the economy and inflation, given high levels of resource  utilization, than of weakness, and in that context, one in which the  Committee is committed to resisting tendencies for income growth to run  much above 6 percent.  As Mike has noted, however, even the staff forecast implies only  meager progress toward price stability in 1989 and 1990. The table  distributed to the Committee marked ""alternative long-run monetary policy  strategies"" repeats the baseline forecast and gives another set of policy  assumptions designed to reduce inflation in 1990 by an additional 3/4 of a  percentage point. As with the constant interest rate scenario discussed  in the chart show, the results are based on the underlying assessment of  the economy in staff judgmental forecast, using various econometric  models to gauge how key variables would have to differ from their values  in that forecast to achieve the desired end. They should be considered  less an exact road map than a general indication of the sorts of policies  that might be involved and the responses of the economy.  One aspect of this alternative that stands out is the amount of additional monetary tightening needed over the near term to get inflation down  to 3 percent in 1990. In this scenario, the 3-month Treasury bill rate  rises nearly 2 percentage points over the next two quarters and a bit  further in 1989, while M2 growth is reduced to 4 percent over the second  half of the year and only 1-1/2 percent in 1989. Largely as a consequence of policy restraint, the dollar would fall less rapidly, especially  over the near term.  This severity results in part from the fairly long lags in the  models between policy impulses and their effects on prices, as Mike has  already discussed, which dictate a sharp tightening in the latter part of  1988 to damp inflation significantly in 1990. In addition, the desired  slowing of inflation rates must occur in the face of continuing upward  movement in the prices of imports, though at a slower pace, necessitating  more substantial moderation in other prices. The models make no allowance  in wage and price setting behavior for any enhanced credibility of the  Federal Reserve's pursuit of its objective for price level stability. In  fact, the evidence of such an effect, even after late 1979, is mixed at  best, but a policy tightening of the magnitude envisioned at the current  rate of inflation certainly would get the attention of the relevant  parties and might speed the adjustment process. Moreover, this alternative leaves the economy at the end of 1990 in a position that would seem  to suggest considerable weakness in activity and increase in unemployment  in 1991, though also substantial further gains against inflation.  Clearly, in the context of the models' structures, if the Committee were  to accept a more gradual downward course for inflation, something between  the baseline and the alternative might be appropriate, with a smaller  increase in unemployment that developed more slowly.  Such ""fine-tuning"" of policy paths is probably pushing the  exercise beyond its inherent limitations. The point remains, however,  that if the staff's assessment of the underlying strength of demand in the  United States economy and the pressures on exchange rates is about on track, a  decision to seek a greater slowing of inflation than in the base line  forecast probably calls for even lower ranges for money growth in 1989,  especially M2, than in the alternatives in the bluebook for example a 2  to 6 percent M2 range. This alternative might even be considered more  consistent with the baseline forecast, since it is symmetrical around the  4 percent M2 growth expected in that forecast. Such a range, however,  would involve a full 2 percentage point decrease from 1988 ranges. And  given the central tendency of FOMC members forecasts that imply nominal  GNP growth of around 6 percent, it would be tantamount to announcing an  FOMC expectation of rising interest rates to obtain the needed velocity  increase.  An additional problem with moving promptly to very low money  growth ranges, and a more general complexity of formulating a long-run  strategy for money growth in a world with appreciable interest sensitivity  of money demand, is illustrated by the projected path of M2 under both the  base line and the lower inflation strategies. In both cases, money growth  strengthens in 1990 relative to 1989 even though nominal income growth is  unchanged or slows. This is a function of the response of M2 to the  decline in nominal interest rates resulting from lower inflation rates and  a softer economy. At some point, as inflation comes down, nominal  interest rates will have to decline and the Federal Reserve will need to  allow money growth to accelerate to avoid high real rates and real output  below its potential. This implies that a strategy of reducing money  growth year after year will not necessarily be optimal. It also means  that if the ranges were reduced to 2 to 6 percent, there is some chance  that at some point the ranges may have to be raised temporarily or money  growth in excess of the ranges tolerated for a time.

198806	210	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Don? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	211	ANGELL	 Yes. Don, in some ways my question arose and you partially answered it [in your report]. The lower [projected] inflation, with a 1.4 percent M2 growth rate in 1989, followed by 2.4 percent in 1990 and then a Treasury bill rate in 1990 of 9.2 percent, is so inconceivable to me. I just wondered: is it conceivable to you? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	212	KOHN	 Well, the relationship is conceivable. In fact, these things are derived from cranking them through the money demand model. The M2, Treasury bill, and nominal GNP relationships implied are derived from cranking them through the Board staff's models of M2 demand. Now, whether the underlying strategy for monetary policy is credible, I think I'll leave that to the Committee. But the relationships in here are credible, entirely credible. I don't have  any problem with seeing the change in interest rates going with the change in GNP and the change in money. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	213	ANGELL	 My comment would be that your model doesn't fit the financial world that I've learned to experience, and I would think that a Treasury bill rate of 5.2 percent would be more consistent in 1990 with that kind of M2 growth. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	214	KOHN	 Well,-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	215	HELLER	 But Don was still applying monetary restraint at that moment. Right? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	216	KOHN	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	217	HELLER	 You're still stepping on the brakes and that produces the high interest rates. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	218	ANGELL	 Yes, but the yield curve in that situation would be so inverted. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	219	KOHN	 Inverted? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	220	ANGELL	 It has to be an inverted yield curve unless the- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	221	BLACK	 I think there's no explanation. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	222	ANGELL	 Unless inflation is accelerating. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	223	KOHN	 I think it's not--I don't have the outlook for the long-bond rate-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	224	BLACK	 That's where the challenge is. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	225	KOHN	 We would not have [the long-bond rate] increasing to the same extent as the Treasury bill rate; increases would be smaller. Whether the yield curve would actually be inverted at that time under these circumstances in the models, I'm not sure. But we have had situations like 1987 when we had very low money growth and rising interest rates. Your point, I gather, is one of inflation expectations and where real interest rates are and where nominal interest rates are. And I think if there were a real break--if the markets saw this, believed it, and inflation expectations took a substantial decline--then you might have a point. I'm not sure that the interest rate thing-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	226	ANGELL	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	227	KOHN	 I'm not sure that money demand would be that much different but, surely, the long bond would be considerably different. And then it would be a question of whether money holders trade off their savings deposits and time deposits. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	228	ANGELL	 You probably haven't yet incorporated a commodity index inflation movement within your model, have you--with a feedback?  	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	229	KOHN	 No. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	230	ANGELL	 Okay. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	231	GREENSPAN	 Are there any further questions before we do another run around the table? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	232	BLACK	 Don, you used an interesting term that I don't remember right now, but I think you really said you assumed expectations weren't rational in this low growth-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	233	KOHN	 In our models, the expectations, as Mike Prell said yesterday, are backward looking. And then you have labor contracts and what not. Some things change slowly in those models; wage rates change slowly, as do prices to a certain extent in response to changes in output gaps, unemployment rates, and that sort of thing. So that's the reason why the lags are so long and the unemployment rate has to get so high to get this immediate, relatively short-run, effect for a 1990 inflation rate. If the expectations change more rapidly, then you wouldn't have to have quite as much restraint. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	234	BLACK	 What was that term you used? I want to remember that. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	235	KOHN	 I can't remember it. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	236	BLACK	 It was an interesting one; I should have jotted it down. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	237	KOHN	 Well, maybe we can talk later; I'm not sure what you're- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	238	GREENSPAN	 Lee. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	239	HOSKINS	 When I match up the Greenbook with alternative III, the implication under alternative III is that we're shooting for 5 percent M2 growth. So the question is: What is the Greenbook projection under that alternative? 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	240	GREENSPAN	 The projection is 4 percent. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	241	KOHN	 Yes, the projection under the Greenbook assumption is 4 percent. I think you're right--the markets probably will take the midpoint. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	242	HOSKINS	 Yes, I'm trying to match the two up. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	243	KOHN	 Yes. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	244	HOSKINS	 You have a midpoint of 5 percent and I'm asking what the Greenbook forecast would look like under a 5 percent M2. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	245	KOHN	 Oh, I see. It would be-- 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	246	HOSKINS	 Because that's how the markets would translate it.  	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	247	KOHN	 The Greenbook forecast under a 5 percent M2 would be something between the baseline and the stable interest rate forecast that Mike gave yesterday. That is, we'd have more M2, somewhat lower interest rates, and everything that went with that. But the 5 percent M2 would be consistent with some further rise in interest rates from where we are now, but not quite as much as we have in the Greenbook forecast. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	248	GREENSPAN	 Any other questions for Don? Let me add something to what Don has been saying. In one sense, we're looking at monetary policy in the short run as sort of the crucial thing to be discussed at this meeting. But, in a sense, this is the more relevant issue. If you go back to the 1960s, and especially the 1970s, my recollection is that toward the latter part of the 1970s we still had this acceleration of inflation expectations. You remember Milton Friedman used to draw the lines where the top of the highs of inflation were always successively higher and the bottoms of the lows were always successively higher. Despite that, until very late in the 1970s--I suspect really the middle of 1979--inflation expectations really never took hold. Long-term nominal bond yields were exceptionally low. All of a sudden the markets got the message and long-term rates went up, I think, 450 basis points between mid-1979 and early 1980. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	249	JOHNSON	 They never got up above the short rates. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	250	GREENSPAN	 No, they never did; but what I think we were looking at was that inflation expectations really found their way directly into the long end of the market. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	251	JOHNSON	 I guess what I'm saying is they never rose above the funds rate or short-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	252	GREENSPAN	 Well, I'm not sure that that's relevant to this issue, because [the definition of] inflation expectations in this context really has to be: what is the inflation premium embodied in the long-term interest rate? It's certainly the case that the structure of the yield curve is relevant, but not to this type of issue. The reason I raise the issue is that everyone's expectation was that we couldn't break the inflation psychology. And, indeed, this Board--or the FOMC--went through the torture of the damned in the years immediately subsequent to that to get inflation expectations out of long-term bonds; and it hasn't fully succeeded. The long-term nominal yields are still reflecting a degree of inflation that is a good deal higher than in the 1970s and the 1960s. This suggests that the market, having come down dramatically with respect to inflation, is going to do it in two loops--meaning, in effect, that inflation is coming back a little. And if it starts going back down in the early 1990s--leaving out the issue of not getting to 5 percent--that probably will bring the long-term yields down in a nominal sense. And this suggests to me that the more important decision that the Committee has to make is on this specific issue. I think we ought to decide whether we believe that money supply is working or whether we believe it's no longer a relevant consideration. But unless we are willing to abandon all hopes of the monetary aggregates coming back as key elements within the financial system, the more I look at the numbers I can't quite buy  your lower inflation thing because I'm not sure it would work. I think that what would happen is that if we squeezed to that point, the economy would go into recession and political pressures would overwhelm us. But certainly, I must say that alternative III looks like something which is, as far as I'm concerned, probably a minimum type of adjustment from current M2 ranges. Well, having already spoken, let me just say that I would opt for no change in 1988 but alternative III for the 1989 figures. Do you think we have time to go around before the coffee gets cold? Let's try. Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	253	ANGELL	 As for alternative II, I don't like quibbling with half a percentage point in these numbers. So the question is alternative III versus alternative I. I come out this way: I prefer that we do alternative III, but I prefer to make that decision next February. Just like a year ago, I preferred that we make the decision closer to the time because I believe it's important to have credibility. And I would certainly want the language of the Humphrey- Hawkins report to indicate that we anticipate doing that. But I really prefer that we not announce one now because I believe there is something in the neighborhood of a 20 percent chance that we will be back into a commodity price deflation prior to the beginning of 1989. And if that's the case I wouldn't want to make the move. So-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	254	GREENSPAN	 Are we required to announce-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	255	JOHNSON	 Yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	256	BERNARD	 Preliminary ranges. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	257	GREENSPAN	 We actually have to do it. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	258	ANGELL	 We have to announce the preliminaries. Well, I'm going to vote for alternative I, but there's an 80 percent chance that I'll want to be at III next February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	259	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman Corrigan. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	260	CORRIGAN	 Reaffirm the '88 ranges; alternative III for '89. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	261	GREENSPAN	 [Mr. Angell] are you reaffirming '88? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	262	ANGELL	 Yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	263	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	264	PARRY	 I would strongly favor alternative III for 1989 and I don't have any problem with our current targets for 1988. One thing we might want to consider for 1988 is to go 4-1/2 to 7-1/2, which would narrow the M2 range to 3 points. You clearly have the visibility that I think we'd be comfortable with. And for M3, 5 to 8 because that looks reasonable as well. And I might point out that the staff has indicated that, due to different income and interest elasticities, it makes sense to have a little higher range for M3. So, I think we could stick basically with the substance of what we have for 1988, but just narrow the range a little.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	265	GREENSPAN	 You know, the ability for us to hold to a whole range for a year for no other reason than credibility is of value in and of itself. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	266	CORRIGAN	 I think that's right. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	267	GREENSPAN	 It's not that I would disagree with you on that necessarily, but I think there is the question of whether or not we really would want to do that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	268	PARRY	 Well, we would be holding to the range. We'd actually be narrowing it. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	269	GREENSPAN	 We'd be narrowing it, yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	270	PARRY	 I wouldn't want to change the midpoint of M2. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	271	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	272	BLACK	 I agree with your prescription, Mr. Chairman, which is where most people have come out. There's one observation I'd like to make, though. I think there's one big weakness with this practice of setting one-year ranges for the aggregates, and that is that it doesn't really commit us to doing anything beyond that year in this. Governor Angell suggested a while ago that it is important that we target some nominal variable. He mentioned nominal GNP. I think it's a point, although certainly one can't be sure that it's a better variable to target than would be M2. [I'd suggest that you] announce, when you give your testimony, that our intention is to move further in the years beyond. If you look at the chart showing velocity of M2 in the Bluebook, that looks pretty darn constant over a period of 30 years. It's true that it jumped around more in the '80s, but it looks remarkably stable for an economic variable. And I would like to see you say that our intention is, given past evidence, and with a zero rate of change in velocity, to bring that down in the early '90s to about 3 percent--which I would interpret to be the long-run potential of the economy--or whatever you can get the Committee to agree to and feel comfortable about in saying something beyond '89. I think that would be very helpful to the markets. And I would certainly favor something of that sort. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	273	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	274	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I, too, agree with your analysis, and I would reaffirm the 1988 targets and opt for alternative III for 1989. I think it's very important that we send a signal to the financial markets and to the public that we're on our path of trying to reduce core inflation. I don't think that alternative III really represents a very restrictive monetary policy and would throw us into a tailspin in the economy. I don't like alternative II because I think that those half percentages indicate a degree of precision that we really don't have. So, I strongly favor alternative III. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	39.0
198806	275	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	276	BOEHNE	 Ditto!  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	33.0
198806	277	GREENSPAN	 You want to expand that? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	278	PARRY	 He wants coffee! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	279	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	280	JOHNSON	 I think I can live with alternative III. Don Kohn pointed out, though, that there is some risk that expectational adjustments will take place a certain way. We can find ourselves going backward at some point. And I think there's some risk that we might get ourselves in a situation where expectations do take effect and we end up with lower interest rates instead of rising interest rates; at some point we're going to get a velocity movement that's going to be in the opposite direction of what we anticipate. To hit a 5 percent nominal GNP you're going to have to compensate for a potential decline in velocity growth--I don't think that's totally out of the picture as a possibility--for me to feel completely comfortable with alternative III; that's why I like a 5-1/2 percent midpoint. It doesn't bother me that we ratchet the targets down a half percentage point a year; we've been doing that for some time. As a matter of fact, we didn't even move them for a while, and a half percentage point was always viewed in the markets as a reasonable amount of progress. I must admit that, barring that scenario that I pointed out, the upper end of the alternative III range seems to give you plenty of room. And maybe we do want to give that kind of message to the markets. But simply because I am unsure about where we might be next February--. I would hate to end up having to back off next February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	281	GREENSPAN	 Am I correct that you would expect to have to back off only if interest rates were lower, which would mean probably that inflation expectations are lower? And the market effect of backing--, there is no reason why we can't back up. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	282	JOHNSON	 No. We can back up. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	283	GREENSPAN	 That's the whole purpose of the exercise. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	284	JOHNSON	 I think that is right. I am just a little concerned at this point that a signal of stronger medicine of that degree to come might put us in that situation; but I could go with it. I am a little more comfortable with waiting as well, but I'd rather demonstrate a ratcheting down of the target than just hanging with the current one, I think--a little unlike Governor Angell. But I can live with III; I just think there's a risk of us backing up some. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	285	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	286	HOSKINS	 Well, alternative III doesn't achieve the objective that I'm looking for over time, which is to ratchet down the rate of inflation. It leaves us with a midpoint that would be more inflationary than the Greenbook forecast, which is still at 4 percent. So, if I were to pick a number, I would certainly look at something like 2 to 6 percent, to focus it around what is consistent with the Greenbook; and 1 to 5 percent might even be preferable. If we are going to use something like III, then I think we ought to make it  explicit in your public statement that we are going to shoot for the lower end of that target range. Otherwise, the implication is that it's 5 percent. An alternative to that would be to narrow the range-- leave the bottom end at 3 percent and pull the top end down to 6 percent. I can live with 1988 the way it is, but I think it's important to signal the markets that we're serious out in 1989. I think we'll get some benefits out of that without having to pay a price in terms of short-term interest rates. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	287	GREENSPAN	 So are you coming out for III or not? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	288	HOSKINS	 Are we voting now? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	289	GREENSPAN	 No, I only wanted to-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	290	HOSKINS	 I'd come out for III if we could make either one of those two adjustments. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	291	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	292	HELLER	 I'm for maintaining the current 1988 ranges and the 1989 ranges that go with II, essentially for the same reasons that Governor Johnson expressed. I think we should proceed slowly and save, if you will, some of that ammunition for the final determination of the ranges in February. I'd rather keep going forward at that point, like Governor Angell was saying, than having to backtrack early next year and then going to a higher range some time next year. I think it is more important for us to meet our targets and to show that we want to make some continuing progress. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	293	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	294	KELLEY	" Well, I will ""ditto"" Governor Heller exactly. I would reaffirm '88 and go for II at this time for '89, for the reasons he just articulated. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
198806	295	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	296	KEEHN	 I'd maintain the '88 ranges and I'd be in favor of alternative III for '89. If I were fine tuning at all, I would widen the ranges when we are going through a period of some uncertainty, but the latter is beginning to clarify. This might be an opportunity to narrow the range again and perhaps go to 3-1/2 to 7. I don't feel strongly about that; I can live with III. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	35.0
198806	297	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	298	SEGER	 I am in favor of maintaining the existing ranges for '88 and in keeping with my position this time last year, I think that it makes sense to maintain the same ranges for '89 because we do have another crack at this early next year, and it makes a lot of sense to keep our powder dry. And if we need to tighten further, I would certainly go to II or III; but in the meantime, I don't think the markets, as a matter of fact, think we are paying much attention to the monetary aggregates at the moment. We keep saying we aren't, so I don't know how it is that we are supposed to send this tremendous message to the financial markets by knocking these ranges down substantially at this point.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
198806	299	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	300	GUFFEY	 Mr. Chairman, I would reaffirm 1988; I can accept alternative III for 1989. However, I would prefer to maintain the current 4 to 8 range for 1989 for the time being, with the appropriate language in your testimony that another look at the beginning of this upcoming year is something that we would look forward to. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	301	GREENSPAN	 [Your view is] similar to Governor Angell's? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	302	GUFFEY	 It's somewhat similar, yes. The record of our ability to forecast has not been terribly good over time. And the fact that we are looking out 6 quarters, to me [unintelligible]. I'd rather keep the flexibility and look again in February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	20.0
198806	303	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	304	MELZER	 I favor sticking with what we have for '88 and alternative III for '89. And I'm inclined to agree with what Martha said about the market impact. I don't think the markets place a lot of weight on this. I think we are heading in the right direction and we ought to do that; but in the final analysis, if we had to violate the ranges in either direction I suspect as a Committee we probably would. And I suspect that's how the market probably perceives this. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198806	305	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	306	STERN	 Well, I have nothing to add. I'd keep the ranges we have for this year and go for alternative III for next year. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
198806	307	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	308	BOYKIN	 I'd stay where we are for '88, alternative III for '89 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	34.0
198806	309	GREENSPAN	 President Morris. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	310	MORRIS	 I've always been uncomfortable with setting a range for the year in the middle of the preceding year. I am very sympathetic to the idea that we keep the present range at this point for 1989 and tell Congress that, if we are thinking in February as we think today, that we'd probably reduce it. But I think our ability to forecast velocity is so limited, that to try to set a range for 1989 in June of 1988--that is something. We've always done it that way; but, at the same time I know that once we set it in the middle of year one, it is difficult to revise it in the middle of year two. It develops a certain inertia and people get concerned about what would happen to our image, and so on. It seems to me that if we get into a pattern of keeping the existing range, and telling the Congress we'd be more comfortable setting the subsequent year's range in February, that we'd be better off in the long run. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	1.0
198806	311	GREENSPAN	 Let's vote first on 1988. Unless I'm mistaken, it seems we have unanimity to reaffirm, but let's put that to a vote.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	312	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Black Yes President Forrestal Yes Governor Heller Yes President Hoskins Yes Governor Johnson Yes Governor Kelley Yes President Parry Yes Governor Seger Yes 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	313	GREENSPAN	 Let me ask a factual question on the 1989 ranges. Do we have the custom of assuming that people are voting on I, II, and III as representative averages? Do we do this or what? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	314	ANGELL	 Well, Mr. Chairman, in fairness, you have 6 people who have clearly shown that they favor alternative III. Even though I don't, I can vote for it; I'm not going to vote no. On that gesture, I think it would be a mistake. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	315	GREENSPAN	 No, I'm asking: Is the procedure here one in which one puts up a proposition on alternative III and asks yes or no? Is that the way it is run? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	316	ANGELL	 It seems to me-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	317	JOHNSON	 I agree with Governor Angell. I am uncomfortable with alternative III, but I would not want to record a vote against it, knowing there's a majority for it. I would like to show more unanimity than that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	318	HELLER	 How about half way--3-1/4 to 7-1/4? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	319	JOHNSON	 We've already been polled; we know where we stand. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	320	GREENSPAN	 May I make a suggestion? As I've listened, there really is not disagreement here. What the issue really rests on is the forecasting ability of this group for a period that far ahead. Why can't I capture that in language in my testimony? So, I'd say that this is the intention, but recognize that it will be revised, as it has to be, in February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	321	HELLER	 Like President Morris said: a) it is very difficult to go back on what we have done; b)-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	322	GREENSPAN	 Well, basically I'm saying that no matter how you do it, it is an intention that inevitably will be reviewed. And I presume that this is not locked in concrete, as it shouldn't be. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	323	CORRIGAN	 If you took the case that Governor Johnson cited, where something happened between now and February such that you had lower rather than higher interest rates, in those circumstances, I'd have no trouble at all myself with changing the targets in February.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	324	GREENSPAN	 It would be appropriate. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	325	ANGELL	 I think there's just a little loss in credibiliity in doing that. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	326	HELLER	 Then we are moving in the wrong direction. In that sense, it sends bad signals to the market, especially if you make some progress and you're getting lower interest rates. And then you say, well, now we are going to increase our monetary growth. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	327	GREENSPAN	 Let me say what I have to say. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	328	HELLER	 I'd be very reluctant to reverse myself later on, having voted for it now. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	46.0
198806	329	GREENSPAN	 If we go for alternative III and it turns out to have to be reversed, too, you would be in the same position. You are not going to tell me that-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	330	ANGELL	 I prefer III to II. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	331	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we do this: Let's vote on III, with the understanding that the language [in my testimony] will try to capture the reservations that people have indicated. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	332	HOSKINS	 Those reservations are on both the high and low sides 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
198806	333	ANGELL	 [Laughing] Well, you mean just one! 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
198806	334	GREENSPAN	 [Laughing] He's got several reservations! We are voting on alternative III. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	335	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Black Yes President Forrestal Yes Governor Heller Yes President Hoskins Yes Governor Johnson Yes Governor Kelley Yes President Parry Yes Governor Seger No, reluctantly 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	336	KOHN	 Mr. Chairman, there is directive language that goes with these alternatives that is pretty straightforward. You can do it after the coffee break, if you prefer that. The language is on page 8. [Coffee break] 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	337	GREENSPAN	 Can we reconvene? Jerry Corrigan has an interesting idea that he broached at the coffee break. I would like general views on it, as it would solve some of the problems we were discussing on the 1989 targets. Jerry.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	338	CORRIGAN	 In listening to the conversation, I must confess that I was a little struck with the comments that Wayne Angell, Bob Heller, Frank Morris, Manley Johnson, and Martha Seger were making about the year-forward targets, as we are required under the law to stipulate in July. The thought that I mentioned to the Chairman was that, in connection with his testimony, he would obviously state that the Committee established the 1989 targets as they were just voted. He would then go through his usual song and dance about uncertainties, but he would take that song and dance one step further and specifically say that, indeed, the Committee was impressed with how much these uncertainties have increased, if anything, over time. Consistent with that, in the future the Committee may well show a strong tendency in July to merely restate the current year's targets for the following year. That would not necessarily always be the case, but there would be a strong tendency in that direction, simply as a further manifestation of the uncertainties that arise in trying to state the targets that far in advance. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
198806	339	SPEAKER	 Very good. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	340	GREENSPAN	 The advantage of that occurs in the event that we are in a position next February, for example, where the types of occurrences that have been expressed here do evolve and we are required to change. What we have done, in effect, while adhering to the requirements of the statute, is basically establish the notion that setting the 1989 ranges is clearly a problem in July 1988, and the fact that it turned out to be a problem in June or July of 1988 isn't that much of a surprise. That gives us, I think, a reasonable basis to change, which could be captured if we were to be very vague in the report and in my testimony, but I gather that really is inappropriate, given the Humphrey-Hawkins statute language. Jerry's notion, within the statutory language, creates the type of conditionality which I think that Wayne and Don and a few others have indicated. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	341	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I have two problems with that. One is that you would be going into next year without having set any long- run targets. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	342	GREENSPAN	 I'm sorry; let me restate it. What Jerry is recommending is that we are actually stating the targets-- specifically, alternative III--and instead of having some language around it about uncertainty and how the targets may be changed, that we stipulate that henceforth, starting in July 1989, we would assume that the then-current ranges would be automatically extended into the subsequent year but be subject to review in February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	343	BLACK	 My other problem is more serious. And that is, that I would like to see us state tentative targets over the long run that tell the market what we have often said in the past--that we want to get these aggregates down to the point that we've got noninflationary growth. To me, [the approach recommended by Jerry Corrigan] would show less resolve than I think [is desirable]. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
198806	344	BOEHNE	 Mr. Chairman, I think what Jerry and the others are getting at is valid, but I'd like to suggest a slightly different wrinkle as to how to achieve it, which I think gets around a potential  difficulty. I would rather say that the uncertainty has increased and that it has become increasingly difficult to make judgments; that we will make our best estimate in July, but the [congressional] committees ought to understand that we may be changing or revising in February more than in the past. I think there is an advantage in saying it that way because it tends to be more in the spirit of the statute. Some years ago--I've forgotten exactly when it was--we didn't send up in July ranges for the following year, and Senator Proxmire said we weren't following [the statute] by what we were doing. This way, if you say that in the future we are just going to continue the current ranges into the next year, I think someone could say to you that what you're really doing, in effect, is revising the statute. If you go the other way and say we'll give it our best effort, but you ought to realize it is highly preliminary and almost routinely you might expect changes in February, then you do it more in the spirit of the statute, and I think it accomplishes the same thing. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	33.0
198806	345	PARRY	 I think I would agree with Ed; I don't like the suggestion that we indicate that we might be very likely to continue the prior year's target in July. I think we go through a very serious exercise here. It is clear that the staff has done that and I think staff at each of our Banks has done that as well. if we are going to do it in a serious way, I think we ought to pay some attention to it. You know, we just don't have to do much work if what we're going to do most of the time is indicate that we are going to retain the current year's target for the next year. I don't see any virtue in that. I hink Congress ought to realize that we are trying to do the best we can and be aware that, at times, we may change it in one direction or another come February. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
198806	346	GREENSPAN	" In the context of this further discussion, let me just read--and throw into the well--two paragraphs suggested by Don Kohn. The first is: ""The Committee will be reconsidering the ranges in early 1989 and recognizes that they could be changed, depending on conditions at that time."" Another alternative is: ""It was understood that all these ranges were provisional and that they would be reviewed in early 1989 in the light of intervening developments."" At any rate, those are two more suggestions. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
198806	347	ANGELL	 I like Don Kohn's second suggestion best of all. I would prefer that we not make it seem as if we are really all that uncertain about these.

There's another paragraph on Ml. It reads: ""With respect to Ml, the Committee reaffirmed its decision in February not to establish a specific target for 1988 and also decided not to set a tentative range for 1989. The behavior of this aggregate in relation to economic activity and prices will continue to be evaluated in the light of the behavior of its velocity, developments in the economy and financial markets, and the nature of emerging price pressures.""  "	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	367	JOHNSON	 I would like to ask one more question. [Unintelligible] I don't have any problem with that, but I'd like to clarify one more thing with Don Kohn. I should have asked this earlier, but it is not going to change anything. Going back and looking at the [unintelligible], the staff forecast is 6 percent nominal for 1989-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	368	KOHN	 It's 6-1/2 percent, I think. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	369	SPEAKER	 6-1/2. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	370	JOHNSON	 That's what I said--around 6. The central tendency of the FOMC members is around 6. The midpoint on this alternative III is 5 percent. Anybody who looks at that is going to say, well, the trend rate of M2 velocity is zero, and that automatically means that the Fed is targeting higher interest rates. Is that going to be obvious to people? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	371	KOHN	 It's not really that obvious. I think it would imply some small increase in interest rates, but it depends on what happens over the second half of this year. It is very hard to say until you know what happens in the second half of this year what the velocity would be next year, because whatever might happen in the second half, interest rates have a [unintelligible]. It's not necessarily-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	372	JOHNSON	 But they can draw that conclusion from what has already happened. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	373	KOHN	 It is close. I think if rates were held about steady here, with the staff's GNP forecast you'd probably get something on the order of 5-1/2 percent [M2 growth] next year. So, it would be a small increase in velocity, just with the lagged effects of what we've done through yesterday. At least that's what the models say. It is not that obvious--especially with 4 points in the range. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	374	JOHNSON	 I didn't want anything obvious. I would be uncomfortable with somebody looking at the range and seeing a big interest rate increase just to get the velocity number. Okay. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	44.0
198806	375	MELZER	 On that Ml sentence--again, this is just a drafting issue, but we are saying that the behavior in relation to economic activity and prices will be evaluated in light of economic developments and emerging price pressures. Somehow it seems redundant to me. It's not a big point, but I think we could do a better job drafting this. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198806	376	KOHN	" You could just take out ""in relation to economic activity and prices."" One question is whether the Committee wants to shorten this thing at all. We felt that this had been repeated sufficiently. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	377	MELZER	 That probably is a good way to fix it, Don. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
198806	378	KOHN	 [Unintelligible] repeat this rationale so maybe this aggregate will continue to be evaluated in the light of its velocity.  	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
198806	379	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Kohn.] 	21	21	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	380	KOHN	 Monetary policy decisions are being made today in a somewhat  different environment of asset price movements than we have been used to  over most of the past year or so. Of course, for most of that period a  weak dollar and rising bond yields had reinforced the analysis that  policy had to tighten to head off accelerating inflation. The question  is whether the recent improvements in bonds and the dollar suggest that  interest rates have been raised enough or at least that the recent  trajectory of firming should be moderated.  Both the causes and the implications of these recent  developments are difficult to interpret. On balance, as both Peter and  Sam indicated, it would seem that incoming information on both trade and  the economy, along with the actions of the Federal Reserve, allayed some  of the market's worst fears about accelerating inflation, a declining  dollar, and the need ultimately for a very much sharper tightening of  monetary policy. This change in attitude made long-term dollar  securities much more attractive, in a situation in which many dealers  and other professionals had thought that prices would continue to head  down.  The very volatility and noise in these asset prices should  strike a note of caution in any reaction to them. The rather large day-  to-day price movements in the bond market suggest that current levels  are not held with much conviction, and recent movements could easily be  reversed. In some sense, such a reversal is embedded in the staff  forecast, though I should hasten to add that that forecast is not so  sensitive to relatively small rate movements that it is incompatible  with the current configuration for a time. Even so, the underlying  assessment of that forecast is that pressures on prices and the pace of  the external adjustment process at some point will show through in substantial increases in short- and long-term interest rates and declines  in the dollar.  Even if strength in the dollar and bonds persists, or at least  is not reversed, the following points may be relevant to their  interpretation for policy.  1. Despite the recent rally in the bond markets, at 8.90  percent the yield on 30 year Treasury bonds is quite high relative to  the inflation of recent years, and certainly relative to the FOMC's goal  of price stability. And this yield is 1/2 percentage point above  earlier this year and 1-1/2 percentage points above its level at the  beginning of 1987. Investors apparently are still of the view that on  balance the risks are weighted toward additional price pressures.  2. The yield curve still slopes upward, albeit by considerably  less than a few weeks ago. The differential between short- and long-  term rates is not at a level that in the past has suggested an impending  recession, or even necessarily a very soft economy, especially if one  makes some allowance for the expected Treasury bond shortage. It seems  likely that investors still anticipate that monetary policy will  continue to firm, though by less than in the staff forecast.  3. Real short-term rates have risen along with the tightening  in monetary policy, but their increase from earlier this year probably  has been less than the increase in nominal rates, given some intensification of at least short-term inflation expectations seen in the various  surveys. Moreover, these rates are probably not much higher than they  were in the spring of 1987, which was compatible with growth in excess  of potential for the last few quarters. The recent direction of real  long-term rates is even more difficult to determine. If the extreme  inflation fears have abated, so too probably has the mean of expected  inflation over a long period. This suggests that at least a portion of  the very recent declines in bond yields did not represent a drop in real  rates. To the extent real rates did decrease, their impact on the  economy would depend on whether that decrease was in response to a  weakening demand picture, or to a shift in demand for bonds, perhaps  from internationally diversified investors. The latter could represent  a net stimulus to the economy.  4. The implications of the dollar's strength are especially  hard to read. If the staff assessment is correct, this is only a  temporary detour in the downward movement of the dollar. As such, if it  persisted, it could slow adjustment and damp growth, as Ted pointed out  yesterday, in a sense supplementing the tighter monetary policy of  recent months and reducing, at least for a time, the degree of further  policy restraint needed. If, however, the dollar remains firm because  the trade balance continues to improve at a rapid pace, the implications  would be somewhat different. The improvement in the trade balance still  will require restraint on domestic demand to free resources and forestall an intensification of price pressures. In this case, policy might  have to be firmed substantially even in the face of some strength in the  dollar.  5. With all the gyrations in these markets, money growth  generally has come in about where the Committee expected. Growth in M2  is a touch stronger, especially in its Ml component. Data received in  the last few days now suggest M2 growth in June of 6-1/2 percent, rather  than the 6 percent in the bluebook, and Ml growth of 9-1/2 percent. We  have interpreted the strength in demands for liquid components of M2 as  a function of uncertainty about future interest rate movements, rather  than a symptom of greater growth in transactions and income than  expected. June M2 growth remains well below the rates of earlier this  year, and we continue to expect a further slowing in the months ahead in  lagged response to previous increases in interest rates and opportunity  costs. The most recent data would not cause us to alter our assessment  of the growth rates of M2 or M3 given the alternatives in the bluebook.  6. Finally, uncertainties about the impact of these  developments might imply some caution in immediate policy moves, though  not a change in course if the risks were still seen to lie on the side  of some uptick in prices, given current levels of resource utilization.  If exacerbating recent strength in the dollar were a particular concern,  because of its potential effect on external adjustment, or because of a  possible demonstration effect of United States actions on the general level of  interest rates in industrialized countries, the foreign exchange markets  might be given more prominence in the directive and short-run policy  implementation. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	381	GREENSPAN	 May I make a comment on that? We will be discussing, probably in both the testimony and the report, something that captures the discussions we had on the monetary base-- what it is that we concluded--and I might also mention the focus on future research relative to that. Let me just raise a couple issues here. When you look at the number of pieces of information that will be coming out in the next several weeks, we are going to be confronted, I think, with a lot of potential changes that we cannot effectively foresee. That includes the resolution of what is an extraordinary rise in the exchange rate, which really is something of a surprise and has to be a part of anything we are considering relative to what we are going to do with respect to policy. As a consequence of that, I think we should have a telephone conference in a couple of weeks--after the employment data, and probably after the PPI data, are released--to review whatever it is that we agree to today. I suggest that because I don't think that I would feel comfortable with a directive covering the next six weeks, given an economy with a capability of doing a lot of things that are shifting all over. In that context, and listening to the economic forecast, I would opt for asymmetric language toward tightness and I very much think that it would be appropriate to add an additional $50 million to the borrowing, which would bring total borrowings up to about the $600 million level. I would opt for that, if for no other reason than, as I understand it, that we probably need to be at that level to reaffirm the 7-1/2 percent funds rate we have in the market currently, and that is where people in the market essentially expect it to be. My concern is that we not be perceived to be reversing policy; and I think that putting that sort of posture forward gives us the flexibility to decide, under whatever conditions exist in a couple of weeks, either to move or not to move thereafter. Mr. Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	382	BOEHNE	 I have two issues that I am trying to balance here. One is how I foresee the risks in the economy and inflation, and the other is that we snugged just a week ago. Taking those two issues into account, I would prefer that we maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. I would have an asymmetric directive on the side of tightening. Under alternative B, I would round down those halves so that instead of 5-1/2 percent for M2 I would make it 5 percent, and instead of 3-1/2 percent for Ml, I would make it 3 percent. I think your advice about having a telephone call is well taken. On the business of being worried about whether the funds rate is 7-1/2 or 7-3/8 or 7-5/8 percent, again, I think we ought not peg that so tightly. I have no problem with borrowed reserves at $550 to $600 million or something like that. But I don't think we should worry that much about whether the federal funds rate goes up an eighth or down an eighth. I think it'll be good to get back to our pre-October 1987 posture on that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	383	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	384	MELZER	 I would support what you have in mind. I don't perceive the move on the telephone call--I guess it was last week--or what you're proposing now, as really pegging the funds rate. What I perceive it to be is an intelligent move which the market really has  discounted--and perhaps it has discounted more tightening than, in fact, we've undertaken. Not only has it discounted it, but it has discounted it very constructively, if you will, in terms of how markets are performing. I think we would all generally agree that we're in an environment where probably more [tightening] will be necessary. I perceive what you're suggesting here is that we take advantage of that and just validate a rate and a policy expectation that's already discounted in the market. And on that basis I would do it. In terms of the policy record, I don't know how we could communicate it in such a way that it doesn't appear that the Committee has in two successive weeks here taken two further tightening actions. There's probably a way to handle it, in terms of words, so it doesn't come across that way. I think that would be desirable. And I would favor the asymmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198806	385	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	386	HELLER	 Mr. Boehne said it pretty well. There is good reason to maintain the current posture, especially in view of the high dollar that we're seeing at the present time. If you see a marked turnaround in markets, international or domestic, then I'd say in two or three weeks, or whenever that occurs, we can have a conference call and change our policy posture as may be appropriate at that particular time. So, I'd be for the $550 million borrowing assumption and a conference call. I don't know whether a conference call means we are asymmetric or not. I think I'd rather have the Committee take action than have the Desk automatically do it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	387	GREENSPAN	 Well, I don't think the Desk is just basically a [unintelligible]. The asymmetric language indicates the direction in which the Desk would be leaning without necessarily acting. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	388	HELLER	 Yes. As long as that's before it happens and the phone call is not a reaffirmation of action. That's what I'd like to see. I'd be glad to go along with the asymmetrical language, with a phone call. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	389	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	390	HOSKINS	 Just for clarification: Is that [telephone] meeting a conference or is it a vote? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	391	GREENSPAN	 It could be either. It is a question of whether something of great significance happens or if we agree that nothing has happened. It's only that it is possible that we may get a significant move in the exchange rate; we may get some very significant data which may change the psychology of the market as a consequence of the payroll data. We've got the PPI coming out, amongst a lot of other figures. So, it's a type of period when I think it's useful for the Committee to be a little more active because there are crucial decisions to be made. President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	392	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I guess the real question is whether we've done enough up until now. If you look at the real activity signs, I guess that would say probably we have; but if you look at the recent behavior of the aggregates--unless that's an aberration of some sort--that says we haven't. My guess is that we  haven't done quite enough yet, so I was thinking in terms of that level of borrowed reserves that would be associated with an expected federal funds rate of 7-3/4 percent. But I could live with what you're suggesting, with an asymmetric directive and the understanding that we get together in a couple of weeks and take a look at it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	393	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	394	PARRY	" I guess my preference would be for alternative ""C"", because I think all of the analysis we have seen over the last two days would support it very strongly. As a fallback position, though, I think I could see taking it in a couple of bites. I must admit that a move up to $600 million on borrowing is not quite the size of bite I had in mind; but if we were to make some move now and then agree to talk about this in a couple of weeks, I certainly could go along with that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	395	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	396	FORRESTAL	" Mr. Chairman, on the basis of the forecast, my preference when I came into the meeting was for some slight tightening--and by slight I mean something around $100 million additional to the borrowing target. That would be somewhere between ""B"" and ""C"". But in light of the uncertainties that you see in the additional data that will be coming in, I don't have any strong objection to doing it in stages. I would like to point out, though, that in my mind there is a problem with that, in the sense that if we keep doing this in small bites and we keep responding to individual pieces of information, we're taking a shorter-term view than I think the Committee should be taking. I think that we need to be more forward-looking and not seem to be reacting to individual pieces of information. I think that's what the markets are doing at the moment. They're focusing on very short-term considerations, and I think we ought to be more forward-looking. The other thing I would say, I think Tom Melzer was saying as well. We ought to take advantage of the seasonal pressures that are in the market and do pretty much what we did last time--that is, take advantage of what the market is doing with respect to the federal funds rate. But the bottom line is that I would go with your suggestion. And I would certainly want to have an asymmetrical directive. With respect to the directive, if I may, I would like to make two other suggestions. Since the focus of this discussion this morning seems to be on inflationary pressures, it would seem to me logical to put that phrase ""indications of inflationary pressures"" first in the directive. In a more general sense, the language in the directive keeps talking about--and we've used this for a long time-- the strength of the business expansion and I wonder whether it wouldn't be better, given my predilection for a longer-term view, to say the strength of the forecast for the business outlook rather than expansion. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198806	397	GREENSPAN	 I don't know whether we shouldn't try to embody that in the 1989 question. It's a little too sensitive to capture in the operational paragraph because that paragraph is essentially the short-term instruction to the Desk. And I was  wondering whether or not we can't capture what you're trying to do in the Humphrey-Hawkins report itself. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	398	FORRESTAL	 Well, that would help. Even though it's short-term and is a direction for the Desk, I still think it can embody that other concept. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198806	399	GREENSPAN	 Sorry-- [could you repeat that?] 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	400	FORRESTAL	 Even though this is a short-term directive to the Desk, I think you still can embody that longer-term forecast and outlook in that language, but I don't feel strongly about that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198806	401	GREENSPAN	 I think you can but the trouble is you may be putting a lot more in there than we need. However, I think we can catch the philosophy you're suggesting because it's certainly the philosophy of the Committee. And we could capture that in the report. President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	402	KEEHN	 Mr. Chairman, I agree with the direction you're suggesting, but I might get there a slightly different way. I wonder if there hasn't been enough movement in the rates that a change in the discount rate would be appropriate. I think I understand the tremendous sensitivity about that, but I wonder if it couldn't be explained as rather a technical move, perhaps a following move, at this point. And if the Board members were to do that, then the borrowing level would be adjusted accordingly. If you were not comfortable with that, then I would agree with the increase in the borrowing level to $600 million with asymmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198806	403	GREENSPAN	 Let me just take a minute on that. One thing we do have to avoid is an international ratcheting game between the United States, the Germans, and the Japanese. We are in continuing consultation with them and we are all trying to avoid that sequence. I'm not certain they would agree at this stage that, with a move on the discount rate, we would not trigger a set of circumstances [that would lead to a ratcheting of rates]. First, if we change the discount rate, which the markets are not expecting, we'd probably have the dollar go up 3 yen and 3 pfennigs pretty quickly. And I think that would almost automatically require that the Bundesbank match it because they are under severe political pressure with the exchange rate weakening for them. So, one of the things that we have to be careful about--and I might add one of the reasons why I think we have to calibrate in the way that we are--is that we have to be very careful not to trigger an international competitive spiral. I think that is not an inconceivable risk here. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	404	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, this gets us into an awkward position with regard to our boards of directors. When we first sent in our recommended increase in the discount rate, we had in mind a half point increase in the federal funds rate, which we virtually have achieved. That would suggest that we really ought to withdraw our recommendation, which is hard to explain to them because we can't really tell them what the System has done at the Open Market level. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	405	GREENSPAN	 That is a--  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	406	BLACK	 It gets into a ticklish position. We did withdraw our first one for that very reason. We had gotten up to where we wanted to go, so we withdrew it and then decided it needed to go more. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	407	GREENSPAN	 But what may solve the problem--we can handle it, I think, if I announce in my testimony what we have done at that point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	408	BLACK	 Sure, that would be very helpful. I've been debating what I would say to them because I can't really tell them what I know. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	409	PARRY	 Except you can say that money market rates have moved to the level-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	410	BLACK	 As I say, the market assumes that the System has tightened. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	411	HOSKINS	 Why not have a following discount rate move? If we believe the discount rate should be roughly in line with other rates, then we could probably get by with having it move up. My concern is that if we move ahead on the funds rate and we leave the discount rate behind, it's going to get more difficult to raise that rate the further forward we go. And I have some concerns that we're just dropping that rate as any kind of a useful tool at all. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	412	GREENSPAN	 At some point we're going to have to do something. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	413	JOHNSON	 Yes. I was going to say--at some point I think if we decide that we have to lock in the structure, obviously that's what you want to do. I think there's still enough uncertainty out there, at least on my part, that I wouldn't want to lock that floor in. But there will be a point, obviously, when that needs to be done. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	414	BLACK	 And therein lies another problem for the directors because, under our new procedures, if we haven't gotten a recommendation in, they are not going to be in' that first wave. And that's going to be very disappointing to them. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	415	GREENSPAN	 Should that event come, we will try to be- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	416	BLACK	 I think it will be very helpful to give them a chance to join. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	417	JOHNSON	 It might be useful if they understood that, to some extent, movements in the funds rate were embodying what their preferences were. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	418	BLACK	 Well, that's what we really told them. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	419	JOHNSON	 I think if they can understand that, then they shouldn't be disappointed on the discount rate--as long as we're getting it done one way or the other.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	420	BLACK	 I don't think they are all unduly disappointed, but it's awfully hard to tell them the full rationale for your recommendation when you really can't tell them what the Open Market Committee has decided. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	421	SEGER	 Maybe we ought to consider announcing promptly what we do; then you could tell them. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	422	BLACK	 That would solve that particular problem, Martha. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	423	GREENSPAN	 And create others. President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	424	STERN	 I like your suggestion, Mr. Chairman. To me, the key thing at this point is the asymmetrical directive. I don't feel personally that it's necessary to do much immediately, but as I noted earlier--and many of us discussed this--I think the risks are on the side of more inflation looking down the road. And I would like to be positioned to address that if and when it's appropriate. I certainly can support raising the borrowing target to $600 million associated with alternative B. I don't view that as having much of an effect one way or the other at this point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198806	425	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	426	KELLEY	 I'm pretty much where Gary Stern is. I would prefer not to make a further move at this point and to have asymmetric language. But I'm comfortable with your suggestion and would be happy to support it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	427	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	428	SEGER	 I'm in favor of maintaining the present degree of reserve pressure with asymmetric language, and reconvening via telephone in the next two or three weeks. In fact, it seems to me we could even wait until that time to put the extra $50 million in the target because, as I understand it, the fed funds rate is running right around 8 percent at the moment. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	429	STERNLIGHT	 This is on the statement date today; it was 8 percent earlier today. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	430	GREENSPAN	 I'm sorry, what was that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	431	JOHNSON	 Statement date. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	432	STERNLIGHT	 Today is the quarter-end statement date. Funds were trading earlier in an 8 percent area, even a little higher. We did some early repurchase agreements and the funds rate came down below the 8 percent level the last I heard. It is still pretty high. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	433	SEGER	 It has been up close to 8 percent even before today, though, hasn't it? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	434	STERNLIGHT	 Well, yesterday. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	435	SEGER	 Thanks. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	436	CORRIGAN	 Well, that's the end of that.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198806	437	GREENSPAN	 I assume that with $600 million we will drift back to 7-1/2 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	438	STERNLIGHT	 When we get past the quarter-end pressures, I would expect that, certainly. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	439	SEGER	 I guess I don't have that much faith in the accuracy of our models. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	440	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	441	CORRIGAN	" Since I'd be between ""B"" and ""C"" anyway, I'm quite comfortable with the formulation that you put on the table, Mr. Chairman. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198806	442	JOHNSON	 Maybe I should--is there anybody else? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	443	GREENSPAN	 Yes, go ahead. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	444	JOHNSON	 I'm sort of like Gary Stern, Mike Kelley, Bob Heller and others who have said they would like no change at this point but that the risks are asymmetric. My view is that that's where the greatest probability is. My preference would be generally no change, but subject to review at some point with the probability that we might move. However, the Chairman has indicated a willingness to go $50 million additional on the borrowing, and I think if there really is a risk of the funds rate settling back below the 7-1/2 percent, I can live with going with $600 million now to avoid that. I think the funds rate is important. I've never viewed this as targeting fed funds unless you leave it stable all the time. My view is that you want to move it, but you want to give a message with that funds rate, and I guess you should be willing to move it as you need to. So, I think the 7-1/2 has a significant message, and basically I think the markets have discounted it, as Tom Melzer says. And I wouldn't want to see them get a different impression from that. So, if in fact going to $600 million means a 7-1/2 percent funds rate, roughly, I can support that. I can also support the asymmetric language, but I would want to make sure that that doesn't mean it's automatic. I think that the conference call should be purely for review, and there's no automatic move on borrowing at that stage. We may actually feel totally differently when we review the evidence. As long as that's well understood, I think I can support this directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	445	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	446	GUFFEY	 Mr. Chairman, I, too, would agree that your proposal is reasonable and quite acceptable, with one proviso, however--that $600 million does indeed mean 7-1/2 percent and not greatly over that level. My point is that it seems to me the next step in the tightening process quite likely is the discount rate. And in my own view, it would be an inappropriate action to tighten further now. As a result, your proposal of going to $600 million, if that really means a funds rate of about 7-1/2 percent and not greatly higher than that, is very acceptable to me. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198806	447	GREENSPAN	 I think President Hoskins is next.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	448	HOSKINS	" Yes, I'm ready. I guess since a $200 [million increase in the borrowing target] made the markets happy, maybe we ought to consider that again! But I don't think there's much support for that. To try to reduce inflation at all in 1989, I think we would have to move at least 50 basis points before the end of the third quarter. That would imply a ""C"" path to me. A trade-off obviously for the ""C"" path, given what Peter Sternlight said yesterday with respect to a discount rate move causing the funds rate to rise, would be living with a ""B"" path with a discount rate increase. I have some reservations similar to President Forrestal in respect to reacting, or appearing to react, to incoming information on an every two-week basis. I think the market has been doing that and I think we should try to set a tone of a little more stability than that. I also am concerned that this tit-for-tat kind of following market rates up may not get us out in front of inflation. It's like trying to nibble it to death, it seems to me. And it's not clear to me from our moves to date that we've tightened significantly. If you look at the monetary aggregates, which is the point Bob Black made, you could make a case that we haven't changed much at all. If you look at bank credit, we had two months of pretty strong growth relative to the last 6 months. So, the concern would be that if the markets are moving rates, while we're allowing them to go up, in fact, we're providing more reserves than-- "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	449	JOHNSON	 You've got a point on the reserve thing, but on the rates, the funds rate has basically led all the other short rates. It's higher than the T-bill, commercial paper rates, and everything else. Your point on reserves is well taken, but we've certainly been ahead on the short rate issue. Some of that could be the supply problem but-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	450	HOSKINS	" Yes. It's just very difficult for me to untangle. I think you understand what I'm concerned about--that it's not obvious to me that we're ahead of the game all the time. So I guess my preference would be for ""C"". But I think if we were to move with the $50 million now and seriously consider $100 million if the data that you're concerned about come out to support that kind of move, then I could live with your suggestion. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	451	HELLER	 Another $100 million then or-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	452	HOSKINS	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	453	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	454	ANGELL	" Borrowing of $550, $600 million--how important is that? Borrowing of $600 million with a 7-1/2 percent fed funds rate is a return to what we decided not to do. I just don't understand how we could do that. We voted to follow a borrowing target, and the present level of our borrowing target is $550 million. And if we tighten, we tighten. Now of all the times to choose to tell the markets we're tightening, this is the lousiest time I have ever heard of. I mean, the markets have received so well what we've done. It has been an immaculate arrangement of achieving objectives. And I don't see how we're going to go in here and do this. I'm reluctant to have to vote ""no"". But in the past I've gone along, and every time I've been sorry. We did this last September. We had a deal; we said  what we'll do is increase the borrowing. But we didn't do it. And then the markets discovered it 3 weeks later and the timing was just as bad as it could be. I just don't understand why we can't maintain present borrowing pressures; then we will know what we're doing. There will be no misunderstanding. Why not have a conference call in the meantime if something happens? I don't know what the dollar is going to do, but if the dollar rises and continues to rise--sometimes if you're in the financial marketplace and you want to go bet against what the market's doing you can go ahead and do it if you like. This dollar might have more [room] to run up than it has to go down. If it does, it would seem to me that it could very well get that much more top heavy, that much more over where the trade requirement is. And I want to have some ammunition to do it when it's time to do it. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	455	GREENSPAN	 You're trying to say that going from $550 million to $600 million is going to do all that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	456	ANGELL	 I'm saying that going to $600 million is either going to cause us to abandon borrowing targeting and make it be 7-1/2 percent or-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	457	GREENSPAN	 No, no; leave the 7-1/2 out. I'm trying to follow you as to why going from $550 million to $600 million is going to create all the problems you're suggesting. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	458	ANGELL	 Well, if it's not a problem, then there's no problem leaving it at its current level. If $50 million isn't important, there's no problem leaving it at $550 million; and then when we have our conference call, let's go to $700 million if we need to. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	459	GREENSPAN	 No, it's a legitimate question as to whether you want to be at $550 or $600 million. But the presumption that you're creating is that going from $550 to $600 million is going to create some crucial unwinding, which strikes me as rather unlikely. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	460	ANGELL	 Oh, I believe it is. I believe the long bond market is poised; I think it has accepted what we've done so far in a marvelous way-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	461	GREENSPAN	 But there's no-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	462	ANGELL	 But I think to tighten at this moment in time with nothing out there-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	463	GREENSPAN	 That's not true that nothing is out there. What is out there are potentials of inventory accumulation; in fact, the May figures that just came in today do show a bit more inventory accumulation than I thought we were getting. The crucial question I think we ought to ask is: What happens if we're wrong? Supposing that we go to $600 million and that's the wrong judgment, in retrospect. What's the down side? And the down side strikes me as really quite minimal at this point, because I don't think anybody is perceiving the issue of a significant weakening occurring in the economy at these rates. We haven't even started really serious inventory accumulation. If we had an overhang of inventories I could readily imagine this whole thing tilting over. One extraordinary aspect of the success that we have had to date--namely the tilting of  the yield curve--is the fact that we are getting a lower long-term bond rate and hence, more effective demand coming from those areas of investment; it's the investment parts of the economy which reflect long-term interest rates. And we've got short-term rates where they probably are beginning to bite on the inventory picture. That strikes me as about right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	464	ANGELL	 But I see the inventory thing just the opposite. It seems to me that tightening is going to accumulate more inventories, not less inventories. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	465	GREENSPAN	 Well-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	466	JOHNSON	 Involuntary-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	467	ANGELL	 Because you're going to slow down final demand. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	468	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but if the tightness has moved long-term rates down, there's far more final demand that sits in the long-term bond market than sits in the short end. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	469	ANGELL	 But it has occurred because our tightening has made sense to the markets. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	470	GREENSPAN	 Yes, and there's every reason. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	471	HELLER	 I think it has effected a slowing in the economy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	472	ANGELL	 And this week is not the time to tell the markets we're tightening. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	473	GREENSPAN	 But wait a second. The markets believe implicitly in the fact that we are in the process of tightening in a gradual way. If we put $50 million into the borrowing, it's just not credible to me that that can have any significant effect other than to reinforce the market's view that we're gradually tightening. We've been gradual and very responsible in this. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	474	JOHNSON	 I think I know exactly what you mean, Wayne. I think what Wayne is saying is this: If the record of that $50 million change is announced to the market as a further tightening move, even though the funds rate may not move at all from where it is, that would be [a concern to him]. Is that what you're saying, Wayne? Obviously, if it doesn't move the funds rate, in my opinion, it's not a further tightening. But I think you're saying you don't want to be seen on record as having raised the borrowing target at this point. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	475	ANGELL	 That's right. In other words, if we really went to $600 million and the existing fed funds rate reflects $600 million, I have no problem. But my understanding is that Peter and Don have been following a $550 million target. And if you change a $550 million target to $600 million, the best Fed watchers know that we've snugged. Does anybody disagree with that? The best Fed watchers know we've snugged. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	476	JOHNSON	 Sure.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	477	GREENSPAN	 Not on $50 million, they wouldn't. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	478	ANGELL	 They do. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	479	HELLER	 I think the last time they did. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	480	ANGELL	 They already know we did. The best watchers know we snugged. And then [do we want] to do it again and to have them say we did it again with this timing and possibly the dollar where it is? I'm ready to go to $700 million when we need to or I'm ready to go to a discount rate change if we need to. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	481	GREENSPAN	 Well, the problem is that you don't want to go to $700 million. I could turn the arguments around and be on the other side of this thing if you start to talk about $700 million, because what we do now is basically in advance of events. I think we have been ahead of the power curve. We have been surprisingly, successfully, ahead of what is an emerging inflationary process. In fact, I think it is very difficult to find a period such as this in which Fed policy has done as much as it has. The one thing I just absolutely find unacceptable is that we throw away any of the gains that we have made. And the notion that we are moving into a period where the the economy is still quite strong, and we decide to wait and see, strikes me as risking at this point the loss of what we've accomplished since we started to tighten. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	482	ANGELL	 You mean to say that staying at $550 million, which would maintain the existing arrangement, and having a telephone conference call in 2 weeks, or 1 week if we need to, is different from going wherever you want to go at that time--whether it's $600 or $650 or $700 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	483	GREENSPAN	 Yes, because what it basically does is it reaffirms the asymmetry of our approach toward this particular market, which the financial markets have very clearly indicated is exceptionally appropriate policy. And it is terribly important for the adjustment process to keep that in place. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	484	JOHNSON	 I think we need some clarification, though, on what $550 million and $600 million mean. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	485	KELLEY	 That's right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	486	JOHNSON	 Before we get too deep into this. To the Desk and to Don, what does $550 million mean? Is $550 million going to cause the funds rate to settle back down below 7-1/2 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	487	STERNLIGHT	 I think it's terribly hard to say, Governor Johnson. When the Committee had its conference call on June 22, we were looking at funds rates that had come up to 7-3/8 to 7-1/2 percent; and we thought then that putting in place a $550 million would tend to validate and accept that. Over the final week of the month, we've gotten higher funds rates with these quarter-end pressures. In the period that ended yesterday, we ended up with borrowing at $5 20 million; we never did get even the modest bulge that we thought we'd get on the final day. And I guess the funds rate averaged about 7.57 or 7.58 percent for the 2 weeks--I don't know, I don't have the statement.  	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	488	KOHN	 7.58 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	489	STERNLIGHT	 My guess would be that as these quarter-end pressures fade, the funds rate will get back toward something like what we looked at in mid-June--if we stayed at $550 million that we'd get back to 7-1/2 percent or a shade under. So I feel comfortable saying that with $600 million it'd likely be around 7-1/2 percent, but I couldn't argue strongly that it would not be 7-1/2 percent or a shade over also. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	490	ANGELL	 But, Peter, the question that I have here is: If we stay at $550 million, will any reputable Fed watchers say we've loosened? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	491	GREENSPAN	 Just keep the question. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	492	ANGELL	 No, if we stay at $550 million, will any-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	493	GREENSPAN	 Well, let me rephrase the question. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	494	ANGELL	 No, I want the answer to my question. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	495	GREENSPAN	" I'll answer it; I will say ""no."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	496	ANGELL	 Okay, I agree with your answer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	497	GREENSPAN	 Okay, I'm delighted. Let me ask you this: What do you think is the probability of having to go to $600 million or more? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	498	ANGELL	 50/50. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	499	GREENSPAN	 What do you think the probability of having to go below $550 million directly from here is? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	500	ANGELL	 15 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	501	GREENSPAN	 It strikes me, therefore, that if you take that literally, the chances are higher that we'll go up from here rather than down. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	502	ANGELL	 That's why I want to have a tilt policy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	503	GREENSPAN	 Yes, but the point is that if that is in fact the case, the risks are very clear; and one has much more clout per unit of action by moving in advance. I must admit I'm really trying to listen to your argument and I'm having difficulty with it, because there has been a general thrust of policy here which has been extraordinarily successful. And I think what the additional $50 million is doing is essentially ratifying that. When they ask me, do I think the world is going to come to an end at $550 million, well, obviously not. Looking at what the markets know or what they don't know, I'm not even certain who will catch the $50 million or not catch it. If they do catch the $50 million, will they consider the fact that we have tightened to be something negative? That, I strongly suggest, is probably untrue. The markets in this context cannot perceive of a further slight tightening of the targets as being negative. I really can't [see it].  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	504	ANGELL	 Well-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	505	GREENSPAN	 Remember this economy-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	506	ANGELL	 That's the reason we have a 12-member group-- because some people might see it differently. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	507	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think we've conveyed our points. I will take it out on a tennis court and see if-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	508	CORRIGAN	 Well, I feel sorry for that ball! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198806	509	HOSKINS	 I would like to make just one comment. We are always discussing this in terms of the risks of having to move it up another notch. But we don't discuss the notion of suppose we went up to $700 million, would we be willing to risk bringing the rates back down? In that context, we're some times following. I think if we thought about it another way and said yes, we can move it down as well as up--the idea being that maybe you do get out in front, and if you have made a mistake, then you'd be willing to-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	510	ANGELL	 Well,-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	511	GREENSPAN	 Let me answer that, since I'm on the other side of this issue. If we were to go to $700 million right now, I think we would be putting too much upward pressure on the exchange rate and I think that would create international problems which have the same order of magnitude as the discount rate. So, while I will argue the other side of this, I think I would also argue against that for the reasons I suggested. We still haven't heard from Presidents Boykin or Morris. If they have any inclination-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	512	BOYKIN	 I would go with your prescription. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198806	513	MORRIS	 I will too, Mr. Chairman. I would add on the discount rate that it seems to me that we ought to reserve action on the discount rate to have something in the closet that we can bring out to cope with a sharply declining dollar. I'd remind you that the last rally phase for the dollar lasted six weeks. Maybe this will be more prolonged; I rather doubt it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198806	514	JOHNSON	 It has been depreciating since the beginning of the year, practically. This recent surge is shorter, but the net depreciation from the beginning of the year is what Ted? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	515	TRUMAN	 Oh, it's 11 or 12 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	516	JOHNSON	 11 or 12 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	517	CROSS	 Well, it depends on against what [the depreciation is measured]. [Secretary's note: Several people spoke at once and their comments were unintelligible.] 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	518	ANGELL	 Well, Frank, what are you going to do when the dollar is falling and the price of gold is soaring? And those things are there; then what do we do? Increase the discount rate?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	519	MORRIS	 Yes. I think it's a very useful instrument for that kind of a situation because it's an instrument that's very visible to people abroad. And I think we could act without really fundamentally changing our monetary policy and still get some bang to the buck. Whereas if we go on aligning the discount rate to the funds rate and we do run into such a period, we don't have anything to use in that kind of a situation except intervention. I think we could support intervention with a rise in the discount rate; that would be very useful in that context if it happens. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198806	520	GREENSPAN	 Any other comments or is everyone getting hungry? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	521	HELLER	" Yes, I have one more comment. I think it was Mr. Forrestal who suggested a slight re-ordering in the operational paragraph. Wouldn't it be appropriate on the bottom of page 19 in the last sentence, ""taking account of"" to move that ""conditions in financial markets"" [further down in the list] to be together with the reference to the foreign exchange markets? So that would read on the next page ""developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets"". That's not our top concern clearly and I'm open to whether you want inflation first or the business expansion first. I'd be happy to go along with Mr. Forrestal to put inflation first, business expansion second, and then the financial and markets together. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	522	KELLEY	 I'd like to associate myself with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	523	GREENSPAN	 Any other comments relative to that comment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	524	MELZER	 I think it's a good idea. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198806	525	SPEAKER	 Yes, inflation ought to be first. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	526	GREENSPAN	 Well, let's vote. Let's put that in and let's stipulate for a vote that $50 million increase in borrowing and going asymmetric. I guess the word slightly is relevant. Would you read that as revised? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	527	BERNARD	" It would read, ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase slightly the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of"" --inflation first? "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	528	GREENSPAN	 Do we do inflation first? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	529	SPEAKER	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	530	GREENSPAN	 Let's do inflation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	531	BERNARD	" ""Taking account of indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, and the behavior of the monetary aggregates, somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about""--someone suggested 5 but  ""B"" is 5-1/2--""about 5-1/2 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 5 to 9 percent."" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	532	KELLEY	 I have a comment before we vote, if I may, for clarification. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	533	GREENSPAN	 Pardon? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	534	KELLEY	" Before we vote--. As Norm just read it, the third line there would read that we were increasing pressure, which would be associated with alternative ""C"". The $50 million estimate falls far short, in my view, of alternative ""C"". And I would not use that word. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	535	GUFFEY	 It should be maintaining. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198806	536	KELLEY	 I would use maintain as being better associated with a $50 million increase. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	537	GREENSPAN	 What's everyone's view? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	538	HELLER	 Good point. I agree with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	539	ANGELL	 I don't agree with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	540	SPEAKER	 We have in previous meetings. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	541	JOHNSON	 We're only trying to clarify-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	542	ANGELL	 We've always done it. We've always done it slightly on this, on that, on a $50 million change. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	543	KELLEY	" I would start having problems with using the language connected with alternative ""C"" and also using asymmetric language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198806	544	JOHNSON	 I was going to say something along the same lines. We are changing the borrowing number, that is true. And that normally has been associated, as Governor Angell says, with slightly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	545	ANGELL	 Slightly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	546	JOHNSON	 However, some people have a different view about how you measure reserve pressures. And if we're saying it's not going to change the funds rate--we're only changing borrowing pressure and the funds rate basically stays stable around 7-1/2 percent--total reserve pressures are not really changed in the market. All we have done is change the borrowing target; total reserves would be the same. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	547	BOEHNE	 I wonder if a better way to do it would be to think of a borrowing target of $550 to $600 million and whether it's $600 million or $550 million depends on where the funds rate is. And then use the language to maintain about the existing degree of pressure.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	548	ANGELL	 Well, now, I could go with that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	549	HELLER	 That's also good. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	550	GREENSPAN	 Yes, we can do that or we can basically consolidate the previous $50 million into this language in some way. In other words-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	551	HELLER	 But that's really taken [into account]; even maintain means consolidating. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	552	GREENSPAN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	553	KOHN	 May I ask for a little clarification? I read President Boehne's language as really going to a funds rate target-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	554	GUFFEY	 Yes, it sounds that way. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198806	555	BOEHNE	 That's where you are anyway; let's don't-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	556	KOHN	 Well,-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	557	BOEHNE	 You want the funds rate at 7-1/2 percent --that's what people are saying. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	558	PARRY	 I don't interpret it that way. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	559	GUFFEY	 The borrowing level itself is not published. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198806	560	GREENSPAN	 That's correct, it is not. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	561	GUFFEY	 It has to be interpreted by market participants. I thought that your proposal incorporated the underlying assumption that going to $600 million gives you a 7-1/2 percent funds rate, roughly. That seems acceptable to me and that translates in my mind to maintain the current-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198806	562	GREENSPAN	" Why don't we say ""about maintaining"" then. The about seems to capture most everybody's view of it. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	563	ANGELL	" Say ""about""? About what? How's that read? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	564	PARRY	 I've got to ask a question then. If we do that and we go to $600 million, is there a side constraint on that? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	565	GREENSPAN	 Sorry, is there a what? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	566	PARRY	 Is there a side constraint on that? In other words, if the fed funds rate does turn out to be 7-5/8 percent, is that a problem? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	567	SEGER	 Or 8-1/4. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	568	GREENSPAN	 No, we have decided on going to a borrowing target. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	569	PARRY	 We're on a borrowing target?  	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	570	GREENSPAN	 We're on a borrowing target, yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	571	ANGELL	 But you're not going to like my explanation of my vote if you do it that way, because I'm going to say that the maintain wasn't what we did. Otherwise, I can't explain my vote. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	572	HOSKINS	 He would have no way to communicate that, when he dissents on this. How's anyone going to know why he dissented unless he spells it out? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	573	ANGELL	 Unless I tell something you don't want me to tell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	574	HOSKINS	 Yes. Well, you'd have to spell it out. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	575	KOHN	 I think it is the case, Mr. Chairman--let's see if Peter agrees with me--that whatever we think funds are today or yesterday or the day before, that our view would be that if you stated $550 million, funds would be just a tick lower, practically imperceptibly, but perhaps a little more perceptibly than if you were at $600 million. I think it is a slight firming relative to what would persist if we kept the $550 million and it's-- 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	576	ANGELL	 Well, let's go to $565 million then. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	577	PARRY	 Are there things to say that there has been some-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	578	GREENSPAN	 Look, I think we're getting-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	579	KOHN	 It's splitting [hairs]. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	580	GREENSPAN	 We are getting a little silly, gentlemen. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	581	BLACK	 If you abstract from this, special pressures are factors that would push the federal funds rate up. We have, by going $50 million higher, done a slight tightening. How's that? And I think it ought to reflect that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	582	PARRY	 Now you're talking about doing a little more. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
198806	583	GREENSPAN	 I think it's got to have-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	584	MELZER	 What did this two-week period that just ended come in at? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198806	585	KOHN	 7.58 percent. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	586	GREENSPAN	 7.58 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	587	KOHN	 Yes. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	588	GREENSPAN	 That's the average? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	589	MELZER	 No--I mean in terms of borrowing? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198806	590	KOHN	 $520 million.  	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	591	BLACK	 $520 million. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	592	JOHNSON	 This argument really wouldn't develop if we had asymmetric language and decided to discretely move, but later. We are arguing about angels on the head of a pin here. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198806	593	GREENSPAN	 We really are. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	594	HOSKINS	 Angels? Or devils? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	595	HELLER	 What if you make it a very slight increase? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198806	596	GREENSPAN	 Is there a word less than slight? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	597	BOEHNE	 Very slight. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	598	GREENSPAN	 No, that's fine-tuning to the point we're really--. Slight means very slight; slight means slight. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	599	ANGELL	 Slight is the proper word to go to $600 million. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198806	600	BOEHNE	 Slight's great. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198806	601	GREENSPAN	 It is; really, it is. Let me put it this way: there may be some of you who have troubles. You shouldn't really, because it really is slight. I must say to you, I sympathize with the problem you're raising, but I really don't know how you get it less than slight. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	602	SPEAKER	 Maintain. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	603	MORRIS	 And then it does-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198806	604	BLACK	 Some of us have been suspected of slighter than-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198806	605	GREENSPAN	 The directive has been read. May I request that we vote? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	606	HOSKINS	 Is it at $600 million with slight? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	49.0
198806	607	FORRESTAL	 Increase slightly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198806	608	GREENSPAN	 Yes. Does anyone wish it to be re-read for clarification? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	609	SEGER	" Are you ending up with ""increase"" or are you ending up with ""maintain""? "	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198806	610	FORRESTAL	 Increase slightly. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198806	611	GREENSPAN	 Right. Go ahead with the vote.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198806	612	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell No President Black Yes President Forrestal Yes Governor Heller Yes President Hoskins Yes, reluctantly Governor Johnson Yes Governor Kelley No President Parry Yes Governor Seger No 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198806	613	GREENSPAN	 The only thing remaining on our schedule is the confirmation for the date of the next meeting, Tuesday, August 16th. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
