201601	0	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	50.0	65.0
201601	1	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I know that many of you have had to deal with pretty challenging travel conditions to get here, so I want to express my appreciation for your willingness to brave the snow and ice to participate in today’s meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	2	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we get started, I want to discuss one housekeeping detail that pertains to dinner this evening.	50.0	65.0
201601	3	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Normally, we would have a dinner after the FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	4	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And it’s not impossible for us to do it tonight: The Board staff is prepared to provide dinner.	50.0	65.0
201601	5	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	However, almost all of the people who live in town here face quite challenging conditions in terms of getting home.	50.0	65.0
201601	6	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It is also forecast to rain this afternoon and maybe freeze over.	50.0	65.0
201601	7	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And so I am, frankly, concerned about people staying late and dealing with those conditions.	50.0	65.0
201601	8	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So would it be acceptable to people to make your own arrangements for dinner and cancel this evening?	50.0	65.0
201601	9	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	Yes.	50.0	999.0

201601	12	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So we will consider dinner to be canceled.	50.0	65.0
201601	13	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Will there be a sufficient supply of doughnuts during the break?	50.0	102.0
201601	15	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we gave you a good lunch.	50.0	65.0
201601	16	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	50.0	65.0
201601	17	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning.	50.0	102.0
201601	18	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You should have confidence and trust your colleagues to do the best they possibly can on that score.	50.0	65.0
201601	19	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201601	20	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Importantly, I would like to welcome Neel Kashkari to his first FOMC meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	21	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Neel became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the turn of this year.	50.0	65.0
201601	22	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari brings valuable government-sector experience, including service as senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and assistant secretary of the Treasury during the global financial crisis.	50.0	65.0
201601	23	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, he has extensive experience in the private financial sector, and going back before that, he was employed as an aerospace engineer, contributing to what we affectionately call the “real side” of the economy.	50.0	65.0
201601	24	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, Neel, we look forward to working with you.	50.0	65.0
201601	25	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would also like to welcome back onto the Committee Presidents Bullard, George, Mester, and Rosengren.	50.0	65.0
201601	26	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, as usual, this entire FOMC meeting will be considered a joint meeting with the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201601	27	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201601	28	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201601	29	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201601	30	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	50.0	65.0
201601	31	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, let’s begin with the organizational portion of the meeting, and, following well-worn precedent, I will turn the floor over to Governor Fischer, who will handle the nominations and elections for the positions of Chair and Vice Chair of the Committee.	51.0	65.0
201601	32	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam—Chair.	51.0	108.0
201601	33	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure—[laughter].	51.0	108.0
201601	34	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we’ll see.	51.0	65.0
201601	35	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	51.0	108.0
201601	36	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“Madam” seems just fine.	51.0	65.0
201601	37	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, madam.	51.0	108.0
201601	38	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll be calling for two sets of nominations and votes, and the first is, I’d like to ask for a nomination for Committee Chair.	51.0	108.0

201601	42	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Any other nominations or discussion?	51.0	108.0
201601	43	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[No response]	51.0	108.0
201601	44	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Without objection.	51.0	108.0
201601	45	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now I’d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair.	51.0	108.0
201601	46	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I will nominate William C.	51.0	97.0

201601	59	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	60	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	61	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	62	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And now we’re ready to move on to item 2.	51.0	65.0
201601	63	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We need to select a Federal Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account, and the floor is open for nominations.	51.0	65.0
201601	64	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did I see President Bullard?	51.0	65.0
201601	65	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	51.0	94.0
201601	66	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ll nominate the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.	51.0	94.0
201601	67	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And are there further nominations or discussion?	51.0	65.0
201601	68	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	51.0	65.0
201601	69	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	70	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	51.0	65.0
201601	71	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I need a motion to approve.	51.0	65.0
201601	72	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	73	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	74	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	75	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Next we’re up to item 3, to select a manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.	51.0	65.0
201601	76	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to ask Vice Chairman Dudley to make these nominations.	51.0	65.0
201601	77	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d like to nominate Simon Potter as Manager of the System Open Market Account and Lorie Logan as Deputy Manager of the System Open Market Account.	51.0	96.0
201601	78	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	51.0	65.0
201601	79	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	80	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	81	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	82	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re going to move on to item 4, which concerns authorization for domestic open market operations and foreign currency operations, and I’d like to ask Simon to introduce this item.	64.0	65.0
201601	83	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I was having problems saying “Thank you, Madam Chair” at the start of this, which I’ve gotten through.	64.0	999.0
201601	84	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well done.	64.0	65.0
201601	85	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As part of the annual review of the Committee’s authorization for domestic open market operations, and as discussed in the memo titled “Request for Votes on the Authorization for Desk Operations” that you received before the meeting, the Desk recommends approval, with one minor change to ensure consistency in the use of terms “repo” and “reverse repo” transactions.	64.0	999.0
201601	86	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That would be on page 44 of the organizational document.	64.0	999.0
201601	87	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I’d also like to highlight another item for the Committee’s consideration.	64.0	999.0
201601	88	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues in light of the Federal Reserve’s having begun a program of purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.	64.0	999.0
201601	89	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.	64.0	999.0
201601	90	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That being the case, I recommend the continued suspension of these guidelines.	64.0	999.0
201601	91	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	No Committee vote is needed to continue the suspension.	64.0	999.0
201601	92	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon?	64.0	65.0
201601	93	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	64.0	65.0
201601	94	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing none, we need a motion to approve the proposals.	64.0	65.0
201601	95	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201601	96	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	64.0	96.0
201601	97	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	64.0	65.0
201601	98	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201601	99	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’re now ready to move on to item 5, “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	64.0	65.0
201601	100	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Excuse me.	64.0	999.0
201601	101	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Can we do the foreign authorization?	64.0	999.0
201601	102	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, I’m sorry.	64.0	65.0
201601	103	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I apologize.	64.0	65.0
201601	104	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We also recommend that the Committee approve the documents governing foreign transactions without amendment.	64.0	999.0
201601	105	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As I mentioned at the December FOMC meeting, the staff is evaluating the current foreign exchange reserve management framework and working on modernizing the documents related to foreign operations.	64.0	999.0
201601	106	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I plan to defer recommending any changes to the documents governing foreign operations until these projects are complete.	64.0	999.0
201601	107	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Note that the approval of the “foreign” documents includes approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.	64.0	999.0
201601	108	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As has been the case since February 5, 1997, the limit on warehousing is set at $5 billion.	64.0	999.0
201601	109	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There are currently no outstanding balances.	64.0	999.0
201601	110	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon on the foreign currency matters?	64.0	65.0
201601	111	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Comments?	64.0	65.0
201601	112	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	64.0	65.0
201601	113	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then we need a motion to approve that proposal.	64.0	65.0
201601	114	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	64.0	108.0
201601	115	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second.	64.0	96.0
201601	116	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	64.0	65.0
201601	117	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	64.0	65.0
201601	118	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	64.0	65.0
201601	119	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, item 5—I’d like to turn to “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	66.0	65.0
201601	120	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The staff is proposing three sets of relatively minor changes to the program.	66.0	65.0
201601	121	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The first is to clarify that all Federal Reserve persons—and that includes FOMC participants as well as staff members—must receive, review, and agree to abide by the program.	66.0	65.0
201601	122	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Second, there are some proposed changes to provide more flexibility in making FOMC information access decisions for persons at the Board.	66.0	65.0
201601	123	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, third, there are some technical changes, such as making program language more consistent and correcting a typo.	66.0	65.0
201601	124	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There is also a slightly more substantive change that I would like to propose, and I sent you a memo on this.	66.0	65.0
201601	125	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, our program for security of FOMC information has received some attention from the Congress and others as a consequence of the 2012 leak of FOMC information.	66.0	65.0
201601	126	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Protecting confidential FOMC information is clearly a matter of the utmost importance, and it’s appropriate that we continually review our program to ensure that our policies and practices remain strong and transparent.	66.0	65.0
201601	127	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The proposed changes to section 7 of the program are intended to clarify our procedures in the event of a potential breach of confidential FOMC information.	66.0	65.0
201601	128	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	To date, our program has stated that, once notified of a potential breach, the Committee’s secretary and general counsel will perform a review of the incident and, in light of the review results, the general counsel will determine whether to request the Board’s inspector general to perform an investigation of the incident.	66.0	65.0
201601	129	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, during my tenure as Chair, all potential material breaches have been referred to the inspector general, with only minimal review by the secretary and general counsel.	66.0	65.0
201601	130	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that that approach is fully consistent with the program, and the proposed revisions are meant to codify this practice.	66.0	65.0
201601	131	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the revised language states that the secretary or the general counsel will make a referral to the inspector general, thereby vesting that responsibility in more than one person and reducing the possibility of any apparent conflict of interest in making a referral determination.	66.0	65.0
201601	132	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I would like to propose those changes.	66.0	65.0
201601	133	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, before we go to a vote, let me ask whether there are any comments or questions on that proposal or other changes to the organizational documents proposed by the staff.	66.0	65.0
201601	134	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	66.0	65.0
201601	135	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Madam Chair, I support what you’ve proposed here, but I noted in the strikeouts that the previous version, at some level, offered consultation with the president of the relevant Reserve Bank in the event of a breach.	66.0	103.0
201601	136	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And if the breach emanated from a Reserve Bank, I just wondered, as a practical matter, even though you’re striking through that in favor of this stronger process, whether there would be such consultation.	66.0	103.0
201601	137	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there could be such consultation.	66.0	65.0
201601	138	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do think our default response should be that any material breach will be referred to the inspector general.	66.0	65.0
201601	139	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I agree.	66.0	103.0
201601	140	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That should be the default.	66.0	65.0
201601	141	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It shouldn’t be a specific judgment that we’re making once something has been determined to be material.	66.0	65.0
201601	142	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It should be turned over to the IG.	66.0	65.0
201601	143	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There could certainly continue to be consultation.	66.0	65.0
201601	144	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I do think it’s important to make clear that our policy will be to turn any material matter over to the IG.	66.0	65.0
201601	145	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I support that.	66.0	103.0
201601	146	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I’m thinking, as a practical matter, with employment and code of conduct issues within the Banks, we would have some follow-up if it involves the staff in a Reserve Bank as well.	66.0	103.0
201601	147	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	66.0	65.0
201601	148	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	66.0	65.0
201601	149	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	66.0	65.0
201601	150	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then I guess we need just one motion to approve the organizational document.	66.0	65.0
201601	151	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I would vote on this program explicitly.	66.0	999.0
201601	152	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	66.0	65.0
201601	153	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll vote explicitly on the changes to “The Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	66.0	65.0
201601	154	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	66.0	65.0
201601	155	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	66.0	108.0
201601	156	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	66.0	65.0
201601	157	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	66.0	65.0
201601	158	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Our next agenda item, is “Proposed Change to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”	92.0	65.0
201601	159	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before I turn things over to Governor Fischer, I would like to extend my thanks to the subcommittee on communications and to the staff who have supported their work on this topic.	92.0	65.0
201601	160	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think they are proposing potential enhancements to what is a very important document of this Committee.	92.0	65.0
201601	161	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me turn things over to Governor Fischer to introduce this topic.	92.0	65.0
201601	162	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	163	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At the October 2014 FOMC meeting, we discussed the possibility of amending the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is shortened to the “consensus statement,” in order to clarify that the Committee’s inflation objective is symmetric.	92.0	108.0
201601	164	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At that time, there was widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly.	92.0	108.0
201601	165	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although many participants thought that the symmetry of the objective was understood by the public, it nonetheless seemed useful to clarify that symmetry in the consensus statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	166	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	However, some members thought that making a change to the consensus statement at that time posed a risk that the change could be seen as signaling a change in the Committee’s views about the appropriate timing of liftoff.	92.0	108.0
201601	167	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In order to avoid such confusion, the change was deferred until after liftoff.	92.0	108.0
201601	168	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	With liftoff now behind us, the Committee thought that this would be an appropriate time to make the modification.	92.0	108.0
201601	169	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	To do so, we have worked with all of you to develop specific language, which is shown in blue ink on page 4 of the handout, that has received broad support.	92.0	108.0
201601	170	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The modified wording makes clear that a sequence of one-sided misses of the 2 percent target in either direction would be undesirable.	92.0	108.0
201601	171	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Even if inflation was ultimately expected to return to target, persistent misses would represent a welfare loss and might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored over time.	92.0	108.0
201601	172	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Regarding the specific wording, we use the words “were running” in order to be clear that the deviations are ongoing.	92.0	108.0
201601	173	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That is, they are not simply :bygones” but are expected to continue, at least for a time.	92.0	108.0
201601	174	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think this wording is appropriate because expected future deviations would be a greater concern if they followed a sequence of past deviations in the same direction, as the expected deviations would be more likely to have an effect on longer-term inflation expectations.	92.0	108.0
201601	175	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That said, the word “concerned” was chosen because it provides flexibility regarding whether the Committee would take action in response to the deviations.	92.0	108.0
201601	176	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It might do so, of course, but a policy response would not necessarily be called for.	92.0	108.0
201601	177	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For example, if inflation was running above 2 percent but unemployment was above the level consistent with maximum employment, then the Committee might judge that no change in policy was appropriate.	92.0	108.0
201601	178	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, if inflation was running below 2 percent but the economy was strengthening and inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over the medium term, then the Committee also might see unchanged policy as appropriate.	92.0	108.0
201601	179	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As we noted in the memo, we have also updated the reference to the SEP estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	92.0	108.0
201601	180	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In doing so, we changed the reference from the central tendency to the median, a change consistent with the outcome of the Committee’s discussion last July.	92.0	108.0
201601	181	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In view of the timing of the Chair’s monetary policy testimony, we plan to release the updated statement following our meeting tomorrow along with the usual postmeeting statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	182	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	A draft of the short cover note that would be used for that press release is on page 5 of 5 of the memo from the subcommittee to the FOMC.	92.0	108.0
201601	183	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	184	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	185	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for comments on the consensus statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	186	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with President Williams.	92.0	65.0
201601	187	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	102.0
201601	188	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Governor Fischer has explained the process that we went through in the subcommittee on this as well as the reasons for the change, and I strongly support the change in the language.	92.0	102.0
201601	189	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just want to add one particular comment that I think is relevant for thinking about what we are trying to accomplish here.	92.0	102.0
201601	190	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This part of the consensus statement is really just about our longer-run inflation objective.	92.0	102.0
201601	191	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t shed light on what the policy responses are to deviations from the objective, or to the shape of the objective beyond the fact that it is a symmetric objective.	92.0	102.0
201601	192	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think one of the great achievements of the consensus statement over the years is that it has provided the biggest umbrella we are able to provide with regard to what we agree on—the 2 percent objective, and the view that this is symmetric—and leaves off of the consensus statement the particulars of how one thinks about the appropriate policy response and other things that we may have different views on.	92.0	102.0
201601	193	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the goal here, really, is just to cement in the public’s mind that the goal is 2 percent, that it is the midpoint of the target, and that it is symmetric around that.	92.0	102.0
201601	194	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the rest of the statement, which stays basically the same as before, describes our policy strategy on deviations from that objective and doesn’t indicate specifically what we do in those circumstances but lays out a general strategy.	92.0	102.0
201601	195	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, I strongly support the statement.	92.0	102.0
201601	196	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it is something that will help clarify our thinking for those who may still think that our 2 percent objective is somehow a ceiling and not a point target.	92.0	102.0
201601	197	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	92.0	102.0
201601	198	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	199	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92.0	65.0
201601	200	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	999.0
201601	201	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was first introduced in January 2012.	92.0	999.0
201601	202	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It serves to clarify the Committee’s decisionmaking framework, and I do view the statement as an important addition to our communications arsenal.	92.0	999.0
201601	203	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It is known internally as the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	204	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That is not a misnomer.	92.0	999.0
201601	205	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The statement has had very broad support among FOMC participants since its adoption.	92.0	999.0
201601	206	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, it wasn’t by accident that that happened.	92.0	999.0
201601	207	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The previous communications subcommittee and its chair, Janet Yellen, worked diligently to devise language that would encompass the diversity of views among participants while at the same time articulate to the public the Committee’s approach to policymaking.	92.0	999.0
201601	208	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Due to the quasi-constitutional nature of the document and the fact that it has had very broad support, participants have generally agreed that the bar should be fairly high for making any changes.	92.0	999.0
201601	209	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At the same time, the Committee has periodically considered amendments that could help clarify the document or make it a more effective communications device.	92.0	999.0
201601	210	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And one of those changes, which is on the table today—the clarification that the Committee views a 2 percent inflation objective as symmetric—has received widespread support at previous meetings and, as Governor Fischer said, with the thought that the change would wait until after normalization had begun.	92.0	999.0
201601	211	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Consistent with those past discussions, I strongly support making the change now.	92.0	999.0
201601	212	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The change has been signaled with the minutes of earlier meetings.	92.0	999.0
201601	213	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And, now that liftoff has occurred, it sounds like the right time to do it.	92.0	999.0
201601	214	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Moreover, January is the normal time for reaffirming the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	215	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I am not concerned that the change will be interpreted as a comment or signal about current monetary policy.	92.0	999.0
201601	216	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And we can contain that interpretation by what we say about the change after it is released, explaining that the purpose is to clarify the framework in the interest of furthering transparency.	92.0	999.0
201601	217	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In terms of the specific language, I can tell you that the communications subcommittee and staff, under the able leadership of our chair, Stan Fischer, took a page out of the previous subcommittee’s book and strove to craft language that would represent the broad consensus.	92.0	999.0
201601	218	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We did engage in deliberations and consultations, and we took the comments and suggestions of each FOMC participant very seriously.	92.0	999.0
201601	219	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our deliberations suggest that the language now on the table is acceptable to almost all participants, and I want to acknowledge the willingness of many Committee members to compromise on their favorite phraseology in the spirit of reaching a workable consensus in the pursuit of our common goal of clarifying to the public this aspect of our policymaking framework.	92.0	999.0
201601	220	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the specific wording, the broad intent is to clarify that the Committee views the 2 percent inflation objective as symmetric.	92.0	999.0
201601	221	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As Governor Fischer said, the phrase “were running” captures the idea that the primary concern is with deviations from target that are expected to persist into the future.	92.0	999.0
201601	222	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It allows for different preferred models of the inflation progress among participants.	92.0	999.0
201601	223	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some might put more weight on current and past deviations from the target as informative about future inflation.	92.0	999.0
201601	224	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Others who view inflation expectations as a predominant factor when forecasting inflation might look at persistent deviations as a potential risk for unanchoring expectations.	92.0	999.0
201601	225	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As was said earlier, the word “concerned” is consistent with the Committee’s past behavior.	92.0	999.0
201601	226	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Concern about persistent deviations doesn’t mean that they necessarily warrant Committee action.	92.0	999.0
201601	227	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	For example, I am concerned by the low level of inflation, but, on the basis of the outlook, I think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will return to target over the medium term, and I don’t believe additional policy accommodation is called for.	92.0	999.0
201601	228	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	A look at the minutes of the FOMC meetings in late 2006 and early 2007, when core inflation was above 2 percent, shows that the Committee was indeed concerned about elevated core inflation but held the funds rate target at 5¼ percent because it expected inflation to move lower over time.	92.0	999.0
201601	229	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed wording clarifies the nature of the inflation target.	92.0	999.0
201601	230	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	How policymakers approach setting policy in order to promote achieving the symmetric inflation goal and our other dual-mandate goal of maximum employment is discussed later in the consensus statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	231	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t feel that the proposed wording constrains or changes in any way the ability of the Committee to chart the appropriate course of policy in pursuit of our goals.	92.0	999.0
201601	232	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Again, we might all think of alternative wordings that we might individually prefer in one way or the other.	92.0	999.0
201601	233	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But this statement is meant to be a consensus statement giving the Committee’s policymaking principles, and the specific wording proposed has been developed with that in mind.	92.0	999.0
201601	234	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In supporting this change, I feel comfortable that I can explain my own approach to monetary policymaking within the context of this statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	235	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I hope that others will approach it in this way, too, and I hope that they will support it as well.	92.0	999.0
201601	236	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	92.0	999.0
201601	237	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	238	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92.0	65.0
201601	239	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me briefly, offer the basis for my support for this change.	92.0	104.0
201601	240	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I support it for three reasons.	92.0	104.0
201601	241	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	First, the change is an important, even fundamental, one in the sense that it rises to the level of inclusion in the consensus statement.	92.0	104.0
201601	242	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The question of whether the 2 percent medium-term objective is a ceiling or a goal, with a symmetric loss function focused on it, is a critical one, particularly today—when inflation has undershot the target since the crisis, including almost every single month of my four years here at the Board.	92.0	104.0
201601	243	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, as the meeting that Governor Fischer referred to earlier showed, Committee participants have broadly agreed that the loss function is symmetric.	92.0	104.0
201601	244	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And, third, the proposed language, as Loretta indicated, has been the result of extensive consultation and now attracts the support of nearly all.	92.0	104.0
201601	245	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And for those reasons, I am happy to support the language.	92.0	104.0
201601	246	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	104.0
201601	247	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	248	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92.0	65.0
201601	249	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	97.0
201601	250	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As some of you have probably noticed, I have abstained from voting on this statement since it was introduced in January 2012 in part, as I have stated for the record in each of the past four years, on the ground that it really didn’t communicate much that gave useful insight into how the FOMC would approach its policy decisions.	92.0	97.0
201601	251	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	In part, though, I abstained because certain expectations I had been given regarding language that would be included in the original statement were confounded at that time.	92.0	97.0
201601	252	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Experience over those four years hasn’t really changed my mind as to how useful the statement is in communicating how we go about making our policy decisions.	92.0	97.0
201601	253	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As I anticipated at the time, in actual decisionmaking, everybody pretty much, I think, takes his or her own reading or interpretation of the statement.	92.0	97.0
201601	254	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	However, it is not a bad thing to have even a high-level expression of consensus as to the FOMC’s longer-range goals, and there does come a point when it is probably not too productive to continue to abstain.	92.0	97.0
201601	255	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	This seems to me such a point, particularly in light of the helpful changes that Chair Yellen, Governors Fischer and Powell, and Presidents Mester and Williams have worked out.	92.0	97.0
201601	256	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And although this change is not directed at the issue that was in play back in late 2011, I think it is noteworthy, in light of recent experience and current circumstances.	92.0	97.0
201601	257	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I will vote for the statement today.	92.0	97.0
201601	258	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I now want to add one thought, though.	92.0	97.0
201601	259	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We don’t have a lot of expressions of agreement on the Committee.	92.0	97.0
201601	260	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The statement expresses, albeit at a very high level, an agreement, despite some nontrivial differences that lie beneath it.	92.0	97.0
201601	261	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams, captured this well in his introductory remarks.	92.0	97.0
201601	262	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is institutionally important for us to project an ability to agree, even if only at a fairly high level, and that is why I abstained rather than dissented over each of the past several years.	92.0	97.0
201601	263	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And that is why I have gone out of my way in the past four years not to highlight publicly my points of difference with the statement.	92.0	97.0
201601	264	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I also appreciate the fact that so far as I am aware, none of you has tried to argue publicly that the statement compels or justifies a particular policy outcome.	92.0	97.0
201601	265	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	There is plenty of room to interpret the statement in a variety of ways, as we have de facto done in our policymaking.	92.0	97.0
201601	266	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I suspect many of you, like me, would be happier if it were drafted somewhat differently.	92.0	97.0
201601	267	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I am not sure the language being added is exactly the way I would have phrased the point.	92.0	97.0
201601	268	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The problem, of course, is that we would differ on what those differences should be.	92.0	97.0
201601	269	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think we should recognize the compromises that are inevitable, salute the work the subcommittee has done, endorse the statement, and then refrain from trying to highlight the differences rather than the admittedly high level of agreement.	92.0	97.0
201601	270	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	97.0
201601	271	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	272	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	92.0	65.0
201601	273	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	94.0
201601	274	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m opposed to this portion of the changes to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.	92.0	94.0
201601	275	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My opposition centers on the extra sentence being added to the statement, which reads, “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.”	92.0	94.0
201601	276	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this sentence is inappropriately backward looking.	92.0	94.0
201601	277	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A basic tenet of modern inflation targeting is that it is the inflation forecast that is critically important, not recent misses of inflation from target that were caused by unpredictable shocks that hit the economy.	92.0	94.0
201601	278	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because this is a statement of longer-run goals, this sentence should appropriately reflect this basic tenet of inflation targeting.	92.0	94.0
201601	279	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A rewrite that would accomplish this would be simple:  “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were expected to run persistently above or below this objective.”	92.0	94.0
201601	280	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I communicated my concerns to the communications subcommittee, but I was unable to persuade the subcommittee to change the language.	92.0	94.0
201601	281	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Because I regard this as a matter of fundamental importance for this Committee, I’m dissenting on the adoption of this statement as written.	92.0	94.0
201601	282	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Part of my concern is that this statement of longer-run goals is quasi-constitutional in nature and that language introduced today will likely be very persistent into the future.	92.0	94.0
201601	283	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I therefore think that it is even more important to get this language correct than it is for other Committee statements.	92.0	94.0
201601	284	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I want to now point out three areas in which I see this new sentence as inconsistent with Committee statements and actual practice.	92.0	94.0
201601	285	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	One is in the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	286	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	A second is in the current Committee communication regarding the inflation outlook and future policy decisions.	92.0	94.0
201601	287	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And the third is in past Committee behavior during an era in which inflation was persistently higher than desired.	92.0	94.0
201601	288	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me begin with the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	289	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The current version of Tealbook B, page 8, provides the Committee with results of an optimal control exercise that projects inflation through 2021.	92.0	94.0
201601	290	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The optimal control projections for inflation are below our 2 percent target until 2020; in addition, actual inflation has been below target for several years in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	291	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yet, at least under the assumptions behind the optimal control exercise, this is the very best policy that can be pursued by this Committee.	92.0	94.0
201601	292	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee adopted this approach to policy, then it would not be particularly concerned that inflation had been below target in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	293	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That outcome would be chalked up to shocks that hit the economy in the past, and the Committee would take the effects of those shocks on board and map out a strategy to move inflation back to target over several years.	92.0	94.0
201601	294	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To me, this type of optimal policy calculation lays out a dichotomy compared with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	295	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn to the current Committee communication.	92.0	94.0
201601	296	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee’s official statements on monetary policy in recent quarters have stressed the idea that the Committee needs to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to target over the forecast horizon.	92.0	94.0
201601	297	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is a forward-looking criterion that I think contrasts with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	298	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, let me turn to the past behavior of the Committee.	92.0	94.0
201601	299	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	During the period from 2003 to 2008, inflation routinely ran in excess of 2 percent.	92.0	94.0
201601	300	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Naturally, the Committee and the Chair at the time were constantly asked about this situation.	92.0	94.0
201601	301	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My general characterization of the response is that the Committee stressed that the factors that were keeping inflation relatively high were likely temporary, and that, under the policy in place at the time, the Committee expected inflation to return to lower, more normal levels.	92.0	94.0
201601	302	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Again, this was a forward-looking argument.	92.0	94.0
201601	303	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the event, inflation did not continue to rise but instead moved lower, and an era of inflation misses on the high side ended.	92.0	94.0
201601	304	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This historical experience suggests to me behavior of the Committee that would be difficult to reconcile with the new sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals.	92.0	94.0
201601	305	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In summary, putting the new sentence in the statement of longer-run goals this way will, in my opinion, put a burden on the Committee’s future communication as financial market participants seek to reconcile the new language with the reality that it must be the inflation forecast that really matters for the future direction of monetary policy.	92.0	94.0
201601	306	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Let me stress before concluding that I support the remainder of the statement as written.	92.0	94.0
201601	307	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I worked closely with many of my colleagues on the Committee to help craft this statement during 2011 for adoption in January 2012.	92.0	94.0
201601	308	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This established an official inflation target for the United States, a longtime goal of former Chairman Bernanke.	92.0	94.0
201601	309	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I still very much support that goal as well as the statement other than the new sentence.	92.0	94.0
201601	310	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, I support the addition of the word “symmetric,” because I have always felt that misses on either side of the inflation target are equally important.	92.0	94.0
201601	311	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My qualms today are solely about preserving the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting in the United States.	92.0	94.0
201601	312	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	94.0
201601	313	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	314	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	92.0	65.0
201601	315	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	90.0
201601	316	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support the statement on longer-run goals and thank the subcommittee for providing language that clarifies that our inflation goal is symmetric.	92.0	90.0
201601	317	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to believe that a symmetric goal was generally understood by the public, but there have been occasions when questions were raised about the Committee’s commitment to a symmetric goal, and this language removes any ambiguity.	92.0	90.0
201601	318	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our original longer-run goals document was adopted in 2012.	92.0	90.0
201601	319	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have made only modest changes to that language, mostly of a clarifying nature.	92.0	90.0
201601	320	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful next year, and subsequently every five years, to conduct a more comprehensive review of the longer- run goals.	92.0	90.0
201601	321	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As President Mester discussed, the original document was a compromise to obtain agreement among participants on the Committee in 2012.	92.0	90.0
201601	322	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We chose to focus on the PCE rather than the CPI measure of inflation; to express the goal in terms of total, not core, inflation; and to adopt a 2 percent inflation target.	92.0	90.0
201601	323	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Over the past five years, we have generally undershot our inflation target while being stuck at the lower bound.	92.0	90.0
201601	324	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	My view is that we should at least more fully consider the possibility that a 2 percent inflation target may unduly constrain monetary policy, especially in a world with low equilibrium real interest rates.	92.0	90.0
201601	325	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is clear to me that we have underestimated the cost of hitting, and the difficulties in leaving, the effective lower bound.	92.0	90.0
201601	326	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We may very well not make any changes to what were in 2012 some difficult compromises, but I think a comprehensive review would be instructive even if we choose to make no substantive changes.	92.0	90.0
201601	327	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	90.0
201601	328	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	329	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92.0	65.0
201601	330	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	331	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d like to thank the communications subcommittee for their hard work in finding consensus.	92.0	91.0
201601	332	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a welcome clarification of our price-stability objective.	92.0	91.0
201601	333	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Even though many of us have said in public that we view 2 percent as a symmetric target, I think adding the idea explicitly to the Committee’s formal statement of goals and strategy is an important communications tool to reinforce this concept with the public.	92.0	91.0
201601	334	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The proposed language is succinct and clear in describing the sensible features of the symmetric objective.	92.0	91.0
201601	335	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I strongly support the proposed addition.	92.0	91.0
201601	336	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	337	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	338	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92.0	65.0
201601	339	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	81.0
201601	340	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t see a pressing need to modify the consensus statement, but I don’t have strong objections to the changes being proposed.	92.0	81.0
201601	341	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I would reiterate a point I’ve made in the past, which is that to serve the purpose of the statement in anchoring expectations regarding the conduct of monetary policy, the statement should not be frequently amended.	92.0	81.0
201601	342	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It should be seen as a statement of timeless principles.	92.0	81.0
201601	343	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think somebody used the word “constitutional.”	92.0	81.0
201601	344	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think that’s right.	92.0	81.0
201601	345	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In particular, we should avoid the appearance of opportunistic editing into driving policy expectations in one particular direction or another in the short run.	92.0	81.0
201601	346	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	My limited enthusiasm for this change stems in part from the extent to which this verges on appearing that way.	92.0	81.0
201601	347	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Another reason my enthusiasm is limited is that I don’t know of an economic model in which our implied objective function is symmetric, mathematically speaking, without taking a linear quadratic approximation, which essentially imposes symmetry, or without imposing symmetry a priori on a loss function that a policymaker is posited to have, as opposed to having the objective function derived from the utility function of the agency model.	92.0	81.0
201601	348	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Many of the reasons we view inflation above 2 percent as detrimental to the well-being of our country and our economy are distinct from the reasons we view inflation below 2 percent as detrimental to the economy, and there’s good reason to believe that inflation dynamics could be different above and below 2 percent.	92.0	81.0
201601	349	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I’m not a big fan of the notion that our objectives are, strictly speaking, symmetric.	92.0	81.0
201601	350	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I can live with the statement, however.	92.0	81.0
201601	351	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The sentence that’s inserted, by itself, doesn’t say our concerns are of equal magnitude on either side, and I prefer to think of the symmetry as a symmetry with respect to the sign of the concern on either side.	92.0	81.0
201601	352	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But as I said, I have no objection to the changes being proposed.	92.0	81.0
201601	353	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	354	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	92.0	65.0
201601	355	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	92.0	110.0
201601	356	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m probably newer to this than just about anybody around the table, so I had a number of questions as we went through it.	92.0	110.0
201601	357	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree and support the language in the statement.	92.0	110.0
201601	358	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think it anchors expectations.	92.0	110.0
201601	359	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	For me, as someone maybe coming at this with fresh eyes, it does appear forward looking because the statement overall is forward looking.	92.0	110.0
201601	360	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the key word in the sentence that Jim was referring to is “concerned.”	92.0	110.0
201601	361	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It doesn’t mean we feel the need to act.	92.0	110.0
201601	362	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It means we’d be concerned.	92.0	110.0
201601	363	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I’ll speak for myself—if inflation runs persistently below or above 2 percent, I am concerned, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t expect it to return to the 2 percent objective.	92.0	110.0
201601	364	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the statement adequately reflects my view.	92.0	110.0
201601	365	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	When I talked to Loretta about the timing of this, I had a question—maybe because I’m a little thinner-skinned as a new person here and sensitive to what’s going on out there in the world on inflation—about whether this will be misinterpreted and taken to mean something other than what we intend.	92.0	110.0
201601	366	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I am convinced that this is simply clarifying and making more explicit what had been an implicit basic consensus around this table.	92.0	110.0
201601	367	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So I support this language.	92.0	110.0
201601	368	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	92.0	110.0
201601	369	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	370	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	92.0	65.0
201601	371	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	103.0
201601	372	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, want to thank the subcommittee members and the staff for their work and for the inclusive manner in which they gathered input and considered various views.	92.0	103.0
201601	373	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, think this document has served us well and, as President Lacker noted, changes to it require careful consideration.	92.0	103.0
201601	374	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support the changes to this statement but would offer a brief observation about the proposed clarification.	92.0	103.0
201601	375	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	The choice of an inflation target represents our best judgment for fulfilling a congressional mandate to achieve price stability.	92.0	103.0
201601	376	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Such judgments necessitate not only a view on symmetry, but also on the magnitude of deviations.	92.0	103.0
201601	377	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My own view is that small deviations from 2 percent may not warrant concern even if they are persistent.	92.0	103.0
201601	378	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	For example, it’s not clear to me that we should be terribly concerned if inflation were persistently 1.9 percent or 2.1 percent.	92.0	103.0
201601	379	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Such judgments, of course, must be made in the context of the economy’s performance and its outlook, as others have noted.	92.0	103.0
201601	380	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Deviations from 2 percent are less of a concern if inflation is expected to move toward 2 percent over time and inflation expectations remain well anchored.	92.0	103.0
201601	381	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Likewise, the cost of deviating from the 2 percent objective depends on what is happening with respect to employment and other economic conditions.	92.0	103.0
201601	382	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation below 2 percent might be less of a concern than inflation above, for example, if unemployment is at or below the natural rate and the economy is growing at a sustainable pace.	92.0	103.0
201601	383	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	92.0	103.0
201601	384	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	385	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	92.0	65.0
201601	386	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	111.0
201601	387	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I support the changes to the statement, and I support the statement itself.	92.0	111.0
201601	388	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I have to say, though, that until I joined the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago, I always thought that 2 percent was a ceiling, not a target.	92.0	111.0
201601	389	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I heard what members said, but when I looked at the actions over the past few years, it appeared to me to be a ceiling.	92.0	111.0
201601	390	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think that markets have short memories, maybe shorter memories than many people around this table, and I was guilty of that, too.	92.0	111.0
201601	391	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And so I support putting this in.	92.0	111.0
201601	392	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think symmetry is sufficiently important to put in our constitutional document.	92.0	111.0
201601	393	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I would just encourage us all that we probably have to work even harder to communicate to markets why our actions are consistent with symmetry, especially in the near term, when we may well have to be raising rates when inflation may well be lower than target, and it is going to raise questions.	92.0	111.0
201601	394	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	92.0	111.0
201601	395	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	92.0	65.0
201601	396	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	397	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92.0	65.0
201601	398	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	107.0
201601	399	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also support the change in our statement on longer-run goals, and I thank the subcommittee for their work on this.	92.0	107.0
201601	400	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The modified language is very helpful—particularly at this time, when inflation expectations appear to be under some downward pressure—in clarifying that our inflation target is just that, not a ceiling but a target.	92.0	107.0
201601	401	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I also like the language underscoring that the Committee would be concerned about persistent one- sided misses.	92.0	107.0
201601	402	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	92.0	107.0
201601	403	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92.0	65.0
201601	404	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92.0	65.0
201601	405	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	96.0
201601	406	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support the revised statement.	92.0	96.0
201601	407	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement makes it clear that our loss function is symmetric with regard to the 2 percent goal, not necessarily in every particular case, but on an ex ante basis.	92.0	96.0
201601	408	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, 2 percent is not a ceiling, but a target.	92.0	96.0
201601	409	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, there is a more subtle question, that of how the statement will be read with respect to the so-called bygones issue.	92.0	96.0
201601	410	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Does “symmetric” mean we will want to make up for past shortfalls with offsetting or symmetric overruns?	92.0	96.0
201601	411	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the statement speaks directly to that, and I don’t read the statement that way.	92.0	96.0
201601	412	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Symmetry to me is about the loss function, not a goal or a commitment to make up for past shortfalls.	92.0	96.0
201601	413	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that we continue to run a bygones policy rather than a price-level targeting policy.	92.0	96.0
201601	414	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re not deliberately seeking to push inflation above 2 percent to offset for the years that we spent below 2 percent, but at the same time, we might have to run above 2 percent for a time if that’s what is required to push inflation expectations back up to our 2 percent objective.	92.0	96.0
201601	415	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And we would do that, of course, so we could better achieve our 2 percent objective over the longer run.	92.0	96.0
201601	416	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s that little subtlety that the statement doesn’t get at, and I think it’s just useful to restate this in terms of our still continuing to follow a bygones policy.	92.0	96.0
201601	417	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	418	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me add my own support for the proposed changes to the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	419	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I always viewed our inflation objective as symmetric and considered 2 percent to be our target and not a ceiling, and I think the new language makes this clear.	92.0	65.0
201601	420	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As others have noted, it’s also consistent with previous communications and serves as a meaningful clarification of the FOMC’s views.	92.0	65.0
201601	421	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, I’d like to proceed, as we have in the past, to first take a straw poll of the views of the entire Committee so that the minutes can record the strength of support for the statement among all participants.	92.0	65.0
201601	422	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But we will also need a formal vote by the members of the Committee to adopt the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	423	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me start with a straw poll, and I would ask any of the participants to raise your hand if you support the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	424	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92.0	65.0
201601	425	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Anyone opposed?	92.0	65.0
201601	426	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92.0	65.0
201601	427	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	428	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	One opposed.	92.0	65.0
201601	429	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re going to take a formal vote of the members to adopt the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	430	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, members only, all in favor?	92.0	65.0
201601	431	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	92.0	65.0
201601	432	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And opposed?	92.0	65.0
201601	433	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[One aye]	92.0	65.0
201601	434	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	435	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As Stan noted, we will release the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy tomorrow at the same time as our policy statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	436	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This marks a departure from our typical practice of releasing the statement with the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	437	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	An advantage of our typical approach is that the minutes can provide important context and rationale for any changes and thereby reduce the possibility that the revisions will be misinterpreted by the public.	92.0	65.0
201601	438	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This year, though, my monetary policy testimony before the Congress will occur earlier than normal and before the release of the minutes for this meeting.	92.0	65.0
201601	439	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because the consensus statement appears in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, we need to accelerate its release.	92.0	65.0
201601	440	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I do want to warn everyone that this timing will pose some communications challenges, particularly in light of the fact that we have the dissent that will be reported tomorrow.	92.0	65.0
201601	441	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you may want to discuss the consensus statement in public, or you may be asked about it by members of the press.	92.0	65.0
201601	442	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I just want to remind everybody that, as always, you are free to share your own views.	92.0	65.0
201601	443	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But let me emphasize that you should not characterize the views of other participants or the Committee as a whole as reflected in this meeting’s discussion or other confidential interactions, and that doing so would be a violation of our program for security of FOMC information and our policy on external communications.	92.0	65.0
201601	444	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And on this particular topic, I do think that staying in line with our policies may prove to be quite tricky, as discussing your view could very naturally lead to contrasting your view with the views of others.	92.0	65.0
201601	445	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I mention this because I would like you to consider your communications on this topic very carefully.	92.0	65.0
201601	446	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	With that, let’s go on to our next item, item 7.	92.0	65.0
201601	447	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair.	92.0	91.0
201601	448	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92.0	65.0
201601	449	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have a question.	92.0	91.0
201601	450	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In listening to your commentary, that reminds me that normally, once the minutes are out, there’s a paragraph or more that describe Committee discussions.	92.0	91.0
201601	451	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, there will be.	92.0	65.0
201601	452	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yes, that’s right, but part of the problem is, talking before the minutes come out means that you’re laying yourself bare.	92.0	91.0
201601	453	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	92.0	65.0
201601	454	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s right.	92.0	65.0
201601	455	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will release this tomorrow.	92.0	65.0
201601	456	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard will have a sentence to explain his dissent.	92.0	65.0
201601	457	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	When the blackout period ends, everybody’s free to comment.	92.0	65.0
201601	458	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Especially with the dissent, many of you may be asked, “Well, what’s that about?	92.0	65.0
201601	459	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	What’s your view?” and so forth.	92.0	65.0
201601	460	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But the minutes won’t be out.	92.0	65.0
201601	461	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So it will be very natural, I think, to say things like, “Well, the Committee really thought X.	92.0	65.0
201601	462	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with most people on the Committee.	92.0	65.0
201601	463	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We think this means blah, blah, blah.”	92.0	65.0
201601	464	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So is it fair to say that after the minutes are out, it seems less likely that we’d be running afoul?	92.0	91.0
201601	465	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, I don’t think you’d be running afoul.	92.0	65.0
201601	466	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You might say, “As the minutes explained, the Committee blah, blah, blah.”	92.0	65.0
201601	467	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And that’s fine.	92.0	65.0
201601	468	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s in this period before the minutes come out that I think we’re at risk.	92.0	65.0
201601	469	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I’m just highlighting that.	92.0	65.0
201601	470	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Good.	92.0	91.0
201601	471	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	92.0	91.0
201601	472	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	92.0	65.0
201601	473	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll ask a question that I’m sure is out of order, but I will ask anyhow, and I’ll direct this maybe to President Bullard and the group.	92.0	110.0
201601	474	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I take it that there’s been enough conversation back and forth by everyone else around the table indicating that we do mean this to be forward looking.	92.0	110.0
201601	475	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That’s not enough to sway your thinking?	92.0	110.0
201601	476	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I normally wouldn’t ask, but I just want to ask because it strikes me that this coming out with a dissent is going to be very confusing to people.	92.0	110.0
201601	477	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I wouldn’t mind if we took a few extra minutes here, if you’re willing, to debate it or discuss it a little bit more.	92.0	110.0
201601	478	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It might be healthy—unless that’s going too far and it’s already been done.	92.0	110.0
201601	479	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with you.	92.0	65.0
201601	480	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But we have had some conversations about this.	92.0	65.0
201601	481	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard?	92.0	65.0
201601	482	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s done.	92.0	94.0
201601	483	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You do?	92.0	110.0
201601	484	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	92.0	110.0
201601	485	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You know, I do feel very strongly about this.	92.0	94.0
201601	486	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a constitutional document.	92.0	94.0
201601	487	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we could have said that if inflation is expected to go back to target, the Committee would be comfortable.	92.0	94.0
201601	488	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I gave examples of when we’ve done that in the past.	92.0	94.0
201601	489	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I gave examples taken from our own communications.	92.0	94.0
201601	490	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So my concern is that what we’re doing is setting up, inside a constitutional document, a challenge for future communication because I think, for instance, our rhetoric about being comfortable that inflation is going to return to target is going to be at odds with what’s now in the longer-run statement, which says that we’re uncomfortable if inflation has been below target persistently for a while.	92.0	94.0
201601	491	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I’m trying to highlight this.	92.0	94.0
201601	492	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think what will happen is that, as you all have done here at the meeting, you’ll talk a lot about how you’re interpreting the phrase as forward looking, which is the way I think it needs to be interpreted.	92.0	94.0
201601	493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92.0	65.0
201601	494	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’d just like to make two statements.	92.0	108.0
201601	495	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	One is that “were running” is not the same as “had run,” and if the statement had said we would be concerned if inflation “had run” below 2 percent, then we would clearly be backward looking.	92.0	108.0
201601	496	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We were trying to get in an element that said past, present, and future, and that was where “were running” came from.	92.0	108.0
201601	497	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And as others have emphasized, and as I said in my opening statement, the fact that we are concerned does not imply a particular course of action, and so I applaud President Kaplan’s initiative, and I would have been very happy if it had led to unanimity.	92.0	108.0
201601	498	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The second thing I’d like to say is that I’d like to thank the three other members of the communications subcommittee who spoke, in the order of John Williams, Loretta Mester, and Jay Powell.	92.0	108.0
201601	499	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This was a fairly long and intensive process.	92.0	108.0
201601	500	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was sustained throughout by the opening remark by one of the members of the subcommittee:  “You should know,” she said [laughter], “that there is a body buried under every word in this statement.”	92.0	108.0
201601	501	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I can testify that there are about 13 more bodies buried under there now.	92.0	108.0
201601	502	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, finally, I would like to thank the members of the Committee, including Jim Bullard, for the fact that the discussion on how to modify this statement was conducted in a thoroughly collegial way.	92.0	108.0
201601	503	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92.0	108.0
201601	504	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	92.0	65.0
201601	505	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s then move along to our next item, item 7, which is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’d like to ask Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201601	506	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	507	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I will begin by discussing global financial market developments and then Lorie will review money markets and operational matters.	61.0	999.0
201601	508	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As highlighted in the Desk’s post-liftoff briefings, global financial markets were little changed in the two weeks following the December FOMC meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	509	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The calm in markets vanished at the turn of the year, and risk assets have had their worst January since 2009.	61.0	999.0
201601	510	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally point to three somewhat related factors underpinning the selloff:  first, concerns over possible economic and financial instability in China; second, the continued declines in oil and other commodity prices; and, third, a change in the perception of support for risk assets from G-3 central banks.	61.0	999.0
201601	511	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows how significant the selloff in global risk assets has been.	61.0	999.0
201601	512	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The S&P 500 declined 7 percent, equity indexes in other countries fell as much as 18 percent, and high-yield corporate credit spreads in the United States widened 90 basis points to a new post-crisis high of 750 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	513	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	While the widening in credit spreads was sharpest for energy-sector firms, ex-energy spreads widened by 77 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	514	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Nellie will discuss the financial stability implications of the rise in spreads in her briefing.	61.0	999.0
201601	515	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The changes in asset prices and yields since the start of the year are remarkably similar to what followed the surprise renminbi devaluation in August of last year, as shown by the comparison of the two episodes in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	516	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Market participants viewed unpredictable and inconsistent management of the Chinese currency as a key factor behind both episodes, which renewed questions about the severity of the economic growth slowdown in China and the ability of Chinese authorities to successfully address it.	61.0	999.0
201601	517	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In both instances, the market-implied federal funds rate path shifted lower as global equity prices and emerging market asset prices declined.	61.0	999.0
201601	518	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, safe-haven currencies like the yen appreciated, and long-dated nominal Treasury yields declined, led by large declines in TIPS-implied breakeven rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	519	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the on- and offshore renminbi have depreciated against the US dollar since the August 2015 devaluation.	61.0	999.0
201601	520	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The depreciation trajectory has been particularly volatile since the turn of the year, as Chinese officials appeared for a few days to have shifted their FX policy to target a trade-weighted renminbi basket as opposed to a dollar–renminbi exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	521	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Both the surprise devaluation on August 11 and the erratic renminbi fixings at the start of 2016 have had the effect of depreciating the Chinese currency faster than some market participants had expected.	61.0	999.0
201601	522	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That is increasing the demand to diversify from RMB-denominated assets into US dollar–linked assets and the urgency of paying down US dollar obligations.	61.0	999.0
201601	523	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Chinese authorities have reacted by increasing capital controls, severely limiting liquidity in the offshore RMB market and ramping up intervention to restore stability in the RMB–dollar exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	524	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The volatility in the renminbi, the pace of depreciation since SDR inclusion was announced, and the recent spike in offshore interbank renminbi rates in Hong Kong have led many dealers to expect further depreciation to above 7 RMB per dollar this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	525	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But perhaps more significantly, an increasing number of market participants are expecting a large, and potentially abrupt, depreciation in the RMB–dollar exchange rate in order to reset expectations and stem capital outflows.	61.0	999.0
201601	526	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Of course, Chinese authorities may want to avoid such an outcome and can instead attempt to push against depreciation expectations by intervening in foreign exchange markets and re-pegging to the US dollar.	61.0	999.0
201601	527	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-right panel, official December reserve data showed a record monthly decline of $108 billion, suggesting a historic pace of PBOC reserve sales to stem capital outflows and smooth the pace of currency depreciation.	61.0	999.0
201601	528	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Many speculate that reserve sales have accelerated so far in 2016 as the PBOC apparently re-pegged to the dollar in the past week or so.	61.0	999.0
201601	529	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Developments in China, along with the persistent declines in oil prices that I will discuss in a moment, have intensified concerns about financial fragilities across the globe.	61.0	999.0
201601	530	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, investors have begun to question the sustainability of two long- standing dollar pegs—the Hong Kong dollar and the Saudi riyal.	61.0	999.0
201601	531	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The top section of the bottom-left panel shows that the Hong Kong dollar depreciated significantly over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201601	532	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The bottom section of the panel shows an uptick in realized volatility in the Saudi riyal–US dollar exchange rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	533	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	While contacts believe the likelihood that the Saudi or Hong Kong pegs will be adjusted or abandoned is low because of large central bank dollar reserves, market speculation over this is a new development, and, if either materialized, it could generate additional market spillovers.	61.0	999.0
201601	534	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Concerns about the potential for a rapid deceleration in Chinese demand, which Steve will discuss further in his briefing, contributed to significant declines in the prices of oil and other commodities over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201601	535	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	However, the balance between demand and supply factors continues to be a debated issue, with oil market participants generally focusing on additional supply coming on line from Iran as the key driver over the period.	61.0	999.0
201601	536	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the Bloomberg metals index has declined roughly 5 percent year-to-date, while the front-month Brent crude futures contract has declined about 15 percent to $30 per barrel; both measures fell below their crisis lows, the dashed lines.	61.0	999.0
201601	537	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The declines in commodity prices—in particular, in oil—had knock-on effects across markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	538	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Commodity-linked currencies depreciated considerably, as shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201601	539	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Their depreciation, along with the weakening renminbi, contributed to an appreciation of the trade-weighted dollar of nearly 2 percent since the start of the year, with many emerging market countries using FX intervention to smooth depreciation and maintain market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201601	540	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, global measures of inflation compensation, particularly in the euro area and United States, declined notably over the intermeeting period, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	541	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The US five-year, five-year inflation swap rate—shown in light blue—is currently around 1.9 percent, while the euro-area inflation swap rate—the dark blue line—is at 1.6 percent, both only slightly above their 10-year lows.	61.0	999.0
201601	542	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The Board staff’s measure of five-year, five-year inflation compensation derived from TIPS fell below 1.5 percent over the period.	61.0	999.0
201601	543	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	A third factor underlying recent market turbulence, according to some market participants, is that the so-called G-3 central bank put, which, in their view, has provided support for global risk assets since the crisis, is now further out of the money.	61.0	999.0
201601	544	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In addition to FOMC liftoff, these market participants point to the disappointment of the December ECB meeting and a belief that the BOJ might be at the feasible limit of monetary policy at the lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201601	545	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	However, market-implied policy rate paths in most of the developed world shifted lower over the period, shown in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	546	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Late in the period, communications by ECB President Draghi served to increase expectations of further accommodation coming from the ECB and produced a rally in global risk assets.	61.0	999.0
201601	547	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	With regard to near-term FOMC policy expectations, as shown in the middle-right panel, the implied probability of a 25-basis-point rate hike occurring by the March FOMC meeting has declined to roughly 1 in 4 from even odds at the beginning of the year.	61.0	999.0
201601	548	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There is a very small probability placed on a January hike, and the market is pricing in only one increase to the target range over all of 2016, down from roughly two hikes at the start of the year.	61.0	999.0
201601	549	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Current market pricing of near-term policy is broadly consistent with the results of the Desk’s most recent surveys.	61.0	999.0
201601	550	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Nearly all survey respondents assign a near-zero probability to an increase in the target range occurring at this meeting, and the average perceived probability of a rate increase at the March meeting is around 30 percent.	61.0	999.0
201601	551	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In our surveys, we redesigned questions related to the path of the federal funds rate with the goal of better understanding the differences across survey modal and mean paths and market pricing.	61.0	999.0
201601	552	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel presents more detailed information on the average probability respondents attach to different outcomes for the direction and timing of the Committee’s next policy rate action, along with the implied expectations for the target rate at the end of 2016 conditional on these actions.	61.0	999.0
201601	553	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the leftmost column, respondents on average attach a 72 percent probability to the Committee’s next policy action this year being a rate increase, a 9 percent probability to the next action being a rate decrease, and a 19 percent probability to there being no change in the target range this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	554	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the rightmost column of the panel, conditional on the FOMC’s next policy action in 2016 being an increase in the policy rate at the January or March meeting, respondents’ average expectation for the target rate at year-end 2016 is 98 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	555	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Conditional on the next action being a rate hike in April or later, the expectation for the year-end 2016 target rate is a little lower, at 90 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	556	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Each of these outcomes is equivalent to approximately two further 25-basis-point rate hikes this year.	61.0	999.0
201601	557	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Taking into account the possibilities of the next move being a decrease in the policy rate or no change in 2016 produces an unconditional expectation for the year- end 2016 rate of 77 basis points—the first red dot in the bottom-right panel—only about 10 basis points above the market-implied rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	558	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Note that this unconditional expectation is constructed by assuming the effective lower bound is 13 basis points, which ignores the views of the roughly 25 percent of survey respondents who now believe the lower bound for the target federal funds rate is below 0 to 25 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	559	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	To measure policy rate expectations further out, we asked respondents to consider two conditioning events:  no return to the lower bound over the next three years versus a return to the lower bound sometime over the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201601	560	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	These conditioning events were then used to elicit probability distributions regarding federal funds rates at the end of 2017 and 2018.	61.0	999.0
201601	561	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Respondents across the surveys assigned an average probability of 30 percent to a return to the effective lower bound at some point during the next three years.	61.0	999.0
201601	562	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Conditional on not returning to the lower bound, the expected path was below the modal path in 2017 and 2018, suggesting that even in this scenario, market participants perceive downside risks to their modal federal funds rate forecasts.	61.0	999.0
201601	563	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Combining these conditional expectations with the means associated with the scenario of a return to the effective lower bound gives the unconditional means shown by the red diamonds for 2017 and 2018 in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	564	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is striking how close these unconditional means are to the market-implied path and how far they are from the modal path.	61.0	999.0
201601	565	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We also obtain economic forecasts and the probabilities of a US recession and global recession given by the dealers.	61.0	999.0
201601	566	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	These forecasts and probabilities are broadly similar to the Board staff forecast and do not appear to justify, in a standard Taylor rule–type approach, the large gap between the modal and mean expected rate paths.	61.0	999.0
201601	567	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Of course, a standard Taylor rule approach doesn’t capture some of the most salient features of the current global situation:  most advanced-economy central banks at or near the lower bound; the second-largest economy in the world going through a difficult economic transition while it haltingly tries to liberalize its financial markets; unprecedented falls in commodity prices; and, finally, a large increase in the value of the global reserve currency.	61.0	999.0
201601	568	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	An alternative explanation is that markets are pricing in outcomes that forecasters don’t expect; as you know, forecasters are notoriously bad at predicting recessions.	61.0	999.0
201601	569	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In his briefing, Thomas will discuss the probability of a recession in the next six months implied by corporate credit markets using simple statistical models.	61.0	999.0
201601	570	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We would be happy to take questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	571	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for Simon?	62.0	65.0
201601	572	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	May I ask a question, Madam Chair?	62.0	108.0
201601	573	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	62.0	65.0
201601	574	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What do you expect us to do with these facts?	62.0	108.0
201601	575	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I view our job as trying to report on what’s happened in markets and the expectations that market participants have.	62.0	999.0
201601	576	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	One of the quandaries we had for some time was that there was quite a big difference between the market path and some of the expectations we were getting back from the people that we surveyed.	62.0	999.0
201601	577	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So one of the things we did was, we tried to change our questions to give them events to think about.	62.0	999.0
201601	578	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And that was to try to get at the notion we had had in our heads that some of the reasons that the market path looks different from the modal path or some of the other numbers we get back from them had something to do with the effective lower bound.	62.0	999.0
201601	579	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And what we found by changing the questions is that it was much easier to reconcile the market pricing with the expectations regarding the federal funds rate path that market participants have, but it leaves a big gap to try to explain how their modal path and the economic forecast that they show could support those expectations regarding the federal funds rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	580	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And, in my view, which I expressed, it’s something more to do with the rest of the world.	62.0	999.0
201601	581	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The other possibility is that markets have sensed a weakening that we can’t see in the data, and that’s in the financial market, and they’re basically giving a signal that US growth will be much weaker in the first half of the year.	62.0	999.0
201601	582	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	62.0	108.0
201601	583	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ll stop there.	62.0	108.0
201601	584	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re welcome to continue.	62.0	65.0
201601	585	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, yes.	62.0	108.0
201601	586	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we all heard the earlier statement that more or less said that we’d better get on with the discussion.	62.0	108.0
201601	587	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I see.	62.0	65.0
201601	588	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m doing this in that spirit.	62.0	108.0
201601	589	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	590	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We certainly have time for a little bit more conversation.	62.0	65.0
201601	591	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I did point out to people that we were starting late and so would need to be perhaps a little more concise than usual, but I did not mean to stifle discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	592	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, please, if you want to follow up, continue.	62.0	65.0
201601	593	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The concern I have is that as you draw them out, you’re guiding them.	62.0	108.0
201601	594	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I have a slightly uneasy feeling that we’re getting these torrents of information about what the market participants believe, and we’re not getting torrents about what the staff believes, although we have the very valuable Tealbooks to use.	62.0	108.0
201601	595	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I don’t know whether it’s healthy that we concentrate our briefings on what the markets are telling us rather than what we believe economic forces are pushing us to.	62.0	108.0
201601	596	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not to ask you not to present this, but it’s to ask whether the deeper and deeper and the more complicated questionnaires you’re preparing are helping us do what we need to do in making our decisions.	62.0	108.0
201601	597	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Agreed.	62.0	999.0
201601	598	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	As you look at the data, this is just one point for you to look at, and you have a lot of other information you can bring to bear on your decisions.	62.0	999.0
201601	599	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The only thing I’d say is, the history of markets forecasting these turning points is a little bit better than forecasters just looking at the backward-looking data that they have.	62.0	999.0
201601	600	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, well, you know, the famous Samuelson statement—but I was told by somebody in the Treasury that it’s not that the markets forecast 9 of the past 5 recessions, it’s that they forecast 20 of the past 8.	62.0	108.0
201601	601	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That is probably about right, and the staff forecast has done 0 of the past 9.	62.0	999.0
201601	602	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	[Laughter]	62.0	999.0
201601	603	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So you can make a choice.	62.0	999.0
201601	604	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62.0	65.0
201601	605	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe just to clarify in my own mind some of the information that is in this exhibit 2, bottom-right panel, could one of the things that has been going on—obviously, I know you said this in different ways—be that because, internationally, central banks are experimenting with negative rates, market participants are looking out there, and they are really thinking, “Oh, if something bad happened, the Committee here would go negative, and, therefore, we are going to lower the whole expected policy rate path.”	62.0	94.0
201601	606	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Is that what you are saying?	62.0	94.0
201601	607	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	No.	62.0	999.0
201601	608	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If you take out the 12 responses that have negative rates or push them to 13 basis points, you get an increase of 3 basis points in the 2017 and 2018 dots.	62.0	999.0
201601	609	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So that is not what I am saying.	62.0	999.0
201601	610	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The 30 percent probability of returning to the effective lower bound is not that different from the previous probability we had over two years.	62.0	999.0
201601	611	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is over three years.	62.0	999.0
201601	612	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The thing I am trying to emphasize is that even if we take the expected path, which doesn’t return to the lower bound, they still see downside risks relative to their modal forecast.	62.0	999.0
201601	613	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And that’s hard to understand.	62.0	999.0
201601	614	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It could be the neutral rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	615	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It could be these global forces and a lot of other things that are driving it.	62.0	999.0
201601	616	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But it’s data driven.	62.0	999.0
201601	617	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I was surprised to see how much of what was a big gap we could reconcile by changing the questions.	62.0	999.0
201601	618	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And they didn’t get to see how their answers added up.	62.0	999.0
201601	619	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, okay.	62.0	94.0
201601	620	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62.0	65.0
201601	621	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	622	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I admit I am still digesting the analysis you just gave us, but I do think it’s very useful to have you try to explain what the market pricing is telling us.	62.0	91.0
201601	623	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For example, here is a different one.	62.0	91.0
201601	624	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	On exhibit 2, the top right, you display the five- year, five-year inflation swap rates and how they have taken another leg down.	62.0	91.0
201601	625	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I think you mentioned that the Board of Governors’ assessment of this is below 1½ percent.	62.0	91.0
201601	626	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It is extremely low.	62.0	91.0
201601	627	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, we’ve talked about this in the past, and I have been troubled by the fact that we kind of dismissed these movements, especially when they are associated with another leg down in the price of oil:  Well, there is just a high correlation between oil going down and all the volatility, and so this is really something else about market functioning.	62.0	91.0
201601	628	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But I don’t know what we know about that.	62.0	91.0
201601	629	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	That’s a story, but I wonder about it.	62.0	91.0
201601	630	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And analysis like what you are talking about might shed light on whether markets actually believe that the FOMC is going to be unable to hit its 2 percent inflation objective in a world in which world demand is lower, oil supplies are higher, the price of energy is going down, prices of commodities are going down, and there is a lower equilibrium real interest rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	631	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it is extremely useful for your team to provide some commentary, at least, as to how market participants are thinking about that.	62.0	91.0
201601	632	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I tend to think that these legs down are somewhat meaningful.	62.0	91.0
201601	633	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s definitely evidence that, when risk assets decline, the correlation that breakeven inflation has with oil goes up.	62.0	999.0
201601	634	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And, remember, it is hard for us to explain why inflation from 2020 to 2024 should be related to the oil price today.	62.0	999.0
201601	635	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t have a good explanation for that.	62.0	999.0
201601	636	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It is starting to feed on itself, though, because everyone has seen that.	62.0	999.0
201601	637	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So the trades they are putting on are sort of based on that.	62.0	999.0
201601	638	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And it is not just in the United States; you see it in Europe and other parts of the world.	62.0	999.0
201601	639	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We were doing 30-minute correlations through the trade index, and you can see them really moving up across asset classes.	62.0	999.0
201601	640	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t have a good explanation for that, and it could be something to do with how these assets are traded in the short run.	62.0	999.0
201601	641	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But if you look over a reasonable period of time, which is now six weeks, these are pretty large falls in risk assets as well as a large decline in the inflation compensation measures we have.	62.0	999.0
201601	642	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And, historically, we have looked to measures like this, for example when we were simply looking at long-term Treasury rates quite a long time ago and saying, “They moved up, it must be inflationary pressures.”	62.0	91.0
201601	643	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These are part of the toolbox that we keep pointing to, and dismissing the movements when they are inconvenient but then bringing them back later on when they are moving up.	62.0	91.0
201601	644	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we need a better handle on that.	62.0	91.0
201601	645	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I rely on your analysis to help us with that.	62.0	91.0
201601	646	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that.	62.0	91.0
201601	647	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think the Board staff has also done a lot of good work on it.	62.0	999.0
201601	648	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	62.0	91.0
201601	649	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62.0	91.0
201601	650	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62.0	65.0
201601	651	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	652	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	653	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think Lorie is going to continue now with the second part of the Desk briefing.	61.0	65.0
201601	654	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	655	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I will begin with exhibit 3.	61.0	999.0
201601	656	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Following the Committee’s decision to increase the target for the federal funds rate, overnight rates moved smoothly into the new target range.	61.0	999.0
201601	657	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, overnight secured and unsecured rates shifted up, and, with the exception of year-end, the effective federal funds rate printed between 35 and 38 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	658	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The dispersion of rates and volume of trading in overnight markets were similar to those pre-liftoff, suggesting that market participants did not materially alter their behavior in response to the new level of rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	659	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, trading volumes in overnight markets were little changed following liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201601	660	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Further, as shown in your middle-left panel, the distribution of rates on federal funds transactions shifted higher, as illustrated by the movement from the dark blue to the light blue line.	61.0	999.0
201601	661	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Rates on triparty repo transactions, not shown, exhibited a similar shift though fell modestly lower within the target range than in the pre-liftoff period, in part reflecting the fact that the ON RRP rate increased by only 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	662	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Over year-end, the changes in money market rates were largely consistent with prior quarter-end dates, though the magnitude of the decline in the effective federal funds rate on the 31st was relatively large, printing below the target range at 20 basis points.	61.0	999.0
201601	663	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As you can see in the red line of the middle-left panel, roughly 70 percent of lending in federal funds—nearly all of which was done by the FHLBs—took place below the ON RRP rate, despite nearly all FHLBs having access to the ON RRP.	61.0	999.0
201601	664	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This lending was driven by two main factors:  first, a preference for a relatively early-in-the-day return of investments, which can be achieved in the federal funds market but not in triparty repo, through which our ON RRP operations are conducted; and, second, reduced demand by foreign banks on year-end.	61.0	999.0
201601	665	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This lower demand leaves FHLBs with a smaller set of counterparties to lend to for early return of investments on period-end dates.	61.0	999.0
201601	666	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We saw a comparable amount of trading activity below the ON RRP offering rate on some quarter-ends during the testing period.	61.0	999.0
201601	667	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	FHLBs appeared willing to lend at rates further below the ON RRP rate this year-end though, perhaps reflecting the movement away from the effective lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201601	668	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Overall, however, the year-end decline in the effective federal funds rate was transitory, and the level of the effective rate and the distribution of federal funds activity normalized quickly.	61.0	999.0
201601	669	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, the volume-weighted median federal funds rate was 15 basis points on year-end, 5 basis points lower than the volume-weighted mean, as indicated by the arrows in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	670	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although the volume- weighted mean and median are virtually the same on most days, a greater dispersion on period-ends between the level at which a majority of trading volume occurs and the other trades can cause the median to fall below the mean.	61.0	999.0
201601	671	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This effect was apparent over the year-end and may have been amplified by movement away from the lower bound, suggesting that the effective rate may print further below the target range on future month- or quarter-ends once the calculation methodology is switched to the weighted median.	61.0	999.0
201601	672	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As noted in the Desk’s January 6 public statement, the staff plans to change the underlying data source and the calculation method for the effective federal funds rate to the volume-weighted median and begin publishing the new Overnight Bank Funding Rate on March 2.	61.0	999.0
201601	673	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the bottom-left panel, term money market rates shifted upward in the run-up to the December FOMC meeting, roughly coincident with the increase in market-implied probabilities regarding liftoff depicted in the dashed line, and in a manner consistent with previous tightening episodes.	61.0	999.0
201601	674	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, Treasury bill rates out to three months, shown in light blue, have largely traded below the ON RRP rate, reflecting strong demand for safe, liquid assets by a variety of investor types, most of whom do not have access to RRPs with the Federal Reserve.	61.0	999.0
201601	675	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to our operations, ON RRP take-up on the day after the December meeting was little changed from the previous day, and thereafter the levels of private market rates and calendar effects appeared to influence take-up in a similar fashion as before liftoff, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	676	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Dynamics at the counterparty level were also largely consistent with the pre-liftoff experience, with no counterparty reaching the $30 billion individual cap.	61.0	999.0
201601	677	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	On the year-end date, ON RRP take-up rose to $475 billion, the highest level to date but generally in line with total RRP take-up on previous quarter-ends.	61.0	999.0
201601	678	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Take-up at the three year-end term RRP operations was minimal, as expected, as these were offered at no premium over ON RRPs and the $2 trillion aggregate cap assured participants that their year-end ON RRP bids would be fully allotted.	61.0	999.0
201601	679	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Federal Reserve RRPs with foreign official institutions, shown in the gray area of the same panel, also reached a record level.	61.0	999.0
201601	680	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This was largely expected, being a reflection of year-end dynamics and the ongoing planned increases in foreign RP pool investments by one customer.	61.0	999.0
201601	681	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Of note, this large planned increase is nearly complete.	61.0	999.0
201601	682	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Looking forward, the Committee will need to decide when and under what conditions it will be appropriate to reduce the capacity in the ON RRP facility, which Gretchen will discuss in the next briefing.	61.0	999.0
201601	683	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the Desk’s January policy surveys indicate that an aggregate cap is not expected to be reintroduced for another 11 months, with the median respondent expecting an initial reduction in the cap to a level of $500 billion.	61.0	999.0
201601	684	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, the median expectations regarding ON RRP usage on non-quarter-end days 6 months forward and 12 months forward, the light blue series, are $225 billion and $250 billion, respectively, down from previous surveys but higher than the current post-liftoff, ex-year-end average of $132 billion.	61.0	999.0
201601	685	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Several survey respondents noted expectations that money market fund reforms may exert further downward pressure on repo and bill rates, which could feed through to increased ON RRP usage.	61.0	999.0
201601	686	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In sum, while our observations of the post-liftoff money market environment are limited, they provide us with some preliminary insights about the operating framework, summarized in the middle-left panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	687	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The first dimension to assess is control:  Are we able to move the effective federal funds rate in the target range the Committee has set out?	61.0	999.0
201601	688	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As noted in the assessment memo of post-liftoff interest rate control, although uncertainty remains, the staff assesses the framework to be working well in this regard.	61.0	999.0
201601	689	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	As shown earlier in panels 13 and 16, the framework has been effective in establishing a floor on the effective federal funds rate and supported an appropriate upward move in other money market rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	690	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	It is hard to distinguish the relative weights between IOER and ON RRP in obtaining this control, but we have evidence of activity being driven by both tools.	61.0	999.0
201601	691	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	IOER clearly provides a substantial upward pull on rates, particularly in the federal funds and Eurodollar markets, while the ON RRP certainly plays an important role in supporting rates in the repo market and increases the competition banks face in their trading with nonbank counterparties.	61.0	999.0
201601	692	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	It is also hard to know how much of the ON RRP’s role in this enhanced competition to attribute to the high cap.	61.0	999.0
201601	693	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One indication the high cap may be playing an important role is that unsecured rates appear to have settled about where they were before liftoff, even though one might have expected the widening in the IOER−ON RRP spread and the lower support from the ELB to result in a greater downward shift.	61.0	999.0
201601	694	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Anecdotally, some market participants have suggested that the increase in the cap over its pre-liftoff value bolstered confidence that there would be ample ON RRP headroom over the medium term, which increased their bargaining power.	61.0	999.0
201601	695	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This argument seems reasonable, but we are uncertain about how high a cap is needed to provide this confidence.	61.0	999.0
201601	696	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Second, were we able to achieve this outcome without materially affecting the organization of financial markets?	61.0	999.0
201601	697	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	So far, despite the high cap, there has been little increase in ON RRP take-up, as noted on panel 18, either in aggregate or at the counterparty level, and little change in overall money market volumes.	61.0	999.0
201601	698	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This suggests that we have succeeded, at least so far, in increasing interest rates without unintended effects on the structure of financial intermediation.	61.0	999.0
201601	699	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In part, the success along this dimension can be attributed to our ability to raise interest rates across a range of money markets and, in particular, the absence of pronounced shifts in relative rates across money markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	700	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In the absence of such shifts, investors have little incentive to make fundamental changes to their lending relationships.	61.0	999.0
201601	701	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Third, has liftoff had any unintended consequences to consider, particularly with regard to financial stability?	61.0	999.0
201601	702	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although there is little to say on this at high frequency, it is perhaps notable that amid the recent market volatility and risk aversion, there has been no surge in ON RRP demand.	61.0	999.0
201601	703	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead, market participants anticipate that the operating framework will continue to provide effective control, with nearly one-for-one pass-through of the next tightening into the effective federal funds rate.	61.0	999.0
201601	704	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk survey respondents expect that this control will be facilitated by ample ON RRP headroom and that ON RRP take-up might grow because of changes in the structure of money market rates and spreads prompted by bank and money fund regulatory developments.	61.0	999.0
201601	705	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Although it’s hard to be sure about the magnitude and timing of the effect of those regulatory developments on ON RRP demand, the tenor of those survey expectations also seems reasonable.	61.0	999.0
201601	706	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	With regard to other operational matters, market focus on the SOMA’s Treasury reinvestments has increased recently due to the large volume of Treasury maturities scheduled in 2016, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201601	707	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	These maturities will begin in the upcoming intermeeting period, with roughly $37 billion of expected reinvestments.	61.0	999.0
201601	708	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In line with the current policy, the Desk plans to roll over these maturities proportionally across securities being auctioned on the basis of the Treasury’s announced offering amounts.	61.0	999.0
201601	709	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The bottom-left panel shows the effect of these planned reinvestments on the evolution of the interest rate risk of the SOMA Treasury portfolio, as measured in 10-year equivalent terms, a unit that captures both the par dollar amount and duration of securities holdings.	61.0	999.0
201601	710	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Since the FOMC ceased new purchases of securities, the par size of the Treasury securities portfolio has remained steady at roughly $2.5 trillion.	61.0	999.0
201601	711	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Ten-year equivalents, however, have declined as securities in the portfolio moved closer to maturity and their duration decreased.	61.0	999.0
201601	712	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	For the period ahead, staff projections, shown in the light blue portion, suggest the decline in 10-year equivalents will continue as the portfolio ages further, although the decline is projected to slow should reinvestment of these large Treasury maturities proceed.	61.0	999.0
201601	713	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, in the memo on small-value tests for operational readiness circulated to the Committee, we provided advance notice of all small-value exercises that the Desk currently plans to conduct in 2016.	61.0	999.0
201601	714	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	This was intended to provide a consolidated set of information and reduce the number of memos circulated each meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	715	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	From now on, we will provide updates on the results of any small-value exercises from the previous period and inform you of the upcoming exercises.	61.0	999.0
201601	716	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Our plans for the next intermeeting period, summarized in the final panel, include small-value tests for Treasury outright purchases, euro repos, and dollar liquidity swaps.	61.0	999.0
201601	717	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, the Federal Reserve announced plans last year to conduct quarterly TDF tests to maintain operational readiness.	61.0	999.0
201601	718	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The staff recommends conducting a test operation for one week each quarter over the remainder of 2016—the next one is scheduled for February—with the parameters for each operation mirroring those for the December operation.	61.0	999.0
201601	719	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, and I’d be happy to take any questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	720	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	62.0	65.0
201601	721	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question, Lorie, on slide 19.	62.0	96.0
201601	722	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You focused on the average, but there’s a lot of dispersion in both of those charts, in terms of both timing and level.	62.0	96.0
201601	723	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a problem?	62.0	96.0
201601	724	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Are people sort of clamoring for more guidance on when we are going to reduce the cap or what the level will be?	62.0	96.0
201601	725	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Or is that something that is not a market focus at all?	62.0	96.0
201601	726	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The reason why I am raising this, obviously, is that this is relevant to the discussion that we are going to have in a few minutes.	62.0	96.0
201601	727	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	In most of the discussions we had this round, it wasn’t a topic that came up because they were much more focused on the volatility that we are seeing in financial markets, and they assumed that there was some time for this decision to be made.	62.0	999.0
201601	728	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	So we asked a lot about their framework and how things were trading in money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	729	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But this wasn’t at the top of their minds.	62.0	999.0
201601	730	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So they’re not expecting anything from us.	62.0	96.0
201601	731	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	You can see there are some market participants who expect the timing to be soon, but I don’t think it was a big focus.	62.0	999.0
201601	732	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	The write-ups and commentary that were circulated certainly mentioned it as a possibility of being discussed with the minutes this round.	62.0	999.0
201601	733	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But, again, there were a lot of other issues in financial markets that dominated the discussion.	62.0	999.0
201601	734	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	62.0	96.0
201601	735	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	62.0	96.0
201601	736	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions for Lorie?	62.0	65.0
201601	737	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	738	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	61.0	65.0
201601	739	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, Gretchen Weinbach is going to provide us some comments to guide our discussion of the cap and the timing concerning it.	61.0	65.0
201601	740	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201601	741	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Reducing Aggregate Capacity of the ON RRP Facility” as I highlight key themes in the recent staff memo on this topic.	61.0	999.0
201601	742	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As Simon and Lorie noted, the implementation of December’s increase in the target range for the federal funds rate went smoothly.	61.0	999.0
201601	743	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In view of the Committee’s stated expectation that it will be appropriate to reduce the facility’s capacity “fairly soon” after the start of policy firming, you may want to consider when and how to reintroduce an aggregate cap on the facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	744	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the first exhibit, our experience with policy implementation to date, both before and after liftoff, leaves us with two key takeaways that are relevant for calibrating the capacity of the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	745	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	First, market confidence that the facility will have sufficient headroom over time seems to be important for interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201601	746	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	But there is little direct evidence we can bring to bear on the issue of exactly how large ON RRP headroom needs to be to support interest rate control in the future.	61.0	999.0
201601	747	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Having very elevated capacity of almost $2 trillion at liftoff may have contributed to the success of the initial policy firming by producing high confidence among market participants in the availability of the facility or by signaling that the Federal Reserve would do what it takes to control interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201601	748	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In the period ahead, the amount of sufficient headroom will likely be lower than that afforded by the current capacity setting, but it could also be higher than the amount—roughly $150 billion—that prevailed, on average, during the testing phase of ON RRP operations prior to liftoff.	61.0	999.0
201601	749	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The second key takeaway is that demand for ON RRPs with the Federal Reserve could increase significantly over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	750	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Factors that might contribute to increased demand include changes in financial regulations for money funds and banks as well as a rise in the general level of US interest rates, including the ON RRP offering rate, compared with those on some money market instruments or other assets.	61.0	999.0
201601	751	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Taken together, these factors suggest that there is meaningful uncertainty about the future demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve and thus the usage of the ON RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201601	752	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As summarized in exhibit 2, the memo offered three illustrative options for reducing the aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility, keeping in mind the possibility that demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve could grow over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	753	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	It also discussed the high-level policy tradeoffs inherent in choosing among the options.	61.0	999.0
201601	754	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You could initially set a high cap, as in option 1, perhaps in the range of $800 billion or $1 trillion; a high cap would make it very unlikely that the cap would need to be increased over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	755	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You might prefer this option if you see substantial headroom as being important for rate control but are less concerned about surge risk and the Fed’s potential footprint in financial markets in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201601	756	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Even if you were quite concerned about surge risk and footprint issues over time, you might see setting an initial cap of $800 billion or even $1 trillion as a prudent first step in a process of reducing the cap over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	757	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Alternatively, you might prefer to initially set a lower cap, as in the two other options, because you judge that the level of headroom sufficient for supporting interest rate control is unlikely to be more than several hundred billion dollars and because you want to mitigate surge risk in the near term.	61.0	999.0
201601	758	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If you also judge that it would be important to accommodate trend growth in demand for ON RRPs in order to maintain sufficient, but nonetheless limited, headroom, you might choose, as in option 2, to announce that you will increase the cap over time as necessary to maintain interest rate control.	61.0	999.0
201601	759	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Or, as in option 3, you might instead prefer to set a hard cap and make it clear that it will not be increased over time.	61.0	999.0
201601	760	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	This approach might be preferred if you wished to limit the extent to which a very large ON RRP facility might alter the behavior of money funds and other institutional investors.	61.0	999.0
201601	761	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Of course, there are some caveats to these broad assessments that we noted in the memo.	61.0	999.0
201601	762	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted at the top of exhibit 3, a related issue is the timing of a reduction in capacity—that is, what constitutes “fairly soon”?	61.0	999.0
201601	763	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If you judge rate control to be sufficient and likely to be sustained with lower capacity in the ON RRP facility, you might choose to reduce capacity as early as the March meeting.	61.0	999.0
201601	764	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Doing so might reduce your concerns about exposure to some risks, including possible surges in take-up, and perhaps also footprint-related issues regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential influence in financial markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	765	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Or you might want to wait longer, perhaps because you want to gain more experience with policy normalization or prefer to wait until some upcoming calendar events—such as March quarter-end and the April tax season—have passed.	61.0	999.0
201601	766	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As noted in the middle panel, how to handle calendar effects on the demand for RRPs in the period ahead, such as at March quarter-end, is a somewhat separate issue.	61.0	999.0
201601	767	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	We expect these effects will continue for some time and recommend that the Committee continue to provide sufficient RRPs at quarter-ends to alleviate the associated pressures in money markets.	61.0	999.0
201601	768	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Under any of the three capacity options just discussed, calendar effects could be accommodated.	61.0	999.0
201601	769	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The bottom panel lists some considerations regarding your near-term communications about RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201601	770	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	First, the minutes to this meeting will note that the topic of reducing the capacity of the ON RRP facility was discussed, which could help lay the groundwork for your future decision.	61.0	999.0
201601	771	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	In addition, if you are inclined to accommodate quarter-end pressures by ensuring sufficient RRP capacity, the minutes could also convey that intention.	61.0	999.0
201601	772	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The decision about how to manage RRP capacity around March quarter-end can be deferred until the March FOMC meeting, as it will depend in part on the nature of the cap on ON RRPs in place at that time.	61.0	999.0
201601	773	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Lastly, we note that the drafts of the domestic policy directive for January that are shown in Tealbook B eliminate the reference to term RRPs because the testing resolution cited in the December directive has expired; it provided authority for term RRPs at quarter-ends only in 2015.	61.0	999.0
201601	774	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	If the Committee decides to offer term RRPs in March, the directive could be changed in March to indicate that.	61.0	999.0
201601	775	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The final page in your exhibits lists the questions for discussion that were included in the cover note to the staff memo.	61.0	999.0
201601	776	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Thank you, we’d be happy to take your questions.	61.0	999.0
201601	777	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	778	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Gretchen?	62.0	65.0
201601	779	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	780	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	781	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, I have several questions, and maybe I’ll start with the ones that are more specific.	62.0	97.0
201601	782	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is my understanding correct, Gretchen, that the way we have been doing term RRPs, at least in the testing phase, would be completely consistent with the SEC’s rules for liquidity for government-only money market funds?	62.0	97.0
201601	783	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The reason I ask that is, obviously, to the degree that we’re worried about surge or business model effects, if the term RRP actually is perfectly consistent with the external constraints that the money market funds would face, then our choosing to use term RRP really wouldn’t make that much of a difference in inhibiting any of those effects.	62.0	97.0
201601	784	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	That’s right.	62.0	999.0
201601	785	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You have been using term RRP at quarter-ends, and that doesn’t come with those concerns.	62.0	999.0
201601	786	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Was your point that settlement is two plus zero?	62.0	999.0
201601	787	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	62.0	97.0
201601	788	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Okay.	62.0	999.0
201601	789	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	As far as I know, you’re right.	62.0	999.0
201601	790	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But it’s a quantity operation rather than a fixed-rate one.	62.0	999.0
201601	791	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Right.	62.0	97.0
201601	792	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So suppose we run the operation at 9:30 in the morning, and there’s an event the night before.	62.0	999.0
201601	793	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The surge would come in, and the rate would change at that point because it’s a maximum bid rate, so that’s the maximum you can bid.	62.0	999.0
201601	794	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So for people who really wanted the money, what you’d see is very low rates being put in.	62.0	999.0
201601	795	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I see.	62.0	97.0
201601	796	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So it might have some efficacy as an antisurge mechanism.	62.0	97.0
201601	797	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	So far it hasn’t been intended to do that, right?	62.0	999.0
201601	798	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Well, when we first offered it, we had it at 10 basis points, so we were getting more demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	799	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The way it would do it is, if there was a surge, it’s got a price mechanism, which is natural.	62.0	999.0
201601	800	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Hitting the cap in the overnight RRP is a different type of event because we’re not expecting that to be hit.	62.0	999.0
201601	801	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it has a different type of signal when you hit the cap in the overnight RRP.	62.0	999.0
201601	802	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Then we just say, “Here’s $X billion.	62.0	999.0
201601	803	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	You can take as much as you like, and we’re going to allocate this by just going through the bids, awarding the price that clears.”	62.0	999.0
201601	804	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s helpful.	62.0	97.0
201601	805	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My second question is—and you may not have the answer to this at your fingertips, but—do we know where nongovernment money market fund holdings are concentrated right now?	62.0	97.0
201601	806	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, in which countries, banks, other areas?	62.0	97.0
201601	807	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Because it’s not a trivial consideration in thinking about how concerned we should be over the next couple of quarters.	62.0	97.0
201601	808	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Right.	62.0	999.0
201601	809	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I don’t have a great breakdown of that, but I think a lot of the holders tend to be hedge funds.	62.0	999.0
201601	810	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	In the FR 2420, we can see that there are some very large French banks who are funding through the Eurodollar market.	62.0	999.0
201601	811	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Most of it looks like what’s called “luxury funding,” so it’s the arbitrage-type funding.	62.0	999.0
201601	812	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Japanese banks definitely have some other types of issues.	62.0	999.0
201601	813	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Then it’s Australian, Canadian, Norwegian—I don’t think they’re going to be greatly affected by this because they’re just arbing through into the interest on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	814	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay, that’s helpful.	62.0	97.0
201601	815	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My last questions are about one of the factors that Gretchen noted in the reasons why demand may increase over time, which is regulation.	62.0	97.0
201601	816	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My first question is on the reference in the memo to some regulations affecting foreign agencies and branches being “in train.”	62.0	97.0
201601	817	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	If I understand correctly the kind of regulations you were talking about, I wouldn’t have characterized them as “in train” so much as “under discussion.”	62.0	97.0
201601	818	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	819	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	We subsequently questioned that wording, so I agree with your characterization.	62.0	999.0
201601	820	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	821	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	The example there gave the nature of the kind of thing we had in mind.	62.0	999.0
201601	822	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	There had been conversations of possible things.	62.0	999.0
201601	823	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	824	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And then, am I correct in drawing a distinction between the SEC regulations as they affect the decisions of money market funds, on the one hand, and the possibility, which I think is unlikely to be realized in the short term, of Europe changing its rules on how leverage ratios have to be reported, on the other hand?	62.0	97.0
201601	825	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But let’s stipulate, for a second, that that change might take place, thereby affecting how the branches of foreign banks think about the ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201601	826	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Tell me if I’m missing something here, but it seems to me that those are somewhat different considerations because for the money market funds, their decision is being made with reference, among other things, to what they think we’re going to do.	62.0	97.0
201601	827	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That is, whether to shift from being a prime fund to a government-only fund may be dependent, in no small part, on whether they think there’s going to be another half a trillion or trillion dollars available for them to invest.	62.0	97.0
201601	828	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Whereas, if you are a bank and you’re just facing capital constraints, you’re going to have to adjust from where you are now as opposed to make a decision to start in some new line of business.	62.0	97.0
201601	829	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is that a fair way of looking at it?	62.0	97.0
201601	830	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	I think so.	62.0	999.0
201601	831	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	That’s right, that there would be some element of choice in the money fund conversion to appeal to investors, but taking into account, in some sense, the prevalence of the availability of the overnight RRP as an investment, whereas the other one is an unconditional change.	62.0	999.0
201601	832	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think for the money funds, they also don’t know what the institutional investors are going to do.	62.0	999.0
201601	833	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Suppose prime funds start posting much higher rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	834	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Will that attract some of that institutional money back in that’s scared about the regulatory changes?	62.0	999.0
201601	835	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We don’t know that.	62.0	999.0
201601	836	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s probably one of the biggest uncertainties in the money fund complex right now.	62.0	999.0
201601	837	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	62.0	97.0
201601	838	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That I get.	62.0	97.0
201601	839	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	840	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	62.0	97.0
201601	841	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions for Gretchen?	62.0	65.0
201601	843	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	844	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	845	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round.	62.0	65.0
201601	846	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, sorry.	62.0	65.0
201601	847	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	848	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Could I ask Simon and Lorie—you have this hint on page 2 of your very clear paper, which I’ll read to you, and perhaps you can explain it:  “The very elevated setting of the cap may have also conveyed the sense that the Committee is willing to do what it takes to control interest rates”—this in a context in which you’re explaining the importance of the cap.	62.0	108.0
201601	849	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then it continues:  “Arguably, this effect could be achieved through other means.”	62.0	108.0
201601	850	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What are the other means?	62.0	108.0
201601	851	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	Different people may have had different means in mind.	62.0	999.0
201601	852	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One example could be, as in option 2, communicating timely adjustments to the cap to ensure it’s not binding over some medium-run horizon.	62.0	999.0
201601	853	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I think if there was full certainty that the cap was going to be adjusted such that it wouldn’t bind, that would give market participants a similar type of certainty as the high cap might be demonstrating.	62.0	999.0
201601	854	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	There might be other options that people have in mind, but that’s the way I would have interpreted it.	62.0	999.0
201601	855	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If the only thing that interested you was control of the federal funds rate, there were very many ways we could’ve done that.	62.0	999.0
201601	856	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We could’ve drained $2.4 trillion of reserves out of the system—it would’ve been quite painful, but we could’ve done it.	62.0	999.0
201601	857	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But our viewpoint was, there were a lot of other thoughts going into this, and Gretchen tried to go through some of those issues.	62.0	999.0
201601	858	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a big issue of some of the trading in these markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	859	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s probably some bargaining surplus for people to agree about.	62.0	999.0
201601	860	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	And by showing a determination to get the rate firmly in the range, we probably helped the people who are investing cash at that point rather than the people who wanted to get cash in and would much rather pay less.	62.0	999.0
201601	861	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	It’s mainly a general thought meant to capture the fact that there are other ways—including, as Lori said, “words,” or as Simon said, “tool adjustments”—that could be used to convey that the Federal Reserve is on the job and that there’s not only one way to do that.	62.0	999.0
201601	862	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But some of that is in option 2, isn’t it?	62.0	108.0
201601	863	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	864	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	Your communications about each of these options is an important feature in making these tradeoffs.	62.0	999.0
201601	865	2016-01-27	meeting	WEINBACH	You can communicate about each one in pretty different ways, and that might alter the way you make those assessments.	62.0	999.0
201601	866	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simon, just one last question.	62.0	108.0
201601	867	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was thinking that I might be told, “Well, we could go out and do open market operations from the portfolio.”	62.0	108.0
201601	868	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Is that what you’re saying?	62.0	108.0
201601	869	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	870	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We could’ve built up a book of term TDF, term RRP, in a really classic way.	62.0	999.0
201601	871	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	We’d just multiply the numbers we used to do by about a hundred or a thousand, and then we’d be there.	62.0	999.0
201601	872	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It just might be disruptive in the market for us to come in for $300 billion or $400 billion a day, something like that, and setting term rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	873	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	One of the advantages of using the overnight RRP in this particular case—there are other issues with it—is that it zeroes in to support interest on excess reserves and doesn’t have us breaking a sweat each day to do that.	62.0	999.0
201601	874	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	62.0	108.0
201601	875	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	62.0	108.0
201601	876	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	62.0	65.0
201601	877	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201601	878	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	879	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If not, let’s begin the go-round.	62.0	65.0
201601	880	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	62.0	65.0
201601	881	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	90.0
201601	882	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Liftoff occurred more smoothly than I anticipated.	62.0	90.0
201601	883	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the exception of the end of the year, the utilization of the facility has been rather limited.	62.0	90.0
201601	884	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the federal funds rate and the Eurodollar rate trading well above 25 basis points on most days, it is not surprising that prime money market funds are not making extensive use of the facility on most days.	62.0	90.0
201601	885	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Other short-term instruments of high quality are paying rates higher than the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	886	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It might be useful in future presentations to distinguish between prime and government-only funds, just to highlight that.	62.0	90.0
201601	887	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For the government-only funds, with more limited alternatives, the RRP facility is more frequently attractive, in part because short-term Treasury rates have been below the RRP rate, as was shown in Lorie’s chart 17.	62.0	90.0
201601	888	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	For many of the days since liftoff, the one- and three-month Treasury bills have traded below the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	889	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, this has been a period complicated by liftoff, the end of the year, and significant financial turbulence.	62.0	90.0
201601	890	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the one- and three-month Treasury bill rates start to trade consistently above the RRP rate, there should be much less incentive for government-only funds to make use of the facility.	62.0	90.0
201601	891	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it would be useful to observe how the use of the facility changes as these complicating factors diminish.	62.0	90.0
201601	892	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I’d prefer to not alter the capacity of the facility at this time and wait to make a decision on the capacity of the RRP facility until we have somewhat more experience with the facility under more normal circumstances.	62.0	90.0
201601	893	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The primary use of the facility is likely to occur at quarter- and year-ends.	62.0	90.0
201601	894	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is a manifestation of poorly designed European bank regulations that incent bank window-dressing.	62.0	90.0
201601	895	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Basel III leverage ratio framework, as Governor Tarullo was referencing, requires a minimum capital calculation at quarter-end.	62.0	90.0
201601	896	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The United States requires averages of daily values throughout quarter for the variables that enter into the calculation of capital ratios used to meet capital requirements, whereas most E.U. nations use quarter-end values.	62.0	90.0
201601	897	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The United Kingdom has recently changed regulations to require the use of averages of daily, on-balance-sheet assets, but UK banks don’t need to comply until December 2017.	62.0	90.0
201601	898	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not surprisingly, in the presence of these incentives, the main culprit in window-dressing is the behavior of foreign branches and agencies.	62.0	90.0
201601	899	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one looks at H. weekly data, US bank assets do not decline significantly at quarter-end, unlike foreign branches and agencies that show distinct decreases at quarter-end.	62.0	90.0
201601	900	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one examines money market fund data, roughly 30 percent of prime money market assets are liabilities of European banks.	62.0	90.0
201601	901	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, at the end of a quarter, there’s a discernible decline in money market fund exposures to European banks but not a discernible drop to exposure to non-European banks.	62.0	90.0
201601	902	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This implies two possible responses to get at the root cause of seasonality.	62.0	90.0
201601	903	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, encourage European colleagues to change reporting requirements.	62.0	90.0
201601	904	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Not only does window-dressing misrepresent the true position of banks to investors and regulators, but it is generating problems discernible in the United States.	62.0	90.0
201601	905	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, we should consider ways in which we in the United States can strongly discourage branches and agencies of European banks from dramatically downsizing at quarter-ends.	62.0	90.0
201601	906	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If European regulators want to perpetuate the misrepresentation of their banks’ balance sheets and capital cushions, let them do it in Europe, rather than in the branches and agencies they have located in the United States.	62.0	90.0
201601	907	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	An alternative strategy to reduce the dependence on an RRP facility would be to allow the RRP rate to move up more slowly than the IOER rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	908	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So far, the IOER appears to be the main mechanism for keeping the federal funds rate at roughly a 15 basis point discount.	62.0	90.0
201601	909	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should that be maintained as we raise rates, more slowly raising the RRP rate will discourage the use of the RRP facility as short-term Treasury yields are more likely to be above the RRP rate.	62.0	90.0
201601	910	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	When we decide to make changes to the RRP facility, I would suggest that we start with option 1 and then potentially move to option 2.	62.0	90.0
201601	911	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Whether money market funds use overnight RRP or term RRP would seem to have little implication for the size of the Fed’s footprint, as Governor Tarullo was mentioning.	62.0	90.0
201601	912	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most efficient way to discourage use of the RRP would be to get at the root cause of window-dressing and to make take-up of the RRP facility less attractive in relation to short-term Treasury rates.	62.0	90.0
201601	913	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	90.0
201601	914	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	915	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	916	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	917	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let me begin by, again, commending Simon, Lorie, and their colleagues at the Desk for their expert preparation for, and precise execution of, the December rate rise, which has relieved us of a bunch of headaches we otherwise might have had following Christmas and even at this meeting.	62.0	97.0
201601	918	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m glad we’re talking about the imposition of a limit on the ON RRP so quickly after liftoff.	62.0	97.0
201601	919	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, I want to say that I share some of President Rosengren’s sense that it would be good to get a better idea of how things may normalize over the course of the next few months.	62.0	97.0
201601	920	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My only qualification to what President Rosengren said is that I would worry if, as my question to Gretchen earlier suggested, we saw in the process a migration of prime funds to be government-only money market funds potentially premised on an expectation of the availability of a very large cap, which would facilitate such a move.	62.0	97.0
201601	921	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That really is the dilemma that I see.	62.0	97.0
201601	922	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would like to accommodate possible increases in demand associated with what the memo described as zero-lower-bound effects, but not to accommodate possible increases in demand that are associated with money market funds deciding that this is a good business model for them to move into, as opposed to simply reacting, at the end of quarters when FBOs are not doing as much activity as they normally do.	62.0	97.0
201601	923	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would actually not be averse to waiting a little longer on the basis of the best understanding we have that, as of now, there doesn’t seem to be much of a migration.	62.0	97.0
201601	924	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I have to confess, I worry that when it starts, it could start pretty quickly, and some of that $700 billion in remaining assets referenced in the staff memo could move pretty quickly.	62.0	97.0
201601	925	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	When we do move, like President Rosengren, I’m inclined toward option 1, but I would say option 1 with an explicit suggestion that further periodic reductions in the cap will be forthcoming, because if we don’t have that, we might be sending the signal that it’s going to be a trillion indefinitely, at which point we might be providing incentives, rather than disincentives, for some of the things that I’ve been concerned with.	62.0	97.0
201601	926	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	What I most want to avoid is for us to impose a cap and then raise or remove it later.	62.0	97.0
201601	927	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me that would risk a little bit of a negative for FOMC credibility in managing interest rate increases, but it may also communicate to money managers that we will adjust the ON RRP to accommodate whatever demand does develop.	62.0	97.0
201601	928	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, again, that wouldn’t be the signal that I would want to send.	62.0	97.0
201601	929	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Imposing a cap, with an expectation of lower caps to come, would signal a tapering of the program that should at least limit that incentive.	62.0	97.0
201601	930	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, obviously, a lower initial cap would send a stronger signal, but were the possibility described in the staff memo of the increase in demand associated with the ELB effects to materialize, I suspect a majority, if not everyone, on this Committee would want the ability to set a hard floor for the federal funds rate by using more ON RRP.	62.0	97.0
201601	931	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s why, as I said, I would prefer to be a little bit more conservative in setting the cap in order to avoid the need to reverse later.	62.0	97.0
201601	932	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Let’s see.	62.0	97.0
201601	933	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Eric made a number of these other points, so I won’t repeat them.	62.0	97.0
201601	934	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’ll end there, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	935	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	936	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	62.0	65.0
201601	937	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	938	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I, too, want to thank the staff for the helpful memo.	62.0	999.0
201601	939	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Because we’ve said publicly that the aggregate capacity on the ON RRP facility would be temporarily elevated at liftoff and that we expected to reduce the capacity fairly soon after the first increase in the funds rate, I don’t think it’s too soon to consider how we want to approach this reduction in capacity.	62.0	999.0
201601	940	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I view the main reason for the ON RRP facility is to give us better control of the interest rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	941	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	By all accounts, operationally, liftoff was a success.	62.0	999.0
201601	942	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I agree with my colleagues.	62.0	999.0
201601	943	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The combination of our tools proved up to the task, and I thank the Desk and the Board staff that made that happen.	62.0	999.0
201601	944	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But as the staff memo assessing our control of interest rates says, it’s difficult to know the relative effects that the IOER, ON RRP, large aggregate cap on the ON RRP facility, and moving away from the lower bound had in bringing short-term interest rates up to the target.	62.0	999.0
201601	945	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thus, how high a cap is needed to ensure interest rate control is not known with certainty at this point.	62.0	999.0
201601	946	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But we also have to consider some of the potential costs associated with the facility, especially if the cap on aggregate capacity remains large.	62.0	999.0
201601	947	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As others have said, there’s a possibility during times of financial market stress that firms will turn to the facility instead of their private-sector counterparts and subtract liquidity from the market, thereby exacerbating stress on the markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	948	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Also, a large facility may lead, over time, to operational and structural changes in private-sector money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	949	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That may affect the viability of the funds rate market over time or other parts of the private-sector funding market.	62.0	999.0
201601	950	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think, because the Committee is currently studying what its longer-run operating framework should be, we wouldn’t want a decision we make today or pretty soon to, in effect, take an option off the table for our operating framework.	62.0	999.0
201601	951	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some of these cost-benefit considerations led the Committee to decide, as indicated in the normalization principles, that it would use the ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary to help control the funds rate, and that it would phase it out when the facility is no longer needed.	62.0	999.0
201601	952	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Those principles helped guide my thinking on the questions posed in the staff memo.	62.0	999.0
201601	953	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding an approach to scaling back the size of the facility, in general, I don’t think we should be moving the maximum size of the facility up or down at high frequency.	62.0	999.0
201601	954	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Admittedly, there are still some questions about what size of the facility is needed for interest rate control and what the demand on the ON RRPs will be, and the memo discusses, in a pretty in-depth way, some reasons to think that demand will be rising over time.	62.0	999.0
201601	955	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we’ve had only one rate increase, and we’ve experienced only one quarter-end since liftoff.	62.0	999.0
201601	956	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we should avoid being overly confident in our ability to raise short-term interest rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	957	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given these considerations, I think we should come to some determination of the appropriate size, conditional on our current estimates and expectations, and then use term RRPs to offset changes in demand that will result from calendar effects, like quarter-ends.	62.0	999.0
201601	958	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, consistent with the normalization principles, we’ll determine that the facility is no longer needed, and we’ll have a plan for phasing out the facility, perhaps by reducing its size.	62.0	999.0
201601	959	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think this puts me closest to the memo’s option 3, but I’m perhaps less dogmatic about never being willing to raise the cap, in view of some of the uncertainties about demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	960	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If it turns out that we’ve set the cap too low for adequate control of interest rates, we may indeed have to revisit the size, but I don’t think that should be our default intention.	62.0	999.0
201601	961	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we can use language similar to what’s in our normalization principles—indicate our plan, but also say that we would be prepared to make some adjustments, if necessary, in the interest of interest rate control.	62.0	999.0
201601	962	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given the take-up to date, the $400 billion to $600 billion aggregate cap in option 3 seems reasonable to me.	62.0	999.0
201601	963	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But because we’re very early in the normalization process, and our estimates of trend demand are not certain, I’m not fully confident in that size and would like to see more analysis supporting that.	62.0	999.0
201601	964	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see some merit in waiting until after the March quarter-end to initiate a reduction in the cap to gain more experience during a period of potentially elevated demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	965	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If the staff indicated that implementing another funds rate increase would be a very valuable experience in determining the appropriate size of the facility, then I wouldn’t necessarily be averse to that, but I think the communications reconciling this with our previous indication that we would reduce the size fairly soon after liftoff would have to be carefully done.	62.0	999.0
201601	966	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The minutes of this meeting will reveal that we’ve had this discussion, and, as the staff memo suggests, it could be used to indicate the Committee’s intentions with respect to the cap.	62.0	999.0
201601	967	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	968	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	969	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201601	970	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201601	971	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	A couple of comments before answering the questions.	62.0	81.0
201601	972	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The gist is willingness to begin with the end in mind, the ultimate objective for the ON RRP facility.	62.0	81.0
201601	973	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We actually decided on our objective in September 2014 when we announced that the Committee will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	974	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So how will we know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate?	62.0	81.0
201601	975	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff memo focuses heavily on the short-run tactical question of what to do next with the overall cap, and they didn’t provide an analysis of this question of how to know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	976	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, they haven’t proposed how we’re going to find out, either.	62.0	81.0
201601	977	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We spent a lot of time discussing whether the overnight RRP facility was necessary to control the funds rate before liftoff, but at that time the one consideration that seemed to trump all others was the desire to avoid the embarrassment of raising the target range for the federal funds rate and interest rate on excess reserves and not having money market rates follow right along.	62.0	81.0
201601	978	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We used to refer to this as the “egg on the face” risk.	62.0	81.0
201601	979	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So we did it.	62.0	81.0
201601	980	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We raised our administrative rates, and market rates came right along as we predicted and hoped, and we didn’t get egg on our face.	62.0	81.0
201601	981	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think that we can think about the role of the overnight RRP facility without that dreadful fear trumping everything else and indicating, well, we have to have this program.	62.0	81.0
201601	982	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, the question is, to what extent is the funds rate being held up by the interest rate on excess reserves as opposed to the overnight RRP rate?	62.0	81.0
201601	983	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The staff doesn’t know.	62.0	81.0
201601	984	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	They were agnostic, or maybe they just couldn’t agree on it—they didn’t say one way or another.	62.0	81.0
201601	985	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The natural way to answer this question, it seems to me, is to do some tests.	62.0	81.0
201601	986	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We did some testing before in 2014 by varying the interest rate we paid on the overnight RRP facility.	62.0	81.0
201601	987	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we should do some tests again.	62.0	81.0
201601	988	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The memos don’t make any mention of changing the RP facility rate, and I find that surprising.	62.0	81.0
201601	989	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	There is a lot of discussions of demand and how demand might rise over time.	62.0	81.0
201601	990	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, demand depends on the price, though, and surely it would vary.	62.0	81.0
201601	991	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It seems plausible to me, looking at what’s happened since liftoff, that the funds rate doesn’t depend much on the RP facility rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	992	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That seem really plausible to me.	62.0	81.0
201601	993	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The fact that the funds rate fell below the RP facility rate at the end of the year suggests, as the staff indicated, that overnight RRPs at our facility are not a very good substitute for funds rate transactions due to the time of day the funds get returned.	62.0	81.0
201601	994	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me that we could learn more by moving the rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	995	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, President Rosengren suggested moving the facility rate less than we raised IOER when we raise interest rates.	62.0	81.0
201601	996	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m not sure we have to wait for a rate increase to do that.	62.0	81.0
201601	997	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we could undertake an experiment like that later this year.	62.0	81.0
201601	998	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’re talking about the funds rate, and our objective is to control the funds rate and keep the funds rate within the target.	62.0	81.0
201601	999	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The question is, could lowering the rate on the overnight RRP facility result in a decline in market RP rates?	62.0	81.0
201601	1000	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That’s not obvious, because the market RP rates are above our facility rate now.	62.0	81.0
201601	1001	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It could be that that spread is determined by the market, and that spread will remain constant, and the RP market rates will fall if we reduce the facility rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	1002	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That could be.	62.0	81.0
201601	1003	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But if that does happen, it’s not clear it should bother us, because our announced goal is to control the federal funds rate, and we used to not care about the RP rate.	62.0	81.0
201601	1004	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We used to let the spread be determined by market, and the market set the spread at various rates at various times.	62.0	81.0
201601	1005	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It was never a concern for the Committee.	62.0	81.0
201601	1006	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So I think there’s an open question, and it would be useful to get the staff working on it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1007	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I understand that the long-term framework project is going to be examining these and other questions presumably, but for us I think it’s important to remember that our objective is to phase out this facility if it’s no longer needed to keep the funds rate within the target, and I think we need to find out whether it’s needed or not and reduce the facility appropriately as we learn.	62.0	81.0
201601	1008	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For the questions, I would prefer option 3—a low hard cap—because I think it would more rapidly ramp down market expectations about the ongoing scale of the program in the future.	62.0	81.0
201601	1009	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Quarter-end fluctuations have been a feature of money markets since—I want to say the beginning of time, but let’s say before the crisis.	62.0	81.0
201601	1010	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And, again, they never really bothered the Committee because it never really made a difference for monetary conditions.	62.0	81.0
201601	1011	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we should change the parameters for quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1012	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For communications, I’d suggest that we say that we believe that the interest rate on excess reserves is able to carry most of the weight in controlling the funds rate, and that we’ll do some experimenting as we go forward to confirm this, and we expect to phase out the ON RRP program gradually as evidence accumulates that IOER is sufficient.	62.0	81.0
201601	1013	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As for timing of putting a cap on it, March isn’t too soon for me, but I’ve heard other views around the table, so we’ll have to discuss that in the future.	62.0	81.0
201601	1014	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	81.0
201601	1015	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1016	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	62.0	65.0
201601	1017	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	1018	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I’m in favor of being forward looking, but even then it seems a bit early to me to be making a decision on this matter.	62.0	999.0
201601	1019	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	For me, the overriding concern right now is maintaining control of the federal funds rate.	62.0	999.0
201601	1020	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I believe it’s important that we maintain maximum flexibility until we’re well on our way toward policy normalization.	62.0	999.0
201601	1021	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Given the uncertainties about how demand for overnight RRP will develop and how gradually we will be normalizing policy, it seems to me that now is not the time to signal to markets that we will be reducing aggregate capacity for this facility.	62.0	999.0
201601	1022	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	So I prefer an approach that would have us implement a flexible cap once the fund rate target hits a certain level—say, for the sake of argument, 1 percent—rather than adhering to a date-dependent schedule.	62.0	999.0
201601	1023	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	At that time we should have a much clearer picture about the normal take-up of the facility, and we could be more confident about how gradually capacity can be reduced without unnecessarily imposing worries about headroom on participants.	62.0	999.0
201601	1024	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Now, if there is a strong view about setting an aggregate cap now, I prefer we set it at a very high level that would reassure markets about our continued willingness to support demand for overnight RRP in the early stages of policy normalization.	62.0	999.0
201601	1025	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	As for calendar-based pressures, I’d prefer that we use term RRPs to meet that demand.	62.0	999.0
201601	1026	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	If we proceed at this gradual pace and markets are settled in the use of the overnight facility, I believe our communication about reducing the capacity of the facility will just simply be that much easier.	62.0	999.0
201601	1027	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	999.0
201601	1028	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1029	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62.0	65.0
201601	1030	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	1031	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’d also like to commend the Board staff and New York for such excellent materials on the design and the implementation that prepared us for the programs that were put in place so that things would run so smoothly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1032	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s really been a big help.	62.0	91.0
201601	1033	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The Committee has previously agreed that the ON RRP facility will be temporary.	62.0	91.0
201601	1034	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I continue to support this approach, and this bears repeating in our announcements.	62.0	91.0
201601	1035	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m inclined to favor option 1.	62.0	91.0
201601	1036	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think that reducing the cap from its current $2 trillion level down to the $1 trillion cap envisioned in option 1 would help remind the markets that our eventual goal for this temporary facility is to wind down the program.	62.0	91.0
201601	1037	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	At this point, like, I think, Governor Tarullo, I could support periodic reductions in the overnight RRP capacity from time to time.	62.0	91.0
201601	1038	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not a big fan of option 2, with the flexible adjustments.	62.0	91.0
201601	1039	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we could move to the $1 trillion cap fairly quickly, within a few meetings, but there’s no need to rush toward a lower hard cap, as in option 3, until we’ve had experience with multiple rate hikes and have more information on the real size and effect of this market.	62.0	91.0
201601	1040	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Regarding end-of-quarter pressures, frankly, it’s not clear to me how important this issue really is.	62.0	91.0
201601	1041	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	During my time in the System, the federal funds rate has often traded away from target for a short period around quarter-end, sometimes spectacularly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1042	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These short-term seasonal variations have not had any significant effect on achieving our policy goals, as near as I can tell, or the ultimate reliability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism itself.	62.0	91.0
201601	1043	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m not saying there wasn’t pain for various financial participants, but quarter-end federal funds rate spikes did not leave an imprint on macrodata, as near as I can tell.	62.0	91.0
201601	1044	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Knowledgeable market observers know that these seasonal effects exist, and they adjust their interpretations of rate movements accordingly.	62.0	91.0
201601	1045	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, regarding communications, for now I think that we should reiterate that the facility is temporary, but that the timing and size of future reductions in the cap will depend on how the normalization process is proceeding.	62.0	91.0
201601	1046	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	91.0
201601	1047	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	62.0	65.0
201601	1048	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	97.0
201601	1049	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Something that Presidents Lacker and Evans have now both said makes me want to ask the two of them a question.	62.0	97.0
201601	1050	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Is one or both of you saying that you would be willing to accept some softness in the federal funds rate around the end of quarters, and that’s what you mean by not worrying too much about the window-dressing effects?	62.0	97.0
201601	1051	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Absolutely.	62.0	91.0
201601	1052	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1053	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	62.0	97.0
201601	1054	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It always happened, yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1055	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It always used to happen, and it was inconsequential.	62.0	81.0
201601	1056	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What matters is longer-run rates, and they’re going to average through the quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1057	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, it would matter if it makes it into the two-year rate or the three- month rate or things like that, lending rates.	62.0	91.0
201601	1058	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That also gets back to the issue of reporting requirements that President Rosengren raised that I should have but didn’t comment on.	62.0	97.0
201601	1059	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There is a very important difference from before the crisis.	62.0	999.0
201601	1060	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Our balance sheet on the liabilities side was currency plus a little bit of reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1061	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Now, it’s currency plus about $3 trillion of other liabilities which the system has to deal with.	62.0	999.0
201601	1062	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But we’re talking about what rates do.	62.0	81.0
201601	1063	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s a question of whether you mind rates going 5 basis points, 10 basis points lower.	62.0	81.0
201601	1064	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s the same question whether we have a giant balance sheet or a little one.	62.0	81.0
201601	1065	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t get it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1066	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think it’s quite the same because of how many liabilities there are in the system.	62.0	999.0
201601	1067	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Are you talking about just the frictional cost of moving all that money around?	62.0	96.0
201601	1068	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62.0	999.0
201601	1069	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s a different situation when you see the contraction.	62.0	999.0
201601	1070	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s a much larger contraction that you see in the volumes in the money markets.	62.0	999.0
201601	1071	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The people who are getting hurt by that are the people who are trying to invest.	62.0	999.0
201601	1072	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s not the dealers, which used to be the other ones who were doing the window-dressing, or the large European banks.	62.0	999.0
201601	1073	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re talking about the dollar volume of people who are affected by a lower rate on quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1074	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s one version of it.	62.0	999.0
201601	1075	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And it might be different for a different sort of scale as people invest a different amount.	62.0	81.0
201601	1076	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So it’s the maturity of their borrowing that we’re talking about?	62.0	91.0
201601	1077	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	A couple of days, or are they going to lock in a one-year rate because they show up on the wrong date right before the end of the quarter?	62.0	91.0
201601	1078	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s about $700 billion to $800 billion, which is overnight, plus some other terms.	62.0	999.0
201601	1079	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it’s quite a lot of that.	62.0	999.0
201601	1080	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Some of that has just been produced by the size of our balance sheet.	62.0	999.0
201601	1081	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So if they’re going to get a bad trade near the end of the quarter and they understand that this is the environment they face, then they’re going to start moving their money around earlier.	62.0	91.0
201601	1082	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I’m not explaining myself.	62.0	999.0
201601	1083	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The money has to end up with the Federal Reserve somehow, and there are easier ways for it to end up.	62.0	999.0
201601	1084	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The overnight RRP or term RRPs are ways for it to directly go there rather than go through some complicated structure in the financial system.	62.0	999.0
201601	1085	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	So it’s more of a plumbing issue with that much money moving around.	62.0	999.0
201601	1086	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I scribbled down some notes as I was listening to President Lacker.	62.0	91.0
201601	1087	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I was sympathetic to what he was saying.	62.0	91.0
201601	1088	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For the longest time, the FOMC and the conduct of monetary policy has been about the funds rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	1089	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And the New York Desk does a great job of telling us about how hard it is to implement that when the funds rate trades soft over a long period of time, how other market rates are affected.	62.0	91.0
201601	1090	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But at the end of the day, it’s really the funds rate.	62.0	91.0
201601	1091	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As we move closer to an environment in which we’re away from the effective lower bound, I think that’s going to be the most important thing.	62.0	91.0
201601	1092	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve ended up, because of the lower bound and all of our programs, having to discuss things at this meeting that normally took place at the 9:20 calls and things like that.	62.0	91.0
201601	1093	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	If they’re really as important for the transmission mechanism as maybe Simon is suggesting, I guess we need more information, because I don’t see it that way.	62.0	91.0
201601	1094	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Sorry.	62.0	999.0
201601	1095	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a market-functioning issue and a rate issue, I think.	62.0	999.0
201601	1096	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Lorie.	62.0	65.0
201601	1097	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I just wanted to mention that, in the old framework, we did take actions to try to alleviate the quarter-end effects.	62.0	999.0
201601	1098	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We just couldn’t do it because we were on the maintenance period.	62.0	999.0
201601	1099	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I wanted to make it clear that, in the old framework, we were making a lot of decisions to try to adjust the level of reserves to smooth through the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1100	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	62.0	81.0
201601	1101	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You did, but you often didn’t completely offset it.	62.0	81.0
201601	1102	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	We weren’t able to.	62.0	999.0
201601	1103	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But it was always a goal of the implementation path to try to offset those effects.	62.0	999.0
201601	1104	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Sure.	62.0	91.0
201601	1105	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But Jim Hamilton had a paper in the Journal of Political Economy many years ago about the spectacular, spectacular spikes in the funds rate that occurred, and I don’t know of any evidence that those spikes made their way into macrodata or things like that.	62.0	91.0
201601	1106	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s correct.	62.0	999.0
201601	1107	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They certainly didn’t and might not now, but there  the size of our balance sheet has a market-functioning aspect that could affect quarter-end trend behavior.	62.0	999.0
201601	1108	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Could I ask another question of Simon?	62.0	90.0
201601	1109	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	No one really knew what the end-of-the-year rate was going to be going in.	62.0	90.0
201601	1110	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So many things were new this time.	62.0	90.0
201601	1111	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if we systematically saw the rates drop to, say, zero if we did nothing, it would start leeching into those other rates, predictably at the end of every quarter and every year.	62.0	90.0
201601	1112	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	So we’d start trading soft instead of trading in the middle; presumably the arbitrage would get us to start being much closer to the floor before the end of the quarter and end of the year.	62.0	90.0
201601	1113	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s possible.	62.0	999.0
201601	1114	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I think the issue for many people is:   They have a lot of cash to invest, and they have a relationship that is not as robust on the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1115	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Where are they going to put that cash?	62.0	999.0
201601	1116	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They want to invest on the quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1117	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They will take action to make sure they can invest on the quarter-end if they think there’s less of the Federal Reserve balance sheet available, and that would lead to softness in rates.	62.0	999.0
201601	1118	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It also leads to inefficient behavior because a lot of the cash they have to invest is coming from the size of our balance sheet.	62.0	999.0
201601	1119	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	To go back to your question, Governor Tarullo, this isn’t about market functioning, it’s a distributional issue—it’s who pays for the privilege of investing cash at quarter-end.	62.0	81.0
201601	1120	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’ve got a lot of cash around.	62.0	81.0
201601	1121	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You can make a lot every other day of the quarter, but at quarter-end, you don’t have relationships.	62.0	81.0
201601	1122	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’ve set up relationships with foreign banks that are doing the arbitrage to IOER.	62.0	81.0
201601	1123	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Part of what you pay for doing that is that on quarter-end, you don’t have relationships elsewhere to invest the cash.	62.0	81.0
201601	1124	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	To some extent, for us to defray that cost, for us to reduce the cost of having nowhere to invest your cash on quarter-end, we’re just making it easier for the foreign banks to do this arbitrage.	62.0	81.0
201601	1125	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’re just shifting costs around these players.	62.0	81.0
201601	1126	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s less market functioning than just a distributional question.	62.0	81.0
201601	1127	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	One last note is, what we’re seeing in unsecured markets is that it’s a day at month-end and quarter-end.	62.0	999.0
201601	1128	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	But for repo markets, if you look at the data, it takes multiple days for the balance sheets of some of those dealers to come down and then multiple days to build back up.	62.0	999.0
201601	1129	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	What we saw in September when we did the test in which we put the cap in and didn’t have the term is that the softness was not just on one day, it was several days in advance.	62.0	999.0
201601	1130	2016-01-27	meeting	LOGAN	I suspect that if we didn’t provide it, we’d be talking about more than one day per month—we’d be talking about a couple of days, both before and after.	62.0	999.0
201601	1131	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	But you would distribute the softness over time, so the financial system would find a way of dealing with all of those reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1132	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If they thought that it was going to be harder to invest on the quarter-end using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in a direct way, they would find a way to distribute that over the quarter .	62.0	999.0
201601	1133	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	1134	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Can you tell us, what is the cost to the Federal Reserve of supplying the Federal Reserve paper that they want?	62.0	108.0
201601	1135	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The overnight RRP offer rate right now is 25 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1136	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	When we issue term, it’s probably going to be 3 basis points above.	62.0	999.0
201601	1137	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	If you look at it the other way, if you want to save a little bit of money at quarter-end, which I don’t think is of interest here, using the overnight RRP is a little bit cheaper because you don’t get it as a reserve balance as it finds its way back into the banking system to be a reserve balance.	62.0	999.0
201601	1138	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Sorry, who’s “you”?	62.0	108.0
201601	1139	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Who saves the money?	62.0	108.0
201601	1140	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	62.0	65.0
201601	1141	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	The US taxpayer would, because we’d remit more to the Treasury.	62.0	999.0
201601	1142	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But were you asking about the operational costs, like how many people they have doing it?	62.0	81.0
201601	1143	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	No, not at all.	62.0	108.0
201601	1144	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was asking about the interest costs.	62.0	108.0
201601	1145	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It saves us money, because it saves reserves—IOER.	62.0	81.0
201601	1146	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Because what will happen is, if we don’t offer another type of liability to the financial system, that money has to get back to our balance sheet, and it will find a way of getting there.	62.0	999.0
201601	1147	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	At that point, it receives interest on excess reserves.	62.0	999.0
201601	1148	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	1149	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62.0	65.0
201601	1150	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	94.0
201601	1151	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I support option 1, which is the high-cap option, but I want to align myself with comments by President Harker and President Evans, who have similar themes.	62.0	94.0
201601	1152	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My preference is actually to have no cap at this point and to watch and wait during the next six months or so.	62.0	94.0
201601	1153	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’d consider what President Harker suggested, that you should have some idea about where the funds rate is before you start putting a cap on this facility.	62.0	94.0
201601	1154	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we want maximum emphasis on rate control during this phase that we’re in right now.	62.0	94.0
201601	1155	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m also encouraged that actual take-up seems to be quite low at this time, and so for this reason I don’t think we really need a cap right now.	62.0	94.0
201601	1156	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think it’s a little premature to put that on.	62.0	94.0
201601	1157	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I agree, if the program grows to a substantially larger size, the Committee could at that point review the reasons for the expansion of the program.	62.0	94.0
201601	1158	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	One way we could proceed—this is just something to consider here—is to simply agree to a size of the program that would trigger further review, and possibly you could announce to the public that the Committee would review it at some point if the program got larger, but that wouldn’t be an official cap.	62.0	94.0
201601	1159	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You’d just say that the Committee is going to look at this again if this thing starts to grow, because one thing that seems like it might happen in the future is that you’d remain with relatively small take-up, and you wouldn’t need a cap, and you wouldn’t get much growth in the program.	62.0	94.0
201601	1160	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I understand it may not go that way, but then we’d have a way to review that possibility.	62.0	94.0
201601	1161	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I’d actually be willing to go with the possibility of no cap indefinitely, depending on how the demand develops as we go forward.	62.0	94.0
201601	1162	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	94.0
201601	1163	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1164	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62.0	65.0
201601	1165	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	104.0
201601	1166	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Let me say, I think it’s great to have this discussion now when there’s no near-term problem to solve and no really urgent need to act.	62.0	104.0
201601	1167	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Broadly speaking, the RRP is doing its job well with IOER.	62.0	104.0
201601	1168	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would say that it’s clear that reserves are going to remain superabundant for a number of years now, and that’s probably going to mean that we’re going to need the RRP, and we’ll be facing these issues for a number of years.	62.0	104.0
201601	1169	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The place to which I would like to see this go in the medium term, two to three years, is more at the level of option 2, which is $300 million to $500 million.	62.0	104.0
201601	1170	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would be comfortable—	62.0	104.0
201601	1171	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Billion.	62.0	97.0
201601	1172	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Billion—thank you.	62.0	104.0
201601	1173	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would be comfortable starting with option 1 and saying explicitly that we expect to reduce this over time, as appropriate.	62.0	104.0
201601	1174	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The problem with option 1, just putting the number out there and not saying that you expect to reduce it over time, is that you send a signal that you welcome, and perhaps even encourage, more funds.	62.0	104.0
201601	1175	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But that would be perfectly acceptable in my view.	62.0	104.0
201601	1176	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	In terms of when to start, I think it is tied up with the path of policy.	62.0	104.0
201601	1177	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	If the Committee is going to be in tightening mode as the year goes on, then it seems to me it would be useful to have one or two more rate increases in place to see how the federal funds rate behaves in space as it moves away from the lower bound.	62.0	104.0
201601	1178	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	If that’s not going to be the case, then it might well be appropriate and a useful signal to send as soon as the March meeting that you’re reducing the cap from $2 billion–plus to effectively $1 billion.	62.0	104.0
201601	1179	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	That might be a useful place to go.	62.0	104.0
201601	1180	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Trillion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1181	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You’ve got to get your orders of magnitude right.	62.0	97.0
201601	1182	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62.0	97.0
201601	1183	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Sorry.	62.0	104.0
201601	1184	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Missed some zeros.	62.0	104.0
201601	1185	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The memo asks about quarter-ends.	62.0	104.0
201601	1186	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As far as quarter-ends go, I like using term RRP at quarter-ends.	62.0	104.0
201601	1187	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It seems to work.	62.0	104.0
201601	1188	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I’d say, keep doing what works.	62.0	104.0
201601	1189	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Those are my comments.	62.0	104.0
201601	1190	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	104.0
201601	1191	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1192	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	62.0	65.0
201601	1193	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	110.0
201601	1194	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I also would wait.	62.0	110.0
201601	1195	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Just in view of the tone of the memo and the presentation, the New York staff don’t appear to have conviction yet on judgments about these market effects.	62.0	110.0
201601	1196	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So my advice to them would be, do what you need to do to get conviction on these judgments, and that implies that it would be helpful if we had one or two more tightenings.	62.0	110.0
201601	1197	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’ll see when and how that happens.	62.0	110.0
201601	1198	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But on the idea of doing experiments and other activities so that you can have more conviction about how much headroom you might need, it’s clear to me that, in terms of priorities, maintaining confidence that we can control the rate is paramount.	62.0	110.0
201601	1199	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think we need to make clear that we’re not going to accommodate all private-sector choices.	62.0	110.0
201601	1200	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re not here to do that.	62.0	110.0
201601	1201	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re here to control the rate, and accommodating all private-sector choices is not why we’re doing this.	62.0	110.0
201601	1202	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If I had to pick a choice to gravitate to, it would probably be the high end of the staff’s low flexible cap—in the middle, $500 billion or more.	62.0	110.0
201601	1203	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I don’t think I know enough to know, and it sounds like the staff don’t yet know quite enough to know.	62.0	110.0
201601	1204	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But as soon as you do have more conviction and at the point we make this decision, I’ll be asking the staff for their recommendation on all these questions, and I probably won’t give a judgment until I get their recommendation.	62.0	110.0
201601	1205	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That will probably be the approach I’ll take.	62.0	110.0
201601	1206	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	62.0	110.0
201601	1207	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1208	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	62.0	65.0
201601	1209	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	103.0
201601	1210	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I, too, appreciate the staff’s work to characterize the challenging and important tradeoffs we face with the ON RRP facility in the future.	62.0	103.0
201601	1211	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Having viewed this facility as essential to controllability of interest rates, especially at liftoff, my preference among the options discussed at this point would be to reduce the capacity of the facility as described in option 2, the low flexible cap, and I would lean toward the higher end of that range.	62.0	103.0
201601	1212	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	This option would maintain adequate headroom for markets to have confidence about the availability of the facility while credibly communicating our original intention that the capacity be elevated only temporarily at liftoff to support policy implementation, and that it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity fairly soon after liftoff.	62.0	103.0
201601	1213	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding quarter-end pressures, it is not clear to me that we should react with this facility.	62.0	103.0
201601	1214	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Missing our target funds rate on one or two days because of these pressures would not seem to have material policy implications, notwithstanding the counsel that Simon provided during our previous discussion.	62.0	103.0
201601	1215	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	But to the degree that such pressures proved persistent, I would not object to a temporary increase in the cap as proposed under the low flexible cap option or offering term RRPs.	62.0	103.0
201601	1216	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	For communication, I would explain the change in the capacity of the facility as the result of a successful liftoff of the target funds rate from its effective lower bound.	62.0	103.0
201601	1217	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And in the future, the capacity should be no greater than what is required to achieve an effective floor under money market rates.	62.0	103.0
201601	1218	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I see such an approach as consistent with our stated intention of, in the longer run, holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.	62.0	103.0
201601	1219	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Given our experience with successful liftoff, I believe it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility as early as our March meeting.	62.0	103.0
201601	1220	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would signal that intention in the minutes of this meeting.	62.0	103.0
201601	1221	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	62.0	103.0
201601	1222	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1223	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	62.0	65.0
201601	1224	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	88.0
201601	1225	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In answer to the question of how to approach reducing aggregate capacity of the overnight reverse repo facility, I prefer to think a little beyond a single choice from the menu proposed.	62.0	88.0
201601	1226	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have the working assumption that the goal is to largely phase out the facility over time, in keeping with our 2014 statement on normalization principles and plans.	62.0	88.0
201601	1227	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	At liftoff, I was in favor of prioritizing monetary control and fully supported the lifting of the cap.	62.0	88.0
201601	1228	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	However, I do have some concern that a decision to continue running a very large facility for a prolonged period entails nontrivial financial stability risk.	62.0	88.0
201601	1229	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In addition, such a policy might incent or enable changes in money markets that might make it much more difficult to reduce or phase out the facility in the future.	62.0	88.0
201601	1230	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With these thoughts in mind, I favor thinking in terms of a sequence of steps or a strategy, if you will, for gradually reducing the footprint of the facility in a manner that places strong emphasis on monetary control.	62.0	88.0
201601	1231	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As an illustration and illustration only, I envision a process that could go something like this.	62.0	88.0
201601	1232	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Begin by implementing a high cap accompanied by communications to establish the expectation of a ratcheting down to an ultimate phaseout.	62.0	88.0
201601	1233	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it would make sense to maintain that cap through at least the next rate increase as a conservative approach to managing monetary control risk.	62.0	88.0
201601	1234	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Assuming things go well and the funds rate trades in the desired range, at the subsequent meeting we can move to a lower flexible cap.	62.0	88.0
201601	1235	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It makes some sense to me to test the headroom effects following a meeting that does not involve the confounding effects of a rate increase.	62.0	88.0
201601	1236	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If monetary control seems well established with a lower flexible cap, I see making a subsequent further step that’s not offered as an option in the memo—specifically, at the next rate increase, I’d prefer to leave the overnight reverse repo rate unchanged, thereby widening the spread between the IOER and reverse repo rates.	62.0	88.0
201601	1237	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this step will be necessary to truly test how necessary the overnight reverse repo facility is to maintaining control over the funds rate.	62.0	88.0
201601	1238	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Once we’ve tested the waters with a wider spread, we can evaluate next steps in terms of fixing the cap or implementing further increases in the spread and whether to phase out the program entirely or retain some residual facility.	62.0	88.0
201601	1239	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The latter—some small but continuing overnight reverse repo operations—might be desirable as we work through the long-run framework questions and consider some of the regulatory and market changes noted in the staff memo.	62.0	88.0
201601	1240	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I offer these specifics as an example of what a longer-view strategy might look like.	62.0	88.0
201601	1241	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I would certainly be open to other paths and options.	62.0	88.0
201601	1242	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The important point is that we not think of the next move with the facility as a one-off decision.	62.0	88.0
201601	1243	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We should have in mind what we intend to do over several steps down the road and communicate our plans to the market.	62.0	88.0
201601	1244	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	88.0
201601	1245	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1246	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	62.0	65.0
201601	1247	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	102.0
201601	1248	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The normalization strategy and principles that we laid out some time ago have worked according to plan, and I don’t see any signs in recent market behavior that would suggest any change in our approach.	62.0	102.0
201601	1249	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I emphasize here that by “approach,”	62.0	102.0
201601	1250	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m referring to both our September 2014 and our March 2015 communications that the ON RRP facility will be temporarily elevated at liftoff, but that the capacity will be reduced fairly soon after policy firming and that it’s a temporary program.	62.0	102.0
201601	1251	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The success in maintaining monetary control is a testament to the thorough testing of our normalization tools—a good example of practice makes perfect.	62.0	102.0
201601	1252	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In light of this success, I would continue along the path we’ve laid out.	62.0	102.0
201601	1253	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our next step should be to start lowering the cap on the ON RRP facility to reduce financial stability risks associated with possible surges in demand.	62.0	102.0
201601	1254	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think option 1 provides for a prudent reduction that still should provide ample headroom to maintain monetary control.	62.0	102.0
201601	1255	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When the appropriate time comes, I would be comfortable with reducing the cap to $800 billion or $1 trillion.	62.0	102.0
201601	1256	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we can take this step fairly soon—in the language of our earlier communications, in the next few meetings.	62.0	102.0
201601	1257	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, waiting until March quarter-end might be useful.	62.0	102.0
201601	1258	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t think we should necessarily wait until the next rate increase.	62.0	102.0
201601	1259	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree completely with Governors Tarullo and Powell that in making that step, we want to communicate that this is only a first step and not the end of a process, and that further decreases in the cap will be forthcoming.	62.0	102.0
201601	1260	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s an important part of the communication regarding option 1.	62.0	102.0
201601	1261	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over time, we can lower the cap for the ON RRP facility further.	62.0	102.0
201601	1262	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, there’s no rush to take that step.	62.0	102.0
201601	1263	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should collect more information along the way to make sure that we’re on the right track.	62.0	102.0
201601	1264	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Assuming all goes well, additional reductions would be warranted after we’ve observed market behavior following further rate hikes.	62.0	102.0
201601	1265	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, as we lower the cap further, term RRPs could or should provide a good supplementary tool to deal with quarter-end spikes in demand, if needed.	62.0	102.0
201601	1266	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, we’ve had a good discussion about whether that’s necessary or really important.	62.0	102.0
201601	1267	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that the term RRP tool has shown to be a pretty elegant solution to this issue.	62.0	102.0
201601	1268	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Once we get to the point at which the cap is much smaller, using the term RRP seems to be a useful way to deal with quarter-end issues and spikes in demand.	62.0	102.0
201601	1269	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When we decide to make these adjustments, communicating clearly with the public that these are natural steps in the normalization strategy that we’ve already explained is going to be very important.	62.0	102.0
201601	1270	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We want to convey that our approach has been successful, and that’s why we’re continuing to follow that in a well-designed strategy.	62.0	102.0
201601	1271	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, communication we give following these changes should, as always, stress their technical nature and emphasize that monetary policy is focused on the setting of the federal funds rate and that all of these other things that are happening in the background are being done in support of monetary control and our other objectives.	62.0	102.0
201601	1272	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	62.0	102.0
201601	1273	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1274	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	62.0	65.0
201601	1275	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	111.0
201601	1276	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think the memos and the staff briefing on this discussion show that we have a lot more to learn about this program, and so I’m in the camp of many of you that there’s no rush.	62.0	111.0
201601	1277	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let’s learn more.	62.0	111.0
201601	1278	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let’s get more experience before we make any changes.	62.0	111.0
201601	1279	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, it’s fundamental that we have a better view of the long-run operating framework.	62.0	111.0
201601	1280	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That’s a pretty fundamental decision for the Committee.	62.0	111.0
201601	1281	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And, for me, having more information about how this tool works and having a better view of the long-run operating framework will be important in informing the ultimate judgment of what this tool looks like.	62.0	111.0
201601	1282	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If pushed today, I’d say I’m in favor of option 1 or option 2.	62.0	111.0
201601	1283	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But waiting is probably my stronger preference.	62.0	111.0
201601	1284	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	62.0	111.0
201601	1285	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1286	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	62.0	65.0
201601	1287	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	107.0
201601	1288	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I want to extend my compliments to the staff on their execution of liftoff, which was really outstanding.	62.0	107.0
201601	1289	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The control over rates has been as strong as any of us could have wished.	62.0	107.0
201601	1290	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The strength of the monetary control so far can be ascribed in no small part to the floor that’s been provided by the ample capacity of the ON RRP.	62.0	107.0
201601	1291	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And for this reason, I think it’s still premature to implement changes to the cap.	62.0	107.0
201601	1292	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the activity of the ON RRP has been quite close to pre-liftoff norms so far, it’s only six weeks since liftoff, and there’s still substantial uncertainty about how our rate control might evolve as normalization proceeds.	62.0	107.0
201601	1293	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m particularly attentive to how both the activity of the ON RRP and the support for the funds rate provided by the ON RRP facility change as we move farther away from the effective lower bound.	62.0	107.0
201601	1294	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I prefer deferring changes to the ON RRP cap until normalization is well under way.	62.0	107.0
201601	1295	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, this would seem to be pretty consonant with market expectations.	62.0	107.0
201601	1296	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Of the three options presented in the staff memo, I prefer setting a high cap as a first step, as outlined in option 1.	62.0	107.0
201601	1297	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	At the stage of normalization at which we find ourselves, as you can probably infer, my highest priority remains monetary control.	62.0	107.0
201601	1298	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I think option 1 has the best monetary control properties—certainly better than option 3, which would sacrifice control for a smaller footprint.	62.0	107.0
201601	1299	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Compared with option 2, option 1 is both easier to explain and easier to implement, which I view as strong virtues in policymaking.	62.0	107.0
201601	1300	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s not obvious that the cap in option 2 could be adjusted in as timely and accurate a manner as would be necessary to maintain the level of monetary control that I think is important.	62.0	107.0
201601	1301	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I do think it’s helpful to remind market participants that the heightened capacity of the ON RRP is temporary in order to guard against a permanent change in the structure of money markets, which I would view as very undesirable.	62.0	107.0
201601	1302	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A reflection of this discussion in the minutes should accomplish this goal.	62.0	107.0
201601	1303	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	107.0
201601	1304	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	62.0	65.0
201601	1305	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	62.0	65.0
201601	1306	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	108.0
201601	1307	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Like everyone else, I’d like to congratulate the staff, both the New York Federal Reserve staff and the Board staff, on the work done and the quality of the paper we received, which is both thorough and interesting.	62.0	108.0
201601	1308	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, of course, I’d also like to congratulate them on the success of the operation of our new method of monetary control, which was faced with a pretty strong stress test in the first six weeks of its operation—at least the past three weeks of its operation—as the market seemed to be less than stable, and it didn’t seem to spread over to the use of the RRP facility.	62.0	108.0
201601	1309	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	One of the benefits of going very near the end is that everything that should be said has been said.	62.0	108.0
201601	1310	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Not everyone has said it.	62.0	97.0
201601	1311	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	62.0	97.0
201601	1312	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It just remains to decide which of the excellent interventions to reference, and I reference President Evans’s approach, which is similar to what a lot of other people suggested.	62.0	108.0
201601	1313	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think, as many have said, that after six weeks, it’s a good time to start changing things.	62.0	108.0
201601	1314	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	A lot can happen, and we want to make sure that this facility and the way we’re operating it is really capable of doing what it’s done so far, and it’s only further experience that will be able to tell us that.	62.0	108.0
201601	1315	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I also have some sympathy for the view that it could be useful to retain a small facility at the end, but that’s an issue that we can discuss nearer the time.	62.0	108.0
201601	1316	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What I’d like to see is what I think President Evans said, which is a move—most people say in the second quarter, I think it could be the end of the second quarter, possibly the third quarter—to option 1.	62.0	108.0
201601	1317	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then, as time goes by, and as we get more and more confident in our use of it, begin reducing the cap in a fairly steady way over the course of time and then phase it out, with the question of whether there should be some capacity left to carry out these operations.	62.0	108.0
201601	1318	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As we move to the hard cap, I do think that we’ll have to either accept the use of term RRP or allow ourselves not to hit the target federal funds rate on a couple of days in each quarter and possibly more at the end of the year.	62.0	108.0
201601	1319	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But this is clearly something that’s working, and it seems to me there’s probably an interesting question as to what comes next, adjusting the RRP or stopping repurchases of maturing assets in the portfolio.	62.0	108.0
201601	1320	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We haven’t talked about those two things together, and each of them could be regarded as capable of creating some noise in the system that we ought to find a way of coordinating.	62.0	108.0
201601	1321	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	108.0
201601	1322	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	62.0	65.0
201601	1323	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, Vice Chairman.	62.0	65.0
201601	1324	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201601	1325	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think the consensus around the table is that the overnight reverse repo facility is working well, and that we’re pleased by how solid the flow has been, even as the take-up has been quite modest.	62.0	96.0
201601	1326	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, that seems like the best of both worlds.	62.0	96.0
201601	1327	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We have monetary policy control, and we have a modest footprint.	62.0	96.0
201601	1328	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That suggests to me that there’s little urgency to make changes at this time.	62.0	96.0
201601	1329	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Why not learn more and proceed relatively slowly?	62.0	96.0
201601	1330	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t seem like there’s any rush in terms of market expectations, either.	62.0	96.0
201601	1331	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We saw in the survey results that there’s a wide range of expectations among market participants, and I deliberately asked Lorie a question about whether they were waiting with a lot of interest to see how we were going to answer this question, and the answer seems to be, “Not really.”	62.0	96.0
201601	1332	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	This is not something that we need to resolve quickly because there’s a big question in the marketplace.	62.0	96.0
201601	1333	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I think there’s some uncertainty about how the facility usage is going to evolve over time, and I’m sympathetic with the staff memo that suggests that, most likely, it’s going to rise rather than fall, everything else being equal, with money market fund reform and possible future regulatory changes the major factors.	62.0	96.0
201601	1334	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	For that reason, because we don’t know really how high demand is going to get over time, I favor option 1, a relatively high cap.	62.0	96.0
201601	1335	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think a high cap has tremendous benefits, and this goes back to something that Governor Brainard said.	62.0	96.0
201601	1336	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s much less drama, and there are fewer communications problems, if you have a high cap.	62.0	96.0
201601	1337	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t need to have term RRP at the end of quarter-ends to accommodate temporary surges in demand at quarter-end.	62.0	96.0
201601	1338	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to explain why you’re paying higher interest rates on term RRP, rather than using the lower rates that are on the overnight RRP.	62.0	96.0
201601	1339	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	You don’t have to adjust the cap up and down as demand fluctuates.	62.0	96.0
201601	1340	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that having a high cap, at least for a while, seems like a very simple and straightforward way to proceed.	62.0	96.0
201601	1341	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I do recognize that having a relatively high cap could lead to issues in terms of footprint and financial stability, and so the question is, how big are those risks?	62.0	96.0
201601	1342	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the footprint issue, I think we’ve already had some success in addressing this.	62.0	96.0
201601	1343	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as we make it clear in the minutes that this is not a facility that’s going to be around indefinitely, that can continue to damp expectations about the ability to develop your business plans to adjust to the idea of an overnight RRP facility being around for some time.	62.0	96.0
201601	1344	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the current time, I don’t think the footprint issue is really very significant.	62.0	96.0
201601	1345	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That could, obviously, change.	62.0	96.0
201601	1346	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If it were to change in the future, then I think we would have to think more seriously about doing something in terms of the cap or in terms of changing the spread between the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate in the future, but there’s no need to address this right now.	62.0	96.0
201601	1347	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the financial stability risk, as I understand the concern, it’s that if we had a high-capacity overnight RRP facility, there could be a big flight out of short-term private debt instruments, and that could put upward pressure on the interest rates for those instruments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1348	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I personally don’t see this as a huge risk.	62.0	96.0
201601	1349	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While we could see some upward pressure on other money market rates, this should be at least partly offset by the fact that if there is an overnight RRP facility that has lots of headroom, you also have a place to flee to.	62.0	96.0
201601	1350	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that there is a place to flee to means that you don’t have as much incentive to run at the first sign of trouble, because it’s known that there’s a place to go in the future should things get worse.	62.0	96.0
201601	1351	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I think that if there was a rise in private-sector short-term rates, and if it was significant and had sufficient persistence to cause us to be worried about the implications for the economic outlook, there are other things we can do about it.	62.0	96.0
201601	1352	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We could adjust monetary policy.	62.0	96.0
201601	1353	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I suspect that in a circumstance in which there really was a large amount of funds flooding into the overnight RRP, the rise in usage of the overnight RRP would not be the first concern that we would have.	62.0	96.0
201601	1354	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There would be something else going on that we would be really focusing our attention on.	62.0	96.0
201601	1355	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of communication, I think we should continue to emphasize that we want the facility to have sufficient headroom so that the cap won’t bind, because monetary policy control is our primary focus here.	62.0	96.0
201601	1356	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If participants in the market understand that the cap is not likely to bind, that improves their bargaining power with banks.	62.0	96.0
201601	1357	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That makes banks more aggressive in bidding for funds, and that actually makes the IOER more effective in pulling up short-term rates.	62.0	96.0
201601	1358	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So there’s a real benefit of having cap capacity in the overnight RRP, even if the overnight RRP facility isn’t used that much.	62.0	96.0
201601	1359	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In addition, assuring people that there’s going to be room in the overnight RRP facility underscores our commitment to monetary policy control, and I think that’s really important, as many people have said today.	62.0	96.0
201601	1360	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to timing, I don’t see any reason to rush.	62.0	96.0
201601	1361	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure it should be the second quarter or the third quarter.	62.0	96.0
201601	1362	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it certainly shouldn’t be March.	62.0	96.0
201601	1363	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s get more experience with the facility, and then we can figure out how to proceed.	62.0	96.0
201601	1364	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to talk a little bit about what President Lacker brought up, because I thought he raised an interesting set of issues.	62.0	96.0
201601	1365	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And that is, we still don’t know the answer to the question, what’s doing most of the work in pulling up short-term interest rates?	62.0	96.0
201601	1366	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Is it the IOER, or is it the overnight RRP facility?	62.0	96.0
201601	1367	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s an interesting issue, and so there are a couple of questions here I guess I would pose.	62.0	96.0
201601	1368	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	One question is, do we need to find out the answer to that question?	62.0	96.0
201601	1369	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if we’re really comfortable with the overnight RRP facility, then presumably we don’t really need to try to run experiments to answer the question about whether the overnight RRP facility is doing most of the lifting, or the IOER is doing most of the lifting.	62.0	96.0
201601	1370	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if we’re uncomfortable with the notion that we really need the overnight RRP facility to raise short-term rates, then it makes more sense to run the experiments, because I think there’s a cost to running the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1371	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the experiments are free.	62.0	96.0
201601	1372	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The point I’m trying to make here is that if the outcome of the experiments is not going to change your choices in terms of how you set the facilities, then it probably doesn’t make sense to run the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1373	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you think the answer to the experiments could change how you use the facilities, then it probably makes sense to run the experiments.	62.0	96.0
201601	1374	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What I’d like to do is see the staff come up with a proposal on how important it is to find out.	62.0	96.0
201601	1375	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What are the pros and cons of running the experiments?	62.0	96.0
201601	1376	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What are the costs of running the experiments?	62.0	96.0
201601	1377	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And if one were going to run the experiments, what’s the best experiment one could run at the lowest cost?	62.0	96.0
201601	1378	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Then we could actually have a full discussion on this topic, because I think it’s a very relevant issue.	62.0	96.0
201601	1379	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62.0	96.0
201601	1380	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62.0	65.0
201601	1381	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes.	62.0	81.0
201601	1382	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you for responding, Vice Chairman Dudley.	62.0	81.0
201601	1383	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we decided that we would phase it out if it’s no longer needed.	62.0	81.0
201601	1384	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me as inconsistent with the spirit of that decision to not take any steps to find out if it’s needed.	62.0	81.0
201601	1385	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And it strikes me that it wouldn’t be that hard to do.	62.0	81.0
201601	1386	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	If we raised rates, if we raised the IOER rate a quarter point, like Eric said, raised the ON RRP rate 20 basis points, a 5 basis point increase in the spread, and the RRP rates stayed where they are in relation to IOER, we’d be able to say, “Look, we’re done,” and volume went down—that could easily happen.	62.0	81.0
201601	1387	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not arguing against running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1388	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I misunderstood you.	62.0	81.0
201601	1389	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But we first have to answer the question, what is the experiment generating in terms of information?	62.0	96.0
201601	1390	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And will that information change your behavior in terms of how you use it?	62.0	96.0
201601	1391	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you decide that the cost of the experiment is high and it’s unlikely to change how you run the facilities, then it’s probably not worth running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1392	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It might be if you decide that the cost to run the experiment is pretty low—in other words, that the staff can come up with a way of doing the experiment that’s not really hard to communicate to markets, and we don’t confuse people about what our intentions are or about how we’re ranking monetary control versus footprint versus financial stability.	62.0	96.0
201601	1393	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all I’m saying.	62.0	96.0
201601	1394	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not arguing against running the experiment.	62.0	96.0
201601	1395	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we also need to think about the question, what are you going to gain from running the experiment, and how is it going to affect your behavior?	62.0	96.0
201601	1396	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, those are perfectly sensible principles.	62.0	81.0
201601	1397	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I totally agree.	62.0	81.0
201601	1398	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What’s at stake here is whether we have a facility or not.	62.0	81.0
201601	1399	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	What’s at stake here is a couple hundred billion dollars of money market fund allocations and where they go—whether they go to us or somewhere else.	62.0	81.0
201601	1400	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think that suggests that the stakes are quite enough to motivate some experiments.	62.0	81.0
201601	1401	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I join you in urging the staff to bring us some plans for experimentation.	62.0	81.0
201601	1402	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201601	1403	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a very good round of comment and discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1404	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me join others in thanking the staff, first, for flawless execution of liftoff and, second, for an excellent memo.	62.0	65.0
201601	1405	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a rich discussion.	62.0	65.0
201601	1406	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, we’ll go off and contemplate what the appropriate next steps or options might be.	62.0	65.0
201601	1407	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think there is some degree of agreement—obviously not complete—but, as in the past, my guess is, we’ll go back and try to narrow options and respond to what we’ve heard and try to work our way forward to a decision about how to proceed.	62.0	65.0
201601	1408	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break.	62.0	65.0
201601	1409	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Do we need to ratify the open market operations?	63.0	108.0
201601	1410	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, I’m sorry.	63.0	65.0
201601	1411	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	63.0	65.0
201601	1412	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	63.0	65.0
201601	1413	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I appreciate that.	63.0	65.0
201601	1414	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Before we break, we need to ratify open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201601	1415	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Can I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201601	1416	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201601	1417	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201601	1418	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201601	1419	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201601	1420	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s take a 20-minute break.	52.0	65.0
201601	1422	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s resume.	52.0	65.0
201601	1423	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Brian has something for you.	51.0	65.0
201601	1424	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	51.0	999.0
201601	1425	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I apologize, but I misstated the name of the person proposed as associate economist by Vice Chairman Dudley.	51.0	999.0
201601	1426	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	The individual that Vice Chairman Dudley proposes is Jonathan McCarthy rather than James McAndrews.	51.0	999.0
201601	1427	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Again, I apologize for this error.	51.0	999.0
201601	1428	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	I think the Chair would like to call for a vote on this nomination.	51.0	999.0
201601	1429	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	51.0	65.0
201601	1430	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Do I have a motion?	51.0	65.0
201601	1431	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	51.0	108.0
201601	1432	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	51.0	65.0
201601	1433	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I assume without objection.	51.0	65.0
201601	1434	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	51.0	65.0
201601	1435	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now let’s move on to our briefings on the “Economic and Financial Situation,” and today we’re going to start with Steve Kamin.	11.0	65.0
201601	1436	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	11.0	999.0
201601	1437	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the materials titled “Material for the International Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1438	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon has discussed, this is the second time in six months that concerns about a steep devaluation of the Chinese renminbi and related fears of a hard landing in China have roiled international markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1439	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Admittedly, finding anything comforting to say about the world economy right now is as challenging as finding a carton of milk or loaf of bread in a local grocery store.	11.0	999.0
201601	1440	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But nevertheless, as in September, our sense is that, in an environment of fragile global economic growth and pronounced anxieties about deflationary pressures, investors are being driven more by heightened concerns about downside risks than by tangible evidence of a sharp deterioration in the baseline outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1441	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, incoming data since your previous meeting do not suggest any steep falloff in Chinese output.	11.0	999.0
201601	1442	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the solid red line in panel 1, GDP growth stayed strong at 7 percent in the fourth quarter, higher than our December projection.	11.0	999.0
201601	1443	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The announced figure was very much in line with our nowcasting model, the blue line, which predicts Chinese GDP using data on contemporaneous industrial production, retail sales, and imports.	11.0	999.0
201601	1444	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	All told, we see no evidence that Chinese GDP is slowing more precipitously than official figures would suggest, and our baseline forecast remains one of only gradually slowing growth—in line with slowing potential output—in the years to come.	11.0	999.0
201601	1445	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Later in my remarks, I will return to the question of downside risks to this reasonably benign outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1446	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The future path of the renminbi is, frankly, a more difficult issue.	11.0	999.0
201601	1447	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The authorities are struggling to achieve multiple objectives:  (1) containing appreciation of the trade- weighted renminbi that would accompany a further rise in the dollar; (2) preventing a large, disorderly depreciation of the currency; (3) maintaining reserves amid strengthening capital outflows; and (4) giving market forces a greater role in the foreign exchange market.	11.0	999.0
201601	1448	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The mutual inconsistency of some of these goals, plus the failure of the Chinese authorities to articulate clearly their strategy and objectives, has confused markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1449	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, when the PBOC allowed the currency to depreciate at a faster pace at the start of the year, investors took this as a sign that a much larger depreciation might be in the offing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1450	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	We believe that the current level of the renminbi is not fundamentally overvalued, but that downward pressures on the currency will continue as long as investors worry that the economy is falling into recession and that the authorities will allow—or even welcome—substantial further depreciation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1451	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, as indicated in panel 2, we are assuming that the renminbi will depreciate a little further—both against the dollar and the authorities’ own announced basket of currencies, the multilateral index shown in red—through the middle of the year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1452	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	By that time, assuming that our forecast materializes that there will be still- solid Chinese growth , capital outflows should settle down and the currency stabilize.	11.0	999.0
201601	1453	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, more bumps on this road are likely, and again, as I will discuss momentarily, more extreme outcomes are certainly possible.	11.0	999.0
201601	1454	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Besides concerns about China, the further steep plunge in oil prices shown in panel 3 has also roiled global financial markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1455	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Part of that plunge was itself a reaction to the concerns about global demand triggered by the events in China, but we believe supply factors accounted for the lion’s share of the decline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1456	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Estimates of US crude oil production came in stronger than expected, inventories continued to build, and sanctions against Iran that had restrained its oil exports were finally removed.	11.0	999.0
201601	1457	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we do not see the most recent plunge in oil prices as reflecting a sharp downgrade in global prospects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1458	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, the decline in oil prices does affect the outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1459	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Ultimately, that decline should be a slight positive for the global economy, as income is transferred from oil-producing to oil-consuming countries that traditionally have a higher propensity to spend out of income.	11.0	999.0
201601	1460	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But it appears to take considerable time for lower energy prices to boost consumption, whereas the hit to investment in the energy sector materializes more quickly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1461	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, over the next few quarters, the drag arising from falling oil prices on net oil exporters—the bottom set of bars in panel 4—should exceed the boost to net oil importers.	11.0	999.0
201601	1462	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	This should lower aggregate foreign growth, as some of the oil exporters, such as Canada and Mexico, have much higher trade weights in our foreign GDP aggregate than the oil importers.	11.0	999.0
201601	1463	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, even net oil importers may experience some drag if, like the United States, they have oil sectors of their own.	11.0	999.0
201601	1464	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	One question we have grappled with recently is whether the current low level of oil prices alters their economic effects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1465	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In regard to the magnitude of the effect of falling oil prices on the energy sector, we remain uncertain.	11.0	999.0
201601	1466	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	On the one hand, if oil prices are reaching thresholds at which production and investment are unprofitable, this could cause disproportionately large declines in energy investment.	11.0	999.0
201601	1467	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, these thresholds are very uncertain and oil prices may already have fallen through them.	11.0	999.0
201601	1468	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	It is worth noting that in the United States, drilling and mining have already fallen by half, so the scope for further declines is limited, no matter how low oil prices go.	11.0	999.0
201601	1469	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In other respects, however, it seems likely that as oil prices hit very low levels, the effects of their decline will prove more injurious.	11.0	999.0
201601	1470	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	For countries that are especially reliant on oil revenues, such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, budgets are becoming so stretched that sharp cutbacks in consumption seem unavoidable.	11.0	999.0
201601	1471	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Very low oil prices may also damage the balance sheets of oil-producing companies and oil-reliant governments and thus make bankruptcies and defaults more likely.	11.0	999.0
201601	1472	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 5 shows our projection for foreign economic growth, taking developments in China, oil prices, and global financial markets into account.	11.0	999.0
201601	1473	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Growth in the fourth quarter fell a bit below our December Tealbook estimate, largely because Canadian growth stalled in the face of drag due to prior declines in oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1474	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	For this quarter and next, we revised down the pace of expansion in Canada and other commodity producers in light of the further fall in commodity prices this year; Mexican economic growth promises to be a little softer as well, reflecting the weaker path for US manufacturing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1475	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Even so, we see foreign activity accelerating from here on out, reaching its trend pace of near 3 percent—the same as we wrote down in December— by the second half of the year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1476	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Canadian growth recovers from its oil-induced slump; lackluster growth in the euro-area firms, supported by low energy costs; and Brazil’s economy finally bottoms out.	11.0	999.0
201601	1477	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Our relatively limited markdown of the foreign outlook for the next couple of quarters might seem inconsistent with the further easing of monetary policy expected in Canada, the euro area, and Japan, as described by Simon, along with a likely postponement of liftoff in the United Kingdom.	11.0	999.0
201601	1478	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	However, with the exception of Canada, those easings appear to be motivated less by a weakening of their economies and more by further declines in inflation and inflation expectations, in part triggered by the recent plunge in oil prices, as well as by concerns about downside risks to the global outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1479	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, assuming foreign growth does return to trend as expected, we believe it likely that the broad real dollar—the solid black line in panel 6—will stabilize as well.	11.0	999.0
201601	1480	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	That said, our forecast path for the dollar now averages almost 3½ percent above its level in the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1481	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Most of that revision reflects the rise in the dollar over the intermeeting period, but some additional appreciation of the dollar against the renminbi and other Asian currencies that we are now assuming also boosts the dollar’s path.	11.0	999.0
201601	1482	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Incorporating our revisions to the dollar and the outlook for foreign GDP growth since the December Tealbook, we now project a slightly greater drag arising from net exports on US GDP over most of the forecast period and a slightly greater drag of core import prices on US inflation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1483	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But as I noted earlier, the fluctuations in global financial markets this year likely reflected concerns about extreme downside risks.	11.0	999.0
201601	1484	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	One prominent such risk, drawn from the January Tealbook and summarized in the top panel of your next exhibit, is that China’s economy experiences a hard landing that spills over to other EMEs and causes sharp disruptions in global markets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1485	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Considering China’s substantial economic and financial imbalances, as well as its increasing weight in the global economy, this scenario is hardly far-fetched.	11.0	999.0
201601	1486	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But even so, we have calibrated the shock to be very severe:  GDP in China and other EMEs falls 7 percent below baseline—similar to during the Asia crisis; the dollar rises 15 percent, more than it did during the Asian crisis; and US corporate credit spreads, which in the 1980s and 1990s generally had been relatively impervious to EME crises, widen by 100 basis points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1487	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we view this scenario as a tail risk rather than a likely alternative to our baseline outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1488	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, as evidenced by the red lines in the panels below, US GDP growth falls below 1 percent, core inflation falls to ¼ percent, and the federal funds rate moves back toward zero.	11.0	999.0
201601	1489	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In the January Tealbook, we featured a second external downside risk to the US economy that we would regard as having a greater probability of coming to pass than a hard landing in China.	11.0	999.0
201601	1490	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in the top panel, foreign real GDP growth comes in just ½ percentage point below expectations—hardly a crisis, but enough to unnerve investors further, pushing the dollar up another 10 percent and oil prices down a further $7 per barrel.	11.0	999.0
201601	1491	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the blue lines below, the rise in the dollar pushes US real GDP growth down ½ percentage point while both the movements in the dollar and oil prices further delay the return of inflation toward target.	11.0	999.0
201601	1492	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The federal funds rate still rises, but at a slower pace.	11.0	999.0
201601	1493	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	David will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1494	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I will be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1495	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Despite the recent turmoil in financial markets and some increase in the turmoil in my own stomach, our baseline outlook for real activity is only a little weaker than it was in December.	11.0	999.0
201601	1496	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I will spend the bulk of my remarks laying out the reasons behind this outcome.	11.0	999.0
201601	1497	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Along the way, I will also note that we continue to assess the risks to our outlook for real activity as weighted to the downside, and a little more so now than six weeks ago.	11.0	999.0
201601	1498	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Starting with some of the bad news, the recent indicators of spending and production have mostly been disappointing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1499	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 1 at the top of your first exhibit shows the evolution of several forecasts of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1500	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The horizontal axis shows the date when a forecast was generated.	11.0	999.0
201601	1501	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The forecasts shown here include the Board staff’s judgmental forecast as of each Tealbook closing date, as well as various model-based nowcasts generated at the Board and elsewhere in the System.	11.0	999.0
201601	1502	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the black line, over the past few months the Board staff has successively lowered our estimate of fourth-quarter growth to the point at which it now stands at just ½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201601	1503	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nowcasts from our dynamic factor model—the red line—have also drifted lower on net.	11.0	999.0
201601	1504	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That said, uncertainty about what happened last quarter is still substantial as portrayed both by the dispersion in views across models maintained by staff around the Reserve Banks—which are portrayed by the blue dashed lines—as well as by the shaded region, which gives a 70 percent confidence interval around the estimate in the Board staff’s factor model.	11.0	999.0
201601	1505	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	For us on the judgmental staff at the Board, the negative surprise since the time of your December meeting has been about equally split between inventory investment and final sales.	11.0	999.0
201601	1506	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At this point, hard evidence about first-quarter real GDP growth is sparse but, as you can see from the black line in panel 2, we do not think that last quarter’s pronounced weakness will persist, partly because non-energy inventories look to be in reasonable alignment with sales, and so inventory investment is not likely to continue declining rapidly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1507	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That said, the various nowcasting models can support a wide range of views about what might be going on in the first quarter.	11.0	999.0
201601	1508	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our judgment about the current state of the economy was heavily influenced by the strength of the December jobs report.	11.0	999.0
201601	1509	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As I have mentioned before, we have been working on an ambitious program to develop a comprehensive method for combining the signal from spending, production, and labor market indicators to infer a summary measure of the economy’s cyclical position.	11.0	999.0
201601	1510	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In panel 3, I show the cyclical indicator—essentially, an estimate of the output gap—that emerges from one model- based version of this idea.	11.0	999.0
201601	1511	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The solid black line gives the estimated cyclical indicator, taking as given what we now know about such variables as the unemployment rate and payroll employment in the fourth quarter, along with our latest estimate of GDP growth in that quarter.	11.0	999.0
201601	1512	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The red dashed line was constructed on the basis only of data through the third quarter and is meant to approximate what we would have estimated on the basis of the official quarterly data that were available to us at the time of your December meeting.	11.0	999.0
201601	1513	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, the estimated cyclical position of the economy in the fourth quarter in this version of the model is completely unaffected by the addition of the fourth-quarter values.	11.0	999.0
201601	1514	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	One interpretation of what is going on is that the model is writing off much of the weak GDP information as statistical noise and instead is putting substantial weight on the strong recent labor market data, leaving the estimated cyclical indicator unrevised.	11.0	999.0
201601	1515	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	We did the same thing in the judgmental forecast albeit to a lesser degree:  Of the total signal for the output gap that we might have taken from the weak trajectory of real GDP growth in the fourth quarter, we took on board half and absorbed the other half by marking down once again our estimate of potential GDP growth in 2015—in effect, using potential GDP as a temporary parking lot for observation error until we can get a more fully articulated accounting system in place.	11.0	999.0
201601	1516	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beyond the near term, our outlook for real output growth—shown in panel 4— and the unemployment rate—panel 5—is very little changed from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1517	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Current and expected financial conditions—particularly the stronger path of the dollar and lower level of equity prices over the projection period—are now less supportive of growth than they were in the December Tealbook, but the effects of these weaker financial assumptions are partly offset by the net impetus from lower oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1518	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, legislation regarding some federal tax policies that the Congress passed last month implies a stance of federal fiscal policy that is slightly more expansionary than what we had penciled in at the time of our December forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1519	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Naturally, views will differ about whether our assessment of the underlying state of the economy is correct, and having been raised at a dinner table at which a lawyer’s adversarial mindset was the norm, I thought I would take a crack at sketching the case I would assemble if I were, alternatively, more pessimistically minded or more optimistic than in the baseline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1520	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	A more downbeat assessment of the outlook for real activity could start with the observation that December’s retail sales report was quite weak, following a stronger- than-expected reading in November.	11.0	999.0
201601	1521	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the baseline, we took the view that this monthly pattern may reflect a shift toward an earlier holiday shopping season, but it could instead reflect a more fundamental weakening late last year in households’ inclination to spend.	11.0	999.0
201601	1522	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Perhaps bolstering that view, while motor vehicle sales were still at a high level in December, they were not as high as we had expected, and a skeptic might be especially attentive to durable goods spending as a relatively sensitive harbinger of cyclical weakening.	11.0	999.0
201601	1523	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, indicators of activity in the industrial sector—including the various regional surveys—have continued to be downbeat.	11.0	999.0
201601	1524	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although the industrial sector seems to have been particularly hard-hit by the stronger dollar and the reduction in oil drilling activity, industrial activity has been sluggish, even leaving those factors aside.	11.0	999.0
201601	1525	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the labor market, while initial claims remain low by historical standards, they have drifted up some since late last year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1526	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, we could be underestimating the adverse implications of the recent tightening in financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1527	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Our baseline incorporates all of the conventional channels—for example, the effect of lower equity wealth on household spending and the effect of a stronger dollar on net exports.	11.0	999.0
201601	1528	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	But we have not allowed for any additional contribution operating through household or business confidence or disruptions of financial intermediation, nor have we assumed that financial market conditions will worsen materially, nor did we take the recent adverse financial news as an indication that market participants know something we do not know about economic prospects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1529	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Thomas will report on some models that key off of financial variables and point to an elevated risk of recession in coming quarters.	11.0	999.0
201601	1530	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, one could also find reasons to be more optimistic than our baseline.	11.0	999.0
201601	1531	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Most notably—as I mentioned earlier—the December labor market report was quite good:  Job gains over the fourth quarter are now estimated to have averaged 285,000 per month, and the employment-to-population ratio ticked up last month as the participation rate edged higher.	11.0	999.0
201601	1532	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the past several years, this has been a consistent pattern:  Labor market improvements have chugged along at a steady pace, and disappointing news about GDP growth has been an indication that we needed to downgrade further our assessment of aggregate supply conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1533	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That is not great news for the living standards of future generations, but thus far it has not meant that cyclical weakness was just around the corner.	11.0	999.0
201601	1534	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, the news coming from the household sector has not been all bleak:  The Michigan measure of consumer sentiment remained at a pretty high level in early January, and the slow-but-steady recovery in housing construction still seems to be in place.	11.0	999.0
201601	1535	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As a partial counterpoint to the estimates of an elevated risk of recession six months hence, I would point to other models suggesting that the probability that the economy was in recession last month was much lower than normal.	11.0	999.0
201601	1536	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, if I were prosecuting the optimistic case, I would note that we still do not really know what went on during the fourth quarter of last year with regard to GDP:  Even after the BEA publishes its first estimate of growth in the fourth quarter—which we will all take, in our weaker moments, as an announcement of the true outcome—the 70 percent confidence interval around that estimate will be wider than 3 percentage points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1537	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In other words, even if the BEA validates our current guess that real GDP inched up only ½ percent at an annual rate last quarter, there would be a 15 percent chance that the actual growth rate last quarter was around 2 percent or better.	11.0	999.0
201601	1538	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, the pessimist could reply that the uncertainty is two-sided, and that a decline of 1 percent or more is just as good a guess, but in light of the recent track record of the GDP data, I think the optimist would have the better side of this particular point.	11.0	999.0
201601	1539	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The middle course that we have taken in the baseline tries to strike a balance between these two views, and I am mildly encouraged that our state-space model would have had us go even a little further in discounting the weak GDP data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1540	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Downside risks are certainly very much in vogue these days.	11.0	999.0
201601	1541	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Although picking a favorite downside risk would feel a little like having to name which is my favorite child and acknowledging the salience of the risks Steve has discussed, I would also put in a word for the scenario titled “Financial Turbulence” in the “Risks and Uncertainty” section of the Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1542	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In that scenario, we used a model developed by colleagues at FRB New York to wrestle with the potential economic implications of a significant further deterioration in financial conditions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1543	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The beauty of the New York model is that it represents one of the few serious attempts to build in a richer interaction between the financial sector and real activity.	11.0	999.0
201601	1544	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	If we assume a substantial and sustained additional widening in credit risk spreads compared with the baseline, then this model does predict a mild recession during the first half of this year.	11.0	999.0
201601	1545	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 6 and 7 summarize the inflation outlook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1546	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I do not have much to report here, mostly because not enough time has passed yet since the December meeting to prove us very wrong.	11.0	999.0
201601	1547	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 6, we have lowered our near-term projection for headline PCE inflation, largely because of the lower path of crude oil prices now anticipated by futures markets and by us.	11.0	999.0
201601	1548	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And panel 7 shows that our near-term forecast of core PCE inflation is a little lower than in the December Tealbook, mainly because the projected path for core import prices has been revised down.	11.0	999.0
201601	1549	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beyond the near term, though, our inflation projection is about unchanged from our previous forecast.	11.0	999.0
201601	1550	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In the statement that you released at the conclusion of your December meeting, you cited reasonable confidence that inflation would move up to your 2 percent objective as one of the rationales for raising the funds rate by a notch.	11.0	999.0
201601	1551	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	To aid in the task of monitoring progress toward that objective, we intend to introduce in the March Tealbook a set of inflation-focused exhibits similar to the ones we used following your September 2012 meeting to track whether the substantial further improvement in labor market conditions was being achieved.	11.0	999.0
201601	1552	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Panels 8 and 9 preview two of the exhibits that we intend to use.	11.0	999.0
201601	1553	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	These two panels will decompose the cumulative revisions that we make to our inflation projection from our forecast in the December 2015 Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201601	1554	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from panel 8, we have revised down our forecast regarding top-line PCE inflation this year by nearly ½ percentage point thus far, mostly because of the further downward move in energy prices.	11.0	999.0
201601	1555	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And as shown in panel 9, the cumulative revisions to our forecast of core PCE inflation are, not surprisingly, very small thus far and almost entirely attributable to readily identifiable factors—namely, the level of resource utilization and the pass-through of energy and import prices into core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201601	1556	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, the next page updates the “Lockhart dashboard,” which summarizes the timeline of when some key indicators will become available to you at the next few FOMC meetings.	11.0	999.0
201601	1557	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The data that will first be available at the March meeting are in the gold-shaded region, the additional observations that will become available in time for the April meeting are shaded in red, and data that will be available at the June meeting lie yet further to the right.	11.0	999.0
201601	1558	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	We expect that headline inflation will continue to run at a low level through the first part of this year—with some further negative readings on a three-month change basis—as low oil prices depress consumer energy prices, and on our reckoning, core inflation will remain below 1½ percent.	11.0	999.0
201601	1559	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As for real activity, we expect that the labor market will keep generating solid job gains and an unemployment rate moving just below 5 percent despite the sluggish pace of GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201601	1560	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Nellie will continue.	11.0	999.0
201601	1561	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Thank you, David.	11.0	999.0
201601	1562	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I will be referring to the materials called “Financial Stability Developments.”	11.0	999.0
201601	1563	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Since the last financial stability briefing in October, the US financial system continued to be buffeted by some large shocks, mainly related to lower oil prices and developments in China.	11.0	999.0
201601	1564	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Risk premiums for many US assets have widened, but the domestic financial system appears not to have amplified them with forced asset sales or stresses at large financial firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1565	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The system’s resiliency likely reflects limited exposures and high capital in the banking system, and a gradual modest decline in leverage and less stable funding more broadly in recent quarters.	11.0	999.0
201601	1566	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	However, bigger shocks, such as a sharper slowing of global growth mentioned by Steve and David, would increase the risk of larger amplification effects.	11.0	999.0
201601	1567	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	On the first exhibit:  As Simon noted in his briefing, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds have risen sharply for many sectors, not just for oil firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1568	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Moreover, spreads have risen by more than required to compensate for higher expected defaults, suggesting risk premiums also have risen significantly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1569	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	One illustration of the rise in risk premiums is the increase in far-forward spreads of about 150 basis points since mid-2014, when oil prices started to fall.	11.0	999.0
201601	1570	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We interpret these changes to reflect changes in risk sentiment as investors likely are not revising their outlook for defaults at that horizon.	11.0	999.0
201601	1571	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The larger increase in near-term spreads of closer to 300 basis points is more plausibly driven by both higher expected defaults and higher risk premiums.	11.0	999.0
201601	1572	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This rise in expected defaults stems partly from the increased leverage of speculative-grade corporations.	11.0	999.0
201601	1573	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Debt has been growing rapidly for the lower-rated segment of the corporate sector, and as shown by the blue line in the top right, the debt-to-asset ratio for speculative-grade non-oil corporations has increased to a near multidecade high and has jumped recently at oil firms, the red line, as they wrote down the value of their oil reserves.	11.0	999.0
201601	1574	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	While many of these firms that issued debt in recent years have locked in lower interest rates and extended maturities, we expect some firms will be stressed as firm values fall amid the reversal in risk sentiment, making it more expensive to maintain or get new financing.	11.0	999.0
201601	1575	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Falling prices for speculative-grade bonds have been accompanied by sizable outflows at mutual funds in recent months (shown in the middle-left chart).	11.0	999.0
201601	1576	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Large redemptions for more than a year at a small high-yield mutual fund led that fund to suspend redemptions in December, an action that surprised investors.	11.0	999.0
201601	1577	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This event highlights the tension between the offer of daily redemptions to investors and the growth of funds concentrated in less liquid assets.	11.0	999.0
201601	1578	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We have not seen evidence of disproportionate outflows at other bond funds as a result.	11.0	999.0
201601	1579	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We also did not see evidence of strains in market functioning at the time in the speculative-grade corporate bond market (shown to the right).	11.0	999.0
201601	1580	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	As shown in that panel, bid-ask spreads (the blue line) and average trading volumes (the black line) stayed in their normal ranges.	11.0	999.0
201601	1581	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Nonetheless, it seems quite possible that the surprise closure raised the risk of preemptive outflows in the future and forced asset sales.	11.0	999.0
201601	1582	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The SEC proposed rules last September to improve liquidity risk management and investor disclosures at these mutual funds, and the Financial Stability Oversight Council is assessing whether potential systemic risks arising from liquidity mismatch are being addressed.	11.0	999.0
201601	1583	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	An adverse dynamic of wider risk premiums that could have broader consequences should be limited by the modest exposures and strong capital positions of banking firms.	11.0	999.0
201601	1584	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although LISCC firms naturally have significant exposures to the corporate sector, as noted in the bottom-left panel, exposures to oil firms are not large.	11.0	999.0
201601	1585	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The more significant concerns arising from lower oil prices would be for community banks or some regional banks in some areas of the country.	11.0	999.0
201601	1586	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In addition, LISCC bank exposures to China, Hong Kong, and other EMEs are limited, although indirect exposures through other global banking firms could be a concern if EME troubles intensify.	11.0	999.0
201601	1587	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	These potential risks are not a complete surprise:  Last year’s stress-test scenarios featured wider corporate spreads and weak foreign growth, and they will remain features of this year’s scenarios, which will be released later this week.	11.0	999.0
201601	1588	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Leverage in other parts of the financial system is more difficult to assess, but it does not appear unusually high and may be falling modestly.	11.0	999.0
201601	1589	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Leverage at hedge funds measured based on margin credit may have turned down after the sharp jump in stock price volatility in August and the related margin calls, and more dealers reported in SCOOS in December that they had tightened somewhat the terms for securities financing and derivatives for their hedge fund clients.	11.0	999.0
201601	1590	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In terms of oil positions, and as shown in the bottom right, the CME started to raise margins for oil futures last fall and have maintained margins at a relatively high level as price volatility has stayed high.	11.0	999.0
201601	1591	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The staff views current margins to be conservative, on the basis of an estimated probability being low that a futures price change would exceed current margin levels.	11.0	999.0
201601	1592	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Conservative margins reduce the prospect of a near-term increase that could trigger further price declines.	11.0	999.0
201601	1593	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Exhibit 2 summarizes a broader view of financial vulnerabilities.	11.0	999.0
201601	1594	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The table focuses on four categories of financial vulnerabilities, listed in the first column.	11.0	999.0
201601	1595	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The current assessments for the categories, shown in the last column, are mostly “yellow,” which means we view vulnerabilities to shocks from any sources to be in the moderate range.	11.0	999.0
201601	1596	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The staff judgments regarding the categories and overall are based on both a cyclical assessment of indicators as assessed against metrics of roughly the past 30 years as well as structural problems not captured well by time-series data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1597	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I do not plan to talk through each line of the table but will highlight a few points.	11.0	999.0
201601	1598	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	For asset valuation pressures, we currently view them to be moderate, a step-down from the notable level in recent assessments.	11.0	999.0
201601	1599	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	As mentioned, risk spreads for corporate bonds widened materially and are now well above average, and low-rated, low-quality issuance has been abating.	11.0	999.0
201601	1600	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In addition, the decline in stock prices has brought forward price-to-earnings ratios down, but they are above their median level of recent decades.	11.0	999.0
201601	1601	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	However, cap rates for commercial real estate through December indicate required returns continued to move down and are very close to or near levels near their previous boom in 2007.	11.0	999.0
201601	1602	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although cap rates may be supported by low interest rates and lending terms and standards recently appear to be tightening, the continued rapid rise in prices suggests this sector warrants continued attention.	11.0	999.0
201601	1603	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In the next category, private nonfinancial sector leverage, an increase to record- high debt ratios in the business sector led us to raise the assessment early last year from green to yellow.	11.0	999.0
201601	1604	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Although the business sector on its own might warrant a higher level, household borrowing has been very subdued, and the total private nonfinancial credit-to-GDP ratio in relation to its long-run trend is at a very low level.	11.0	999.0
201601	1605	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In the financial sector, vulnerabilities arising from leverage are viewed to be low (shown by green), though a notch higher than the blue subdued level that would be suggested by the time-series data.	11.0	999.0
201601	1606	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Bank capital ratios are at their highest in decades, but ratios have been rising as capital has turned out to have been inadequate many times for the risks of the financial system.	11.0	999.0
201601	1607	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	In maturity and liquidity transformation, vulnerabilities also are viewed as moderate, reflecting the fact that while cyclical vulnerabilities are low, structural reforms are still incomplete.	11.0	999.0
201601	1608	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Short-term nondeposit liabilities have declined sharply in recent years and are low, especially adjusted for an upward trend.	11.0	999.0
201601	1609	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	On the structural side, the money fund reforms to address run risk are still to be implemented, as discussed earlier, and some parts of the repo and sec lending markets are very opaque.	11.0	999.0
201601	1610	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Liquidity transformation has increased, and, as noted earlier, there is work supporting reforms for mutual funds.	11.0	999.0
201601	1611	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Finally, I would note that this assessment that financial vulnerabilities overall are moderate was an input into the Board’s decision in December to affirm the level of the countercyclical capital buffer at zero.	11.0	999.0
201601	1612	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The Board at the same time issued a proposal for comments on the framework for determining the level of the countercyclical capital buffer.	11.0	999.0
201601	1613	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	That concludes our remarks, and we would be happy to answer your questions.	11.0	999.0
201601	1614	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	12.0	65.0
201601	1615	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Two quick questions.	12.0	111.0
201601	1616	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	David, on your inflation revisions, forgive me, what’s the takeaway from panel 9?	12.0	111.0
201601	1617	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	How do we look at this, and how do we use it?	12.0	111.0
201601	1618	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	8 and 9 are components of an inflation monitor that we intend to introduce in the March Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201601	1619	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The first page of those exhibits is just going to show the evolution of our inflation forecasts from one Tealbook to the next and will overlay each successive forecast on top, so that if our forecast begins to drift away from what we had envisioned at the time of the December 2015 Tealbook, that will be completely evident.	12.0	999.0
201601	1620	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And 8 and 9 will look at the cumulative revision in the inflation forecast, putting a stake in the ground at the December 2015 Tealbook.	12.0	999.0
201601	1621	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What they’ll do is decompose in the left-hand panel the projection for top-line PCE inflation and in the right-hand panel the projection for core PCE inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1622	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The decomposition in the left-hand panel is just arithmetic.	12.0	999.0
201601	1623	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	All it does is take the top-line PCE price index and decompose our forecast error into the main categories that are listed there:  food, energy, and core.	12.0	999.0
201601	1624	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	In some sense, there’s no analytical content there.	12.0	999.0
201601	1625	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	It’s just relative importance weights and an arithmetic exercise of how much each component departed from our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201601	1626	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	There is some economic content in the panel on the right-hand side because that’s based on rules of thumb that our sector analysts use, which in turn themselves are informed by model- based estimates.	12.0	999.0
201601	1627	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What we’re trying to do is trace through the importance of changes in each of these factors for the projected behavior of core inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1628	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The idea there in the right-hand panel is that what we’ll do is attempt to trace back revisions in our core PCE inflation forecast to one- level-more fundamental sources.	12.0	999.0
201601	1629	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’m sure that interpretations around the table will differ, probably in 19 different ways at least.	12.0	999.0
201601	1630	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That will double-count—	12.0	999.0
201601	1631	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But there are only 17 of us.	12.0	97.0
201601	1632	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	—two of you.	12.0	999.0
201601	1633	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I was onto that.	12.0	999.0
201601	1634	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At least two of you will have different views.	12.0	999.0
201601	1635	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	12.0	999.0
201601	1636	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	One possible interpretation of this decomposition might be that if we’re able to trace the cumulative revision in our inflation forecast back to easily identifiable, earlier sources, like energy prices, the dollar feeding through import prices, or the pressure on economic activity— that is, the Phillips curve at work—that might not reveal any extent to which we’ve lost our handle on how the inflation mechanism is working, because those would be identifiable factors that we would understand the economic mechanism that’s at work.	12.0	999.0
201601	1637	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there’s an “other” category, because it’s not going to work out in so tidy a manner.	12.0	999.0
201601	1638	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	At the moment, this “other” category is barely discernible, as we’ve only had one reading on the PCE monthly price index and one reading on the CPI since last time, but over time the “other” category will emerge, either to the upside or the downside.	12.0	999.0
201601	1639	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	My hope is that it will provide an interesting vehicle for discussion and analysis as to what’s going on, what the underlying story might be.	12.0	999.0
201601	1640	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the goal of this.	12.0	999.0
201601	1641	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	The last piece of this inflation monitor will just be a panel—currently page 27 in your data sheets—that provides a roundup of a whole bunch of different measures of longer-term inflation expectations, which play a pretty key role in our inflation analysis.	12.0	999.0
201601	1642	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	If those begin to drift one direction or the other, that’s something that would capture our attention.	12.0	999.0
201601	1643	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The second quick question I had—maybe for David or Nellie, I’m not sure—is that in the risk scenarios I found it hard to reconcile that the China hard-landing scenario did not yield a recession, but the financial market turbulence did yield a recession.	12.0	111.0
201601	1644	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	It struck me that a China hard landing would trigger financial market instability, and if that’s really what’s going to trigger a recession, China could well be it.	12.0	111.0
201601	1645	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m just curious if I’m off in how I’m thinking about it, or if the staff would think differently.	12.0	111.0
201601	1646	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Let me start, because the international side was responsible for that part of the scenarios.	12.0	999.0
201601	1647	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	If you look at exhibit 2 of your international outlook materials, the red line in panel 5, which is US GDP, falls on a four-quarter change basis to ½ percent.	12.0	999.0
201601	1648	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I don’t have the actual quarterly numbers on me, but I’m pretty darn sure that that means a quarter or two of negative changes in real GDP.	12.0	999.0
201601	1649	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	In that sense, it probably is associated with at least a mild recession.	12.0	999.0
201601	1650	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Just to compare that scenario with the financial turbulence scenario, in the China hard-landing scenario, the negative effects on the US economy come mainly through trade channels—the rise in the dollar and the decline in foreign GDP.	12.0	999.0
201601	1651	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	Those have a very important and material effect on the US economy, but all that being said, because the US economy is not as open to international trade as other economies, the effect is not so great.	12.0	999.0
201601	1652	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	The China hard- landing scenario does also incorporate the disruptions to US markets that do depress GDP, but obviously not as much as the financial turbulence scenario.	12.0	999.0
201601	1653	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll now pass the baton to my colleagues here.	12.0	999.0
201601	1654	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I would only add, I think we could probably easily, in some sense, concatenate the two scenarios and get something that’s more severe to the downside from the combination of both of the factors.	12.0	999.0
201601	1655	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And I think it’s realistic to envision that the kind of financial turbulence that we have in that scenario would result from the China scenario.	12.0	999.0
201601	1656	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And that’s a pretty common type of additional exercise that you do with these, right, when you’re looking for an extra kick from spillovers.	12.0	91.0
201601	1657	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I’ll add one more point.	12.0	999.0
201601	1658	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	When we were looking at the financial linkages between the United States and China, and the EMEs, most of the linkages are economic—trade and the dollar—so that’s where the biggest linkages in the scenario are, as you would expect.	12.0	999.0
201601	1659	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The linkages between the financial institutions in the United States and China and the EMEs are pretty limited.	12.0	999.0
201601	1660	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Your first scenario would not entail a lot of distress in the US financial markets from this, but, clearly, that could be added.	12.0	999.0
201601	1661	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, did you have a two-hander?	12.0	65.0
201601	1662	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Yes, it was a two-hander.	12.0	81.0
201601	1663	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Because it appears as if charts like number 9 might make more visits to the Committee, I wanted to follow up on President Kashkari’s question and ask something that I’ve wanted to ask you for a while.	12.0	81.0
201601	1664	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You have apportioned this: resource utilization, energy prices, and import prices.	12.0	81.0
201601	1665	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In our standard models, we often think of monetary policy as related to inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1666	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, in the standard textbook models, an impulse from monetary policy affects both prices and, to the extent that there are monetary nonneutralities or something that gives rise to the Phillips curve, simultaneously real activity and real resource utilization.	12.0	81.0
201601	1667	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’m wondering how you want us to think about attributing inflation to resource utilization, when in the standard models it’s just a correlate of inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1668	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We usually think about it in terms of monetary impulses affecting both—sometimes not real things, sometimes real things.	12.0	81.0
201601	1669	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that clear?	12.0	81.0
201601	1670	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Do you understand the question?	12.0	81.0
201601	1671	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It’s a puzzle, more or less.	12.0	81.0
201601	1672	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Well, this is quite a standard New Keynesian Phillips curve kind of framework.	12.0	999.0
201601	1673	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Monetary policy is relevant because it influences the thrust of aggregate demand, and that influences, in turn, the level of resource utilization.	12.0	999.0
201601	1674	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	As well, monetary policy operates very importantly on inflation through the exchange rate and setting the terms of trade.	12.0	999.0
201601	1675	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	So monetary policy is very much present here through two different channels:  One is the thrust of economic activity, and the other is the import price channel.	12.0	999.0
201601	1676	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, I don’t know what else I can say.	12.0	999.0
201601	1677	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I’m looking back to Dave Reifschneider.	12.0	999.0
201601	1678	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What would you add to that?	12.0	999.0
201601	1679	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I’d add two things.	12.0	999.0
201601	1680	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	One, there’s a third channel—expectations.	12.0	999.0
201601	1681	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1682	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1683	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	I would say your point is correct, in that some of the explanatory variables for inflation—say, resource utilization or marginal costs or something like that—are determined by monetary policy, but they’re determined by many other things as well.	12.0	999.0
201601	1684	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	And the accounting exercise that David was talking about isn’t trying to take everything back to every single ultimate cause, which would include what’s up with Chinese economic growth, what the European Central Bank’s monetary policy is, and yada, yada, yada.	12.0	999.0
201601	1685	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	It’s stopping at an earlier point than that.	12.0	999.0
201601	1686	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	Yes, it’s stopping at an earlier point, and it’s using some things that are clearly endogenous, like slack.	12.0	999.0
201601	1687	2016-01-27	meeting	REIFSCHNEIDER	But in the accounting mechanisms, in the New Keynesian Phillips curve, they are direct drivers of inflation.	12.0	999.0
201601	1688	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So the puzzle is that this makes it seem as if it’s the case that if monetary policy did not affect real activity, it wouldn’t affect inflation, whereas in our models, that’s a case in which it does affect inflation.	12.0	81.0
201601	1689	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That’s the puzzle for me.	12.0	81.0
201601	1690	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s still the inflation expectations channel, right?	12.0	96.0
201601	1691	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Forget expectations.	12.0	81.0
201601	1692	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In the standard model, if the Phillips curve is vertical, it affects inflation, even though it doesn’t affect real activity.	12.0	81.0
201601	1693	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s an aggregate supply relationship in there, which is this Phillips curve mechanism between the level of utilization and inflation.	12.0	65.0
201601	1694	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And according to their estimates, that relationship, at least at the moment, is, and has been, quite flat.	12.0	65.0
201601	1695	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But in the world you’re talking about, the relationship could be quite steep.	12.0	65.0
201601	1696	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The influence of utilization on inflation could be, in some world, very large, in which case monetary policy, when you incorporate that into a model, would mainly raise inflation and have very little effect on utilization.	12.0	65.0
201601	1697	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That would be a vertical Phillips curve.	12.0	65.0
201601	1698	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s not in any way the estimates that you are basing this on, but it could be, so I don’t think there’s any conceptual puzzle here.	12.0	65.0
201601	1699	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t think so.	12.0	999.0
201601	1700	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12.0	65.0
201601	1701	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s a two-hander, because at least it’s on the same dashboard topic.	12.0	91.0
201601	1702	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But another factor that could show up here—you mentioned the inflation expectations table, but, presumably, one thing that’s underlying this is, you’ve got your price-inflation Phillips curve with the additional transitory variables that show up here and other things.	12.0	91.0
201601	1703	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But you’ve also got the inflation attractor, if I understand that right.	12.0	91.0
201601	1704	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So part of the forecast, the last time I remember looking at it, was, you’ve got that at something like 1.8 percent, and it’s expected to go up at some point, possibly within the forecast horizon.	12.0	91.0
201601	1705	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Beginning of 2018.	12.0	999.0
201601	1706	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So if that doesn’t happen, that would show up as one of these yellow factors?	12.0	91.0
201601	1707	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	That’s right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1708	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12.0	91.0
201601	1709	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So to the extent that the yellow all of a sudden gets big, it is like other things are at work, and we might be behind.	12.0	91.0
201601	1710	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Right.	12.0	999.0
201601	1711	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	So if the yellow region begins to emerge, what we would do at that point is caucus among ourselves—	12.0	999.0
201601	1712	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Break out the yellow region.	12.0	96.0
201601	1713	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	—engage in some analysis of the yellow region and see whether we had some readily attributable underlying factors there, or come back to the Committee and say, “Gee, we don’t know.	12.0	999.0
201601	1714	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	There is something at work in the inflation mechanism that we can’t square with our analytical framework.”	12.0	999.0
201601	1715	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Now, there will be a lot of different analytical frameworks brought to the table.	12.0	999.0
201601	1716	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	And so what might be of concern in our framework might be understandable in others, but the goal here is to try to provide one metric where, applying our pretty mechanical rules of thumb, you’ll be able to keep score at home and see whether things are drifting away from the narrative that we had in place as of the time of the December 2015 projection.	12.0	999.0
201601	1717	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12.0	91.0
201601	1718	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Further questions?	12.0	65.0
201601	1719	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201601	1720	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201601	1721	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just had a question about the jobs numbers on the Key Economic Indicators exhibit.	12.0	94.0
201601	1722	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I guess you penciled in 238,000 for the three months in the first quarter of 2016 for nonfarm payrolls, and I notice the Tealbook had the year averaging more than 200,000.	12.0	94.0
201601	1723	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit about where the risks on that part of the forecast are.	12.0	94.0
201601	1724	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It seems high to me, but I’m willing to listen to explanations.	12.0	94.0
201601	1725	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’ve been telling a story that we expect job growth to slow down, but this really sounds like it’s still going to be a banner year in 2016.	12.0	94.0
201601	1726	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I guess that’s my general feeling.	12.0	94.0
201601	1727	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	We’re basically taking some signal from 2015.	12.0	999.0
201601	1728	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	The strong job growth and the modest pace of GDP growth has been a feature of the economy for a while, and we have those trends extending into 2016, particularly in the first half of the year.	12.0	999.0
201601	1729	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	And then over the second half, we have monthly employment increases slowing down to about 160,000 or so.	12.0	999.0
201601	1730	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	So, yes, it’s still good job growth with moderate GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1731	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	Again, that’s what we’ve been seeing.	12.0	999.0
201601	1732	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	Now, I suppose I can see risks on both sides.	12.0	999.0
201601	1733	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	We’ve underpredicted job growth in the past, and so that might argue for a higher number, not a slowdown.	12.0	999.0
201601	1734	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	On the other hand, with the modest pace of GDP growth, and if you felt productivity was going to pick up toward a faster trend, you might expect a sharper slowing in job growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1735	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	So I guess we view this as relatively balanced, a view reflected in our forecast of GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201601	1736	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	The other risk I would note is that we see the balance of risks for real activity as weighted to the downside, and that might argue for thinking about the risk to employment growth as weighted to the downside.	12.0	999.0
201601	1737	2016-01-27	meeting	WASCHER	But in view of our path for GDP growth, I think the risks of our employment forecasts seem reasonably balanced to me.	12.0	999.0
201601	1738	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201601	1739	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	88.0
201601	1740	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a financial stability question for Nellie.	12.0	88.0
201601	1741	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	One thing that has gotten my attention recently are media reports and commentary linking global equity market declines to the selling activity of sovereign wealth funds, particularly the sovereign wealth funds of oil- and gas-producing countries.	12.0	88.0
201601	1742	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	After looking into the issue, there seems to be some evidence for a reduction in holdings in foreign assets, but it seems much more difficult to determine if these reductions could be directly contributing to the declines in equity markets or indirectly influencing a risk-off environment by large investors more broadly.	12.0	88.0
201601	1743	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So my question is, has the staff done any work on, or given any thought to, the potential role of sovereign wealth funds in the recent equity market declines and, maybe more broadly, the increasing correlation of oil and risk-asset markets—which seems to be a new development?	12.0	88.0
201601	1744	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Let me just say a couple things about sovereign wealth funds.	12.0	999.0
201601	1745	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	It is something we’re currently learning more about.	12.0	999.0
201601	1746	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I would say that, six months ago, we thought of sovereign wealth funds like endowments:  They are private pools of capital.	12.0	999.0
201601	1747	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	They make investment decisions.	12.0	999.0
201601	1748	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	They might be big, and so they might affect asset prices, but they’re private pools of capital, generally not viewed as leveraged.	12.0	999.0
201601	1749	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Market regulators would not be concerned about sovereign wealth funds.	12.0	999.0
201601	1750	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	It’s not pooled investment funds or investment for others.	12.0	999.0
201601	1751	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I think what we’re seeing over the past six months to a year is that they aren’t really endowments, to the extent that they are parts of oil-producing countries, and the countries are using them to finance their deficits.	12.0	999.0
201601	1752	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So, in some sense, they’re just a leveraged fund for a country, and to that extent they are of more interest.	12.0	999.0
201601	1753	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Could make a comment?	12.0	88.0
201601	1754	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1755	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	One commentator, I thought, had a very interesting analysis.	12.0	88.0
201601	1756	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He said that we’re experiencing an enormous margin call.	12.0	88.0
201601	1757	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201601	1758	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	That is the exact sentiment I was trying to express.	12.0	999.0
201601	1759	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	I think the main questions for financial stability are:  What kind of liabilities do they have?	12.0	999.0
201601	1760	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	How short are they?	12.0	999.0
201601	1761	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	How quickly do they need to meet these obligations?	12.0	999.0
201601	1762	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And then the other piece would be, who are the other investors?	12.0	999.0
201601	1763	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Are their sales offset by purchases by other investors?	12.0	999.0
201601	1764	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So I’m giving you a sense of how we’re thinking about it.	12.0	999.0
201601	1765	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We don’t have any answers to these questions.	12.0	999.0
201601	1766	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	The international community is very interested in learning more about sovereign wealth funds, but they are a very different kind of “private” financial institution, so the kind of proposals for regulations would be very different.	12.0	999.0
201601	1767	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	This would be a country.	12.0	999.0
201601	1768	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Globally, they’re about $7 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1769	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And just to put that into context, US mutual funds have about $15 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1770	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	And I think separately managed accounts—which is the way we’ve been thinking about them, like pension funds or insurers or endowments—are probably $9 trillion.	12.0	999.0
201601	1771	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	So they’re a big piece, but they’re not the whole piece.	12.0	999.0
201601	1772	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	We’ll probably be giving them a little bit more thought.	12.0	999.0
201601	1773	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	But that’s the state of play right now.	12.0	999.0
201601	1774	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	They mainly hold US assets.	12.0	999.0
201601	1775	2016-01-27	meeting	LIANG	Yes, they like US assets.	12.0	999.0
201601	1776	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	If I could just add a couple of points.	12.0	999.0
201601	1777	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	As Nellie said, it is almost certainly the case that a lot of sovereign wealth funds are very intimately connected with their governments.	12.0	999.0
201601	1778	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	And so it’s quite plausible that over the past year or so, you’ve seen sales of sovereign wealth funds both to help finance governments that had been reliant on oil revenues and now need more cash and, secondly, perhaps even to basically finance reserve intervention.	12.0	999.0
201601	1779	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	A lot of times, the line between foreign exchange holdings and sovereign holdings is not very clear cut.	12.0	999.0
201601	1780	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	So probably both of those factors are at play, although to what extent is a little bit murky.	12.0	999.0
201601	1781	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	But I would view those as important background factors.	12.0	999.0
201601	1782	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	And then if you think about what’s happened with the plunge in equity prices more recently in the last couple of weeks, that seems to be triggered more by high-profile macroeconomic elements, such as in China.	12.0	999.0
201601	1783	2016-01-27	meeting	KAMIN	You probably wouldn’t want to attribute that to any particular sea change in the portfolio behavior of the sovereign wealth funds themselves.	12.0	999.0
201601	1784	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	12.0	65.0
201601	1785	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	12.0	65.0
201601	1786	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12.0	65.0
201601	1787	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then we have an opportunity for comments on financial stability, and let me start with Governor Fischer.	94.0	65.0
201601	1788	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201601	1789	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, I want to commend the staff that produced both of these reports, “QS Assessment of Financial Stability” and “Financial Stability Implications of ‘Low-for-Long’ Interest Rates in AFEs.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1790	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The QS assessment is summarized in the table on exhibit 2, which shows a slight improvement in the overall level of vulnerability due to a decline in valuation pressures in corporate debt markets and equity markets.	94.0	108.0
201601	1791	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think in both those cases, the decline in valuation pressures is a result of external events happening, and I’m not sure that’s all good news about what’s happened to prices there.	94.0	108.0
201601	1792	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What I found remarkable about these two reports is how much you read about the rest of the world.	94.0	108.0
201601	1793	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And this is not the first time the United States banking system has been severely exposed to foreign countries, the debt crisis of the 1980s being an obvious example in which the exposure was very large.	94.0	108.0
201601	1794	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It may be the first time that the United States financial system seems to be exposed to other countries.	94.0	108.0
201601	1795	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Starting in the morning, you get the Japanese affecting us not that much, then the Chinese in a big way, and then it moves on to Europe affecting us to a greater extent than I recall at earlier stages.	94.0	108.0
201601	1796	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s very interesting, because it isn’t all happening through the banking systems, which it used to.	94.0	108.0
201601	1797	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s happening, to a considerable extent, through equity markets and debt markets.	94.0	108.0
201601	1798	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I find that very interesting.	94.0	108.0
201601	1799	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was just thinking, as I was writing this, that it was only about nine months ago that we first decided we could refer to China being a factor in our thinking about what we ought to do.	94.0	108.0
201601	1800	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And now it’s coming in massively, and it’s a good thing that we’re following what’s going on there.	94.0	108.0
201601	1801	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The QS report ends with something that I think is very important and that we need to remember as we move ahead.	94.0	108.0
201601	1802	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think the last paragraph says that “because Treasury yields are closely related to discount rates used to value many assets and securities, sudden future increases in longer-term Treasury yields, especially if not related to faster-than-anticipated economic growth, could prompt sharp declines in the prices of many assets that appear fairly valued primarily because of the low term premiums.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1803	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I think that’s part of what’s happening in the US equity markets as well.	94.0	108.0
201601	1804	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We cut the interest rate in order to get asset values up, and we were successful—very successful.	94.0	108.0
201601	1805	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Equity markets came through the crisis beautifully.	94.0	108.0
201601	1806	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, if that all worked, then when we undo the cuts in interest rates, unless the economy has grown a lot since then, and profits are much higher, and firms are much more prosperous, and so on—which hasn’t happened—equity prices are going to go down.	94.0	108.0
201601	1807	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And in any case, the partial effect of a rise in short-term interest rates, which also affects longer-term rates, is to reduce equity prices and other asset prices.	94.0	108.0
201601	1808	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we’ll have to keep thinking about those facts.	94.0	108.0
201601	1809	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The paper asking about what the longer-term effects are, if any, of low-for-long interest rates in the advanced foreign economies doesn’t find much to worry about, or at least to comment on, except for German insurers who have given long-term guarantees of real rates that are no longer available.	94.0	108.0
201601	1810	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think there are some American insurance companies in the same position as well, but you didn’t find very much more.	94.0	108.0
201601	1811	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m kind of reflecting on the fact that we—and when I say “we,”	94.0	108.0
201601	1812	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I mean “I”—have said in many a speech, “Well, we gave them a long time to prepare.	94.0	108.0
201601	1813	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We kept warning them.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1814	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then you sort of say, “Well, what did you—or what did we, or what did I—expect them to do after we’d told them that we were going to raise the rates and they could be facing capital outflows?”	94.0	108.0
201601	1815	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, did we want them to raise rates to keep the money there?	94.0	108.0
201601	1816	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure what we wanted them to do.	94.0	108.0
201601	1817	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Some of them have gone on to use capital controls, which, if we’re interested in financial stability, we’d better not rule out if we want financial markets to not be a source of problems for us.	94.0	108.0
201601	1818	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then there are a few—Mexico is an example of one that has simply built a very robust financial system and has been, so far, able to withstand a very large devaluation in part because of its oil dependence, which is not that high.	94.0	108.0
201601	1819	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what are the lessons?	94.0	108.0
201601	1820	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we’re in a period in which we’re undergoing a shift of regime in the global economy in which we’re heading back to the 1970s and 1980s.	94.0	108.0
201601	1821	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think we’re going to be less connected.	94.0	108.0
201601	1822	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think there’s going to be less foreign lending.	94.0	108.0
201601	1823	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re doing that with the anti–money laundering.	94.0	108.0
201601	1824	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re creating problems at the level of the individual.	94.0	108.0
201601	1825	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	They may be justified problems, but we’re doing it.	94.0	108.0
201601	1826	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the big difference that China made when it was growing fast, at least in terms of the way I thought of this, is we thought for 40 years or so that the terms of trade would be turning against raw material producers, natural resource producers, forever.	94.0	108.0
201601	1827	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Australia was quite used to that assumption.	94.0	108.0
201601	1828	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Then all of a sudden China came along and started buying iron, copper, everything, and all of the prices of commodities started rising.	94.0	108.0
201601	1829	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then everybody thought, happy days are here again, and there were massive investments taking place.	94.0	108.0
201601	1830	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And now, unless I’m mistaken, unless India, which is less globally integrated than China decided to become, replaces it—which is possible, but I don’t think will happen—we’re going to have to get used to a different behavior of that fundamental relationship—namely, the terms of trade between the industrialized world and the developing world.	94.0	108.0
201601	1831	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And that will have some implications for financial relationships and may have some implications for financial stability.	94.0	108.0
201601	1832	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So what do we have to do?	94.0	108.0
201601	1833	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think, two things.	94.0	108.0
201601	1834	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We have to remember that we don’t have a lot of financial stability tools, and that we’ve got to do this primarily, as Dan keeps emphasizing, I think, through strengthening the structure of our financial system more than through the use of macroprudential tools, which other countries may have more of.	94.0	108.0
201601	1835	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And the other thing that I think we have to remember, having watched what has happened in the short period since concerns about China started increasing, is the Warren Buffett warning, “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who is swimming naked.”	94.0	108.0
201601	1836	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You don’t see it until the crisis actually comes.	94.0	108.0
201601	1837	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You think about it and you worry about it, but you don’t actually know when it’s going to come.	94.0	108.0
201601	1838	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And then, bang, it shows up.	94.0	108.0
201601	1839	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I like both of these papers, and I think they’re very useful warnings to us, particularly the second one.	94.0	108.0
201601	1840	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	94.0	108.0
201601	1841	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	94.0	65.0
201601	1842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	94.0	65.0
201601	1843	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201601	1844	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will be brief, in view of the number of topics we are discussing at this meeting.	94.0	90.0
201601	1845	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The QS report notes that commercial real estate prices continued to rise through Q3, as shown in chart 1-10.	94.0	90.0
201601	1846	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This continued upward trend in commercial real estate prices, driven by low interest rates and declining vacancy rates, is a scenario we ran in the tabletop exercise.	94.0	90.0
201601	1847	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this trend continues through year-end, rather than simply being a tabletop scenario, we will be looking at a possible commercial real estate bubble in real time.	94.0	90.0
201601	1848	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would seem to be the appropriate time to signal even more forcefully our concerns, through guidance, stress tests, and speeches, that supervisory tools are not sufficient.	94.0	90.0
201601	1849	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I may be inclined to use monetary policy tools, perhaps raising the funds rate more rapidly than otherwise would be the case, even though I view that as a second-best solution.	94.0	90.0
201601	1850	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	90.0
201601	1851	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	94.0	65.0
201601	1852	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	94.0	65.0
201601	1853	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	110.0
201601	1854	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I just have two comments, briefly.	94.0	110.0
201601	1855	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	First of all, I just want to emphasize—and we’ve been talking about this—that the composition of the S&P 500 is today very different than that of the underlying US economy.	94.0	110.0
201601	1856	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Approximately 50 percent–plus of the S&P 500 are goods-producing companies, in terms of their profitability, and 40 percent–plus of S&P 500 earnings originate outside the United States.	94.0	110.0
201601	1857	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This goods- producing exposure explains why the oil decline last year was enough to cause a decline in S&P earnings last year.	94.0	110.0
201601	1858	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And S&P earnings this year, despite this oil wane, are expected to be $115 to $120.	94.0	110.0
201601	1859	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If you take a 16-times multiple of that, you would get to $1,840 to $1,920 on the S&P.	94.0	110.0
201601	1860	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And 16, in my career, and if you go through history, is a relatively full multiple.	94.0	110.0
201601	1861	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s sort of in the range.	94.0	110.0
201601	1862	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And so, right now, we are at 1,870, which is right in the middle of 1,840 to 1,920.	94.0	110.0
201601	1863	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think one of the parts of normalization is that the market is likely to find reasons to get to a more normal level of P/E.	94.0	110.0
201601	1864	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t think that is a bad thing, and I think that is part of this process.	94.0	110.0
201601	1865	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It does not necessarily mean that the underlying US economy is slowing.	94.0	110.0
201601	1866	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It may turn out to mean that, but it says a lot more about the non–US economy than it does about the US economy, as the composition of the S&P is so dramatically different.	94.0	110.0
201601	1867	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That has been increasing during our lifetimes, and people are used to thinking about it in the old way.	94.0	110.0
201601	1868	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The only other comment I’d make, and I have talked to Nellie about this, is on this issue of high-yield ownership in mutual fund form.	94.0	110.0
201601	1869	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know Nellie is working on this.	94.0	110.0
201601	1870	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think there is a natural mismatch between high-yield bonds, which by their nature trade these days very infrequently but are held in mutual fund form at a size that offer daily redemptions.	94.0	110.0
201601	1871	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Third Avenue was indicative of it.	94.0	110.0
201601	1872	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My fear would be, and we will talk about this later, that if oil did get down to $15 per barrel—which I think is not unreasonable—and high-yield spreads widen more, some of these reforms, such as swing pricing, may not really be sufficient to deal with the run that could occur.	94.0	110.0
201601	1873	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know this would require a change in law, but I hope we keep talking about the idea.	94.0	110.0
201601	1874	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If mutual funds are going to hold, in size, relatively illiquid assets—that is, if these assetscannot trade in size—I would love to see us revisit whether they should go to quarterly liquidity or longer or have the ability to gate put into their provisions.	94.0	110.0
201601	1875	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I do believe someday we’re going to make these changes.	94.0	110.0
201601	1876	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would prefer that a blowup did not cause us to make these reforms.	94.0	110.0
201601	1877	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I know we have limited, not complete power in this, but I would hope we keep raising it.	94.0	110.0
201601	1878	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	94.0	65.0
201601	1879	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	94.0	103.0
201601	1880	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I just wanted to make a brief comment about the low-for-long paper, which I found helpful.	94.0	103.0
201601	1881	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I take the conclusions that there are no immediate or near-term problems regarding financial stability as some comfort.	94.0	103.0
201601	1882	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	But also, in connection with President Rosengren’s point:  When I look at things like CRE, I think that we’ll have to continue to watch the implications of our policy for various asset classes for fiscal policy effects and other macroeconomic effects over the long term to see how those are being affected.	94.0	103.0
201601	1883	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I wanted to make one specific point, as it relates to the effect of low rates on bank net interest margins.	94.0	103.0
201601	1884	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would add to that that the flattening of the yield curve—which has come from our policies, in conjunction with forward guidance that kept expectations of policy rates low— has played a role in compressing those margins for banks.	94.0	103.0
201601	1885	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	And I would point to some research by my staff that suggests that the flatter yield curve is actually more consequential than the level of short-term rates in affecting, particularly, community banks, and that, as we begin to normalize short-term rates, unless the yield curve moves, that could actually worsen their net interest margin position.	94.0	103.0
201601	1886	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	94.0	65.0
201601	1887	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard, did you want to comment?	94.0	65.0
201601	1888	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No comment indicated]	94.0	65.0
201601	1889	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	94.0	65.0
201601	1890	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If there are no further comments on financial stability, I think we’re ready to begin our economic go-round.	13.0	65.0
201601	1891	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hope we will be able to finish this before we break for the day, but we’ll see.	13.0	65.0
201601	1892	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201601	1893	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201601	1894	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In San Francisco, we are preparing to host the Super Bowl—“SB50,” as all the posters say.	13.0	102.0
201601	1895	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The actual game is 45 miles away, in Santa Clara, but the big pregame party is all set for next week in the city itself.	13.0	102.0
201601	1896	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	President Williams?	13.0	94.0
201601	1897	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	13.0	102.0
201601	1898	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Are your guys in that Super Bowl?	13.0	94.0
201601	1899	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	13.0	94.0
201601	1900	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We are hosting the Super Bowl.	13.0	102.0
201601	1901	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Revenge is a dish best served cold, President Bullard.	13.0	102.0
201601	1902	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve got to read my jokes.	13.0	102.0
201601	1903	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13.0	102.0
201601	1904	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Bullard, do you have a team in your District?	13.0	97.0
201601	1905	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13.0	97.0
201601	1906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the future, we won’t be in any bets with San Francisco.	13.0	94.0
201601	1907	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, the typical comment is that he does have a team so it’s very apropos.	13.0	91.0
201601	1908	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The fenced-in party zone starts literally at the front door of the San Francisco Fed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1909	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with all the congestion and crowds, the Bank and other local employers will likely scale back to only essential operations.	13.0	102.0
201601	1910	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I expect a surge in spending from football fans in our District next week but also a drop in hours worked.	13.0	102.0
201601	1911	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the national economy is the opposite pattern:  strong employment but weak spending.	13.0	102.0
201601	1912	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I don’t think this disconnect is all that troubling.	13.0	102.0
201601	1913	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have seen it before.	13.0	102.0
201601	1914	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, this will be the eighth time over the past five years that we will have gotten negative labor productivity growth in a quarter.	13.0	102.0
201601	1915	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In all but one of the earlier cases, productivity fell because output growth turned out to be temporarily weak.	13.0	102.0
201601	1916	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	What we have seen is that relatively stronger employment data turned out to give the more accurate signal on underlying fundamentals.	13.0	102.0
201601	1917	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The strong job gains but weak GDP growth in the fourth quarter reflect a fundamentally healthy domestic economy, but it is being buffeted by developments abroad.	13.0	102.0
201601	1918	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Sectors with direct exposure to the dollar, weak foreign demand, and falling energy and commodity prices have underperformed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1919	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the sectors hardest hit, such as manufacturing, drilling and mining, and agriculture, account for less employment than they do output.	13.0	102.0
201601	1920	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In contrast, the large domestic services sector of the economy, including restaurants, health care, and professional and business services, is doing quite well.	13.0	102.0
201601	1921	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Notably, of the 2.6 million jobs added last year, 94 percent were in services.	13.0	102.0
201601	1922	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Strong domestic services demand provides a fire break or a flood bank—we need both in California—against shocks from abroad.	13.0	102.0
201601	1923	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, I continue to expect above-trend growth this year and balanced risks.	13.0	102.0
201601	1924	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Reports from my directors and other contacts confirm the view that the new hiring and low gas prices should provide ample resources to support more consumer spending.	13.0	102.0
201601	1925	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As enumerated in the Tealbook, a broad range of labor market indicators have improved significantly over the past year and are nearly unanimous in signaling that the labor market is very close to our maximum employment goal.	13.0	102.0
201601	1926	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Even labor force participation is very near its estimated trend.	13.0	102.0
201601	1927	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The one exception to the good news on labor utilization is the still-elevated level of involuntary part-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1928	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, my staff recently reaffirmed their earlier work that shows that the degree of additional slack implied by elevated involuntary part-time work is likely to be quite small.	13.0	102.0
201601	1929	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another indicator of labor market slack is wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1930	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And over the past eight years, wage behavior has been, at times, puzzling.	13.0	102.0
201601	1931	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	During the recession, aggregate wage growth didn’t fall as much as we might have expected, and then later, during the recovery, despite the considerable improvement in the labor market, wage growth has remained stubbornly low.	13.0	102.0
201601	1932	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Some recent research by my staff argues that these two puzzling episodes of contradictory wage growth in part reflect changes in the composition of the labor force that are associated with movements into and out of full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1933	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, during the Great Recession and early in the recovery, aggregate wage measures were propped up because it was predominantly low-wage workers who were let go.	13.0	102.0
201601	1934	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The employees still on the payroll generally had higher-than-average skills and wages.	13.0	102.0
201601	1935	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The shift in the mix of workers—the so-called upscaling of the labor force—boosted the average aggregate wage and had the effect of moderating the cyclical decline in nominal wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1936	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	More recently, as the labor market has strengthened, this pattern has reversed.	13.0	102.0
201601	1937	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Many workers on the sidelines of the labor force who were holding part-time positions have been moving into full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1938	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The vast majority of these new workers earn less than the typical full-time employee, so their entry—or the downscaling of the labor force, if you will— pushes down the average wage.	13.0	102.0
201601	1939	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, superimposed on these cyclical dynamics is the “silver tsunami”—that is, the retirement of the baby-boom generation.	13.0	102.0
201601	1940	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the exits from full-time employment of older, higher-paid retirees have put downward pressure on wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1941	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Further, with so many still to retire, this more secular downscaling is a headwind to higher wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1942	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is likely to continue for some time.	13.0	102.0
201601	1943	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, my staff estimates that the changes in the composition of the labor force are pushing down the rate of growth of median weekly earnings by more than 1 percentage point.	13.0	102.0
201601	1944	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other measures of nominal wage growth are also being held down by such compositional changes in the workforce.	13.0	102.0
201601	1945	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, in fact, even the ECI, which holds the composition of occupations constant, is susceptible to the same problem, because the composition of workers in these very broad job categories can shift.	13.0	102.0
201601	1946	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what’s the implication of this research?	13.0	102.0
201601	1947	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The main result is that the sluggish wage growth may be a poor indicator of labor market slack if you don’t control for the compositional effects that I just outlined.	13.0	102.0
201601	1948	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, correcting for worker composition, wages are consistent with a stronger labor market that is drawing lower-wage workers into full-time employment.	13.0	102.0
201601	1949	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And some support for this view can also be seen in the productivity data.	13.0	102.0
201601	1950	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The same compositional flows affecting wage growth also clarify why productivity growth was very strong during the recession and early recovery and why it has been so weak recently.	13.0	102.0
201601	1951	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff estimates that, from 2007 to 2010, the shift from low- to higher-skilled workers almost added 1 full percentage point per year to labor productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1952	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And these are very big effects when you think about the cyclical movements.	13.0	102.0
201601	1953	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since then, with downscaling pressures, the overall pace of shifting from low- to high-skilled workers has declined, and this contribution has been cut to only about ¼ percentage point per year.	13.0	102.0
201601	1954	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This productivity effect leaves the effect of the shift in labor composition on price inflation unclear.	13.0	102.0
201601	1955	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	To the extent that firms keep their wage bills low by hiring lower-wage workers, labor cost pressures will provide less impetus for higher price inflation.	13.0	102.0
201601	1956	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, if these lower-wage workers are less productive, then continued increases in unit labor costs may be hiding behind the lower readings that we are seeing in nominal wage growth.	13.0	102.0
201601	1957	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think this is just something that we have to be aware of when watching the wage data over this year.	13.0	102.0
201601	1958	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you very much.	13.0	102.0
201601	1959	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	1960	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	President Williams, is all of that research you talked about on your website?	13.0	97.0
201601	1961	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Not yet.	13.0	102.0
201601	1962	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a preview.	13.0	102.0
201601	1963	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	13.0	97.0
201601	1964	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But we’re happy to share it.	13.0	102.0
201601	1965	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the work on productivity, though, is previous work.	13.0	102.0
201601	1966	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	1967	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201601	1968	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201601	1969	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Since the December FOMC meeting, incoming data have significantly reduced our estimate of Q4 real GDP.	13.0	90.0
201601	1970	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Sizable declines in stock and commodity prices have also raised the possibility of slower global growth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1971	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yet in light of these data, we saw surprising strength in payroll employment in December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1972	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Which of these data portend the true underlying strength or weakness of the economy?	13.0	90.0
201601	1973	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although incoming real data have been, on balance, weaker than expected, they are not of a magnitude that one would normally expect to cause such significant asset price movements, and much of the real data reflect what are likely to be temporary phenomena:  mild weather effects on service spending and a two-quarter inventory adjustment.	13.0	90.0
201601	1974	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	While official data reports from China may overstate actual economic activity, other independent evidence indicates limited direct trade effects, which are hard to reconcile with the observed large declines in stock indexes around the globe.	13.0	90.0
201601	1975	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, the positive correlation between oil prices and stock indexes in countries that are large importers of oil and thus should benefit from lower oil prices is somewhat puzzling.	13.0	90.0
201601	1976	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, while there have been some reductions in estimates of foreign growth by many forecasters, they are relatively modest compared with asset price movements.	13.0	90.0
201601	1977	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With little fundamental economic data to explain such large asset price movements, a reasonable interpretation is to view asset price movements as a temporary exogenous net worth shock that is unlikely to have much of a permanent effect on the economy.	13.0	90.0
201601	1978	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, other than weaker near-term forecasts of data that reflect wealth effects, the Boston staff forecast has not changed materially.	13.0	90.0
201601	1979	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I do not have a good explanation for recent asset price movements, I must admit to some unease about my forecast, and, like the Tealbook, I view the downside risks to my forecast as being elevated relative to December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1980	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One source of my anxiety is whether the consumption-led economic growth over the next year will be as strong as forecast in the Tealbook or in my own forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1981	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Current estimates regarding consumption in the fourth quarter were weaker than many earlier forecasts.	13.0	90.0
201601	1982	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	And over most of the recovery to date, actual consumption has tended to come in lower than expected, particularly when considering the gains that have been experienced in both disposable income and household net worth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1983	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One possible explanation for this lower-than-expected growth in consumption is that consumers are not consuming as much of the disposable income freed up by recent declines in oil prices.	13.0	90.0
201601	1984	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, work done by the Boston staff that utilizes account-level transaction data that include every transaction from checking accounts, savings accounts, and linked credit cards for more than a half-million accounts finds that the marginal propensity to consume from the newly available real income that is generated by a gas price decline is 80 percent.	13.0	90.0
201601	1985	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similar results were found in a recent JPMorgan Chase Institute study based on data on Chase customer debit and credit cards.	13.0	90.0
201601	1986	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because the Boston model expects individuals to spend roughly 80 percent of savings from lower gas prices, this does not seem to account for the lower consumption.	13.0	90.0
201601	1987	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	An alternative explanation for the consumption shortfall is that the income gains in this recovery have disproportionately accrued to high-income individuals with a lower marginal propensity to consume.	13.0	90.0
201601	1988	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Work by the Boston Federal Reserve staff has found that a large fraction of households in middle- to lower-income deciles have current resources below recession levels, and that much of the income and wealth gains that we see in aggregate data have accrued to affluent households who tend to have a lower marginal propensity to consume.	13.0	90.0
201601	1989	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would imply less pent-up demand for consumption and may suggest that misses in consumption forecasts reflect compositional shifts in income and wealth that may be more persistent.	13.0	90.0
201601	1990	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, saving may remain high relative to aggregate disposable income and wealth.	13.0	90.0
201601	1991	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	A third explanation is that consumers are still scarred by the experience of the Great Recession and thus will maintain higher precautionary savings.	13.0	90.0
201601	1992	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This scarring may be exacerbated by recent, highly publicized declines in US and global stock prices.	13.0	90.0
201601	1993	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Anecdotally, I must say that the number of people commenting on their 401(k) plans, from the Federal Reserve lunchroom to audiences at my speeches around New England, has certainly gone up.	13.0	90.0
201601	1994	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	This scarring might indicate a greater reluctance to spend than is reflected in my current consumption forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1995	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	One piece of evidence that runs contrary to this, however, is that the most recent responses to the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers suggest little, if any, response to recent financial market developments.	13.0	90.0
201601	1996	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, the downside risks to the economic outlook in my view are higher than in December.	13.0	90.0
201601	1997	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I will be highly attentive to evidence that consumption growth may be slower than forecast.	13.0	90.0
201601	1998	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In some sense, the canary in the consumer coal mine may be whether large purchases, such as car purchases, are postponed because of the recent financial turbulence.	13.0	90.0
201601	1999	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Were the economy not to grow at potential, this would have implications for my desired path of interest rates, which I will discuss tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201601	2000	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	13.0	90.0
201601	2001	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2002	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201601	2003	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201601	2004	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The tone of conversations in recent weeks with directors and contacts in my District was subdued compared with the previous FOMC cycle.	13.0	88.0
201601	2005	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We detected a downshift in confidence.	13.0	88.0
201601	2006	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With only a few exceptions, business activity in the fourth quarter and the first weeks of January was characterized as disappointing.	13.0	88.0
201601	2007	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Retail contacts reported mixed sales over the holiday season, with many brick-and-mortar retailers reporting deep discounting, especially in apparel.	13.0	88.0
201601	2008	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Notwithstanding strong sales numbers, we heard a similar report from our large auto retailer director.	13.0	88.0
201601	2009	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This is a national-scope company.	13.0	88.0
201601	2010	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sales slowed somewhat over the fourth quarter despite being supported by heavy discounts and incentives.	13.0	88.0
201601	2011	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Our director indicated that retail auto inventories are high, and he expects auto production to scale back in 2016.	13.0	88.0
201601	2012	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	He does not anticipate a significant overall drop-off in auto sales.	13.0	88.0
201601	2013	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The exception is the luxury car segment, which he claimed is directly tied to equity market performance.	13.0	88.0
201601	2014	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Despite continuing strong sales, he offered the opinion that the domestic auto market is not likely to be a factor pushing consumer activity growth, as it has been in recent years.	13.0	88.0
201601	2015	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more upbeat reports from residential real estate contacts.	13.0	88.0
201601	2016	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	They reported increased sales and construction activity, at least compared with year-ago levels.	13.0	88.0
201601	2017	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The Friday existing home sales print exceeded our expectations and raised our tracking estimate for the fourth quarter by 0.2 percent, to 0.9 percent.	13.0	88.0
201601	2018	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	After a first few days of January characterized as “dead,” banker contacts noted that mortgage applications have picked up in recent days.	13.0	88.0
201601	2019	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Our commercial real estate contacts depicted the construction pipeline as steady.	13.0	88.0
201601	2020	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A few contacts noted a slowdown in multifamily development and some weakness in retail, but overall, we heard little concern about a change in momentum in commercial real estate.	13.0	88.0
201601	2021	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	From our energy-sector contacts, mostly in Louisiana, we heard concerns that firms in this sector are still adjusting to lower oil prices and expect further cuts in investment and employment.	13.0	88.0
201601	2022	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Although localized, we heard reports that the direct economic effects of oil prices are spawning more indirect effects.	13.0	88.0
201601	2023	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Spillover is accelerating.	13.0	88.0
201601	2024	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Likewise, we heard pessimistic sentiment about the outlook for manufacturing.	13.0	88.0
201601	2025	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Sluggish growth abroad and an appreciating dollar continue to weigh on companies with a significant export component of sales.	13.0	88.0
201601	2026	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In this round of director summaries, we picked up strong opinions that, on the basis of their experience in the fourth quarter and January to date, firms are beginning to temper their 2016 economic growth expectations.	13.0	88.0
201601	2027	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard reports of heightened caution as regards capital expenditure plans for expansion.	13.0	88.0
201601	2028	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Projects are being shelved or their timelines extended.	13.0	88.0
201601	2029	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Anecdotal feedback on labor market conditions portrayed a reasonably strong situation somewhat at odds with signals on economic activity.	13.0	88.0
201601	2030	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Business contacts continue to experience areas of labor market tightness, and tightness is spreading.	13.0	88.0
201601	2031	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Firms reported increased wage pressures in an effort to attract or keep workers.	13.0	88.0
201601	2032	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I consider it noteworthy that the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker shows the growth rate of low-skill wages to have caught up with middle- and high-skill wage growth after having lagged for most of the recovery.	13.0	88.0
201601	2033	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	With regard to the national economy, at this point, I’m pretty certain the GDP growth number for the fourth quarter of 2015 will show a meaningful slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201601	2034	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As mentioned, the Atlanta Fed’s GDP tracker for Q4 is just under 1 percent.	13.0	88.0
201601	2035	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Like our business contacts, I’m unsure whether the fourth quarter will turn out to be just a temporary dip or the onset of a more persistent period of weakness.	13.0	88.0
201601	2036	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have not adjusted my 2016 outlook from what I submitted in December.	13.0	88.0
201601	2037	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	My full-year 2016 forecast regarding economic growth is just a little higher than what’s in this meeting’s Tealbook, but at this juncture, I find it hard to reconcile broad-based indications of slowing activity with the continuing strength in jobs growth, and I have to question whether the divergent signals on growth momentum and the labor market can persist.	13.0	88.0
201601	2038	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the inflation outlook, we will likely see a short period of firming as last year’s drop in energy prices roll out of the 12-month numbers.	13.0	88.0
201601	2039	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But due to the recent drop in energy and earlier declines in commodity prices, I anticipate a 12-month headline inflation trend near zero by midyear, and I would not be surprised if core measures also reflect some of this softness.	13.0	88.0
201601	2040	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m expecting inflation readings in the near term to be pretty messy—a technical term.	13.0	88.0
201601	2041	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding inflation expectations, I’m sticking with the view that longer-term expectations remain well anchored.	13.0	88.0
201601	2042	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m influenced in this view by my Bank’s business inflation survey and my staff’s work that argues that inflation compensation can be explained by market adjustments of risk and liquidity premiums.	13.0	88.0
201601	2043	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If the first quarter produces a bounceback from the fourth and moderate economic growth continues through the year, which is my forecast, I expect to see a firming of the underlying inflation trend later in the year.	13.0	88.0
201601	2044	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But clarity could be elusive well into the year, and policy calls in March, April, and June may have to rely on forecast assumptions as opposed to outlook-confirming evidence.	13.0	88.0
201601	2045	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	All things considered, my read on the balance of risks has moved a little to the downside.	13.0	88.0
201601	2046	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Were it not for the solid labor market reports, I would have shifted my balance of risks for economic growth lower.	13.0	88.0
201601	2047	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A lot of negative factors are ganging up on my risk assessment at the moment.	13.0	88.0
201601	2048	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	On my list are fourth-quarter economic growth estimates, global financial market volatility, and the effects of falling oil prices.	13.0	88.0
201601	2049	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We will take up the matter of how to deal with all this in our statement in tomorrow’s policy round.	13.0	88.0
201601	2050	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201601	2051	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2052	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201601	2053	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2054	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District has continued to improve since December, but growth may have slowed a bit.	13.0	999.0
201601	2055	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturing activity worsened slightly, while nonmanufacturing firms continued to see modest sales growth.	13.0	999.0
201601	2056	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Bank lending continues to improve, with loan growth exceeding 10 percent, according to some of our contacts.	13.0	999.0
201601	2057	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	And commercial building has continued at a relatively high level of activity.	13.0	999.0
201601	2058	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The January Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey responses were generally weak and remained well below trend.	13.0	999.0
201601	2059	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The general activity diffusion index for January came in at minus 3.5, but this was an improvement from minus 10.2 in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2060	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The indexes for new orders and unfilled orders were also negative in January, but, again, improved compared with December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2061	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Shipments for January rebounded into positive territory, and inventories were being drawn down more rapidly than in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2062	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Taken together, these data suggest that manufacturing output is declining slightly in the region and at a less rapid pace than in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2063	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Weakness is not uniform, however.	13.0	999.0
201601	2064	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Some manufacturers are doing quite well.	13.0	999.0
201601	2065	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Driven by strength in aerospace, one metal stress-testing firm has seen sales rise by 20 percent, and area manufacturers remain upbeat.	13.0	999.0
201601	2066	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The diffusion index for future general activity remains comfortably in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201601	2067	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	However, it has been trending down since last summer.	13.0	999.0
201601	2068	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The survey’s labor market indicators suggest slightly weaker employment in January, and most firms reported no change in product prices in January.	13.0	999.0
201601	2069	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	In special questions regarding the effect of lower energy prices, over half of the firms reported this is a positive for their business, while 30 percent reported it as a negative.	13.0	999.0
201601	2070	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Firms mentioned lower costs of production as the main reason for a positive effect, while firms reporting a negative effect tied it to a decline in demand from energy production–related customers.	13.0	999.0
201601	2071	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Regarding the effect of lower energy prices on future demand, firms are evenly divided, with roughly one-third being unaffected, one-third experiencing a negative effect, and the remaining one-third being affected positively.	13.0	999.0
201601	2072	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Though the index remained positive, nonmanufacturing activity in the District appears to have slowed.	13.0	999.0
201601	2073	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey headline activity index fell from 26.7 in December to 2.9 in January.	13.0	999.0
201601	2074	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The index of expected future activity weakened, as firms saw both their prospects and the prospects for the region as worsening over the next six months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2075	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	At the same time, though, the nonmanufacturing respondents saw only a modest change in the general business activity at their own firms over the last month.	13.0	999.0
201601	2076	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	So there is a bit divergence between what firms are seeing in their own business activity and what they perceive is happening around them.	13.0	999.0
201601	2077	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The survey suggests that firms are more uncertain, obviously, about the economy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2078	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Employment in the region continues to improve, on balance, but the growth was mixed.	13.0	999.0
201601	2079	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	New Jersey and Delaware saw employment growth in November at a much faster pace than the nation as a whole.	13.0	999.0
201601	2080	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	But employment growth in Pennsylvania was flat and has been weak for the last three months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2081	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The three-state unemployment rate edged down to 5.1 percent in November from 5.2 percent in October, and so remained in line with the nation.	13.0	999.0
201601	2082	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	We are continuing to hear reports, as others are, of the difficulty of hiring skilled labor.	13.0	999.0
201601	2083	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Skilled engineers are in short supply, and one light truck service station reported having difficulty in finding skilled technicians despite offering very high yearly salaries.	13.0	999.0
201601	2084	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Keeping with Madam Chair’s request for brevity, I will skip the normal Beige Book report for the Third District and turn to my views on the national economy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2085	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The economy appears to have less momentum entering 2016 than I thought in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2086	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Nevertheless, my near-term forecast continues to be that of economic activity rebounding to a pace above 2 percent this quarter and then growing at near trend in 2016.	13.0	999.0
201601	2087	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The continued fall in oil prices and appreciating dollar will lead to further downward pressure on headline and core inflation, but survey measures of inflation expectations have remained fairly well anchored.	13.0	999.0
201601	2088	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, I remain optimistic that inflation will rebound toward our 2 percent target over the medium term.	13.0	999.0
201601	2089	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	The recent downturn in worldwide equity prices obviously is a cause for concern, but I find it difficult to extract much signal about the domestic economy from these movements, especially in light of the ongoing strength in the labor market and the generally high levels of consumer confidence.	13.0	999.0
201601	2090	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Rather than sharply deteriorating fundamentals, stock prices may be reacting to domestic, political, geopolitical, and policy uncertainty.	13.0	999.0
201601	2091	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I do see somewhat higher downside risk to my forecast, especially if asset prices continue to fall or remain depressed for a long period.	13.0	999.0
201601	2092	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	For now, though, I see these developments as likely to be transitory and the economy as strong enough to absorb them without a worrisome adverse effect.	13.0	999.0
201601	2093	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2094	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2095	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201601	2096	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201601	2097	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	As we know, since the December FOMC meeting most of the news about energy has been negative.	13.0	110.0
201601	2098	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Let me just go through the data that we accumulate at the Dallas Federal Reserve and what we hear from our contacts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2099	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We now believe the excess of supply over demand today is approximately 1.5 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2100	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is higher than we had estimated in December.	13.0	110.0
201601	2101	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Why did this happen?	13.0	110.0
201601	2102	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It turns out that the DEA and other sources probably overestimated the amount of US production cuts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2103	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And it has turned out that US production declines have been stubborn.	13.0	110.0
201601	2104	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is also clearly a time lag between cap-ex cuts and actual production declines.	13.0	110.0
201601	2105	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, there have actually been production increases in places like the Gulf of Mexico and where there are long-lived projects.	13.0	110.0
201601	2106	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, the shale industry is much more productive than it was a few years ago.	13.0	110.0
201601	2107	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is creating a greater supply–demand imbalance.	13.0	110.0
201601	2108	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, we now believe that by the end of 2016, we will still have an oversupply of approximately 300,000 barrels per day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2109	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The average oversupply per day during 2016 we now believe will be approximately 750,000 barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2110	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This won’t be linear.	13.0	110.0
201601	2111	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect that by 2017, supply and demand will get into daily balance, but you still will have the excess inventory to work off.	13.0	110.0
201601	2112	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We have now revised upward our excess inventory estimate, and we now believe that global excess inventory is approximately 400 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201601	2113	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We talked previously about the prospect of Iran coming online.	13.0	110.0
201601	2114	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That production is now factored now into these numbers because it appears that, by February, Iran’s production will in fact get into the market.	13.0	110.0
201601	2115	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Some of that, as I mentioned last time, already has.	13.0	110.0
201601	2116	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We believe their daily production is somewhere between 2.8 and 3.3 million barrels.	13.0	110.0
201601	2117	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Plus they have, in our view, 30 to 40 million barrels of inventory.	13.0	110.0
201601	2118	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One of the new issues that has now gotten into the thinking of this industry and people who trade oil is whether some lack of capacity will constrain the ability to store the commodity.	13.0	110.0
201601	2119	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	People still believe we will have enough storage capacity, but they’re starting to be concerned about it.	13.0	110.0
201601	2120	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And this is particularly the case, in view of the behavior of the forward curve.	13.0	110.0
201601	2121	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	If the forward curve is not more upwardly sloping, there’s not much incentive for people to store oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2122	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The prospect of production not going into storage, but going into the market, is further, in our view, depressing prices.	13.0	110.0
201601	2123	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still believe that, in 2016, daily demand will increase by, on average, 1.4 million barrels a day.	13.0	110.0
201601	2124	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, when we talk about Saudi Arabia, our contacts have said to us, “Saudi Arabia wanted lower prices.	13.0	110.0
201601	2125	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to hurt the shale industry in the United States.	13.0	110.0
201601	2126	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to hurt Russia.	13.0	110.0
201601	2127	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They wanted to be maybe a thorn in the side of Iran.	13.0	110.0
201601	2128	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	They did not, though, want this level of prices or this level of instability.”	13.0	110.0
201601	2129	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We were talking about the sovereign wealth funds earlier.	13.0	110.0
201601	2130	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is increasing fear in Saudi Arabia, we are hearing from our contacts, about the domestic unrest that could come from this situation.	13.0	110.0
201601	2131	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	At the Dallas Fed, we’ve talked about three basic potential scenarios for this year.	13.0	110.0
201601	2132	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	One, we could plod along, plus or minus $30 per barrel.	13.0	110.0
201601	2133	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Another scenario, which we think is distinctly possible, is, we will get down to $15.	13.0	110.0
201601	2134	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This will happen if storage becomes an issue, if the forward curve stays flat.	13.0	110.0
201601	2135	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I think people in the industry who have the ability to do so are preparing themselves for the possibility that it could get down to $15.	13.0	110.0
201601	2136	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Keep in mind that we think incremental cash costs in this industry are probably somewhere between $25 and $30 per barrel in the Permian.	13.0	110.0
201601	2137	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And in some other places like the Bakkan and Eagle Ford, cash costs, we believe, are in fact higher.	13.0	110.0
201601	2138	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So we’ve gone from worrying about capital structure in this industry to now worrying about the ability of these companies just simply to generate cash flow and viability.	13.0	110.0
201601	2139	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The other potential development—it would not surprise us, although you can’t predict this—is that we will wake up one day and see that Saudi Arabia has made an agreement with other OPEC countries to modestly cut their supply and do it proportionately.	13.0	110.0
201601	2140	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In our view, that alone could actually kick up oil prices to between $40 and $60 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201601	2141	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It could make a dramatic difference.	13.0	110.0
201601	2142	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We would not rule that possibility out at this point, in view of the potential instability that Saudi Arabia may be fearing.	13.0	110.0
201601	2143	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So that is oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2144	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, none of this is having a very positive effect on the 11th District.	13.0	110.0
201601	2145	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Manufacturing is shrinking.	13.0	110.0
201601	2146	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The service sector has been growing, but at slower rates.	13.0	110.0
201601	2147	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We now expect job growth in Texas to be approximately 1.1 percent in 2016, assuming $30 per barrel oil.	13.0	110.0
201601	2148	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is versus 3.6 percent job growth in 2014.	13.0	110.0
201601	2149	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The unemployment rate in the state is now 4.7 percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2150	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We think risks are that unemployment rate will increase from here.	13.0	110.0
201601	2151	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And, interestingly, Austin and Dallas seem to be particularly resilient in this period.	13.0	110.0
201601	2152	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston is suffering the brunt of this weakness, as well as along the border, because of the strength of the dollar.	13.0	110.0
201601	2153	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I have one last comment on the national economy.	13.0	110.0
201601	2154	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Understanding, as everyone else here does, that we have much weaker data for the fourth quarter, we are basically taking for the moment a wait-and-see attitude about our GDP forecast.	13.0	110.0
201601	2155	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We still believe, for now, that it could be 2 to 2½ percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2156	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You could still have sufficient job growth to drive down the rate of unemployment.	13.0	110.0
201601	2157	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And in terms of inflation, we will be very interested in watching the trimmed mean data, which continues to run between 1.6 and 1.7 percent.	13.0	110.0
201601	2158	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But, in particular, we will be watching the effect of China’s devaluation; the stronger dollar; and tighter economic conditions, both in terms of the wealth effects and tighter financial conditions.	13.0	110.0
201601	2159	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	And I would have to say that our forecasts for the national economy are such that the risks are to the downside.	13.0	110.0
201601	2160	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	But I think the main thing we have been talking about in Dallas is that only time will tell, and we’re just going to have to wait and see.	13.0	110.0
201601	2161	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s too soon to judge.	13.0	110.0
201601	2162	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s too soon to revise our forecasts.	13.0	110.0
201601	2163	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We may change our mind here in the next four to eight weeks.	13.0	110.0
201601	2164	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13.0	110.0
201601	2165	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2166	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201601	2167	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201601	2168	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Since our decision to begin normalizing interest rates in December, the news from the labor and output markets has continued to arrive in a familiar pattern:  a very strong labor market with disappointing real spending.	13.0	108.0
201601	2169	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That pattern, which remains difficult to explain, has been complicated by the volatility in financial markets and by the continuing decline in the price of oil.	13.0	108.0
201601	2170	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, I am somewhat more uncertain about the trajectory of real economic activity and the inflation rate than I would be if all of the data were aligned.	13.0	108.0
201601	2171	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This meeting is a time for watchful waiting to see how the uncertainties of the current situation resolve themselves over the coming months.	13.0	108.0
201601	2172	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although we should recognize that they may neither resolve themselves nor resolve themselves in a manner that reduces uncertainty about future inflation and growth.	13.0	108.0
201601	2173	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The news from the financial markets, both domestic and international, has been unsettling.	13.0	108.0
201601	2174	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	My sense is that this bout of volatility will subside as the volatility in August did and allow us to proceed more or less—probably a bit less—on the path I had predicted when filling in the December SEP, which was three increases in the federal funds rate in 2016.	13.0	108.0
201601	2175	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	However, there is more uncertainty and downside risk associated with that prediction than there was only six weeks ago.	13.0	108.0
201601	2176	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That uncertainty arises from the possibility that the current asset market instability presages deeper weakness to come.	13.0	108.0
201601	2177	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The inability so far of the Chinese authorities to clarify and communicate their exchange rate policies is one source of uncertainty—uncertainty that, in the case of China, is strengthened by concerns that economic growth may slow more sharply than the anticipated gradual decline from the vicinity of 7 percent to a somewhat lower rate over the next five years or so.	13.0	108.0
201601	2178	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And there are some foreign economies whose growth performance has been better than expected.	13.0	108.0
201601	2179	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That includes India and, to a lesser extent, some countries in the euro zone.	13.0	108.0
201601	2180	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There is another factor that has begun to receive attention, and we started talking about it in connection with the work on financial stability an hour or so ago:  the expected effect on asset prices of the beginning of the unwinding of the extremely accommodative monetary policies that central banks have put in place during the last seven to eight years.	13.0	108.0
201601	2181	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those policies were put in place in the expectation that doing so would lower interest rates and increase asset values, Tobin’s q in particular.	13.0	108.0
201601	2182	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The lower interest rates and the increase in wealth would increase both investment and consumption through intertemporal substitution and wealth effects, and thereby increase aggregate demand.	13.0	108.0
201601	2183	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the effect of the low interest rates on asset prices, especially equity prices, happened, but there was less effect on investment, in part because the housing market did not recover as rapidly as expected.	13.0	108.0
201601	2184	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Markets have reason to believe that the period of extraordinary accommodation is now beginning to end, even though we have indicated that we will raise rates at a pace that is likely to be gradual.	13.0	108.0
201601	2185	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The beginning of the slow process of normalization has increased the probability that equity prices, too, will begin to normalize, which means that the very high q will likely decline.	13.0	108.0
201601	2186	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That is a reasonable expectation, especially because the economy has not grown as fast as markets must have expected when the Great Recession began.	13.0	108.0
201601	2187	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The outlook for inflation remains a concern.	13.0	108.0
201601	2188	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I retain my belief that the basic logic of the Phillips curve will, in the medium term, assert itself.	13.0	108.0
201601	2189	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, indeed, the rate of compensation increase has moved up somewhat.	13.0	108.0
201601	2190	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But we have continued to see further decreases in inflation, resulting from the continuing fall in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the dollar.	13.0	108.0
201601	2191	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I continue to believe that the ongoing declines in oil prices and in the appreciation of the dollar are temporary, and that when they stop, we will, after a while, see actual inflation rising to our target rate of 2 percent.	13.0	108.0
201601	2192	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But the recent behavior of the price of oil and the weaknesses in many foreign economies have further delayed the beginnings of that return.	13.0	108.0
201601	2193	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This further delay in the increase in inflation, in conjunction with the increase in downside risks to both output and inflation, have increased my uncertainty about the outlook and led me to the view that the trajectory of rate increases may be flatter than I had expected in December.	13.0	108.0
201601	2194	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But there appear to be elements of herd behavior in the financial markets.	13.0	108.0
201601	2195	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Steve Kamin referred to that in his presentation.	13.0	108.0
201601	2196	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And we could see a stabilization or change in direction of those markets before the March meeting.	13.0	108.0
201601	2197	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, our views will also be informed by the rate at which employment increases.	13.0	108.0
201601	2198	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, the signal we will send by and following our decision tomorrow will be extremely important.	13.0	108.0
201601	2199	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201601	2200	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2201	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201601	2202	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	2203	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	My only two points on the economy are, I think, in agreement with what many of you have already said.	13.0	97.0
201601	2204	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	First, I agree that the baseline economic outlook hasn’t really changed much since December, though I was and remain somewhat less optimistic than the median participant on GDP growth and the degree to which inflation will turn toward the 2 percent target.	13.0	97.0
201601	2205	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Second—and here I thought I was not going to be as much in agreement, but I think the first half-dozen of you roughly agree with what I am about to say—I think that the risks are now weighted to the downside, as compared with December.	13.0	97.0
201601	2206	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	At that time, I thought they were only modestly so, but I find them now decidedly weighted to the downside.	13.0	97.0
201601	2207	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	David, Dennis, Eric, Stan, and probably a few others of you have already mentioned some of them, so I won’t rehearse them in turn.	13.0	97.0
201601	2208	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I did, though, want to emphasize one in particular.	13.0	97.0
201601	2209	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think the upside risks for the dollar and the associated downside risks facing the economy are rather greater than the Tealbook suggested and than I have heard to this point.	13.0	97.0
201601	2210	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Some of that is because of my view on developments in China, and some of it is because of where I think the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank may go and the Bank of England may not go over the course of the next several meetings.	13.0	97.0
201601	2211	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	On China, I think anybody who thinks they know what is going on there is fooling themselves right now.	13.0	97.0
201601	2212	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I was struck, when Governor Fischer and I were in Basel two weeks ago, by the divergence between those who are mostly talking to the professionals and those who would actually talk to senior political leadership, obviously not in Basel but elsewhere.	13.0	97.0
201601	2213	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	There was a pretty big divergence in the perceptions that those two groups had, which suggested that there is still an effort within China to figure out where they want to go, and that there are political impetuses or constraints overlaid on the judgments that the professionals in the People’s Bank are making on a regular basis.	13.0	97.0
201601	2214	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I want to turn away from the economy as such for a second, to talk a bit about the monitoring mechanism for the components of inflation that David Wilcox introduced.	13.0	97.0
201601	2215	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I first want to thank the staff for taking the time and effort to try to develop such a mechanism.	13.0	97.0
201601	2216	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	In December, when the Committee concluded that it had reasonable confidence that inflation would return to the 2 percent target, the SEP medians for both core and headline inflation for 2016 were 1.6 percent.	13.0	97.0
201601	2217	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Behind those projections was a narrative—to some degree explicit, to some degree implicit—about how those outcomes would be realized, such as through fading effects from energy prices, increasing effects from further reductions in the output gap, and—for some, perhaps—other factors such as the reemergence of significant increases in health-care costs.	13.0	97.0
201601	2218	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Some of us who have rather more hope than confidence that this is the path inflation will follow were particularly focused on the inclusion of language in the December statement indicating that “in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”	13.0	97.0
201601	2219	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think that this is obviously what the staff is trying to help us do.	13.0	97.0
201601	2220	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would welcome efforts by Reserve Bank staff or others to create complementary mechanisms that will, in effect, impose some discipline on the statement of reasonable confidence that was made in December—reasonable confidence, with a trajectory and a narrative behind it.	13.0	97.0
201601	2221	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think it’s important that we be testing that in real time, not necessarily because actual inflation may go up during that period.	13.0	97.0
201601	2222	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think there is every reason to believe that with the change in energy prices, even since December, that won’t happen.	13.0	97.0
201601	2223	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But as the decomposition of the core inflation rate in David’s exhibit 9 shows, there is a way in which we can question ourselves on an ongoing basis as to whether what was expected to happen is in fact in the process of happening, or whether it isn’t happening, or something else has intervened in the interim.	13.0	97.0
201601	2224	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And I think by doing that, some, like me, who were a little bit less than reasonably confident, might be made more so.	13.0	97.0
201601	2225	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Or, contrariwise, those who were reasonably confident might have some grounds for questioning those assumptions.	13.0	97.0
201601	2226	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think it is important to have this discipline.	13.0	97.0
201601	2227	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, actually, Jim, it’s one of the reasons why I do think it’s important to look at the actual inflation numbers as well as expectations.	13.0	97.0
201601	2228	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s in order to discipline the expectations, because the actuals help us test the basis on which prior expectations were formed to see if those have to be modified in the future.	13.0	97.0
201601	2229	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The staff, too, I think, can help us isolate what’s going on underneath, particularly, the core numbers, and if not provide definitive answers, at least provoke a discussion among us that will enhance that self-discipline as we try to see whether the expected path of inflation will in fact track, fall short of, or even exceed what we put forth in the December SEP.	13.0	97.0
201601	2230	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201601	2231	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2232	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201601	2233	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2234	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Since the December meeting, incoming spending and production data have been weaker than expected.	13.0	104.0
201601	2235	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The weakness was partly due to lower consumption of energy services thanks to unusually warm weather late in the year and to a negative surprise in inventory investment, both of which should prove to be transitory factors.	13.0	104.0
201601	2236	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Labor market data, on the other hand, were strong right through December, with monthly increases in payroll jobs averaging 284,000 for the fourth quarter and 220,000 for all of 2015.	13.0	104.0
201601	2237	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Wages seem to be on a path of moderate increases, with signs of gradual acceleration.	13.0	104.0
201601	2238	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the Michigan survey shows ongoing strength in consumer confidence, as do the latest Conference Board and Bloomberg surveys, suggesting that, for now, consumers view the world as more like that indicated by the labor data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2239	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Putting all of that together, the nonfinancial data suggest that one might reasonably expect the economy to continue to expand at a moderate rate, although probably lower than what was expected in December.	13.0	104.0
201601	2240	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The financial markets appear to be expressing a different view.	13.0	104.0
201601	2241	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	With the big selloff in risky assets since the December meeting, the S&P 500 is down 7 percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2242	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Credit spreads have increased further, especially for lower-quality issuers.	13.0	104.0
201601	2243	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Volatility has spiked, and oil prices are down another 20 percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2244	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The broad trade-weighted dollar is up 2½ percent.	13.0	104.0
201601	2245	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Overall, there has been a significant tightening in financial conditions estimated by credible external economists as the equivalent of three or four tightenings.	13.0	104.0
201601	2246	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	On the basis of my reading of the vast flow of commentary out there, it seems that macroeconomists generally take only modest signal from the financial market selloff so far and see increased but still relatively low chances of a significant reduction in economic growth or a recession.	13.0	104.0
201601	2247	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Tealbook view—and I think the Tealbook does a great job, by the way, of assessing the downside risks to the modal view—is essentially also in that vein.	13.0	104.0
201601	2248	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It is also my view, although I hold it with fingers crossed for hope.	13.0	104.0
201601	2249	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, the financial markets are signaling elevated risk, and some financial economists point, in particular, to the big increases in credit spreads as a sign of trouble.	13.0	104.0
201601	2250	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I understand that Thomas is going to be discussing some of that work in his presentation, I take it, tomorrow morning.	13.0	104.0
201601	2251	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The intense risk focus is clearly evident in conversations with investors and in the rash of pieces by Wall Street economists asking whether a recession is coming.	13.0	104.0
201601	2252	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	That fear may or may not be justified.	13.0	104.0
201601	2253	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And even if it is not justified, the deterioration in financial conditions may itself contaminate real activity by holding back household consumption or business hiring and investment.	13.0	104.0
201601	2254	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And as I’m sure many have around the table, I’ve been trying to unpack what is really driving the financial market, because it’s not the real data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2255	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I can come up quickly with four related stories, probably all four of which are playing some kind of a role.	13.0	104.0
201601	2256	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And all of them strike me as having some basis, but, frankly, as either overdone or premature.	13.0	104.0
201601	2257	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Of course, there’s no way to know.	13.0	104.0
201601	2258	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’re not good at predicting these downturns, and we’ll have to simply wait and see.	13.0	104.0
201601	2259	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The first narrative, though, is really grounded in US cyclical considerations.	13.0	104.0
201601	2260	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I think that this is the one probably gets less play than China and oil and the fourth one I’ll talk about.	13.0	104.0
201601	2261	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And it goes along the following lines.	13.0	104.0
201601	2262	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s pretty downbeat.	13.0	104.0
201601	2263	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I don’t vouch for all of this, I’m just reporting it.	13.0	104.0
201601	2264	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The manufacturing sector is barely growing, thanks to the strong dollar and lower oil prices.	13.0	104.0
201601	2265	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The service sector is growing but has to carry an awful lot of weight with little help.	13.0	104.0
201601	2266	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The corporate profits cycle has turned, and they have begun to decline from their peak.	13.0	104.0
201601	2267	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	After years of cost-cutting and meager investment, US businesses have squeezed their income statements to the limit, and to continue to drive earnings, they will have to start doing more with their balance sheets.	13.0	104.0
201601	2268	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The credit cycle has also turned, for now.	13.0	104.0
201601	2269	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Spreads have blown out, and banks are tightening credit standards for C&I and CRE loans.	13.0	104.0
201601	2270	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The flow of newly issued leverage loans has dried up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2271	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And against that background, asset prices have had support from years of accommodative monetary policy and have been ripe for a correction.	13.0	104.0
201601	2272	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Meanwhile, global economic growth is even weaker than our own, which will hurt us through our stronger dollar.	13.0	104.0
201601	2273	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I said it was downbeat—very downbeat.	13.0	104.0
201601	2274	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And if you take all of that together, that does amount to a credible set of factors that could weigh on economic growth through credit availability, wealth reduction, and a stronger dollar, not to mention general risk aversion.	13.0	104.0
201601	2275	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It’s a plausible, if premature, story for a weakening economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2276	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We don’t yet see it in the labor market data or the real data.	13.0	104.0
201601	2277	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And I also know that if you look at the factor models or the leading indicator models, they don’t actually prove this up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2278	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But the persistence of these factors means that, over time, they could well prove it up.	13.0	104.0
201601	2279	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ve talked about the second and third narratives, China and oil, a lot already.	13.0	104.0
201601	2280	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The China story concerns the risk of a hard landing, a substantial devaluation of the renminbi, or both.	13.0	104.0
201601	2281	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Markets are also unnerved by the apparent clumsiness since last summer on the part of typically sure-handed Chinese economic officials.	13.0	104.0
201601	2282	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And overall leverage in the Chinese economy increased very rapidly after the crisis to quite high levels, which is a story that doesn’t tend to end well.	13.0	104.0
201601	2283	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Yet, as Steve pointed out, incoming economic data from China show no sign of unexpected weakness.	13.0	104.0
201601	2284	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	There is no doubt that China faces a difficult transition, but it may be that China can manage through this.	13.0	104.0
201601	2285	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The oil story is that low oil prices, driven by weak demand and a supply glut, will undermine US activity either through financial contagion or by reducing activity in the oil patch.	13.0	104.0
201601	2286	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The domestic financial contagion story is real, but I am not sure how substantial it is.	13.0	104.0
201601	2287	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The debt issued by energy firms is not now held principally by large, systemically important financial institutions, but rather by mutual funds and other asset managers.	13.0	104.0
201601	2288	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And we haven’t seen difficulties there.	13.0	104.0
201601	2289	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I do take President Kaplan’s point that we haven’t run the test with $15 oil.	13.0	104.0
201601	2290	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And it may be that credit spreads on high-yield bonds for oil and $15 per barrel oil could produce run characteristics and damage the economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2291	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We haven’t seen that yet.	13.0	104.0
201601	2292	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	There’s also the possibility, as outlined in the “China-Driven Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies” alternative scenario, that lower oil prices could really put commodity- exporting emerging market countries in serious trouble.	13.0	104.0
201601	2293	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	And we would certainly feel that kind of a crisis.	13.0	104.0
201601	2294	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	But without such an event, it’s worth remembering, I think, that low oil prices should be a net benefit for our economy.	13.0	104.0
201601	2295	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We are a very large oil importer.	13.0	104.0
201601	2296	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The pain may be front-end- loaded through declining drilling investment and weaker oil patch employment, but the overall proposition that oil prices benefit the US economy still seems to be right to me.	13.0	104.0
201601	2297	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	A fourth and final factor may also be playing a role, and that is that—someone referred to it over here earlier—central banks have changed their posture and may no longer be standing in such a supportive way, relative to asset markets.	13.0	104.0
201601	2298	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So there’s a reasonable possibility that all of these bad narratives may linger in the financial markets and weigh on economic activity.	13.0	104.0
201601	2299	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	We’ll just have to wait and see.	13.0	104.0
201601	2300	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Two final comments, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2301	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	First, on inflation, the stronger dollar and lower oil prices will mean that these negative effects will linger even longer, which will allow further patience on the Committee’s part.	13.0	104.0
201601	2302	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The underlying story of inflation returning to 2 percent in the medium term is still credible to me, assuming that economic growth continues above trend and the labor market continues to tighten.	13.0	104.0
201601	2303	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Second, and finally, it does seem to me that the balance of risks has probably shifted to the downside; at the same time, it also seems to me premature to embrace that conclusion fully in our statement.	13.0	104.0
201601	2304	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201601	2305	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201601	2306	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2307	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201601	2308	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201601	2309	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The intermeeting period has seen an intensification of global crosscurrents, with volatility spilling over into our financial markets.	13.0	107.0
201601	2310	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The associated financial tightening poses downside risks to domestic activity, which so far has remained resilient, and to inflation, which was already soft and coming in persistently under target.	13.0	107.0
201601	2311	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I believe the underlying drivers of these crosscurrents are likely to be with us for some time.	13.0	107.0
201601	2312	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on our labor market and aggregate spending have been mixed, with the employment data suggesting a pickup in momentum, while the spending data point to a softening.	13.0	107.0
201601	2313	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The underlying trajectory of activity likely lies somewhere between these two signals.	13.0	107.0
201601	2314	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	However, looking beyond the near term, the global environment is likely to continue weighing on activity and inflation and presents an important downside risk.	13.0	107.0
201601	2315	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Global growth remains subdued, with many advanced economies facing strong disinflationary forces, and many emerging economies suffering from the combined effects of the drop in commodity prices together with weaker demand from China.	13.0	107.0
201601	2316	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This implies downward pressure on US inflation throughout the year, threatening progress on our inflation target.	13.0	107.0
201601	2317	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me take each facet in turn.	13.0	107.0
201601	2318	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The December labor market report showed strong job gains at the end of last year and a continued take-up in labor market slack.	13.0	107.0
201601	2319	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Although the unemployment rate was flat, labor force participation moved up.	13.0	107.0
201601	2320	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, despite changing little in December, average hourly earnings rose 2½ percent over the year, somewhat faster than the average pace thus far over the recovery.	13.0	107.0
201601	2321	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While fourth-quarter job growth seems somewhat outsized when judged against the underlying trend, the opposite could be said of aggregate spending, with indicators currently suggesting a fourth-quarter annualized increase in GDP of only ½ percentage point.	13.0	107.0
201601	2322	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of this weakness, such as further moderation in the pace of inventory accumulation, seems unlikely to persist.	13.0	107.0
201601	2323	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the recent weakening in some of the indicators of consumer spending, such as retail sales, seem out of sync with the support to consumer spending from job gains, real income growth, and elevated sentiment, although this might be slightly damped by the nearly 10 percent fall in equity prices since our last meeting.	13.0	107.0
201601	2324	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Overall, I wouldn’t expect spending growth to rebound to more than a moderate pace.	13.0	107.0
201601	2325	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While the housing sector looks likely to continue its gradual recovery and government purchases will offer a small additional boost, the global environment continues to weigh on aggregate activity.	13.0	107.0
201601	2326	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	From the summer of 2014 to December, the real dollar increased 17 percent, and nominal changes in the dollar since then suggest another 3 percent real appreciation on top of that.	13.0	107.0
201601	2327	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, net exports likely subtracted a little over ½ percentage point from GDP growth last year, and econometric models, such as the one used by the staff, suggest net exports will subtract a further 1 percentage point this year.	13.0	107.0
201601	2328	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	A higher dollar, along with lower energy prices, have also restrained manufacturing output, which looks to be close to flat in the fourth quarter, and business investment, for which indicators suggest only tepid gains heading into this year.	13.0	107.0
201601	2329	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It has been assumed that falling oil prices would contribute on net to aggregate demand, offsetting the drag arising from the behavior of the dollar.	13.0	107.0
201601	2330	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But thus far, the offsetting contribution is hard to discern.	13.0	107.0
201601	2331	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Declines in drilling and mining investment have been sizable, while the consumption response, as others have noted, has been somewhat smaller than it has historically been.	13.0	107.0
201601	2332	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, although real income looks to have increased nearly 4 percent last year, the gain in consumption appears to have been considerably smaller and the saving rate appears to have increased by close to 1 percentage point.	13.0	107.0
201601	2333	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Also notable has been the accompanying tightening in financial conditions.	13.0	107.0
201601	2334	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The size of the decline in oil prices, together with the large footprint of the domestic oil industry since the shale oil boom, may be leading to greater strains in corporate bond markets than historical data would have suggested.	13.0	107.0
201601	2335	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Many energy companies have experienced significant financial distress, and the associated pullback from risk appears to be spilling over more broadly.	13.0	107.0
201601	2336	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It is also noteworthy that the recent oil price decline has negatively affected important commodity-producing countries, including our two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico, who account for nearly 40 percent of our exports.	13.0	107.0
201601	2337	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Anemic foreign demand is an important underlying driver of both the succession of downward movements in oil prices and upward movements in the exchange rate.	13.0	107.0
201601	2338	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	This weakness has been widespread, affecting important advanced foreign economies and emerging economies.	13.0	107.0
201601	2339	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In assessing the risks associated with this weakness, it’s important to note that the weakening in foreign growth, the decline in commodity prices, and the strengthening of the dollar have been considerably greater and more persistent than most observers expected.	13.0	107.0
201601	2340	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While there is good reason to look through truly transitory moves in oil prices and the dollar, the exchange rate in fact has strengthened in each of the six quarters since mid-2014, for a cumulative increase of nearly 20 percent in real effective terms.	13.0	107.0
201601	2341	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And oil prices have dropped in five of those six quarters for a greater cumulative decline.	13.0	107.0
201601	2342	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Just as the futures price of crude oil two to three years out has been subject to persistent, repeated markdowns over the past year and a half, so too the projected peak in the dollar has been repeatedly marked up.	13.0	107.0
201601	2343	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The IMF’s most recent downgrade of the outlook for global growth is only the latest in a string of downgrades going back to early 2014.	13.0	107.0
201601	2344	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the global adjustment to the economic transition in China is likely to be with us for some time.	13.0	107.0
201601	2345	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think many people are struggling with how it is possible for China to both be hitting its domestic growth and employment targets and still see such large negative spillovers into the rest of the world economy.	13.0	107.0
201601	2346	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Structural transformation indeed appears to be under way in China, with indicators suggesting that consumption and services are indeed accounting for increasing shares of economic growth.	13.0	107.0
201601	2347	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But even if China successfully rebalances, without a sharp slowing in its domestic employment and growth, the implications of this transition away from trade- and investment-intensive activities could be quite sobering for many of its trade partners.	13.0	107.0
201601	2348	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China’s massive investment has accounted for nearly one-third of global investment over the past three years, which in turn has absorbed about one-half of global consumption in metals, from iron ore to aluminum to copper to nickel.	13.0	107.0
201601	2349	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Even with its recent slowing, China still accounts for nearly 40 percent of global growth.	13.0	107.0
201601	2350	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	With imports down 14 percent last year and investment needing to contract significantly further as a share of GDP, the change in the pattern of China’s growth is being painfully felt in countries from Australia to Brazil.	13.0	107.0
201601	2351	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, the accumulated financial-sector imbalances pose downside risks, as we have seen with the sharp movements in China’s equity markets.	13.0	107.0
201601	2352	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Little clarity remains about China’s intentions with regard to its exchange rate mechanism.	13.0	107.0
201601	2353	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If anything, recent policy moves have added to confusion and volatility.	13.0	107.0
201601	2354	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Since China’s senior leadership affirmed their commitment to the basic stability of the RMB in the fall, the currency has depreciated materially further both against the dollar and against their preferred basket.	13.0	107.0
201601	2355	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China’s exchange rate regime shift is a marked contrast to China’s strategy in previous episodes of financial crisis in which China strengthened its commitment to a peg in order to foster stability.	13.0	107.0
201601	2356	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	So it should be no surprise that market participants are on high alert.	13.0	107.0
201601	2357	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	While there are good reasons to expect China’s policymakers have the will and the capacity to avoid adverse tail scenarios to their domestic activity, nonetheless, the complexity of the challenges they face, together with their relative inexperience in managing financial market volatility that has global repercussions, should lead us to put some weight on recurring bouts of volatility rather than viewing the two episodes we have seen as one-offs.	13.0	107.0
201601	2358	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, I think it is appropriate to recognize global challenges as a prominent downside risk to both our inflation and employment goals.	13.0	107.0
201601	2359	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	At the current juncture, the threat to our inflation goal seems particularly prominent, as the most recent data suggest inflation will continue to be well short of our 2 percent target through the near term; that we have continually revised down our projections for core inflation; and that, although the staff and Committee members continue to have inflation eventually moving back to 2 percent, the timing regarding when we get there keeps being delayed.	13.0	107.0
201601	2360	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Persistently low inflation, of course, is a concern not only here but also in many other advanced economies.	13.0	107.0
201601	2361	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, market-based measures of inflation expectations, both here and abroad, have slipped further, recently touching historic lows.	13.0	107.0
201601	2362	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The persistence and global nature of the forces holding down inflation have important implications for the risks surrounding our inflation forecasts and for monetary policy, a subject to which we turn tomorrow.	13.0	107.0
201601	2363	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	13.0	107.0
201601	2364	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2365	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201601	2366	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201601	2367	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think I’m number 10, and I’m beginning to feel the pain that some of the Governors have talked about before, listening to so many people.	13.0	91.0
201601	2368	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	[Laughter]	13.0	91.0
201601	2369	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Much has been said already, but still, I’ll try to spice it up and be nimble.	13.0	91.0
201601	2370	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In spite of the strong labor market data that we received, I continued to hear mostly downbeat assessments from my business contacts.	13.0	91.0
201601	2371	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Also, the incoming data on spending have been disappointing.	13.0	91.0
201601	2372	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	My view is that GDP growth for the fourth quarter will come in close to the Tealbook’s meager projection of ½ percent, and financial market developments will add some further restraint to the economy.	13.0	91.0
201601	2373	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These crosscurrents increase uncertainty over the outlooks for economic growth and inflation, and they make me nervous.	13.0	91.0
201601	2374	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, I think it would be a mistake to overreact today to the softer spending data and financial volatility.	13.0	91.0
201601	2375	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	After all, last August and September, we found ourselves facing volatile financial markets and a disappointing slowing in job growth.	13.0	91.0
201601	2376	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We responded with a well-timed pause in our policy plans and monitored how the uncertainty would play out.	13.0	91.0
201601	2377	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Financial markets soon settled down, and the labor market improved markedly, giving the Committee the confidence necessary to take our first move toward normalization.	13.0	91.0
201601	2378	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I see us in a similar situation today.	13.0	91.0
201601	2379	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	While uncertainty and the downside risks have risen in recent weeks, in my opinion, there’s not enough evidence yet to adjust the basic contours of the outlook, although I admit that December’s forecast does now seem a bit optimistic in light of intermeeting developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2380	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	With this as background, it’s not surprising that I heard a mixture of views from my business contacts and directors.	13.0	91.0
201601	2381	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Along the same lines as President Lockhart’s comments, manufacturers with significant international exposures continue to face a very tough business environment.	13.0	91.0
201601	2382	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Some are talking about a recession in manufacturing, notably those in steel and heavy machinery, and they see little relief in sight.	13.0	91.0
201601	2383	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, the attendees at our December 30 manufacturing roundtable were somewhat more optimistic.	13.0	91.0
201601	2384	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	While they acknowledged that late 2015 was dismal, most were hopeful and expecting growth to pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.	13.0	91.0
201601	2385	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They and other contacts pointed to domestic strength in autos, aerospace, consumer- facing product markets, and labor markets in general.	13.0	91.0
201601	2386	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In light of these mixed views, I think we will just have to wait and see how it all plays out.	13.0	91.0
201601	2387	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But the international headwinds are strong.	13.0	91.0
201601	2388	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Even if the dollar stabilizes, as Governor Brainard was touching on, the trade-weighted dollar has risen 25 percent since the summer of 2014, and that’s a heavy lift for tradable goods sectors.	13.0	91.0
201601	2389	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	One thing that seems clear is that financial conditions have tightened.	13.0	91.0
201601	2390	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Both Discover Financial and Ford said it has become more difficult to sell asset-backed securities.	13.0	91.0
201601	2391	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Financing is still available, but spreads are higher and market volatility makes the timing of deals problematic.	13.0	91.0
201601	2392	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Other contacts noted that new issuance of high-yield debt has essentially shut down.	13.0	91.0
201601	2393	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They report a similar contraction in the supply of leveraged loans.	13.0	91.0
201601	2394	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our contact at PayNet, a small business credit bureau, also noted that there was an abrupt pullback in small business lending in October and November.	13.0	91.0
201601	2395	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	He attributed this mostly to increased caution on the part of borrowers as opposed to supply-side developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2396	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The bottom line is that the credit environment has tightened by more than simply our 25 basis point move.	13.0	91.0
201601	2397	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It is unclear how these conditions will weigh on cap-ex and other spending, but it seems difficult to imagine that business confidence has been unaffected.	13.0	91.0
201601	2398	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	These developments bear watching, but if the essential intent of our renormalization is to tighten financial conditions, then I think we’re ahead of schedule—and Governor Powell’s comments regarding federal funds equivalent increases seem relevant on this point.	13.0	91.0
201601	2399	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The news on inflation also suggests caution.	13.0	91.0
201601	2400	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our December statement indicated confidence that inflation would rise to target over the medium term.	13.0	91.0
201601	2401	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our communications have also pointed to developments that we are looking for to support that confidence, and I think the staff’s inflation dashboard ought to help us get at assessing those developments, too.	13.0	91.0
201601	2402	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with Governor Tarullo’s comments there.	13.0	91.0
201601	2403	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Stabilization in energy and import prices are prominent on the list, but both oil prices and the dollar have again moved in the wrong direction.	13.0	91.0
201601	2404	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We’ve also cited anchored expectations as a key inflation support.	13.0	91.0
201601	2405	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve been uncomfortable for a while with the continued low levels of inflation breakevens, and their recent further deterioration has only made matters worse.	13.0	91.0
201601	2406	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	The most benign interpretation is that these unusually low readings can be ignored as statistical noise or market anomalies.	13.0	91.0
201601	2407	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe this is right, but other measures, such as the Michigan survey’s longer-term inflation expectations, also are near 25-year lows.	13.0	91.0
201601	2408	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To remain confident about inflation pressures being right around the corner, the Committee will have to continue to look through a lot of uncomfortable data developments.	13.0	91.0
201601	2409	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To sum up, my baseline forecast has not changed much since December, but the recent news beyond labor markets has been a sharp reminder that there continue to be large downside risks.	13.0	91.0
201601	2410	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201601	2411	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2412	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201601	2413	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201601	2414	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have been surprised during the intermeeting period by the relative weakness in US economic data other than those for labor markets, the selloff in global equity markets, and renewed declines in crude oil prices.	13.0	94.0
201601	2415	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I took some comfort that the staff forecast has not been changed substantially in response to these developments, at least as measured by Q1 real GDP growth.	13.0	94.0
201601	2416	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I thought that the staff’s explanations and expectations were reasonable, at least at this juncture.	13.0	94.0
201601	2417	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, I think it’s appropriate to watch and wait at this time to see if the seeming weakness in economic growth in the second half of 2015 persists into the first half of 2016.	13.0	94.0
201601	2418	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m also mindful of a topic that we’ve not mentioned today:  Q1 residual seasonality, which has plagued us in the last couple of years.	13.0	94.0
201601	2419	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It’s possible you get another weaker-looking quarter now on that basis.	13.0	94.0
201601	2420	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Although the Eighth District continues to grow at a moderate pace, I’ve been concerned during the intermeeting period with anecdotes from District contacts.	13.0	94.0
201601	2421	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Some companies reported substantial drop-offs in activity in December and into January.	13.0	94.0
201601	2422	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I will be very interested to see whether the activity levels for these firms recover in the weeks ahead.	13.0	94.0
201601	2423	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve heard a lot about the state of US agriculture since the first of the year.	13.0	94.0
201601	2424	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The US agricultural sector is large.	13.0	94.0
201601	2425	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It has been doing relatively well since the recession ended, a relative strong point in the economy, but many components of this sector were weaker in 2015 because of declines in many key commodity prices since the summer of 2014.	13.0	94.0
201601	2426	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In the Eighth District, the outlook for the ag sector was considered weak during the October–November 2015 timeframe.	13.0	94.0
201601	2427	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Since then, crude oil prices have renewed their decline, and many other commodity prices fell in sympathy.	13.0	94.0
201601	2428	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Since the first of the year, many Eighth District farmers and bankers are looking at the likely 2016 prices with considerable trepidation.	13.0	94.0
201601	2429	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	On the basis of the discussions I have had, I expect a particularly weak year for agribusiness income.	13.0	94.0
201601	2430	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I take this as an example of the effects of commodity price declines, which could be substantial beyond those coming directly from the renewed fall in crude oil prices.	13.0	94.0
201601	2431	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The renewed decline in crude oil prices since early November has also caused me to revisit my ideas about the state of US medium- and longer-term inflation expectations.	13.0	94.0
201601	2432	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As has been discussed here extensively, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations over the medium term have fallen around 75 basis points since the summer of 2014, when crude oil began its recent fall.	13.0	94.0
201601	2433	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have argued that TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations are useful indicators of the state of markets on this dimension.	13.0	94.0
201601	2434	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	However, the high correlation between crude oil prices and market-based inflation expectations has been a puzzle.	13.0	94.0
201601	2435	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	As President Evans was just referring to, I have argued for a wait-and-see policy on this aspect of monetary policy over the past 18 months.	13.0	94.0
201601	2436	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I thought that crude oil prices would likely stabilize and that, post- stabilization, market-based inflation expectations would return to more normal levels.	13.0	94.0
201601	2437	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But the renewed decline in crude oil prices since November 2015, which again has pulled down inflation expectations, has led me to review this assumption.	13.0	94.0
201601	2438	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I am now concerned that inflation expectations may be falling in the United States regardless of crude oil price developments, and that the Committee may have to place more emphasis on this factor than we have in the past 18 months.	13.0	94.0
201601	2439	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201601	2440	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201601	2441	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201601	2442	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201601	2443	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll abbreviate, in the interest of time, my regional comments.	13.0	81.0
201601	2444	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Conditions improved in the Fifth District.	13.0	81.0
201601	2445	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I didn’t pick up the broad, downbeat tone, but I think it’s fair to say that reports were mixed in manufacturing.	13.0	81.0
201601	2446	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Our composite manufacturing index that came out this morning was marginally positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2447	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Service- sector revenue rose to plus 10, and contacts in retail and nonretail were very positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2448	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Labor markets are strong outside West Virginia, where things are pretty weak.	13.0	81.0
201601	2449	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The employment indexes in all of our surveys were solidly positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2450	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In housing markets, the anecdotal comments were universally positive.	13.0	81.0
201601	2451	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Commercial real estate reports were upbeat, notably in DC, which has been a quite soft market for years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2452	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The belief is that the new federal appropriations are going to add to demand for office space.	13.0	81.0
201601	2453	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And in some areas, availability of skilled and unskilled construction workers is limiting construction activity.	13.0	81.0
201601	2454	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	On the national economy, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the outlook hasn’t changed much since our previous meeting.	13.0	81.0
201601	2455	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the labor market, if anything, looks better than we thought.	13.0	81.0
201601	2456	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve now reached a point at which the unemployment rate is just one-tenth above the median of SEP estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, just three- tenths above the lower bound of the range of those projections, and, of course, one-tenth below the natural rate estimated by the staff.	13.0	81.0
201601	2457	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	For me, this suggests that the extent of any underutilization of labor resources is likely to be quite limited now, and, to me, that suggests that there’s less scope for further declines in the unemployment rate from here.	13.0	81.0
201601	2458	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In addition, the labor force participation rate is now, someone remarked, within confidence bands of any plausible estimate of trend.	13.0	81.0
201601	2459	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Tealbook has it as just ¼ percentage point below trend.	13.0	81.0
201601	2460	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As demographics are going to be driving labor force participation down over time, I think we should expect little, if any, further boost to employment growth from gains to participation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2461	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	As a result, I expect monthly payroll employment growth to decline over the next couple of years toward its longer-run trend rate of less than 100,000 per month.	13.0	81.0
201601	2462	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Growth in labor productivity has been relatively low for the past several years on average.	13.0	81.0
201601	2463	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	If it was to rise, as the Tealbook forecasts, it could offset the decline in employment growth and allow real GDP to continue to grow at about its current pace.	13.0	81.0
201601	2464	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	This certainly could happen.	13.0	81.0
201601	2465	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Productivity growth is notoriously hard to forecast, but I don’t see any compelling reason why that’s more likely than a continuation of current trends.	13.0	81.0
201601	2466	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So, on the basis of all we know, I think a more reasonable expectation is that labor productivity over the medium term will grow at about the same low rate it has grown over the last few years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2467	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	A continuation of low productivity growth, together with low employment growth, implies that real GDP growth will moderate over time from its recent average of around 2¼ percent to, perhaps, around 1¾ percent.	13.0	81.0
201601	2468	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In the context of slowing GDP growth, one would expect a moderation of consumption growth relative to the high rates we’ve seen over the past two years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2469	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	On the near term, I agree with the Tealbook that we should expect a rebound from the disappointing retail sales numbers in the late fourth quarter.	13.0	81.0
201601	2470	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Beyond the near term, I wouldn’t be surprised to see consumption growth moderate somewhat.	13.0	81.0
201601	2471	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Growth in business fixed investment was slower last year, and that seems attributable in part to the effects of lower oil prices.	13.0	81.0
201601	2472	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The boom in shale oil extraction spawned by oil prices above $100 a barrel returned oil production to 1980s levels.	13.0	81.0
201601	2473	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The decline in oil prices to nearly $30 a barrel over the past year and a half has resulted in a corresponding investment bust, of course.	13.0	81.0
201601	2474	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	One should pay attention whenever spending in a significant sector declines so dramatically, but the secondary effects of this bust seem likely to remain limited because oil and gas extraction is a relatively small portion of the economy.	13.0	81.0
201601	2475	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I would note that it is far smaller than residential construction:  The peak shares of employment and investment connected to oil extraction were significantly smaller than the shares associated with residential construction at the peak of the housing boom.	13.0	81.0
201601	2476	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, significant adjustment in oil-sector employment and investment apparently has already taken place.	13.0	81.0
201601	2477	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Over the longer run, I expect that the beneficial effects of lower oil prices due to reduced costs to energy users is going to outweigh the adverse effects of reduced employment and investment spending in the energy sector.	13.0	81.0
201601	2478	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The unexpected decline in oil prices and further dollar appreciation since the previous meeting have also affected the near-term outlook for inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2479	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I interpret this the way we’ve interpreted previous oil and dollar impulses; namely, as another transitory shock to headline and core inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2480	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	It will delay somewhat our return to 2 percent inflation.	13.0	81.0
201601	2481	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Having said that, I have to admit, I’m a bit apprehensive about the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS compensation falling below 1.5 percent.	13.0	81.0
201601	2482	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s reassuring that estimates of expected inflation extracted from TIPS compensation did not seem to have fallen, but our ability to disentangle expectations from risk premiums is imperfect.	13.0	81.0
201601	2483	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Finally, it’s hard to talk about the economic situation without commenting on the recent unpleasantness in equity markets.	13.0	81.0
201601	2484	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	At a broad level, the sudden decline in equity prices seems way out of proportion with any tangible change in the outlook for economic fundamentals.	13.0	81.0
201601	2485	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I agree with others who have made that point.	13.0	81.0
201601	2486	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The equity risk premium appears to have risen, as have measures of expected volatility, suggesting that investors, as Nellie said, are placing greater weight on some adverse outcomes, either domestically or abroad.	13.0	81.0
201601	2487	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But these measures haven’t moved outside the range of values we’ve seen over the past several years.	13.0	81.0
201601	2488	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So at this point, my modal economic projection is unchanged, although I think it’s reasonable to put slightly more probability on downside scenarios.	13.0	81.0
201601	2489	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And while I’ll be watching equity market developments with great interest in the weeks ahead, I remain mindful of the risk of overreacting to financial market moves that aren’t demonstrably connected with weakening economic fundamentals.	13.0	81.0
201601	2490	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201601	2491	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2492	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, we’ll turn to President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201601	2493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And then, I think, although there are a couple of speakers left, I propose we adjourn until tomorrow.	13.0	65.0
201601	2494	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of our staff are going to have a tough time getting home—and maybe not only staff.	13.0	65.0
201601	2495	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	13.0	65.0
201601	2496	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let’s do what we can so that people can get on the road.	13.0	65.0
201601	2497	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Loretta, though, please.	13.0	65.0
201601	2498	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2499	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, sentiment among business contacts in the Fourth District turned down and indicators of activity in the energy-related and manufacturing sectors weakened further.	13.0	999.0
201601	2500	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	On the positive side, the retail and construction sectors showed improvement, and labor market indicators remained strong.	13.0	999.0
201601	2501	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions fell 18 points, from plus 2 in December to minus 16 in January, indicating some softening of business conditions.	13.0	999.0
201601	2502	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This decline was driven mainly by reports from contacts in the energy, manufacturing, and freight sectors, which have been under pressure for some time and which are expected to face continued challenges in light of continued declines in oil prices and the rising dollar.	13.0	999.0
201601	2503	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Within manufacturing, the auto sector remains a bright spot.	13.0	999.0
201601	2504	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In contrast to President Lockhart’s report, the auto producers we spoke with remain optimistic despite weaker sales in December.	13.0	999.0
201601	2505	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Our retailers are also optimistic.	13.0	999.0
201601	2506	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Their sales toward the end of the year held up well, even as national retail sales were below market expectations.	13.0	999.0
201601	2507	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	These reports, coupled with the strong labor market, suggest that outside energy and manufacturing, the District economy is likely to continue expanding modestly.	13.0	999.0
201601	2508	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, the weaker sentiment among business contacts over the intermeeting period is somewhat at odds with these signs from the labor market, which show that firms are continuing to expand hiring at a good pace.	13.0	999.0
201601	2509	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	District labor market conditions appear to be at levels consistent with full employment.	13.0	999.0
201601	2510	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s estimate of year-over-year growth in District payroll employment was 1.4 percent in November, little changed from October but up from a softer reading in September.	13.0	999.0
201601	2511	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Employment gains in 2015 were sufficient to push the District unemployment rate down below the national average to 4.7 percent in November, which is well below the minimum of 5.2 percent reached during the last expansion.	13.0	999.0
201601	2512	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Reports of tightening labor markets have spread beyond construction and skilled trades.	13.0	999.0
201601	2513	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Firms have reported they’re having difficulty filling positions in unskilled occupations, and there are rising wage pressures for entry-level employees in retail.	13.0	999.0
201601	2514	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Auto dealers noted troubles hiring qualified sales personnel as well as skilled auto technicians.	13.0	999.0
201601	2515	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Bankers reported having trouble filling not only midlevel positions, but also entry-level jobs, such as tellers and phone bank associates.	13.0	999.0
201601	2516	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	With regard to the national economy:  Economic growth stalled in the fourth quarter, pulled down by net exports and a slowdown in inventory investment.	13.0	999.0
201601	2517	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	National retail sales in December were also a bit disappointing.	13.0	999.0
201601	2518	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The question is whether this softness will last.	13.0	999.0
201601	2519	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We also had to evaluate what the recent market volatility might imply about medium-run growth.	13.0	999.0
201601	2520	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I’m not sure what’s more disheartening—listening to the financial news stations during episodes of market turbulence, to the local news stations when a blizzard is coming, or to an excerpt of Rhapsody in Blue for three hours as you try to rebook a flight during said blizzard.	13.0	999.0
201601	2521	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	[Laughter]	13.0	999.0
201601	2522	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In any case, declines in global equity markets since the beginning of the year partly reflect market participants’ reassessment of the outlook for economic growth in China and their views on how effective actions undertaken by Chinese policymakers will be in fostering growth there.	13.0	999.0
201601	2523	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As it relates to US growth, the direct trade ties between the US economy and China are low.	13.0	999.0
201601	2524	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But because many emerging economies are considerably more dependent on trade with China, the implications of developments there for the global economy need to be considered.	13.0	999.0
201601	2525	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In addition to the decline in stock prices, we’ve seen another sharp decline in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201601	2526	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In part, this reflects the same reassessment of global economic growth prospects affecting the stock market, but supply-side factors are perhaps more important.	13.0	999.0
201601	2527	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Worldwide oil inventories remain high, and oil production has not been as responsive as one might have thought, in view of the price declines seen over the past 18 months.	13.0	999.0
201601	2528	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This means that oil prices are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated, as it’s taken longer for supply to rebalance with demand.	13.0	999.0
201601	2529	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I ask myself, how should a data-dependent policymaker incorporate the recent developments in the medium-run outlook?	13.0	999.0
201601	2530	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Has there been an accumulation of enough evidence to actually materially change the medium-run outlook?	13.0	999.0
201601	2531	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And my answer is “no.”	13.0	999.0
201601	2532	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The drop in oil prices means that the US energy sector and manufacturing sectors will continue to be under pressure.	13.0	999.0
201601	2533	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	However, lower energy prices will provide an offsetting benefit for the US consumer and those in other oil-importing countries.	13.0	999.0
201601	2534	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Although there’s always a possibility that a steeper, more persistent drop in equity markets could lead to a broader and persistent pullback in risk- taking, so far we’ve not seen this.	13.0	999.0
201601	2535	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, even during some of the recent market volatility, some of my directors reported seeing an increase in risk-taking, driven by low interest rates, rather than a pullback.	13.0	999.0
201601	2536	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At this point, solid labor market indicators, including strong payroll growth, suggest to me that underlying fundamentals remain sound.	13.0	999.0
201601	2537	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	While I continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the outlook and risks to the outlook, at this point, I anticipate the US economy will likely work through the latest episode of market turbulence and the patch of weaker data and will regain its footing for moderate growth, even as the energy and manufacturing sectors remain challenged.	13.0	999.0
201601	2538	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect that economic growth this year will be sufficient to generate some further improvement in labor markets.	13.0	999.0
201601	2539	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see the risks associated with my forecasts regarding economic growth and labor markets as remaining roughly balanced.	13.0	999.0
201601	2540	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The latest round of oil price declines means headline inflation will remain lower for longer than I previously thought, but I still think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will gradually return to 2 percent over the medium run.	13.0	999.0
201601	2541	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Oil prices cannot continue to decline indefinitely, nor can the dollar continue to appreciate forever.	13.0	999.0
201601	2542	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	At some point, both will regain some stability, and the effects of previous changes on inflation will dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201601	2543	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As that happens, with inflation expectations remaining stable—that’s my read of them—and economic growth continuing, I remain reasonably confident inflation will gradually move back to 2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201601	2544	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It just may take a bit longer now, in light of the most recent decline in oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201601	2545	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This has got me thinking about our characterization of the inflation outlook.	13.0	999.0
201601	2546	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been saying the effects of the decline in energy prices are transitory, because when energy prices stabilize, the pass-through of past declines in the headline inflation dissipate.	13.0	999.0
201601	2547	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	However, we’ve now experienced a series of energy price declines, and although each decline has a transitory effect on headline inflation, the effect of the series of declines is longer lasting.	13.0	999.0
201601	2548	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If energy prices continue to fall, we’ll need to strike the word “transitory” and make other adjustments to the characterization of our inflation outlook.	13.0	999.0
201601	2549	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Lower energy prices are a downside risk to inflation in the near term but pose an upside risk in the medium run because they may spur stronger-than-expected consumer and business spending in an environment of significantly accommodative monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201601	2550	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	My reasonable confidence that inflation will gradually return to our objective over time recognizes there is and has always been large uncertainty regarding inflation forecasts.	13.0	999.0
201601	2551	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In many different models, 2 percent is within the 70 percent confidence interval of the inflation forecast for 2017.	13.0	999.0
201601	2552	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	These models include the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff’s baseline and steady-state Bayesian VAR models, the Tealbook, and several others that have been shown in the literature to perform well, including those of Stock and Watson and Faust and Wright.	13.0	999.0
201601	2553	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, the 70 percent confidence interval also includes many lower levels of inflation as well.	13.0	999.0
201601	2554	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I wish we were able to forecast inflation with more precision, but, unfortunately, the state of the science—or, perhaps I should say, the state of the art—isn’t there yet.	13.0	999.0
201601	2555	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Central bank and academic economists are working hard to improve our forecasting models.	13.0	999.0
201601	2556	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In the meantime, policymakers will have to fight against any nihilistic tendencies—here I’m really speaking about myself—and deal with the uncertainty as best we can.	13.0	999.0
201601	2557	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201601	2558	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2559	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we quit now to let people get on the road to go home.	52.0	65.0
201601	2560	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll resume at 9 am  We’ll try to be expeditious tomorrow, and we should have time to conclude our work.	52.0	65.0
201601	2561	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Safe travels, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201601	2563	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	January 27 Session .	52.0	65.0
201601	2564	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks, let’s get started.	52.0	65.0
201601	2565	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think you all have in front of you a handout called “Revised Draft Press Release regarding Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2566	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I wanted to spend a moment discussing that.	92.0	65.0
201601	2567	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the fact that President Bullard has dissented, we thought it advisable to rewrite the press release that will accompany the statement and will reflect his reasons for dissenting.	92.0	65.0
201601	2568	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So to provide some necessary context, we also made some changes from the short paragraph that was distributed to you with the memo, and I wanted to give you the opportunity to see this before it’s released later today.	92.0	65.0
201601	2569	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If you have any concerns, I would like to know about them.	92.0	65.0
201601	2570	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe you can just spend a second looking this over.	92.0	65.0
201601	2571	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It’s intended to provide a bit of context on what the Committee was doing in revising the statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	2572	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	92.0	65.0
201601	2573	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I have one.	92.0	104.0
201601	2574	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Do you want to wait a second to give people a chance to read it, or shall I launch in?	92.0	104.0
201601	2575	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Go ahead.	92.0	65.0
201601	2576	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Focusing on the last sentence, I, too, believe that “the Committee’s concern should be focused primarily on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	104.0
201601	2577	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So to say that that’s a basis for dissent is to say that that’s not what we believe this statement says.	92.0	104.0
201601	2578	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I think what President Bullard is really saying is that the statement doesn’t sufficiently point in that direction.	92.0	104.0
201601	2579	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Committee does not have a different concern than the one that’s expressed here.	92.0	104.0
201601	2580	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Do you see my point?	92.0	104.0
201601	2581	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I do see your point.	92.0	65.0
201601	2582	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The problem is that the minutes will come out and will reflect the discussion we had on that, and I think they will indicate that the view of most of the Committee is not inconsistent with President Bullard’s view.	92.0	65.0
201601	2583	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	However these are not the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2584	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	This is just a cover sheet for releasing this statement.	92.0	65.0
201601	2585	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think our view—maybe Governor Fischer, President Mester, or others want to speak about this—was that almost everything that’s in here was essentially in the previous minutes, and we vote on the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2586	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We didn’t want to get involved in writing a statement that would require a lot of editing and a vote.	92.0	65.0
201601	2587	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So we’ve just included some background but are not trying to offer a full discussion, which will later appear in the minutes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2588	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	92.0	65.0
201601	2589	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I share Governor Powell’s concern, and, as you say, there would be a three-week period in which members of the public might have a misimpression of what the other 16 members of the FOMC—at least the other 9 members plus the other participants—thought they were voting for.	92.0	97.0
201601	2590	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I wonder whether President Bullard might be amenable—it should be his language because it’s his statement—to a change in the formulation, which would at least allow people to infer that this is a difference of gradation rather than a binary issue.	92.0	97.0
201601	2591	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m just suggesting this language, and, obviously, again, it’s President Bullard’s.	92.0	97.0
201601	2592	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But if that last clause read “but believed the Committee’s language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal” or something like that, it might allow him to take his principal position while not leaving people with a false impression of where most of the rest of us are.	92.0	97.0
201601	2593	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Another possibility along those lines, if President Bullard is amenable, would be “but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2594	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I’d be open to either Governor Tarullo’s language or the language that you just gave.	92.0	94.0
201601	2595	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think insufficient focus is my main concern, and I wanted to force that point.	92.0	94.0
201601	2596	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I like the Chair’s language of “express” because, when you characterized your view, it was really about what that sentence said in terms of “were running” versus “expected.”	92.0	96.0
201601	2597	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think “express” focuses on how it’s more of a language issue than something more.	92.0	96.0
201601	2598	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would that language, then, be acceptable to you, President Bullard?	92.0	65.0
201601	2599	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It sounded acceptable.	92.0	94.0
201601	2600	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It is acceptable?	92.0	65.0
201601	2601	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	92.0	94.0
201601	2602	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure exactly what it is, but it sounded good.	92.0	94.0
201601	2603	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	92.0	94.0
201601	2604	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me read that language to you:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2605	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s perfectly acceptable to me.	92.0	94.0
201601	2606	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	92.0	65.0
201601	2607	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s fine.	92.0	102.0
201601	2608	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Loretta, are you okay with that?	92.0	65.0
201601	2609	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	92.0	999.0
201601	2610	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is everybody okay with that?	92.0	65.0
201601	2611	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92.0	108.0
201601	2612	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	92.0	81.0
201601	2613	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2614	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Did it say “should more clearly express that it is”?	92.0	81.0
201601	2615	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Is that what you said?	92.0	81.0
201601	2616	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	92.0	65.0
201601	2617	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Should it be “the Committee”?	92.0	81.0
201601	2618	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, it’s the statement.	92.0	102.0
201601	2619	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The statement.	92.0	107.0
201601	2620	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It’s about the consensus statement.	92.0	108.0
201601	2621	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	About the statement of the Committee.	92.0	102.0
201601	2622	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“The statement is primarily focused”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2623	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You mean the statement?	92.0	81.0
201601	2624	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	You could say “but believed that the statement should more clearly express.”	92.0	999.0
201601	2625	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	Yes.	92.0	999.0
201601	2626	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That “it is,” or “the Committee is”?	92.0	65.0
201601	2627	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That “it is primarily focused”?	92.0	65.0
201601	2628	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That “the Committee is primarily focused.”	92.0	999.0
201601	2629	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So maybe it should be “the Committee.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2630	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	92.0	999.0
201601	2631	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s try that again:  “the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that the Committee is primarily”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2632	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Right.	92.0	81.0
201601	2633	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	92.0	999.0
201601	2634	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	92.0	102.0
201601	2635	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	You’re starting to talk about Committee actions at that point.	92.0	91.0
201601	2636	2016-01-27	meeting	PARTICIPANTS	It’s the statement.	92.0	999.0
201601	2637	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“But believed that the statement should more clearly express that”— what?—“the Committee is primarily focused” or—	92.0	65.0
201601	2638	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	“That the Committee’s primary focus be on expected future deviations.”	92.0	88.0
201601	2639	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	92.0	102.0
201601	2640	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, could we try the passive voice, because it avoids that.	92.0	81.0
201601	2641	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	“It should more clearly express a focus on” or “a primary focus on.”	92.0	81.0
201601	2642	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Dan’s language avoided this whole mess.	92.0	104.0
201601	2643	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	92.0	102.0
201601	2644	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We were good before.	92.0	102.0
201601	2645	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	“But believed the Committee’s language is not adequately,” or maybe “the statement language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations.”	92.0	104.0
201601	2646	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	How about “sufficiently” rather than “adequately”?	92.0	96.0
201601	2647	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“That the statement language is not”—	92.0	65.0
201601	2648	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	—“sufficiently” or “adequately focused on expected”—et cetera.	92.0	104.0
201601	2649	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s his view, so Jim?	92.0	102.0
201601	2650	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yes, it’s Jim’s, in the end.	92.0	97.0
201601	2651	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, he’s characterizing the difference between how he sees it and the Committee’s so he’s in effect also characterizing the Committee’s view by saying it this way.	92.0	91.0
201601	2652	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	2653	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s try this, and this obviously requires President Bullard’s consent:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed the statement language is not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2654	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I agree with that.	92.0	94.0
201601	2655	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92.0	65.0
201601	2656	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Can I offer one thought?	92.0	999.0
201601	2657	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Could you say “the amended language,” because you’re not wanting to reopen the whole statement?	92.0	999.0
201601	2658	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	92.0	102.0
201601	2659	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s a good addition.	92.0	94.0
201601	2660	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, “the amended language.”	92.0	108.0
201601	2661	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	“But believed the amended language is not sufficiently focused.”	92.0	65.0
201601	2662	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Right.	92.0	94.0
201601	2663	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Is everybody content?	92.0	65.0
201601	2664	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Yes.	92.0	107.0
201601	2665	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, thank you.	92.0	108.0
201601	2666	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Good.	92.0	96.0
201601	2667	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	92.0	96.0
201601	2668	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92.0	65.0
201601	2669	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much, and thank you, President Bullard, for working with us on this.	92.0	65.0
201601	2670	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll now return to the economic go-round with a few speakers left, and we’re going to start with President George.	13.0	65.0
201601	2671	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201601	2672	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with weakness in commodity prices and a stronger dollar weighing on sectors like agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.	13.0	103.0
201601	2673	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	District manufacturing activity has now contracted in 9 out of the past 10 months, and prices of all major crops grown in the District are at or very near their 12-month lows and considerably below prices three years ago.	13.0	103.0
201601	2674	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Concerns at District energy companies also have risen, as oil prices fell further below breakeven levels, hedges continued to roll off, and financing to the sector tightened.	13.0	103.0
201601	2675	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In our fourth-quarter energy survey, more than 80 percent of respondents now expect a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies this year for those oil and gas companies with exceptionally high debt levels.	13.0	103.0
201601	2676	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Other than those in these sectors, District contacts remain relatively upbeat about the outlook for 2016, primarily in construction and retail, travel, and leisure.	13.0	103.0
201601	2677	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	One District contact in the nonprofit sector noted for the first time that charitable giving is up and the demand for food and shelter services has declined.	13.0	103.0
201601	2678	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is little changed since our December meeting.	13.0	103.0
201601	2679	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I expect moderate economic growth this year as temporary weakness from the fourth quarter of last year dissipates.	13.0	103.0
201601	2680	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Consumption and labor market gains continue to be the primary sources of strength in my forecast.	13.0	103.0
201601	2681	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Fundamentals remain supportive for consumption.	13.0	103.0
201601	2682	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Debt service ratios remain low, household wealth remains at high levels, saving rates are higher, gasoline prices are low, house prices are rising, and the labor market continues to improve.	13.0	103.0
201601	2683	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	However, if households pull back amid the current market volatility and other uncertainties, as highlighted yesterday in terms of downside risks, then this year would likely see only modest economic growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2684	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I note that confidence among the top third of income earners from the University of Michigan survey has been slipping for several months and is now about equal to the rising confidence of middle-income households, a somewhat unusual occurrence that likely reflects the volatility in financial markets.	13.0	103.0
201601	2685	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Still, the empirical evidence suggests to me that households make only modest adjustments to their spending in response to higher uncertainty, and that these kinds of developments don’t necessarily translate into weaker consumption growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2686	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the labor market, continued improvements seem likely to support economic growth.	13.0	103.0
201601	2687	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In December, the level of activity component of my staff’s labor market index went above its long-run average for the first time since the crisis.	13.0	103.0
201601	2688	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	While my forecast of the unemployment rate depends on continued improvement in the labor market, I expect some lower job growth numbers in the next few months, in light of how strong we assessed the release in December to be.	13.0	103.0
201601	2689	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	A number of sectors saw December job gains at or near the tops of the ranges seen over the previous 12 months, so I won’t be surprised to see payroll growth below what we’ve seen over the past few months.	13.0	103.0
201601	2690	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, I expect that the decline in oil prices and dollar effects will continue to be a headwind for inflation, a headwind that has proven to be more persistent than fleeting and appears to be affecting five-year, five-year-ahead breakevens.	13.0	103.0
201601	2691	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	While the stability of survey- based longer-term inflation expectations is reassuring, longer-term inflation expectations bear watching.	13.0	103.0
201601	2692	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201601	2693	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2694	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201601	2695	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Good morning.	13.0	111.0
201601	2696	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201601	2697	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy is growing moderately but unevenly, and employment is strong in the District overall.	13.0	111.0
201601	2698	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In the Twin Cities, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in November was 3.2 percent— pretty strong.	13.0	111.0
201601	2699	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Our business contacts continue to report difficulty finding skilled and specialized workers.	13.0	111.0
201601	2700	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	However, the strong dollar is weighing on exports of manufacturers and farmers, and low commodity prices are reducing incomes and activity in the oil, mining, and ag sectors.	13.0	111.0
201601	2701	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Let me offer two anecdotes from the region that I think the Committee may find interesting.	13.0	111.0
201601	2702	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	First of all, we have the Bakken oil field, and some of our contacts there expressed a great deal of optimism that prices are going to rebound quickly.	13.0	111.0
201601	2703	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	When pushed, there wasn’t a lot of analysis underlying that optimism.	13.0	111.0
201601	2704	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I would call it more of a hope.	13.0	111.0
201601	2705	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But it’s a good reminder that not all market participants adjust immediately when prices move in a painful direction for them.	13.0	111.0
201601	2706	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The adjustment can take time before they fully embrace it.	13.0	111.0
201601	2707	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The second anecdote I’ll offer is that I’m pleased to report that I was able to get a mortgage.	13.0	111.0
201601	2708	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	[Laughter]	13.0	111.0
201601	2709	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I went through the whole process, from soup to nuts.	13.0	111.0
201601	2710	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I was concerned when Chairman Bernanke famously was turned down for a refinance, so I thought, what hope did I have?	13.0	111.0
201601	2711	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But I’ve got to tell you something:  It is a painful process.	13.0	111.0
201601	2712	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I went through it like anybody else.	13.0	111.0
201601	2713	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The amount of documentation that I had to provide was shocking to me.	13.0	111.0
201601	2714	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So the good news is, the mortgage market is open.	13.0	111.0
201601	2715	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The good news also is, the banks are taking the new regulatory environment very seriously, but it’s not for the faint of heart.	13.0	111.0
201601	2716	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The national economic picture is similarly mixed.	13.0	111.0
201601	2717	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Concerns about China’s economic growth outlook and policy decisions and about other global risks, as we’ve noted, have destabilized financial markets.	13.0	111.0
201601	2718	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As of last night, the S&P is down, I think, 7 percent since the start of the year.	13.0	111.0
201601	2719	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Volatility has risen, credit spreads have widened considerably, and longer-run market-based measures of inflation expectations have fallen to new lows.	13.0	111.0
201601	2720	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As we discussed yesterday, financial markets can be leading indicators.	13.0	111.0
201601	2721	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We have to consider the possibility that these developments are signaling higher odds of an economic downturn, especially one that’s accompanied by low inflation.	13.0	111.0
201601	2722	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The US economy does show substantial underlying strength, especially in the labor market, so it’s far from certain that the international volatility we see is going to directly affect us.	13.0	111.0
201601	2723	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	In summary, I share the Tealbook’s baseline outlook for gradual improvement in the economy, but uncertainty has risen.	13.0	111.0
201601	2724	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	We don’t know how hard a landing China will have, we don’t know how effectively China’s policymakers will deal with that landing, and we don’t know how events in China will spill over to the United States.	13.0	111.0
201601	2725	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I feel that we must be prepared to respond to a wide range of potential outcomes, including those downside scenarios.	13.0	111.0
201601	2726	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201601	2727	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13.0	65.0
201601	2728	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201601	2729	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201601	2730	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My views have changed somewhat since the December FOMC meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2731	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While I still think the economy will grow at a slightly above-trend pace in 2016, the recent foreign and financial market developments do make me more concerned that economic growth could disappoint.	13.0	96.0
201601	2732	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, inflation seems likely to stay lower for longer, due to lower energy prices, a stronger dollar, and inflation expectations that seem less well anchored than earlier.	13.0	96.0
201601	2733	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Starting with the economic growth side of the ledger, I think we’ve had a bit more negative news than positive news since the December meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2734	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the positive side, payroll gains have been strong, and household real income remains on a sturdy trajectory.	13.0	96.0
201601	2735	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, fiscal policy is likely to provide support to the economy in 2016.	13.0	96.0
201601	2736	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But this has to be set against the softness in real GDP growth, the weakness of the factory sector, soft foreign activity, and significantly tighter financial conditions.	13.0	96.0
201601	2737	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	While my baseline view is that consumer spending will strengthen and real GDP growth will rebound this quarter as the drag due to the behavior of inventories lessens, if this doesn’t fully materialize, then I’d be concerned that we might see a significant slowing in payroll employment growth and, with it, a weakening in what’s been a very favorable trend for household real income.	13.0	96.0
201601	2738	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, the outlook has also deteriorated, in that the transitory effects of lower energy prices and non-energy imports look likely to prove more persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2739	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As many people have noted, inflation expectations obtained using survey data remain weak, and the five- by-five inflation compensation obtained from the spread between nominal Treasury yields and TIPS yields continues to decline.	13.0	96.0
201601	2740	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that said, if the rebound in economic growth does materialize, then I think inflation will gradually move up as labor market utilization continues to tighten.	13.0	96.0
201601	2741	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that the core inflation measures have been pretty stable, despite the sharp deflationary impulses we’ve seen, supports that conclusion.	13.0	96.0
201601	2742	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But it is very important that above- trend economic growth does, in fact, materialize.	13.0	96.0
201601	2743	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the sharp and abrupt tightening we’ve seen in financial market conditions is difficult to reconcile with what still seems to be a relatively good US economic outlook, we do have to recognize that there are underlying causes—the slowdown in China, the collapse in energy prices, and the pressure on many EME economies.	13.0	96.0
201601	2744	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not just animal spirits, so I wouldn’t completely dismiss it.	13.0	96.0
201601	2745	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is that the strains we’re seeing have intensified since August.	13.0	96.0
201601	2746	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, the shift in our monetary policy regime may also play a role.	13.0	96.0
201601	2747	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s a lot more uncertainty now about the path of short-term interest rates, for example.	13.0	96.0
201601	2748	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Now that we’ve lifted off, I would expect financial asset prices to be more volatile.	13.0	96.0
201601	2749	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So liftoff probably has played a role, even though some of the other factors I’ve cited seem more important to me.	13.0	96.0
201601	2750	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue for me is, will the tightening in financial market conditions prove persistent, or will it intensify further?	13.0	96.0
201601	2751	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t know the answer to that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2752	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So let me review the major financial market components and what my current thoughts are on that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2753	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The equity market has been very volatile and down more than 10 percent from its peak and about 7 percent since year-end.	13.0	96.0
201601	2754	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I view the main cause here as the lack of earnings growth due to a stronger dollar and negative foreign earnings translation effects, poor productivity growth, and a tightening labor market.	13.0	96.0
201601	2755	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The problem, to me, is not that equities are overvalued relative to bonds.	13.0	96.0
201601	2756	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Equity risk premiums are not unusually narrow.	13.0	96.0
201601	2757	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But, instead, the problem is the lack of visibility in terms of future earnings growth.	13.0	96.0
201601	2758	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Credit spreads have widened considerably.	13.0	96.0
201601	2759	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	What’s happening in the energy sector is pretty straightforward.	13.0	96.0
201601	2760	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue is what to make of the widening elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2761	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the key question is, how much of this widening just represents spillover from the energy sectors and outflows from bond mutual fund bleeding to selling pressure versus a regime shift in which the price of leverage has gone up?	13.0	96.0
201601	2762	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Leverage in the corporate sector increased in recent years as companies actively sought to lever up to boost their returns on equity and their stock prices.	13.0	96.0
201601	2763	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Companies were responding to an environment of record-low interest rates and narrow credit spreads, but now the situation may be reversing.	13.0	96.0
201601	2764	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The price of leverage may be going up, so, as a consequence, this widening in credit spreads could turn out to be persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2765	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the dollar, the outlook in the United States continues to be better than elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2766	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Chinese officials have made it clear the RMB is no longer pegged to the dollar, and I imagine that, if the RMB is allowed to weaken, this is likely to lead to currency weakness elsewhere.	13.0	96.0
201601	2767	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	President Evans and I were having a conversation at breakfast today, and I think he made a really interesting point.	13.0	96.0
201601	2768	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If things evolve in line with the Tealbook forecast—an interest rate path that’s above the market consensus—one consequence of that would probably be a dollar that’s also firmer than expected.	13.0	96.0
201601	2769	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So we need to understand that, if the interest rate path materializes as we envision it, dollar strength is probably going to continue, especially in light of the fact that Japan and Europe are continuing to add to quantitative easing rather than pulling back from that.	13.0	96.0
201601	2770	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The key issue, to me, is whether this is a temporary squall that will soon reverse or something that will prove more persistent.	13.0	96.0
201601	2771	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If the tightening in financial conditions reverses, as it did last fall, then it probably doesn’t have implications for what we’re going to do or not do at the March meeting.	13.0	96.0
201601	2772	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if it does prove persistent or intensifies further, then the case for tightening would be a lot less compelling because the tighter financial conditions would, over time, imply slower growth and lower inflation, all else being equal.	13.0	96.0
201601	2773	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201601	2774	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for a thoughtful round of comments on the incoming data, the outlook, and the associated risks.	13.0	65.0
201601	2775	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If I might, I’d like to wrap up with a few comments of my own, including some observations on the policy implications of the outlook and the uncertainties we face, anticipating our next round of discussion.	13.0	65.0
201601	2776	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the data we’ve received on spending, production, and the labor market, as many around the table commented, incoming readings on real activity have been quite mixed and almost seem to tell a tale of two economies.	13.0	65.0
201601	2777	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thus far, the labor market has been doing very well, although the move up we’ve seen in UI claims may conceivably be a harbinger of a weaker job market ahead.	13.0	65.0
201601	2778	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate has changed little in recent months but is at a level only a little higher than my estimate of its longer-run level.	13.0	65.0
201601	2779	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the recent stability reflects a welcome combination of solid gains in household employment and a pickup in labor force participation.	13.0	65.0
201601	2780	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, the employment-to-population ratio rose over the fall, even as its underlying trend continued to drift down.	13.0	65.0
201601	2781	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, average hourly earnings in December were up 2½ percent on a 12-month change basis, which is a considerable improvement from a year ago, even if the pace remains subdued.	13.0	65.0
201601	2782	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, because of the noisiness of compensation indicators, I don’t want to read too much into this pickup, but perhaps it hints that diminished labor market slack may be finally showing through to wages.	13.0	65.0
201601	2783	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, incoming data on overall real activity have been disappointing, to say the very least.	13.0	65.0
201601	2784	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Manufacturing output barely increased last quarter, and recent readings from business surveys are weak.	13.0	65.0
201601	2785	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Retail sales declined in December and were up only modestly, on net, over the fall.	13.0	65.0
201601	2786	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As for overall activity, whereas I had anticipated that real GDP would expand more or less in line with potential output in the fourth quarter, the staff now estimates that it rose at an annual rate of less than ½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2787	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For me, a particularly worrisome aspect of this near stall is the contribution of consumption, which had been one of the few sources of strength in this economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2788	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But consumer spending now appears to have risen at an annual rate of only 1½ percent last quarter, down from a 3 percent rate in the third quarter, despite strong real income gains from rising employment and falling energy prices.	13.0	65.0
201601	2789	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In trying to make sense of some of these mixed signals, I take some comfort that transitory factors explain some of the weak GDP growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2790	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	As David noted yesterday, part of the slowdown in consumer spending was a result of unusually warm weather that held down outlays on energy services, and the likely snapback in the level of that spending component this quarter should boost overall GDP growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2791	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, changes in mortgage reporting rules appear to have caused a temporary blip down in home sales and thus sales commissions last quarter.	13.0	65.0
201601	2792	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Consistent with this assessment, existing home sales rebounded strongly in December.	13.0	65.0
201601	2793	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the estimated sharp slowdown in inventory investment last quarter probably is a one-time adjustment of stocks, with no lasting implications for overall GDP growth, although, in this case, one cannot dismiss the possibility that it could signal a more persistent scaling back of firms’ production plans.	13.0	65.0
201601	2794	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For these reasons, I’m inclined to discount the recent spending and production data in judging where the economy is probably headed in the near term and rely more on the labor market indicators themselves.	13.0	65.0
201601	2795	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	De-emphasizing the GDP data also makes sense, as they’re noisy indicators, prone to substantial revisions, and, as David noted, simply just not that informative in predicting near-term labor market developments.	13.0	65.0
201601	2796	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, econometric analysis reveals that, in forecasting the current-quarter change in the unemployment rate, one can completely ignore lagged GDP growth and simply rely on last quarter’s change in the unemployment rate.	13.0	65.0
201601	2797	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I did hear comments around the table indicating that a number of you noted that your business contacts saw a slowing in economic activity toward the end of the year, and that obviously bears watching.	13.0	65.0
201601	2798	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Even if we significantly discount the relevance of the slowdown in fourth-quarter GDP to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market, we should not dismiss the implications of recent developments in financial markets and the global economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2799	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Since our December meeting, as many of you noted, the stock market is down about 7 percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2800	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Risk premiums on corporate bonds have increased notably, banks reported tightening terms and standards on C&I and CRE lending in the most recent SLOOS, and the dollar has appreciated an additional 2½ percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2801	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	According to FRB/US, the net GDP effects of the rise in the dollar, the fall in stock prices, and the movements in longer-term interest rates are roughly equivalent to an increase in the federal funds rate of at least 50 basis points, assuming that the changes in asset prices persist.	13.0	65.0
201601	2802	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Now, of course, they may not, and the imprint of lower stock market wealth on the Tealbook projection is less than it might be, because the staff projects some of the recent decline to be reversed over time.	13.0	65.0
201601	2803	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, lower oil prices and the resulting boost to real income and consumer spending provide a partial offset, although the net boost to GDP will likely be tempered by a further reduction in domestic drilling activity and slower economic growth in Canada and Mexico, two of our biggest trading partners.	13.0	65.0
201601	2804	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Beyond these conventional effects of changes in financial conditions, I also worry that a more unusual dynamic may now be at work, especially as recent market developments seem disproportionate in light of the staff’s quite small downward revision to foreign economic growth.	13.0	65.0
201601	2805	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps this pronounced jitteriness partly reflects fears that some countries and firms are near a tipping point, past which further declines in commodity prices could lead to a highly nonlinear deterioration in conditions, with quite adverse effects for the global economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2806	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, markets seem concerned that central banks may be reaching their limits in terms of the support they can provide to the economy.	13.0	65.0
201601	2807	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Whatever the underlying reason, we need to be careful that our own communications do not make the situation worse.	13.0	65.0
201601	2808	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Currently, many financial market participants appear concerned that we will respond too inertially to the evolving downside risks.	13.0	65.0
201601	2809	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In view of the fact that we raised rates in December, they may fear we’ll be insufficiently responsive to these intensifying risks and particularly resist a policy reversal, even if the incoming data are quite weak.	13.0	65.0
201601	2810	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Given our consensus on the importance of being data dependent, I don’t believe that we would actually make such mistakes.	13.0	65.0
201601	2811	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But if we aren’t careful in our public statements, we could strengthen the market’s fears on this score.	13.0	65.0
201601	2812	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we need to be particularly careful that we do not inadvertently leave the impression that we’re being overly dismissive of adverse global developments.	13.0	65.0
201601	2813	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Such a misperception could result in further dollar appreciation, increases in risk premiums, and declines in oil and other commodity prices.	13.0	65.0
201601	2814	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But, at the same time, we don’t want to make the opposite mistake of overreacting, thereby making matters worse, by conveying panic or an unduly pessimistic shift in our outlook.	13.0	65.0
201601	2815	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Achieving this balance is clearly our task today, and that is the objective of the revised version of alternative B.	13.0	65.0
201601	2816	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, the recent appreciation of the dollar and decline in oil prices also have implications for inflation.	13.0	65.0
201601	2817	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Once again, we will have to wait longer for the transitory influences of these factors to fade.	13.0	65.0
201601	2818	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	According to the current Tealbook, core inflation is now projected to remain near 1¼ percent on a 12-month change basis through the end of this year, while headline inflation is expected to remain below 1 percent.	13.0	65.0
201601	2819	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think that, in continuing to predict an eventual pickup in inflation, we risk sounding like Wonderland’s White Queen:  “The rule is, jam tomorrow and jam yesterday—but never jam today.”	13.0	65.0
201601	2820	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There are good reasons for monetary policy to look through the transitory inflation effects of price shocks, and that approach served us well from 2004 through 2008, when, year after year, unexpected increases in oil prices caused headline inflation to be persistently elevated.	13.0	65.0
201601	2821	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But there are at least two caveats.	13.0	65.0
201601	2822	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	First, shocks of this sort can have persistent contractionary effects on real activity, to which monetary policy should respond.	13.0	65.0
201601	2823	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And this is clear in the case of dollar appreciation, fueled by flight-to-safety concerns.	13.0	65.0
201601	2824	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The shock not only puts downward pressure on inflation but also restricts economic growth by reducing net exports.	13.0	65.0
201601	2825	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	While oil price declines are normally viewed as a plus for US real activity, there is a risk that the tipping point effects I mentioned earlier may have reversed the sign in present circumstances.	13.0	65.0
201601	2826	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The second caveat is that one better be sure that the transitory influences aren’t starting to have persistent effects on inflation expectations.	13.0	65.0
201601	2827	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In this regard, it does worry me that longer-run inflation expectations in the Michigan survey are now at the bottom end of their historical range, and that inflation compensation has now declined to a historically low level, well below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	65.0
201601	2828	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Developments in this area need to be closely monitored and considered, as we emphasized in our December statement.	13.0	65.0
201601	2829	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there and turn over the floor to Thomas for his policy briefing.	21.0	65.0
201601	2830	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201601	2831	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201601	2832	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Your policy decisions today center on whether economic and financial developments over the intermeeting period warrant modifying the Committee’s assessment of the medium-term economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, or both.	21.0	999.0
201601	2833	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternatives A, B, and C present essentially the same modal outlook for economic activity and the labor market but different assessments of the outlook for inflation and of the risks attending the economic outlook, along with corresponding policy choices—specifically, whether to increase the target range for the federal funds rate and whether to indicate any change in the likely future path of the policy rate.	21.0	999.0
201601	2834	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Developments over the intermeeting period apparently led market participants to see a greater likelihood that the real economy and inflation will evolve in ways that will warrant even more gradual policy normalization than investors had anticipated earlier.	21.0	999.0
201601	2835	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The federal funds rate path implied by futures shifted down noticeably, as shown in the upper-left panel.	21.0	999.0
201601	2836	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And even though the median dealer’s modal path for the funds rate did not change materially, dealers now see a higher probability of a lower target range for the federal funds rate at the end of this year, suggesting that they see greater downside risks to the economy than in December.	21.0	999.0
201601	2837	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, as shown in the upper-right panel, since December, a number of dealers have raised the odds they assign to the US economy being in recession in six months.	21.0	999.0
201601	2838	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In dealers’ written responses, financial market developments and risks to economic growth abroad, particularly in China, were the most frequently cited reasons for respondents having raised their probabilities of recession.	21.0	999.0
201601	2839	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	One key issue confronting you is whether to continue to describe the risks associated with the outlook for real activity and the labor market as balanced, as in alternative C, or whether to withhold judgment for the time being—as in the revised version of alternative B that was distributed on Monday, and that is shown in your handout—or to describe those risks as tilted somewhat to the downside, as in alternative A.	21.0	999.0
201601	2840	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels examine the downside risks to real activity from a number of perspectives.	21.0	999.0
201601	2841	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The panel on the left shows estimates of the probability that real GDP will decline this quarter and next; these results, which are also reported on page 77 of Tealbook A, are derived from several staff models and are independent of the staff baseline forecast.	21.0	999.0
201601	2842	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first three estimates continue to show very low probabilities and are little changed since the December Tealbook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2843	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	However, these particular estimates do not take into account the recent turbulence in global financial markets, because the models either condition on financial data only through the fourth quarter or largely exclude such information altogether.	21.0	999.0
201601	2844	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In contrast, the fourth estimate shown in the table, which is derived from a factor model that does incorporate information on a range of financial variables, shows not only a noticeably higher probability of a recession, but also that it has risen some since December.	21.0	999.0
201601	2845	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In an attempt to expand on the financial dimensions of this analysis, the Board staff estimated two different probit regressions, each of which attempts to calculate the probability of the US economy entering an NBER-defined recession sometime during the next six months as a function of one or more financial indicators.	21.0	999.0
201601	2846	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This is the panel that has been telegraphed beforehand.	21.0	999.0
201601	2847	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The first regression employs the excess bond premium, or EBP—a measure of the average credit spread net of default risk for the outstanding senior unsecured bonds of nonfinancial corporations.	21.0	999.0
201601	2848	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The EBP can be interpreted as an aggregate credit risk premium, and its developers, Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek, find that it is a good predictor of GDP growth.	21.0	999.0
201601	2849	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the black line in the middle-right panel, the probability of a near-term recession implied by the EBP has risen steadily since last spring and now stands at almost 70 percent.	21.0	999.0
201601	2850	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	A somewhat less alarming picture is presented by the second probit regression, which replaces the EBP with a summary statistic of a wide range of financial variables.	21.0	999.0
201601	2851	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By this measure, and as shown by the red line, the estimated probability of near-term recession has increased sharply since the turn of the year and now stands at 40 percent.	21.0	999.0
201601	2852	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, any estimate of this sort should be taken with a large block of salt:  These regressions are estimated using long time series because recessions occur infrequently.	21.0	999.0
201601	2853	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The regressions may therefore fail to pick up the evolving structure of financial markets and changing relationships between the explanatory variables and the probability of recession.	21.0	999.0
201601	2854	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally, economists’ failure to predict recessions is notorious, and, as the old saw goes—and here I’m using the old, Samuelson numbers—the stock market has predicted nine of the past five recessions.	21.0	999.0
201601	2855	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For these and other reasons, you may judge it premature to draw conclusions about the balance of risks to real activity.	21.0	999.0
201601	2856	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom two panels present information relevant to your decision about how to characterize the outlook for inflation and the risks to this outlook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2857	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	All three of the draft alternatives acknowledge that inflation is likely to remain low in the near term due in part to the drop in energy prices.	21.0	999.0
201601	2858	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	They differ in the degree of concern they express about the downside risks to the inflation outlook.	21.0	999.0
201601	2859	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The new language in alternative B stating that the Committee is closely monitoring the implications of global financial and economic developments clearly indicates concern about risks to the inflation outlook but does not suggest a change in the modal outlook that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	21.0	999.0
201601	2860	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative C states that the Committee remains reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term, while alternative A indicates that inflation will remain below 2 percent longer than previously anticipated.	21.0	999.0
201601	2861	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	A significant number of forecasters and market participants appear to have marked down their inflation projections.	21.0	999.0
201601	2862	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The exhibit in the lower left shows that the dealers have pushed out expectations for a firming in core inflation.	21.0	999.0
201601	2863	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Like the staff judgmental forecast, dealer forecasts for core inflation this year, which had stepped down during the fall, have again moved lower, likely reflecting the sharp drop in oil prices over the intermeeting period and the further appreciation of the dollar.	21.0	999.0
201601	2864	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Most dealers still see core inflation in 2017—not shown— as making more progress toward the Committee’s objective than the staff does, but a number appear to see a risk that low inflation will persist longer, perhaps along the lines of the staff baseline.	21.0	999.0
201601	2865	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Several of the staff’s statistical models also show an increase in the risk of persistently low inflation.	21.0	999.0
201601	2866	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The bottom-right panel reports the probability that the four-quarter change in total PCE inflation will be less than 1 percent four quarters from now.	21.0	999.0
201601	2867	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The probability calculated using the FRB/US model increased noteably since December, while estimates from EDO, one of the Board staff’s DSGE models, and the Bayesian VAR model are still quite low.	21.0	999.0
201601	2868	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201601	2869	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201601	2870	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	22.0	65.0
201601	2871	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions.	22.0	65.0
201601	2872	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201601	2873	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In the chart Thomas presented with the probabilities on the excess bond premium, it looks like there were a couple of spikes in 2002 and 2004.	22.0	91.0
201601	2874	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think the 2002 is probably Enron, WorldCom, and all of that, but what about 2004?	22.0	91.0
201601	2875	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It gets up to about 40 percent.	22.0	91.0
201601	2876	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, I think the salient point is, of course, that these are somewhat noisy indicators of recessions, so there are false positives in here as well.	22.0	999.0
201601	2877	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The excess bond premium is constructed from literally a very large universe of outstanding corporate bonds, so there may be particular factors like corporate governance scandals.	22.0	999.0
201601	2878	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	More recently, you may wonder what role, for example, energy firms are playing in driving that particular variable, and that was the intention of then moving to the red line.	22.0	999.0
201601	2879	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, the red line, too, gives you some movement, as you point out, especially in late 2002.	22.0	999.0
201601	2880	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	If I recall correctly, that period actually wasn’t an NBER recession but saw substantial financial stresses in many areas.	22.0	999.0
201601	2881	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It’s clear that when you base this indicator on financial variables, you may get a false positive.	22.0	999.0
201601	2882	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But nobody remembers the headline in 2004 that is likely responsible for that little spike?	22.0	91.0
201601	2883	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The increase in rates?	22.0	81.0
201601	2884	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, it could be.	22.0	91.0
201601	2885	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s too early for the conundrum to have 10-year rates drop out.	22.0	91.0
201601	2886	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	22.0	91.0
201601	2887	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Sorry.	22.0	91.0
201601	2888	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, I would be surprised.	22.0	999.0
201601	2889	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, this thing is constructed on the basis of the expected excess returns on holding corporate bonds over Treasury securities.	22.0	999.0
201601	2890	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So I don’t know whether they responded very strongly to the tightening.	22.0	999.0
201601	2891	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201601	2892	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201601	2893	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to understand your presentation.	22.0	94.0
201601	2894	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	In this panel on the middle left, “Probability of Recession in 2016:H1,” what I’m understanding is that the Tealbook says 1 percent, and then these other charts, though, are six months ahead.	22.0	94.0
201601	2895	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So you’re talking about the second half of 2016.	22.0	94.0
201601	2896	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	No.	22.0	999.0
201601	2897	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The calculations on the right are the probability of being in recession either already now or within the next six months.	22.0	999.0
201601	2898	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Does that mean the recession would begin then?	22.0	94.0
201601	2899	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22.0	999.0
201601	2900	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So it could begin in July, and then that would be okay, according to the model?	22.0	94.0
201601	2901	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes.	22.0	999.0
201601	2902	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I have to confess that I’m not quite sure whether we picked the window of January to June or February to July, but it was one of the two.	22.0	999.0
201601	2903	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But if, say, you were thinking a recession might begin later in the year, in the late fall or something like that, it would not be captured in these regressions.	22.0	999.0
201601	2904	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	They ask about now or in the next six months.	22.0	999.0
201601	2905	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So these three charts, the recession probability charts, are meant to be comparable.	22.0	94.0
201601	2907	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	As much as possible.	22.0	999.0
201601	2908	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2909	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And the Tealbook is wildly lower than the other probabilities.	22.0	94.0
201601	2910	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So explain that to me.	22.0	94.0
201601	2911	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The Tealbook is not actually shown.	22.0	999.0
201601	2912	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	What are you referring to?	22.0	999.0
201601	2913	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	FRB/US.	22.0	94.0
201601	2914	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Sorry.	22.0	94.0
201601	2915	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Just to create a little space here, that’s different from the Tealbook.	22.0	999.0
201601	2916	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I know.	22.0	94.0
201601	2917	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Sorry.	22.0	94.0
201601	2918	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Just for clarity.	22.0	999.0
201601	2919	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I stand corrected.	22.0	94.0
201601	2920	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Go ahead.	22.0	94.0
201601	2921	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The FRB/US number is based on stochastic simulations, and it’s computing the probability, the number of draws or the percentage of draws for which you get a decline in real GDP in both Q1 and Q2.	22.0	999.0
201601	2922	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Well, another question would be the unconditional probability of going into recession at any particular date, and FRB/US would seem to have a very low number for that, whereas the other models would have something like 10 or 15 percent all of the time.	22.0	94.0
201601	2923	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I think this is a fair point that these models may have different steady-state probabilities of going into recession.	22.0	999.0
201601	2924	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That is right.	22.0	999.0
201601	2925	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, in the case of FRB/US, my guess—so please take it with a grain of salt—would be that it takes a lot of signal from the strong labor market data.	22.0	999.0
201601	2926	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s really what’s keeping it out of recession.	22.0	999.0
201601	2927	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	But that’s a guess.	22.0	999.0
201601	2928	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	22.0	94.0
201601	2929	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201601	2930	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions?	22.0	65.0
201601	2931	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	22.0	65.0
201601	2932	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	110.0
201601	2933	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I have one question.	22.0	110.0
201601	2934	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	On the red line, are you looking at absolute levels, or are you looking at the degree of change from a point in time?	22.0	110.0
201601	2935	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	So, for example, I noticed you’re looking at equity prices and other things.	22.0	110.0
201601	2936	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You’re not looking at absolute valuation levels, but you’re looking at the delta?	22.0	110.0
201601	2937	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	You’re taking a bunch of variables that include the VIX.	22.0	999.0
201601	2938	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	It includes spreads.	22.0	999.0
201601	2939	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m actually looking for help from Eric Engstrom, who assisted me in that.	22.0	999.0
201601	2940	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Could you speak about exactly how the stock market is fitting into it?	22.0	999.0
201601	2941	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you.	22.0	999.0
201601	2942	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGSTROM	There are actually both level and change variables in the regression.	22.0	
201601	2943	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGSTROM	There’s a six-month change in the stock market as well as a stock market valuation level, like a P/E ratio, and there are credit spread levels and volatility measures.	22.0	
201601	2944	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Okay.	22.0	110.0
201601	2945	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	22.0	110.0
201601	2946	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201601	2947	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Simple question:  How many models did you estimate?	22.0	81.0
201601	2948	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For this year?	22.0	999.0
201601	2949	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	For the right panel?	22.0	999.0
201601	2950	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	You’re showing us two.	22.0	81.0
201601	2951	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	How many did you estimate?	22.0	81.0
201601	2952	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly these two.	22.0	999.0
201601	2953	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	No more?	22.0	81.0
201601	2954	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I do not know how many more models the staff is estimating, but when I asked colleagues, like Eric, to help me put this briefing together, we did not engage in a laborious search.	22.0	999.0
201601	2955	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	This is certainly an area that many folks across divisions here at the Board are working on, but, no, we did not engage in a particular search.	22.0	999.0
201601	2956	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The reason I thought these two would be interesting is because we wanted to present something that was using financial variables in order to get at the question “Should you draw a very different view from the financial information?”	22.0	999.0
201601	2957	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	And I deliberately wanted to draw a stark contrast in the sense that you could easily imagine estimating models in which you throw in both nonfinancial and financial variables, and the factor model in the left-hand panel is a bit of that nature.	22.0	999.0
201601	2958	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Again, for contrast, I wanted to focus exclusively on financial variables.	22.0	999.0
201601	2959	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Then we thought that two obvious starting points would be, one, just an agnostic thing, which is the red line,  for which we drew on a bunch of headline variables that you would normally look at in order to get an overall view of financial conditions.	22.0	999.0
201601	2960	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Then the other one, the excess bond premium, is simply quite interesting because of the work that has been done by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek documenting that it is a surprisingly strong predictor of future real GDP growth.	22.0	999.0
201601	2961	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Those were just two candidates that came to my mind, but I’m not claiming that they are representative of a larger universe of things that the staff has looked at.	22.0	999.0
201601	2962	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions for Thomas?	22.0	65.0
201601	2963	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22.0	65.0
201601	2964	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22.0	65.0
201601	2965	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, let’s begin our go-round and start with President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201601	2966	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201601	2967	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201601	2968	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We need more time to assess the direct effect of recent financial market volatility on the economic outlook and inflation and, more important, to determine whether the volatility is signaling underlying weakness that is not yet evident in the data.	23.0	90.0
201601	2969	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is disappointing that the real GDP growth forecast for last quarter has been revised down.	23.0	90.0
201601	2970	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am concerned that we also may be revising down estimates of first-quarter real GDP growth.	23.0	90.0
201601	2971	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are growing slower than potential, then the median path of the federal funds rate in the December SEP may prove to be too steep.	23.0	90.0
201601	2972	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I highlighted yesterday, I believe the downside risks to the outlook are elevated relative to December.	23.0	90.0
201601	2973	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	With consumption being an important component of real GDP that could disappoint.	23.0	90.0
201601	2974	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would also add that if both actual as well as expected inflation are important determinants of actions to be taken in March, it is unlikely that we will have much in the way of evidence of higher core or total PCE inflation by that time.	23.0	90.0
201601	2975	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the recent declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar, the Tealbook expects that total PCE inflation for the first quarter of 2016 will be negative, and that core PCE inflation will be 1.2 percent in Q1.	23.0	90.0
201601	2976	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, the Tealbook forecast does not have core inflation showing signs of accelerating until next year.	23.0	90.0
201601	2977	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	If this forecast proves correct, the inflation data will not provide evidence of approaching our 2 percent goal for quite some time.	23.0	90.0
201601	2978	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have plenty of data yet to be received before the next meeting.	23.0	90.0
201601	2979	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nonetheless, in view of recent events, we should be reinforcing the idea that the median SEP is a forecast, not a promise, and that we remain data dependent.	23.0	90.0
201601	2980	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	I greatly prefer the new sentence substituted in the second paragraph of alternative B to the previous version of alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201601	2981	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	It appropriately highlights that we are monitoring recent events for implications on the outlook and the risks to the outlook.	23.0	90.0
201601	2982	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201601	2983	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	2984	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201601	2985	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201601	2986	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B in the version with the revised wording at the end of the second paragraph.	23.0	108.0
201601	2987	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	This gives the right combination of concern over recent developments and calmness in deciding how to appraise them and how to react to them at later meetings.	23.0	108.0
201601	2988	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Although a lot has happened so far in January, this is not the time to change course.	23.0	108.0
201601	2989	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We continue to be faced by the combination of a strong labor market and disappointing real spending, with the recent addition to the mixture of considerable financial market volatility.	23.0	108.0
201601	2990	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re not expected to change the federal funds rate at this meeting.	23.0	108.0
201601	2991	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, at least in this regard, we should not disappoint expectations.	23.0	108.0
201601	2992	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, we should, in the words of alt-B, closely monitor “global economic and financial developments” and assess “their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.”	23.0	108.0
201601	2993	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Our discussions yesterday and today started from the current combination of a labor market that has performed relatively well and that must be near maximum sustainable employment, and, at the same time, the staff’s forecast of PCE inflation for 2016 that is only 0.7 percent, with even the forecast of the core PCE inflation at 1.3 percent.	23.0	108.0
201601	2994	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The discussion yesterday went on to detail the background to this situation:  the large depreciation of the dollar; the ongoing declines in the price of oil; the recent declines in asset and commodity prices; and the fears, particularly of asset market participants, that China’s economic growth may decline more rapidly than the official predictions, and that the exchange rate of the renminbi may depreciate more than the authority’s pronouncements about it would suggest.	23.0	108.0
201601	2995	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There was concern over Japan, which may want a weaker exchange rate, and the euro zone, which makes no bones about that.	23.0	108.0
201601	2996	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Aside from the market volatility, these are not especially new facts.	23.0	108.0
201601	2997	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, like the markets, the FOMC was in a distinctly less optimistic mood yesterday than it had been only six weeks ago.	23.0	108.0
201601	2998	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It was striking that the basic view about inflation that had obtained among many of us until now—that inflation has been held down by temporary factors, especially declines in the price of oil and the appreciation of the dollar—appeared to be losing ground.	23.0	108.0
201601	2999	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simply put, the view I thought I heard from some of you was that we’ve been surprised too often by low inflation, and that we should accept low inflation as a better description of the underlying state of the economy than the view that inflation is low primarily because of temporary factors.	23.0	108.0
201601	3000	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I do not believe that.	23.0	108.0
201601	3001	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	True, we have continually been surprised by oil price declines.	23.0	108.0
201601	3002	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So has almost everyone, including the Saudis.	23.0	108.0
201601	3003	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That does not mean that the temporary oil price declines and their consequences are not a major factor underlying the behavior of prices.	23.0	108.0
201601	3004	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Similarly, the appreciation of the dollar has had an influence on even core PCE prices.	23.0	108.0
201601	3005	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Among the consequences of declines in the price of oil is the decline in expected inflation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3006	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those who worry about inflation losing its expected-inflation anchor need, at present, to look no further than the behavior of the price of oil.	23.0	108.0
201601	3007	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Those who ask why core PCE inflation is 1.3 percent rather than closer to the target of 2 percent will find that a significant share of that 0.7 percent gap is taken up by the influence of oil prices and the appreciating exchange rate on core inflation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3008	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Now, one may well ask why movements in energy prices are correlated with expected inflation and core PCE inflation, and everyone is asking.	23.0	108.0
201601	3009	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	There are explanations for both these phenomena, but there is a clear need for further research on these topics.	23.0	108.0
201601	3010	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And I’m sure that WE9, which is Wilcox exhibit 9, marks a good start in getting an answer to that question.	23.0	108.0
201601	3011	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Where would we be if we accept, as I do, the view that inflation will gradually rise to its 2 percent target if labor markets continue to be strong, with unemployment remaining close to the natural rate?	23.0	108.0
201601	3012	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We would essentially remain with the forecast we had last month, which is close to this month’s Tealbook forecast.	23.0	108.0
201601	3013	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We would continue with our approach of gradual increases in the federal funds rate at a rate that depends on incoming data and without any commitment to a fixed number of increases per period.	23.0	108.0
201601	3014	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What if that view turns out to be wrong and the labor market starts weakening and the unemployment rate moves up in a sustained way?	23.0	108.0
201601	3015	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I think it’s premature to start talking seriously about that possibility now, but it is not premature for the staff to start researching that situation and possible courses of action to deal with it.	23.0	108.0
201601	3016	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201601	3017	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3018	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201601	3019	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201601	3020	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the substance of alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201601	3021	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As regards the statement language, the objective should be to position the Committee as agnostic about a March policy action but to be careful not to rule out March.	23.0	88.0
201601	3022	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	While I have some sympathy with the alternative A language that the Committee sees risks “tilted slightly to the downside,”	23.0	88.0
201601	3023	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the better communication strategy is to avoid explicitly making that declaration.	23.0	88.0
201601	3024	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	To shift the risk assessment to the downside at this meeting would signal, in my opinion, that a rate increase at the March meeting is quite unlikely, and I think it is too early to make such a call.	23.0	88.0
201601	3025	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding the notion in the new alternative B language of omitting an explicit balance-of-risks assessment, yesterday I heard quite a number of comments that the balance of risk may have tilted to the downside.	23.0	88.0
201601	3026	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think this presents a tricky communication situation.	23.0	88.0
201601	3027	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Avoiding an explicit assessment of risk will be noticed and give rise to lots of commentary.	23.0	88.0
201601	3028	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It is a departure from past practice.	23.0	88.0
201601	3029	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It could also be taken as a signal regarding March.	23.0	88.0
201601	3030	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So, all things considered, I am leaning, after thinking about it over the weekend, toward just sticking with the language in the memo on alternative language circulated on January 20 premising that it’s simply too early, and it’s premature to make an adjustment to the downside in the Committee’s official stance on the balance of risk.	23.0	88.0
201601	3031	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have a couple of more comments.	23.0	88.0
201601	3032	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Strict adherence to data dependence makes us, to an extent, tethered to the data calendar.	23.0	88.0
201601	3033	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I can imagine incoming data leading up to the March meeting that continue the run of ambiguous signals.	23.0	88.0
201601	3034	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We have two more employment reports before the March meeting.	23.0	88.0
201601	3035	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A soft reading on the labor market, along with weakness in the spending data, could give pause.	23.0	88.0
201601	3036	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I commented in the economic go-round that inflation data are likely to be messy through the middle of the year.	23.0	88.0
201601	3037	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The February CPI data will arrive on the second day of our March meeting.	23.0	88.0
201601	3038	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Although, as I said, I’m not ready to send any signal that a rate increase in March is off the table, I am anticipating that a rate move in March could feel premature and unsupported by evidence.	23.0	88.0
201601	3039	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If that’s the situation, I expect I will be comfortable waiting until April for more data that confirm, I hope, that the outlook is holding up.	23.0	88.0
201601	3040	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In some respects, I think it would be a healthy departure to move in April to reinforce that every meeting of this first phase of normalization is live.	23.0	88.0
201601	3041	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201601	3042	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3043	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201601	3044	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3045	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Consistent with my economic forecast, I support alternative B for this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201601	3046	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Labor markets have continued to improve, and inflation is likely to be held back by energy prices and dollar appreciation over the near term.	23.0	999.0
201601	3047	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	But survey- based measures of inflation expectations have remained steady, and I expect that oil prices and the dollar will stabilize in the months ahead.	23.0	999.0
201601	3048	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Monetary policy—and I think it’s important to remind myself—remains accommodative, and a cautious approach seems appropriate in view of the economic and political uncertainties that we face.	23.0	999.0
201601	3049	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	I’ve advocated a gradual normalization of policy that is data dependent, and the current data and forecasts suggest to me that no change in our policy stance is warranted at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201601	3050	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	While my own view is that the risks to the economy are largely balanced or slightly to the downside, I’m fine with the proposed language in paragraph 2.	23.0	999.0
201601	3051	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	There’s a large and growing divergence of the federal funds rate path in both the Tealbook forecast and the central tendency in the SEPs from the implied funds rate path from the financial markets.	23.0	999.0
201601	3052	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Looking ahead to our next few meetings, we may find ourselves in a situation in which the labor market continues to be relatively strong while realized inflation runs at a slow pace.	23.0	999.0
201601	3053	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	My own view is that such a scenario would call into question the suggested path of our normalization.	23.0	999.0
201601	3054	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Fortunately, I believe we take care in the statement to say that our policy decisions are data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201601	3055	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	However, in the event that there is ongoing tension between our employment and inflation goals, we may need to provide more guidance about how these tensions will be resolved and what that implies for the future course of monetary policy.	23.0	999.0
201601	3056	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Personally, I would need to see convincing evidence that inflation is once again moving toward target, and that is unlikely to occur this quarter.	23.0	999.0
201601	3057	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	In any event, on account of the disconnect between the policy rate path we have in mind and the policy rate path expected by financial markets, it’s important to think about what we would have to see to choose to resume our rate increases.	23.0	999.0
201601	3058	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Lastly, I’d just reiterate a comment I made a few meetings ago, which President Bullard referred to yesterday—Q1 GDP data are notoriously difficult to interpret due to seasonal adjustments.	23.0	999.0
201601	3059	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	And I encourage the Committee to take that with—I don’t know if it’ll be a block of salt or a grain.	23.0	999.0
201601	3060	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Let’s call it a cube of salt.	23.0	999.0
201601	3061	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3062	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3063	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3064	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201601	3065	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Financial conditions have tightened considerably since we last met, and market-based measures of inflation expectations have taken another sizable step down.	23.0	107.0
201601	3066	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Equity prices have fallen roughly 7 percent, and credit spreads have widened.	23.0	107.0
201601	3067	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The trade-weighted real exchange rate appreciated a further 3 percent, bringing the total real effective appreciation to 20 percent, roughly 1 percent a month since the summer of 2014.	23.0	107.0
201601	3068	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As noted earlier, the financial tightening in this period is roughly equivalent to two additional hikes in the federal funds rate.	23.0	107.0
201601	3069	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the course of the movements in the exchange rate and oil prices, we have repeatedly noted their transitory nature and stated our willingness to look through them.	23.0	107.0
201601	3070	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As I discussed yesterday, the factors holding down inflation have proven to be persistent and appear to be related to global forces that are also persistent.	23.0	107.0
201601	3071	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, it would be unwise to dismiss the fluctuations in China’s financial markets as either one-offs or unlikely to perturb global markets sufficiently to matter for the US outlook.	23.0	107.0
201601	3072	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As China changes the composition of its economic growth trajectory, it is having material effects on commodity producers, which are being amplified in countries whose growth was accompanied by rapid increases in debt.	23.0	107.0
201601	3073	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	China is also undertaking a notable shift in its exchange rate regime, a departure from earlier financial crises, when it hardened rather than loosened its commitment to a peg.	23.0	107.0
201601	3074	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	As China adjusts its exchange rate and attempts to work off large imbalances in its financial markets, this could lead to periodic bouts of volatility with possible amplification associated with post-crisis changes in financial market functioning.	23.0	107.0
201601	3075	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Eighteen months of repeated step-downs in oil prices and step-ups in the exchange rate risk exerting a disinflationary force in the medium-term framework in which we are making policy.	23.0	107.0
201601	3076	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	These may well have important implications for policy when they are accompanied by a significant deterioration in measures of market-based inflation expectations, as we’ve seen, and some hints of softening in survey-based measures.	23.0	107.0
201601	3077	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	From where we sit today, in light of the extent of deterioration we’ve seen to an inflation outlook that was already raising concerns and to measures of inflation expectations, I think it’s unlikely that we would see a set of data that would give me enough reassurance in the intermeeting period to justify an increase in the federal funds rate in March.	23.0	107.0
201601	3078	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	What would it take to reverse that judgment?	23.0	107.0
201601	3079	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	To raise rates and still be confident in progress toward our inflation objective, we would need to see those forces abate at least somewhat and evidence that inflation is moving back toward our goal, along with some firming of expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3080	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would want to see a constellation of data indicating progress on actual and expected inflation, some combination of an inflection on the exchange rate and oil prices that’s durable, a firming in core inflation, and an improvement on market-based measures of inflation expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3081	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of the current balance of risks, to act without hard evidence that inflation is moving toward our goal threatens to undermine the credibility of our inflation target.	23.0	107.0
201601	3082	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	My views on policy are importantly shaped by the very limited room we have to cushion shocks on the downside using conventional tools.	23.0	107.0
201601	3083	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, if we were to see an unexpected acceleration in inflation, we have ample room and experience using conventional tools to adjust policy in a manner that is not disruptive.	23.0	107.0
201601	3084	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Interestingly, other advanced-economy central banks have taken note of recent developments and suggested they may warrant adjustments in their path of policy.	23.0	107.0
201601	3085	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In our discussions yesterday and today, I heard around the table a strong sense that recent developments pose downside risks to the outlook for inflation and activity.	23.0	107.0
201601	3086	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If this is, in fact, a widely held view among those on the Committee, I think it would be helpful to shape market expectations that the path of policy is sensitive to recent negative developments.	23.0	107.0
201601	3087	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I recognize there are risks to reacting both too much and too little, but I believe we can strike the appropriate balance, signaling we are actively engaged and prepared to adjust the path of the policy rate in tune with financial and economic conditions without appearing to lurch or suggesting greater alarm than is warranted.	23.0	107.0
201601	3088	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	If we do not do so, we risk seeing further financial tightening due to expectations of divergence and further deterioration in inflation expectations.	23.0	107.0
201601	3089	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I can support alternative B.	23.0	107.0
201601	3090	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I would find it difficult to support language that continued to describe the risks to activity and inflation as balanced.	23.0	107.0
201601	3091	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201601	3092	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3093	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201601	3094	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201601	3095	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23.0	91.0
201601	3096	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Yesterday Governor Fischer stated some interesting financial-stability concerns related to equity market pricing and changes in the federal funds rate.	23.0	91.0
201601	3097	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Because I favor continued strong accommodation, I want to clarify my views on those particular concerns.	23.0	91.0
201601	3098	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	After the Lehman Brothers crisis, the financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed, a big output gap emerged, $11 trillion of net worth was destroyed, and risk aversion increased very strongly.	23.0	91.0
201601	3099	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In that context, monetary policy accommodation was required to facilitate as quick a return to trend economic growth and a closing of the output gap as necessary.	23.0	91.0
201601	3100	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I viewed that as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices throughout that time and a reduction in risk aversion.	23.0	91.0
201601	3101	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I view so much of that period as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices.	23.0	91.0
201601	3102	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As we get closer to closing the gap, then renormalization, I think, properly gets that back.	23.0	91.0
201601	3103	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Anyway, that’s my view regarding why policy accommodation continues to be appropriate, even in the presence of those concerns.	23.0	91.0
201601	3104	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We made it clear in December that future policy would be data dependent.	23.0	91.0
201601	3105	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To me, data dependence reflects not just the baseline outlook relative to our dual-mandate goals, but also the uncertainties and balance of risks surrounding that outlook.	23.0	91.0
201601	3106	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, while I’ve not changed my baseline much, the developments since our December meeting have raised uncertainties and shaded the risks further to the downside.	23.0	91.0
201601	3107	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In addition, financial conditions appear to have already tightened in response to the increase in uncertainty and risks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3108	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	So, for me, data dependence and appropriate risk management dictate that we do not raise rates today, and that we communicate this reasoning for the decision to the public.	23.0	91.0
201601	3109	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Alternative B accomplishes this.	23.0	91.0
201601	3110	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Before we move again, we should be confident that economic growth and inflation have successfully weathered the latest round of downside shocks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3111	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It could be well into the second half of the year before I have that confidence.	23.0	91.0
201601	3112	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think we need confirmation that our above-trend outlook for economic growth is still on track to drive continued labor market improvement.	23.0	91.0
201601	3113	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	That is an important channel for many of our inflation projections to rise to trend.	23.0	91.0
201601	3114	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	My December SEP submission envisioned only two quarter-point rate increases in 2016.	23.0	91.0
201601	3115	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	For me, this slow pace of renormalization—or even less—still seems appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201601	3116	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I support the new last sentence in paragraph 2.	23.0	91.0
201601	3117	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We need to carefully assess the balance of risks.	23.0	91.0
201601	3118	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In this environment, risk-management arguments weigh more strongly for further delay.	23.0	91.0
201601	3119	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Let me quickly repeat my risk-management views.	23.0	91.0
201601	3120	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It’s a new year, and we have new Committee members.	23.0	91.0
201601	3121	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ll be very brief, and they’re very similar to what Governor Brainard and others have mentioned.	23.0	91.0
201601	3122	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We continue to be in a special policy environment because of the lower bound.	23.0	91.0
201601	3123	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Our move of 25 basis points in December doesn’t give us enough headroom to use conventional policy to address any meaningful downside shock to economic growth or inflation, but we still can easily raise rates to address upside surprises.	23.0	91.0
201601	3124	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Accordingly, even if the baseline outlook does not change, increases in uncertainty and downside risks generate asymmetric expected policy losses, and risk-management considerations still tell us that this asymmetry should be addressed with accommodative and perhaps looser monetary policy.	23.0	91.0
201601	3125	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Finally, I’ll note that, in paragraph 1, when we’re talking about inflation expectation measures, we still, for survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, simply say that they’re little changed on balance.	23.0	91.0
201601	3126	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	In your own comments, Madam Chair, you mentioned that they’re at near-historic lows for the Michigan survey.	23.0	91.0
201601	3127	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It would be useful, perhaps, to add that, although challenging.	23.0	91.0
201601	3128	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201601	3129	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, last time, we did say they had edged down, and I think, in reflection of that, we agree they’re low.	23.0	65.0
201601	3130	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201601	3131	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3132	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201601	3133	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today as written.	23.0	94.0
201601	3134	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Real GDP growth for the second half of 2015 appears to have been substantially weaker than I anticipated earlier in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201601	3135	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do react to the data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3136	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I am concerned about this, and I would hope to see a rebound in the first half of 2016.	23.0	94.0
201601	3137	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	For now, I’m willing to go with the staff view that the US outlook has not changed materially.	23.0	94.0
201601	3138	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	However, this bears careful watching in the coming weeks.	23.0	94.0
201601	3139	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Labor markets have been strong, but there will now be even more pressure on this aspect of the economic data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3140	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Weak jobs reports at this point may change the narrative substantially and perhaps suddenly for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3141	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few comments on the equity selloff.	23.0	94.0
201601	3142	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	By itself, I’m not particularly concerned about it.	23.0	94.0
201601	3143	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I can summarize President Kaplan’s remarks from yesterday that valuations could be viewed as returning to more normal levels, historically speaking, and this would be a welcome development for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3144	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t know if this will intensify, as Vice Chairman Dudley was talking about.	23.0	94.0
201601	3145	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Despite all of that, I would still be concerned that markets are reacting to a deteriorating US outlook that we are dismissing at this point because of strong labor market outcomes.	23.0	94.0
201601	3146	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I have a few comments on declines in crude oil.	23.0	94.0
201601	3147	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Ultimately, I still view this as a positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3148	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Again, I don’t think many would be willing to say that a sharp rise in crude oil prices would be a positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3149	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s got to be that declines are the positive for the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3150	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do think, though, that the decline in crude oil prices continues to have disconcerting effects on inflation expectations.	23.0	94.0
201601	3151	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This also bears careful watching, and it’s an important acknowledgment in the statement that market-based inflation expectations have been declining.	23.0	94.0
201601	3152	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I share some of the concerns of President Evans.	23.0	94.0
201601	3153	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	These are at 10-year lows.	23.0	94.0
201601	3154	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s pretty low.	23.0	94.0
201601	3155	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Actual year-over-year Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation remains stable at about 1.7 percent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3156	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I take comfort in that, but I’m worried that this will not last if inflation expectations continue to decline.	23.0	94.0
201601	3157	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	My last comment is on the effects on policy of the current global financial developments.	23.0	94.0
201601	3158	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We made a small rate move at the December meeting.	23.0	94.0
201601	3159	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Even with that rate move, policy remains accommodative, and we say so in our statement.	23.0	94.0
201601	3160	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is normalization, not tightening.	23.0	94.0
201601	3161	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Did markets interpret this as a much larger move?	23.0	94.0
201601	3162	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s a key concern for the Committee.	23.0	94.0
201601	3163	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	If it was a 25 basis point move by itself that was truly data dependent, you wouldn’t have expected major effects.	23.0	94.0
201601	3164	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets may have interpreted this as a much larger move, however.	23.0	94.0
201601	3165	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Why would this be?	23.0	94.0
201601	3166	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	It would be because, while we emphasize data dependence, the amount of credibility we have on this issue is limited because of the legacy of the 2004–06 tightening cycle, in which we were not data dependent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3167	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Once we got going in that tightening cycle, we simply increased at a certain pace, which, at that time, was every meeting.	23.0	94.0
201601	3168	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We also have the QE tapering legacy, in which we said we were data dependent but we actually tapered in a more or less mechanical fashion and did not change the pace of tapering in reaction to economic data.	23.0	94.0
201601	3169	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now we’re coming into this phase in which we’re again saying we’re data dependent.	23.0	94.0
201601	3170	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Markets—or at least some corners of markets—are saying, “No, you’re not.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3171	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Some corners of financial markets may have viewed the Committee as making a quasi-commitment to four rate increases in 2016.	23.0	94.0
201601	3172	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The nature of financial pricing is that you pull all of that forward and you get a big selloff in markets and other kinds of effects.	23.0	94.0
201601	3173	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is obviously a very tenuous story, but I would be concerned that we don’t have enough credibility in our data dependency, and this echoes a few of the comments that Chair Yellen just made.	23.0	94.0
201601	3174	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To the extent that we can build credibility that we are actually willing to react to incoming data, we’ll get better policy results.	23.0	94.0
201601	3175	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I see our normalization cycle as “When we get good news, we’ll make moves.	23.0	94.0
201601	3176	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	When we don’t get good news, we won’t make moves.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3177	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the market is saying, “You guys are going to plow ahead no matter what the news is.”	23.0	94.0
201601	3178	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To the extent that we can draw distinctions between those two options and build credibility on data dependence, we’ll get better monetary policy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3179	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you very much.	23.0	94.0
201601	3180	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3181	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201601	3182	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Chair Yellen.	23.0	110.0
201601	3183	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I support alternative B with the language as revised.	23.0	110.0
201601	3184	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In my communication after this meeting, I intend to emphasize that current monetary policy remains accommodative; that any action we take will be data dependent; that there is no predetermined path—or, as President Lockhart said, we are agnostic on the path, and I like that language—and that we will not be, for lack of a better term, Calvinistic in our actions [laughter]; and that any future removal of accommodation will be done only gradually.	23.0	110.0
201601	3185	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will do everything I can to avoid getting pinned down into predicting the number of moves that we might make in 2016.	23.0	110.0
201601	3186	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will also, though, emphasize that there are three segments that are distinctive but interrelated:  first, US economic developments, which are obviously GDP, unemployment, and inflation; second, non-US economic developments, which have obviously weakened; and, third, global financial market developments, which have clearly tightened.	23.0	110.0
201601	3187	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will emphasize that the S&P, as I said yesterday, is not the same as the US economy, although it is affected by it.	23.0	110.0
201601	3188	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It is also heavily affected by non-US developments and global financial developments.	23.0	110.0
201601	3189	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In 2016 or in this part of it, we will have to be patient, and I will talk about that in assessing the ramifications on underlying US economic conditions of the weakness we are seeing so far in non-US economic activity as well as global financial developments.	23.0	110.0
201601	3190	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	While I’ve said before and I do believe that normalization would be desirable because of the potential distortions that excessive accommodation has on asset allocation, investment, and hiring, I don’t believe we can force normalization, and we really do have to be data dependent.	23.0	110.0
201601	3191	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The prospect of normalization has caused markets and risky assets to undergo a revaluation.	23.0	110.0
201601	3192	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	There is now a greater focus on fundamentals and possibly a gradual return to more traditional asset allocation.	23.0	110.0
201601	3193	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I actually think both of those developments are not a bad thing if they don’t go too far.	23.0	110.0
201601	3194	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In that vein, I’m going to be particularly focused in the next few months on S&P earnings forecasts, which, right now, as I mentioned yesterday, are $115 to $120.	23.0	110.0
201601	3195	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I will feel much better if forecasts stay in that range.	23.0	110.0
201601	3196	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’ll obviously be looking at high-yield and investment-grade credit spreads, and I’ll be looking at the 10-year Treasury.	23.0	110.0
201601	3197	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	In addition, I’ll be continuing to try to assess the effect of three key secular, apart from cyclical, trends.	23.0	110.0
201601	3198	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The first one is aging demographics in the United States, China, Japan, and Europe, which negatively affect labor participation rates and are expected to have further negative effects on those participation rates in the future, reduce potential GDP, and have a negative effect on r*.	23.0	110.0
201601	3199	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The second secular trend is China, where there’s overcapacity and a transition to a more service-based economy is likely to take many years.	23.0	110.0
201601	3200	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The world is going to have to get used to slower rates of Chinese economic growth, and this is going to happen over a very long period.	23.0	110.0
201601	3201	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	The third secular trend I’m focused on and am trying to continue to understand and assess is the end of the so-called debt supercycle.	23.0	110.0
201601	3202	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	That is, it is tougher for countries, including the United States, to boost their economic growth in the future by using leverage.	23.0	110.0
201601	3203	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think the prospect of removal of central bank accommodation even gradually will likely create greater focus on these secular trends.	23.0	110.0
201601	3204	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	23.0	110.0
201601	3205	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3206	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201601	3207	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3208	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I support making no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3209	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the most likely outcome continues to be that the economy will evolve in a way that warrants a gradually rising path of policy rates over time, although there are risks associated with that outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3210	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I view alternative B as consistent with my view on the economy, and I think that policy remains pretty well calibrated to the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3211	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In my view, I don’t think we have accumulated enough evidence to conclude that the medium-run outlook or the risks associated with the outlook have changed in a material way that necessitates giving a signal about a change in our policy course.	23.0	999.0
201601	3212	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed change to the description of our inflation outlook acknowledges the further decline in oil prices and that inflation will remain low in the near term but, at the same time, indicates that, over time, inflation is expected to move back once the effects of energy price declines dissipate.	23.0	999.0
201601	3213	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	As I discussed yesterday, if energy prices continue to fall, we’ll need to reconsider that language, but today I’m comfortable with the proposed language in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3214	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Given the intermeeting developments in financial markets, I do think it’s appropriate to indicate we’re monitoring economic and financial developments closely and assessing their implications for the medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3215	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	This is consistent with past communications that our monetary policy decisions are going to be data dependent.	23.0	999.0
201601	3216	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Regarding the balance of risks, I note that in September, in a similar period of high market volatility, we did not change the balance of risks but indicated we were monitoring developments abroad.	23.0	999.0
201601	3217	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I see today’s situation as somewhat analogous and would have preferred we not change our balance-of-risks assessment, because of the potential that that change might alter expectations further about our March decision.	23.0	999.0
201601	3218	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And I would like us to remain data dependent with respect to our decision at that meeting, in which we’ll have new projections, and at subsequent meetings.	23.0	999.0
201601	3219	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Now, it is true that we’re monitoring developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the balance of risks associated with the outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3220	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	My concern is not with the truth of the statement but with the signal that would send about our policy rate path for the period ahead.	23.0	999.0
201601	3221	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That said, I’m prepared to accept that statement as written in the revision of alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3222	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, I do understand it’s important to show that the Committee is aware and cognizant of economic and financial market developments, and I understand that we need to signal that in the statement.	23.0	999.0
201601	3223	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But at times like this, when we’ve seen a lot of volatility in the markets, it’s easy to signal that we’re focused on the short run.	23.0	999.0
201601	3224	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, as the people around the table have said, in view of the lags with which policy affects the economy, we need to be thinking about the medium-run outlook.	23.0	999.0
201601	3225	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And I don’t think we should use our statements to encourage short-run thinking.	23.0	999.0
201601	3226	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Again, that said, I’m supportive of alternative B and the revision that was made.	23.0	999.0
201601	3227	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3228	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3229	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201601	3230	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201601	3231	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I won’t attempt a comprehensive review.	23.0	81.0
201601	3232	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’ll just make a couple of observations.	23.0	81.0
201601	3233	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	First, I’ve heard a lot of discussion about downside risks.	23.0	81.0
201601	3234	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, it’s the topic of the day here.	23.0	81.0
201601	3235	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But I’m also struck that it’s very unclear whether global developments are going to affect our economic growth prospects materially.	23.0	81.0
201601	3236	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	When financial markets move significantly, like they have, without an immediately discernible deterioration in economic fundamentals, we often find ourselves striving to write a statement that shows we’re paying attention without adding to market pessimism unduly.	23.0	81.0
201601	3237	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think the new language proposed for the end of paragraph 2 strikes as reasonable a balance as possible.	23.0	81.0
201601	3238	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Now, of those two concerns you commented on, Madam Chair, the risk of distorting or biasing market participants’ outlook is, for me, more pressing.	23.0	81.0
201601	3239	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	People take our assessments of economic conditions very seriously, I think.	23.0	81.0
201601	3240	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	They accord a lot of skill and ability to us in our capacity to sift through the data and make a judgment about economic prospects.	23.0	81.0
201601	3241	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	And I think there have been times in the recent past when our actions and statements have had an influence on broad market beliefs about economic prospects.	23.0	81.0
201601	3242	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So at times like this, we should be really cautious about altering our assessment of the economic outlook as well as the policy outlook.	23.0	81.0
201601	3243	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I’d also point out that this phrase “balance of risks” has been used commonly in our discussions yesterday and today in the sense of where outcomes are likely to fall in terms of economic growth and inflation.	23.0	81.0
201601	3244	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	The origin of that language in our statement is as an explicit signal of the likelihood of the direction of the next move.	23.0	81.0
201601	3245	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	So while you might be attracted to one formulation under one interpretation of “balance of risks,”	23.0	81.0
201601	3246	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I think we should be cautious because it has this broader connotation of putting down a marker about which direction the next likely move is going to be.	23.0	81.0
201601	3247	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I want to comment on one other aspect of the language.	23.0	81.0
201601	3248	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	This might be odd to bring up here, considering the tenor of things.	23.0	81.0
201601	3249	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	But I would point out that, in paragraph 1, we say that “a range of ... labor market indicators ... points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.”	23.0	81.0
201601	3250	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We should think about that going forward if things play out the way the Tealbook suggests.	23.0	81.0
201601	3251	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I argued yesterday that underutilization is statistically indistinguishable from zero now, and I think that word is going to be increasingly problematic as we go forward.	23.0	81.0
201601	3252	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 1 of alternative C contains what I believe to be more appropriate language.	23.0	81.0
201601	3253	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	There, it says that a range of labor market indicators “points to some additional increase in utilization of labor resources,” without judging what “full” or “underutilization” is.	23.0	81.0
201601	3254	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	That concludes my comments, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201601	3255	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3256	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201601	3257	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201601	3258	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B as an appropriate pause after the first rate hike in several years.	23.0	103.0
201601	3259	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	Although volatility in financial markets has already made the path of the funds rate less certain this year than in December, I continue to anticipate moderate economic growth and rising inflation, with further removal of accommodation this year being appropriate.	23.0	103.0
201601	3260	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	My confidence in that forecast, however, will depend on judging between now and March the signal of various risks and uncertainties that have been well highlighted at this meeting.	23.0	103.0
201601	3261	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	In light of that background, I support the revised language in paragraph 2.	23.0	103.0
201601	3262	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	It is what I consider to be an honest assessment on the part of the Committee about the risks.	23.0	103.0
201601	3263	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I would also add that I had a similar comment to President Lacker’s as it relates to how we characterize additional declines in underutilization, versus increases in utilization as described in alternative C.	23.0	103.0
201601	3264	2016-01-27	meeting	GEORGE	I hope we’ll consider that as we go forward.	23.0	103.0
201601	3265	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3266	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201601	3267	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201601	3268	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B.	23.0	104.0
201601	3269	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Both the weaker inflation picture and the likely increase to downside risks suggest to me that the Committee can and should proceed cautiously.	23.0	104.0
201601	3270	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As I mentioned yesterday, there are several story lines underlying the recent market weakness, and I think that the Committee will need some time to understand whether markets have overreacted.	23.0	104.0
201601	3271	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	As for the language, I support the revised language in the statement.	23.0	104.0
201601	3272	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The Committee, in my view, has to navigate between two risks.	23.0	104.0
201601	3273	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Saying that “risks remain balanced” no longer seems right to me, and I think it also risks suggesting that the Committee is committed to a preset path.	23.0	104.0
201601	3274	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	At the same time, it seems premature to me to say that they are skewed to the downside; I also think that could send too much of a signal.	23.0	104.0
201601	3275	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So I think that the proposed language navigates between these two risks and suggests that the Committee takes note of potential downside risks, is watching developments carefully, and will react appropriately.	23.0	104.0
201601	3276	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201601	3277	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3278	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201601	3279	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201601	3280	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I agree that, as the Chair noted, it’s important to show that we recognize downside risks but do so without appearing to panic or sending a negative signal that could further increase volatility.	23.0	111.0
201601	3281	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think alternative B strikes that balance appropriately, so I support alternative B.	23.0	111.0
201601	3282	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As we’ve talked about, there are risks to any outlook, and we have to be prepared to respond if the economy evolves in ways we may not expect.	23.0	111.0
201601	3283	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Like others, I am particularly concerned about downside risks here.	23.0	111.0
201601	3284	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ve been thinking about what we’re seeing in the markets, and it’s hard to tell signal from noise.	23.0	111.0
201601	3285	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	One piece of data that has stuck with me, as I read in the Tealbook, is that we estimate the Chinese have spent about $400 billion defending their currency.	23.0	111.0
201601	3286	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	That struck me as pretty revealing that they must be concerned.	23.0	111.0
201601	3287	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So while we don’t have great visibility into what’s happening in China, we do now, I believe, know that they are legitimately concerned.	23.0	111.0
201601	3288	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I think alternative B is the right approach, and I’m concerned about what actions we would consider taking if these financial market developments actually did affect our economy.	23.0	111.0
201601	3289	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, if things are better than we expect, we have a lot more room to react, and we’ve got plenty of levers.	23.0	111.0
201601	3290	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	If things are worse than expected, what would we do?	23.0	111.0
201601	3291	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’d be very interested in the staff’s analysis of what some of those options could be if these things evolve in ways that we hope they don’t.	23.0	111.0
201601	3292	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	23.0	111.0
201601	3293	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3294	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201601	3295	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201601	3296	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Yesterday I said that my baseline expectations, while less optimistic than those of the Committee as a whole, hadn’t changed too much since December, but that I thought the risks had moved from modestly to decidedly weighted to the downside.	23.0	97.0
201601	3297	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The remarks that a couple of you made yesterday afternoon suggested, I think, the valid point that the weight of the downside risks may itself have affected baseline expectations.	23.0	97.0
201601	3298	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think I actually heard all but a few participants take one or both of those perspectives, and the second seems to me an interesting one.	23.0	97.0
201601	3299	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But, to me, the more important point was that all but a few people did seem to regard risks as having shifted to the downside.	23.0	97.0
201601	3300	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And there, just to be clear, I agree with Jeff that that doesn’t mean it should be a signal of what the next interest rate move is, but that it’s an honest appraisal of where the economy stands right now.	23.0	97.0
201601	3301	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I said in December that I didn’t have reasonable confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent.	23.0	97.0
201601	3302	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Nothing since then has increased my confidence.	23.0	97.0
201601	3303	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	To the contrary, a few more doubts have crept in.	23.0	97.0
201601	3304	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Looking at the Committee’s median expectation—this in the December SEP—of a 1.6 percent increase in both headline and core inflation, I think it’s important, as I said yesterday, to make as close a real-time evaluation as possible of the degree to which actual inflation is tracking those expectations.	23.0	97.0
201601	3305	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We’ve already seen in this Tealbook that the path expected in December has been pushed out a couple of quarters.	23.0	97.0
201601	3306	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It remains to be seen whether the slope of the path itself will hold after those couple of quarters.	23.0	97.0
201601	3307	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	The staff’s monitoring mechanism, as explained yesterday by David Wilcox, will help answer this question.	23.0	97.0
201601	3308	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	This will be in line with my recurring call for some evidence that expectations derived from models or past correlations are actually being realized before we take policy steps based on them.	23.0	97.0
201601	3309	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As to the statement, alternative A captures my views better than alternative B, certainly, in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, though I must confess that the subtlety of the difference in the last sentence of paragraph 3 somewhat eludes me.	23.0	97.0
201601	3310	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So I may be missing something.	23.0	97.0
201601	3311	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I think the views of the Committee as expressed yesterday suggest support for at least the weak version of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of alt-A with respect to downside risks, but I hear many participants reluctant to articulate what, as someone said, is a true statement, because of the tactical reasons of what kind of signaling that may indicate about where we are going.	23.0	97.0
201601	3312	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Personally, like Lael, I’d be quite surprised if it was appropriate in March to increase rates further, but one never knows.	23.0	97.0
201601	3313	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	As the policy actions in alt-A and alt-B are, I think, identical—in fact, I know the policy actions are identical, but I just don’t understand that difference in phraseology in paragraph 3—I can certainly go along with alt-B, including the more agnostic version of the last sentence of paragraph 2.	23.0	97.0
201601	3314	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I must confess that I do so a little bit reluctantly on the basis of past experience where, just to be direct about it, some participants take agnostic language and then try to go out and shape expectations of how many rate increases that’s going to indicate over the next year.	23.0	97.0
201601	3315	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I hope, as President Kaplan urged, we don’t do that going forward.	23.0	97.0
201601	3316	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I wanted to end with a point that I’ve made before, but I wanted to make it again.	23.0	97.0
201601	3317	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	On the concept of normalization, I resist the notion that whatever we’re engaged in is a normalization process, because that suggests there is a “normal” for monetary policy.	23.0	97.0
201601	3318	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not a matter of getting the body temperature back to 98.6.	23.0	97.0
201601	3319	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	What is appropriate policy is going to depend on what the circumstances are that we face.	23.0	97.0
201601	3320	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And, while some regarded having zero interest rates as abnormal, suggesting that we needed to get off of it as soon as possible, I think we see in the results that it was entirely appropriate, in view of external conditions, to be at zero.	23.0	97.0
201601	3321	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I would also say that the very good r* discussion we had a few meetings ago should have reinforced the idea that, at some level, we don’t really know quite what “normal” is, and that “normal” changes over time.	23.0	97.0
201601	3322	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	So that doesn’t affect how one thinks about actual rate increases, but I think it does, in public communications, sometimes affect people because it suggests that there is this obvious goal.	23.0	97.0
201601	3323	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We may say we’re data dependent, but we’re going to get to that goal.	23.0	97.0
201601	3324	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	We’re going to normalize, meaning “get back to the normal level.”	23.0	97.0
201601	3325	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Maybe a few of us actually believe that, but I don’t think most of us, including some who use that term, actually mean that.	23.0	97.0
201601	3326	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I think they really are making judgments as to what’s appropriate in what circumstances.	23.0	97.0
201601	3327	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201601	3328	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3329	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	May I say something?	23.0	108.0
201601	3330	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	23.0	65.0
201601	3331	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201601	3332	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I understand what you say, Governor Tarullo, but I will continue to use the word “normalization.”	23.0	108.0
201601	3333	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think a zero interest rate is a normal situation.	23.0	108.0
201601	3334	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It hasn’t been historically, and I’d rather be in a situation in which you can move both ways as needed.	23.0	108.0
201601	3335	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, that is not to say that zero was wrong when we were at zero.	23.0	108.0
201601	3336	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, if I may continue—President Evans, I didn’t say anything critical of QE or policies followed up to 2015 or 2016.	23.0	108.0
201601	3337	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I was just trying to explain why, as we come out of zero, we might expect stock prices to adjust because the capitalization factor is rising.	23.0	108.0
201601	3338	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s all I was saying.	23.0	108.0
201601	3339	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	23.0	91.0
201601	3340	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201601	3341	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	On Governor Tarullo’s comments on normalization, I’d be willing to use a different word if you wanted to.	23.0	94.0
201601	3342	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But “tightening,”	23.0	94.0
201601	3343	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think, is contrary to some of the things that we’re saying, because we’re saying that policy remains accommodative.	23.0	94.0
201601	3344	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	And if you say, “Well, every time you raise rates, you’re tightening,”	23.0	94.0
201601	3345	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure that the Committee is really there.	23.0	94.0
201601	3346	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Even taking into account the r* discussion, I think we still believe we’ve got an accommodative policy.	23.0	94.0
201601	3347	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I struggled a little bit to describe the situation, but I thought “normalization” was maybe a good term.	23.0	94.0
201601	3348	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’d be happy to switch to something else, but I think the idea was to not be saying that we’re tightening in a situation in which people think the economy is certainly not at the level that it’s been historically.	23.0	94.0
201601	3349	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Well, I wasn’t trying to suggest any particular formulation, Jim.	23.0	97.0
201601	3350	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	One could say “removal of accommodation” or whatever.	23.0	97.0
201601	3351	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I actually, though, think Governor Fischer made my point, even though he was rebutting it [laughter], that zero was appropriate for those conditions, and what will be appropriate in the future will depend on what the conditions are, both cyclical and secular.	23.0	97.0
201601	3352	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	That’s really the only point that I was trying to make, and, as I say, I know you, certainly—and, I suspect, others—have not had in mind that there’s some interest rate that we’re going to end at.	23.0	97.0
201601	3353	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You’re taking the data and your assessment of the economy as we go.	23.0	97.0
201601	3354	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	But I have read more than one account in which people have said, “They’re normalizing to get to a particular rate,” and the rate is the one that they find in the SEP.	23.0	97.0
201601	3355	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	And we just don’t know that yet.	23.0	97.0
201601	3356	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Now, that’s really my only point.	23.0	97.0
201601	3357	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, could I say something?	23.0	91.0
201601	3358	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201601	3359	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’m confused by this.	23.0	91.0
201601	3360	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I thought we had work streams that use the term “renormalization process.”	23.0	91.0
201601	3361	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We do.	23.0	65.0
201601	3362	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not my work.	23.0	97.0
201601	3363	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201601	3364	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, okay.	23.0	91.0
201601	3365	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But as a Committee, I’ve seen documents in which we refer to this as renormalization, and there have been periods when Chairman Bernanke certainly had strong preferences for certain types of terminology as opposed to others.	23.0	91.0
201601	3366	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I just assumed that, on most occasions, it would be okay to use the official language.	23.0	91.0
201601	3367	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think I disagree with the substance of what you’re saying, though.	23.0	91.0
201601	3368	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I agree with you that we have to be clear about it.	23.0	91.0
201601	3369	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	We all have our viewpoints of where we’re headed.	23.0	91.0
201601	3370	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201601	3371	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Am I next?	23.0	102.0
201601	3372	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You are.	23.0	65.0
201601	3373	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Number 15.	23.0	102.0
201601	3374	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	All right.	23.0	102.0
201601	3375	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201601	3376	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I want to correct something in my response to Governor Tarullo’s question to me at the end of my remarks during the economic go-round, when I was talking about the composition effects.	23.0	102.0
201601	3377	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	He asked me if these papers are available.	23.0	102.0
201601	3378	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’ve actually been available for years on our website.	23.0	102.0
201601	3379	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	These are the same papers?	23.0	97.0
201601	3380	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These are the same papers.	23.0	102.0
201601	3381	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I said I wasn’t sure whether they were.	23.0	102.0
201601	3382	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	They are.	23.0	102.0
201601	3383	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	What is new is the update through the current, most recent data, which we’ll be happy to share.	23.0	102.0
201601	3384	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it’s the same analysis—one paper by John Fernald, Mary Daly, and Bart Hobijn and the other paper by Bart and Mary.	23.0	102.0
201601	3385	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So these are analyses they’ve done in previous work.	23.0	102.0
201601	3386	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been updating it regularly.	23.0	102.0
201601	3387	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3388	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it does a reasonably good job of paying heed to recent developments while indicating that the medium-term trajectory of the economy remains favorable.	23.0	102.0
201601	3389	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this regard, the modal outlook hasn’t changed much since the December meeting despite the spike in financial market volatility.	23.0	102.0
201601	3390	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The incoming data on economic activity have been mixed, with a fourth-quarter dip in output growth but the stronger-than-expected job gains.	23.0	102.0
201601	3391	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like the Tealbook, I take more signal from the employment data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3392	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I continue to expect somewhat slightly above-trend GDP growth and employment growth this year, and that’s sufficient for us to overshoot full employment by a meaningful amount.	23.0	102.0
201601	3393	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Headline inflation data continue to be low, but that’s mainly stemming from another round of transitory restraining factors.	23.0	102.0
201601	3394	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	These, too, shall pass.	23.0	102.0
201601	3395	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as the labor market tightens further, we should get back on track toward our 2 percent inflation objective.	23.0	102.0
201601	3396	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, in thinking about the future path of policy, I do find it instructive to look at Tealbook B in terms of how the changes in the outlook regarding output, employment, and inflation affect what the path for policy should be.	23.0	102.0
201601	3397	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Whether you’re looking at policy rules or the optimal control simulations, these are ways of thinking about policy that have been studied for decades, and they’ve been highlighted by the Chair in numerous speeches.	23.0	102.0
201601	3398	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you look at the very modest changes in the modal forecast—I’ll get to the risks in a moment—basically, that implies the changes in the projected paths for real activity and for inflation that take into account all of the factors that everyone talked about the past few days:  a stronger dollar, the weaker stock market, weaker economic growth abroad, and the weak Q4 data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3399	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Everything that we talk about in the modal forecast is in the Tealbook.	23.0	102.0
201601	3400	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I trust that the staff has incorporated all of the latest information to get their view of where the economy is and where it’s going, and it basically calls for just a slightly shallower path for the funds rate—maybe a ¼ percentage point lower path in the funds rate over the next year or so.	23.0	102.0
201601	3401	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that’s appropriate, in light of the effects of, especially, the stronger dollar and financial conditions on where the economy is and where it’s going.	23.0	102.0
201601	3402	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the good news there—and here I am a little perplexed by some of the comments by both the Chair and President Bullard about how the market is locked into thinking we’re raising it four times this year.	23.0	102.0
201601	3403	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, with these weaker data and with the changes in conditions, we’ve seen a significant movement in expectations for the funds rate for 2016.	23.0	102.0
201601	3404	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the Tealbook, the primary dealer survey says that, already, even after just a few weeks, they expect one fewer rate increase in 2016.	23.0	102.0
201601	3405	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you look at the probabilities in Simon and Lorie’s presentation, for a second rate hike by March, at the beginning of the year, it was around 50 percent.	23.0	102.0
201601	3406	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	According to the latest data that Simon shared with me, we’re under 30 percent today.	23.0	102.0
201601	3407	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the market expectations are moving, as they should, with a data-dependent policy approach that we have announced and we should stick to.	23.0	102.0
201601	3408	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My own personal view is similar, based on this analysis—that we should have probably one fewer rate hike this year already on the basis of the changes in the data.	23.0	102.0
201601	3409	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I don’t see there being this clear problem that market expectations see us somehow set on a course of having four rate increases.	23.0	102.0
201601	3410	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the data strongly contradict that sense out there.	23.0	102.0
201601	3411	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have to continue to be data dependent.	23.0	102.0
201601	3412	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have to watch what’s happening.	23.0	102.0
201601	3413	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the point that Governor Tarullo and, I think, Governor Brainard made about watching the inflation data:  not just hoping—hope is not our strategy—but also making sure it’s consistent with the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201601	3414	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I really like David Wilcox’s approach of showing us how the data have been coming in relative to our expectations.	23.0	102.0
201601	3415	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with all of those points.	23.0	102.0
201601	3416	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would say that right now, the change in the baseline forecast has actually been quite modest, and I think that calls for a relatively modest modification of our path for policy.	23.0	102.0
201601	3417	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That brings me to the risks, and here I actually come out with comments very similar to those of Presidents Mester and Lacker.	23.0	102.0
201601	3418	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agree with the Chair completely about trying to thread a needle here.	23.0	102.0
201601	3419	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re trying to neither scare markets by saying that the risks are mostly to the downside nor look asleep at the wheel.	23.0	102.0
201601	3420	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This has been a situation that we’ve been in before, as Presidents Lacker and Mester mentioned.	23.0	102.0
201601	3421	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It doesn’t work as well as we think.	23.0	102.0
201601	3422	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I try to thread a needle, with my vision deteriorating, I find that I put the thread next to the needle about 50 times in a row.	23.0	102.0
201601	3423	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this is what’s going to happen when we try to do this.	23.0	102.0
201601	3424	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	There will be a market interpretation that the FOMC is, with the new language, putting significant weight on or making an acknowledgment that risks to the economic outlook are worse.	23.0	102.0
201601	3425	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That may be what the Committee wants to do.	23.0	102.0
201601	3426	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s just a reality.	23.0	102.0
201601	3427	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do know from September that the commentary I heard from members of the public in my outreach activities was shockingly or surprisingly strong and consistent, indicating that, clearly, the FOMC knew something that the rest of the world didn’t know, and that we were much more worried about global economic and financial developments, which was worrisome to people.	23.0	102.0
201601	3428	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know we’ve considered all of those issues.	23.0	102.0
201601	3429	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had a good discussion.	23.0	102.0
201601	3430	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I can support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3431	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My expectation is, when the statement goes out, this will be seen as, in a way, validating the worries out there in the market.	23.0	102.0
201601	3432	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It could make expectations a little bit worse and will definitely lower market perceptions of the probability of a rate hike in March.	23.0	102.0
201601	3433	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, it’s a difficult decision to make, and I do support alternative B.	23.0	102.0
201601	3434	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of future language, we were asked for our views on alt-A and alt-C for the future.	23.0	102.0
201601	3435	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	My view is that alt-C, whenever we do think it’s appropriate to raise rates, is a fine starting point.	23.0	102.0
201601	3436	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I did answer their question on that.	23.0	102.0
201601	3437	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	23.0	102.0
201601	3438	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23.0	65.0
201601	3439	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201601	3440	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201601	3441	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	96.0
201601	3442	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I do think we face a tricky communications problem at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201601	3443	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	As I see it, we have four objectives.	23.0	96.0
201601	3444	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	First, we want to keep our options open in terms of what we do at the March meeting.	23.0	96.0
201601	3445	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, we want to acknowledge the ongoing international financial market developments because they are noteworthy and do, if sustained, have significant implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy.	23.0	96.0
201601	3446	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, we don’t want to show so much concern about the outlook that we exacerbate market participants’ fears about the global outlook, making the bad outcome more likely.	23.0	96.0
201601	3447	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Language that showed great anxiety on our part might make households and businesses more skittish.	23.0	96.0
201601	3448	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Fourth, we don’t want to create an impression that monetary policy will necessarily respond to short-term movements in financial asset prices.	23.0	96.0
201601	3449	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, there’s no “Fed put.”	23.0	96.0
201601	3450	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	At the same time, financial conditions do matter because they do affect the outlook for economic growth and inflation.	23.0	96.0
201601	3451	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	My own view is that the risks to the outlook may have tilted slightly to the downside, but I think you can make the case that it is premature to reach that conclusion.	23.0	96.0
201601	3452	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	We just don’t know whether the tightening of financial market conditions will be sustained and what the effect will be on the economy’s performance.	23.0	96.0
201601	3453	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, the alternative B formulation says that we’re mulling it over and we haven’t reached a firm conclusion yet.	23.0	96.0
201601	3454	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	March is still open as to whether we will or won’t raise the federal funds rate target.	23.0	96.0
201601	3455	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It depends on the data, broadly defined.	23.0	96.0
201601	3456	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And when I say “broadly defined,”	23.0	96.0
201601	3457	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean that it includes global and financial market developments.	23.0	96.0
201601	3458	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think alternative B strikes the right balance.	23.0	96.0
201601	3459	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I think the March meeting is going to be very consequential.	23.0	96.0
201601	3460	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If we do tighten, it will tend to crystalize the idea that we’re doing four rate hikes this year, and it may contradict our saying we’re data dependent.	23.0	96.0
201601	3461	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	People may start to say, “Oh, they’re on a mechanical path of every quarter.”	23.0	96.0
201601	3462	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Sitting here, not knowing where we’re going to be in March, I guess my inclination is that the bar to tightening in March is a little high.	23.0	96.0
201601	3463	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I need to see a positive reason to tighten in March, as opposed to a strong reason not to tighten in March.	23.0	96.0
201601	3464	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bar there is a little higher than it was before, because it will be quite consequential in terms of how markets would react to a March tightening.	23.0	96.0
201601	3465	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201601	3466	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201601	3467	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think we’ve had a good round of discussion.	23.0	65.0
201601	3468	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201601	3469	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, Thomas.	23.0	65.0
201601	3470	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	Excuse me.	23.0	999.0
201601	3471	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	President George brought to my attention that, unfortunately, there is a tiny typo in alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201601	3472	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, in paragraph 2, the second line, if you’ll squint, you’ll see that the “s” in the word “adjustments” is struck.	23.0	999.0
201601	3473	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I believe that is not intended.	23.0	999.0
201601	3474	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So it should stay plural—“with gradual adjustments,” as opposed to “with gradual adjustment.”	23.0	999.0
201601	3475	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	I apologize for that mistake.	23.0	999.0
201601	3476	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201601	3477	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hope, without objection, we can accept that change.	23.0	65.0
201601	3478	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Clearly, President George doesn’t have President Williams’s eye problems.	23.0	97.0
201601	3479	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	23.0	97.0
201601	3480	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Keen eye.	23.0	65.0
201601	3481	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you for catching that.	23.0	65.0
201601	3482	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’ve had a very good discussion, and all of us recognize that threading that needle today is difficult.	23.0	65.0
201601	3483	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The outside commentary, I think, indicates they think we have a hard problem, and, although there are some qualms about the language in alternative B, I think I’ve heard broad-based support around the table for alternative B as written.	24.0	65.0
201601	3484	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I would like to ask Brian to get us ready for the vote.	24.0	65.0
201601	3485	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Okay.	24.0	999.0
201601	3486	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	This vote will be on the statement for alternative B that appears on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, with the correction of the typo that was just noted.	24.0	999.0
201601	3487	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	It will also be on the directive to the Desk as it appears in the implementation note on pages 10 and 11 of those briefing materials.	24.0	999.0
201601	3488	2016-01-27	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen  Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard  Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George Yes President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes .	24.0	999.0
201601	3489	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Very good.	24.0	65.0
201601	3490	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would note that, unlike at our December meeting, there’s no need for the Board to vote on actions pertaining to interest on excess reserves or the discount rate, as we’re leaving those unchanged.	24.0	65.0
201601	3491	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	24.0	65.0
201601	3492	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think at this point, we’re going to have a further discussion on fan charts.	52.0	65.0
201601	3493	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I think we could take a break for coffee for 20 minutes and reward ourselves for all that we have accomplished.	52.0	65.0
201601	3494	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	52.0	65.0
201601	3496	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201601	3497	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	52.0	65.0
201601	3498	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	There’s one last item on the agenda, and that pertains to the possibility of adding fan charts to the Summary of Economic Projections.	95.0	65.0
201601	3499	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start off by again thanking the subcommittee on communications and the staff who worked with the subcommittee  We have had a number of discussions over the years about fan charts, and I’m pleased that the subcommittee has put forward what I think is a sensible proposal for moving forward.	95.0	65.0
201601	3500	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn it over to Stan to begin our discussion.	95.0	65.0
201601	3501	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201601	3502	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee on communications indicated last summer that we’d come back to this Committee with a proposal for the use of fan charts in the SEP after doing some work with the staff on possible approaches to the construction of the fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3503	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve examined a number of options, and our memo to the Committee on January 11 provided a specific proposal for simple fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3504	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We do not claim that these fan charts are a critical advance, but we do think they offer a real improvement in our communications.	95.0	108.0
201601	3505	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Todd Clark from Cleveland is going to provide the specifics of the proposal, but, before that, let me make a couple of points.	95.0	108.0
201601	3506	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	First, in past Committee discussions of fan charts, there’s been a fair amount of support for the idea that they would be a useful addition to our communications.	95.0	108.0
201601	3507	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	They’d help to communicate that our projections are subject to considerable uncertainty and so help make it clear that policy will depend on incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.	95.0	108.0
201601	3508	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In addition, a comparison of the fan charts with the existing SEP chart showing the range of participants’ projections will help make it clear to the public that the differences in view across participants regarding the economic outlook are not that large relative to the uncertainty regarding the projections—information that should avoid the sense, which may arise from time to time, that Committee participants are in sharp disagreement.	95.0	108.0
201601	3509	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Second, in past discussions, a fair number of you have indicated either that you are not confident that the fan charts will be understood by the public or that you would prefer more sophisticated fan charts that could convey a more complex message to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3510	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, these two sets of concerns point in opposite directions, of course, and our proposal is a compromise— that is to say, the more complicated it is, the less likely it is to be understood by the public, and you have to get somewhere on that spectrum.	95.0	108.0
201601	3511	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For those of you who are concerned that fan charts will not be well understood, we’ve aimed to keep the fan charts simple and based them on information that is, for the most part, already included in the SEP and so more likely to be comprehensible to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3512	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’d note that a table in the staff memos that you received showed that many advanced-economy central banks use fan charts, suggesting by revealed preference that they view them as a useful communication tool, which is something my conversations with foreign central bankers have confirmed.	95.0	108.0
201601	3513	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	For those of you who’d like a more sophisticated approach, I’d urge you to take this first step.	95.0	108.0
201601	3514	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	At least for now, let’s keep the fan charts simple so that we’re confident that we can successfully explain them to the public.	95.0	108.0
201601	3515	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Simple fan charts like those we’ve proposed are also low cost, which improves the cost-benefit calculation.	95.0	108.0
201601	3516	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Among those costs is how much work the person looking at them has to do to understand them.	95.0	108.0
201601	3517	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And, like all parts of our communications apparatus, they can be enhanced over time.	95.0	108.0
201601	3518	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Indeed, the experience of the Bank of England, which has produced increasingly sophisticated fan charts, shows how such an incremental approach can work to deliver more informative fan charts over time.	95.0	108.0
201601	3519	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	In short, we should not let the best be the enemy of the good—our motto for the day.	95.0	108.0
201601	3520	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	3521	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Let me summarize by saying I was aware yesterday that I thanked the members of the subcommittee for all of the work they had done.	95.0	108.0
201601	3522	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I also need to thank the staff associated with the subcommittee—which includes Todd, Bill English, Glenn Rudebusch, Stacey Tevlin, Ellen Meade, and probably others I’ve omitted—for the hard work they have done with regard to both the consensus statement and this work on fan charts.	95.0	108.0
201601	3523	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Todd, would you please take over and provide the details?	95.0	108.0
201601	3524	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	95.0	108.0
201601	3525	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	95.0	999.0
201601	3526	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for Briefing on Proposal for Fan Charts in the Summary of Economic Projections.”	95.0	999.0
201601	3527	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In broad terms, the addition of fan charts to the SEP would offer several benefits.	95.0	999.0
201601	3528	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	First, compared with the SEP’s current table 2, fan charts would more prominently— and therefore more effectively—communicate the broad magnitude of the uncertainty associated with participants’ projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3529	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Second, fan charts would clearly communicate that the differences in the forecasts of participants are modest compared with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3530	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, a fan chart for the federal funds rate would help market participants understand that the SEP numbers for the funds rate in no way reflect a commitment to a particular path, and that the actual path of appropriate policy will depend on economic developments.	95.0	999.0
201601	3531	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In light of these potential benefits, the staff has worked with the subcommittee on communications to examine a range of approaches to including fan charts in the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3532	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the basis of this examination and in consultation with the Chair, the subcommittee recommends that the Committee adopt, as Governor Fischer described, a relatively simple approach, one similar to those employed by a number of foreign central banks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3533	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll first review the proposal and then describe some of the alternative approaches that the subcommittee has considered.	95.0	999.0
201601	3534	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The proposed charts, provided in exhibit 1 of the handout, show median SEP forecasts surrounded by symmetric confidence intervals based on the historical root mean squared errors of private- and public-sector forecasts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3535	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The underlying root mean squared errors used to construct this chart are taken from the SEP’s current table 2, extended to include the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3536	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The fan charts deliberately show only 70 percent confidence bands, which suffice to communicate the uncertainty associated with the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3537	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Although the root mean squared errors could be used to form and report 90 percent confidence bands, the historical forecast errors provide relatively few observations of tail occurrences, and the normality of the forecast errors that’s required under a root-mean-squared-error-based approach could be an approximation that’s much less accurate with a 90 percent confidence interval than with a 70 percent interval.	95.0	999.0
201601	3538	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	This proposed approach offers simplicity along several dimensions:  The charts would be straightforward to construct from information already available and, for the most part, already used in the SEP; they would not require any additional information from FOMC participants; and they should be relatively easy to explain.	95.0	999.0
201601	3539	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	That said, the root-mean-squared-error-based approach raises several issues of implementation.	95.0	999.0
201601	3540	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	These issues were all discussed in the staff memo distributed to the Committee on January 11, but, in the interest of brevity, I’ll focus on two of them today.	95.0	999.0
201601	3541	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	First, the two components of the fan charts—median projections from the SEP and confidence intervals based on root mean squared errors from past forecasts—are conceptually different.	95.0	999.0
201601	3542	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The SEP numbers reflect each participant’s assessment of appropriate policy, not the modal path of policy as in the case of some of the forecasts that are used to calculate the root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3543	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	All of that said, the SEP medians are, in most circumstances, generally close to most participants’ expectations for the economy and the path of policy, and therefore the root mean squared errors underlying table 2 and the fan charts, while not strictly comparable, should provide a reasonable, approximate measure of the uncertainty associated with the median projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3544	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A second implementation issue is that, in past discussions of fan charts, some Committee participants have expressed misgivings about providing a fan chart for the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3545	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A funds rate fan chart could blur the distinction between views regarding appropriate policy and modal projections of the funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3546	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Not providing a fan chart for the funds rate could help maintain that distinction.	95.0	999.0
201601	3547	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the other hand, omitting a funds rate fan chart might increase the risk that some members of the public mistakenly view the projected path of the funds rate as a commitment.	95.0	999.0
201601	3548	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	For this reason, other participants have at times suggested that a fan chart for the funds rate would be particularly useful because it would help communicate that the appropriate policy rate path is quite uncertain and dependent on economic developments.	95.0	999.0
201601	3549	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In the subcommittee’s assessment of the merits of a fan chart covering the funds rate, these advantages are viewed as outweighing the concerns.	95.0	999.0
201601	3550	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	As part of the analysis that led to this recommendation of the simple approach that I’ve outlined, the subcommittee considered several other possible approaches to constructing the fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3551	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I’ll briefly describe these possible approaches, their potential advantages, and the subcommittee’s reasons for judging these approaches to be less desirable than the proposed approach, at least for now.	95.0	999.0
201601	3552	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Under the first alternative, confidence intervals surrounding the SEP medians could be constructed using the actual historical distributions of forecast errors—and by that I mean the percentiles of the forecast errors—instead of root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3553	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	This alternative approach would not require the assumptions of symmetry or normality that implicitly underlie the root-mean-squared-error-based approach.	95.0	999.0
201601	3554	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Confidence intervals based on the historical distributions of forecast errors could also be useful for capturing possible asymmetries in the forecast errors for the unemployment rate and the federal funds rate.	95.0	999.0
201601	3555	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But fan charts based on the historical distributions of errors could be somewhat more difficult to explain to the public than fan charts based on just root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3556	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	And, perhaps more important, the available data for quantifying the asymmetries from historical forecast errors may not be enough for the SEP fan charts to reliably represent these relevant asymmetries.	95.0	999.0
201601	3557	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Second, the fan charts could be based on forecast confidence intervals constructed from simulations of an econometric model or models.	95.0	999.0
201601	3558	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The model-based approach could be attractive for its structural approach to quantifying forecast uncertainty and for allowing these simulations to capture asymmetries due to the effective lower bound on interest rates.	95.0	999.0
201601	3559	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But against these advantages, the model-based approach could be seen as difficult to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3560	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Perhaps more important, this approach would make the fan charts model dependent, and it would require agreement on a model or models, including a policy rule or rules.	95.0	999.0
201601	3561	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The Committee’s past experiments with constructing a consensus forecast suggest participants may find it difficult to agree on a model and policy rule that could be used to construct such fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3562	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, fan charts could be constructed from participants’ subjective assessments of the uncertainty and risks associated with their projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3563	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A subjective approach could ensure that the fan charts capture the judgments of uncertainty and risks that contributed to the Committee’s policy decision at the meeting.	95.0	999.0
201601	3564	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	A subjective approach might also allow the confidence intervals to reflect assessments of appropriate policy rather than simply capture past forecast errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3565	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Notwithstanding these possible advantages, a subjective approach could present a number of difficulties.	95.0	999.0
201601	3566	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Most importantly, a number of participants would likely find the reporting requirements to be onerous, and some may be concerned about the reliability of any effort to translate subjective judgments of uncertainty and risks into quantitative measures.	95.0	999.0
201601	3567	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Finally, depending on implementation, fan charts based on subjective assessments could be difficult to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3568	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The subcommittee came to these conclusions in part on the basis of an evaluation of an approach sketched by the staff that involved giving SEP respondents the choice of either submitting their own numerical values for confidence intervals or allowing the staff to quantify confidence intervals implied by the historical root mean squared errors and answers to the existing questions about uncertainty and risks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3569	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Although each of these alternative approaches offers some advantages, after careful consideration, the subcommittee concluded that the relatively simple approach to fan charts based on the SEP medians and historical root mean squared errors was the most effective and would constitute a useful addition to Committee communications.	95.0	999.0
201601	3570	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If there was support for this approach, the subcommittee would plan to introduce the fan charts in the March SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3571	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	That concludes my prepared remarks, and I’d be happy to answer any questions you might have.	95.0	999.0
201601	3572	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Todd.	95.0	65.0
201601	3573	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to open it up for questions and comments.	95.0	65.0
201601	3574	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But before I do so, I’d like to note my own personal view, which is that the addition of the proposed fan charts to the SEP would serve as a useful enhancement to our communications tools.	95.0	65.0
201601	3575	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	For example, as you know, the number of increases in the federal funds rate during this year as embodied in the median SEP forecast has received quite a bit of attention of late, and discussions along those lines, I think, tend to reinforce the unhelpful and inaccurate view that we’ve embarked on a steady path of rate increases with little regard for how the economy will evolve.	95.0	65.0
201601	3576	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	In that sense, the fan charts would be useful in helping us communicate the uncertainty that’s associated with both our economic forecasts and the path for policy.	95.0	65.0
201601	3577	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I wanted to note that if this change is adopted today, I would plan to feature these fan charts in my press conference.	95.0	65.0
201601	3578	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	With that comment, let me stop there, and the floor is open for questions for Todd.	95.0	65.0
201601	3579	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	95.0	65.0
201601	3580	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3581	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Your comment on press conferences adjusts my question a little bit.	95.0	88.0
201601	3582	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	We use the word “public,” but I can’t remember any of my public ever asking me about the SEPs per se.	95.0	88.0
201601	3583	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we have any “click on” data as to how many people actually read the SEPs and therefore would see these fan charts?	95.0	88.0
201601	3584	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Do we track that?	95.0	999.0
201601	3585	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know if we track that.	95.0	999.0
201601	3586	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t know that we track it.	95.0	65.0
201601	3587	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In some of the Reserve Banks, we track what happens on our website.	95.0	88.0
201601	3588	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m sure we must be doing something like that here.	95.0	88.0
201601	3589	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we know how many people actually ever read this stuff?	95.0	88.0
201601	3590	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Of course, one purpose would be to use them at the press conference, so it wouldn’t just be through the website.	95.0	999.0
201601	3591	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Yes, and I acknowledge that.	95.0	88.0
201601	3592	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s why I mentioned it because, as you propose this, we’re talking about one additional figure that would be buried deep in the SEP.	95.0	65.0
201601	3593	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Right.	95.0	999.0
201601	3594	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It would appear in the “Uncertainty and Risks” section.	95.0	999.0
201601	3595	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It would be figure 4, following the first figure, which presents the median and the range of views; figure 2, on the funds rate; and figure 3, showing the histogram.	95.0	999.0
201601	3596	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Figure 4 would be covered in the section on uncertainty and risks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3597	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Right.	95.0	65.0
201601	3598	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That’s why I thought I would mention that if this change is adopted, we would modify the figure that I distribute at the press conference, which does get a lot of immediate attention.	95.0	65.0
201601	3599	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At present, it shows the median, the range, and the central tendency.	95.0	65.0
201601	3600	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We would include the fan charts in there.	95.0	65.0
201601	3601	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I think that’s quite relevant.	95.0	88.0
201601	3602	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	That’s pushing information out.	95.0	88.0
201601	3603	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This contrasts with just posting it and having someone click on it and read it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3604	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But my question preceded your comment, really, in thinking about it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3605	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Do we know who the public is for this?	95.0	88.0
201601	3606	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Certainly, people in markets look at this incredibly closely.	95.0	999.0
201601	3607	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	That’s one version of the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3608	2016-01-27	meeting	SMITH	And the media.	95.0	999.0
201601	3609	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Are you asking whether you can measure whether someone clicks on a figure?	95.0	91.0
201601	3610	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Because the SEPs are in the minutes, right?	95.0	91.0
201601	3611	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	95.0	65.0
201601	3612	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Well, the minutes get downloaded all of the time.	95.0	91.0
201601	3613	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Could you separate SEP views from the minutes generally?	95.0	91.0
201601	3614	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	95.0	65.0
201601	3615	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	The projection materials are, of course, published at the time of the press conference.	95.0	999.0
201601	3616	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	So for three weeks, the public will pick up, in particular, the dot plot from that place.	95.0	999.0
201601	3617	2016-01-27	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s where you’d find it.	95.0	999.0
201601	3618	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I get questions at every speech about the SEPs because I regularly try to inform people about the dot plot, just to share different perspectives.	95.0	91.0
201601	3619	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know about downloads, but in some of the public commentary, from the financial press and the economists, there is a tendency to focus on the range of views and confuse that with uncertainty.	95.0	999.0
201601	3620	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	To the extent that people pay attention to the fan charts, they would help clarify that this is the uncertainty—what you’re looking at is the range of views, and, in most cases, the disagreement in views is fairly small in relation to the uncertainty.	95.0	999.0
201601	3621	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll hold the reason why I’m asking until my comments in the go- round.	95.0	88.0
201601	3622	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Sure.	95.0	65.0
201601	3623	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other questions for Todd before we go to comments?	95.0	65.0
201601	3624	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3625	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s go to comments and start with President Mester.	95.0	65.0
201601	3626	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	999.0
201601	3627	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	First, I want to thank Todd Clark, Bill English, and the rest of the staff supporting the communications subcommittee for their work on this topic.	95.0	999.0
201601	3628	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	In some sense, the simple approach to fan charts being proposed belies the great deal of effort and analysis that went into coming up with the proposal.	95.0	999.0
201601	3629	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I’m going to tip my hand:  I personally see a lot of value in the SEPs, and I think adding the fan charts will be a very useful enhancement.	95.0	999.0
201601	3630	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We are somewhat behind other central banks.	95.0	999.0
201601	3631	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Most of them publish some type of fan chart.	95.0	999.0
201601	3632	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And, in the interest of transparency, I think the FOMC should convey to the public that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with our projections, just as it is true that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with private-sector and other central bank forecasts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3633	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	To me, we’re living in uncertain times.	95.0	999.0
201601	3634	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It seems like an important omission in the SEP not to include something about the uncertainty in an accessible way.	95.0	999.0
201601	3635	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It would help the public avoid confusing dispersion in the SEP forecasts with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3636	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Sometimes when I go out and talk, I know even I point to dispersion as a proxy for uncertainty, and it’s because we have little else to point to in the SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3637	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But, of course, this is misleading because, as Todd and Governor Fischer pointed out, the dispersion is actually pretty modest compared with the uncertainty associated with the projections.	95.0	999.0
201601	3638	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	A subtler benefit, which was noted by Governor Fischer, is that, over discussions even in the Committee, one of the criticisms of the SEP in the past has been that it tends to emphasize the differences across participants rather than convey a sense of the consensus view.	95.0	999.0
201601	3639	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	If we show the relatively wide uncertainty bands, I think it will help put the dispersion into better context.	95.0	999.0
201601	3640	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Since last summer, the subcommittee and the staff have evaluated a number of approaches to fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3641	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Some of them were suggested to us by FOMC participants, and these included the subjective approach that Todd mentioned.	95.0	999.0
201601	3642	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Going in, I had some sympathy for the subjective approach.	95.0	999.0
201601	3643	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But as we worked through it, I became convinced that, at this time, the simple approach would be preferable.	95.0	999.0
201601	3644	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We considered a number of different ways of thinking about the subjective approach, which would involve either participants providing their own confidence bands or, for participants who would feel uncomfortable doing that, having the staff map their qualitative assessments of risks and uncertainties that are already in the SEP into confidence bands using historical root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3645	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	But, in the end, we concluded that this would be somewhat complicated to explain to the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3646	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And if most responses ended up being based on historical root mean squared errors anyway, then the resulting fan charts would look very similar to the simple ones in the proposal.	95.0	999.0
201601	3647	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Going in—I’m coming clean here—I had some concerns about providing an error band surrounding the funds rate projection, because it would further blur the distinction that the funds rate projection is an assessment of appropriate policy and not a forecast.	95.0	999.0
201601	3648	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, the fan chart would be a very simple way to convey the message that there’s uncertainty associated with the appropriate policy rate path because the outlook is uncertain, and that the policy rate path in the SEP is not a commitment because it’s appropriate for policy to respond to shocks that materially change the outlook.	95.0	999.0
201601	3649	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So I became convinced that the benefit of providing the confidence band surrounding that funds rate projection was real.	95.0	999.0
201601	3650	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I also became convinced that we could handle, with appropriate wording in the exhibit and in the SEP text, the conceptual issue of the SEP reporting the appropriate, not necessarily the expected, policy rate path.	95.0	999.0
201601	3651	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Finally, no feasible approach to fan charts is perfect.	95.0	999.0
201601	3652	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I think we have to keep in mind that the goal of this project is to better communicate with the public.	95.0	999.0
201601	3653	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Currently, the SEP might be leading the public to underestimate both the degree of uncertainty associated with our projections and the data dependence of our policy rate path.	95.0	999.0
201601	3654	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The proposed approach, while imperfect, would alleviate these problems in a way that would be simple to implement and simple to explain.	95.0	999.0
201601	3655	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I support the proposal to add these fan charts to our next SEP submission in March, and I hope others on the Committee will, too.	95.0	999.0
201601	3656	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	999.0
201601	3657	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3658	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	95.0	65.0
201601	3659	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3660	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I know that a lot of work has preceded this recommendation, so thanks to Todd Clark, Bill English, and others, as well as the subcommittee for your good efforts.	95.0	88.0
201601	3661	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I realize that this is not a highly ambitious proposal.	95.0	88.0
201601	3662	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In my mind, it’s one to use pictures to make an already made and simple point to an audience that largely already knows it.	95.0	88.0
201601	3663	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I recently read the claim that more than half of brain activity is processing the visual, so maybe that’s just the reason to go ahead and do this.	95.0	88.0
201601	3664	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Nonetheless, I remain a bit of a skeptic of this communication tool, and let me explain why.	95.0	88.0
201601	3665	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I don’t see how presenting historical error bands derived from both internal and outside forecasts associated with our SEP medians provides useful additional information to our policy communication.	95.0	88.0
201601	3666	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The message that there is substantial inherent uncertainty associated with our forecast is already conveyed in the minutes.	95.0	88.0
201601	3667	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	In a world where every FOMC move is scrutinized for profound meaning, there is some risk that the historical forecast accuracy bands will be construed as reflecting how the Committee is viewing the risks to the outlook as of the SEP publication.	95.0	88.0
201601	3668	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	And this, of course, isn’t the case.	95.0	88.0
201601	3669	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As proposed, the error bands will likely show a nonnegligible chance that the economy will be near or in recession within the time frame of the forecast period.	95.0	88.0
201601	3670	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	The error bands will always show a significant chance that inflation will persistently deviate from our 2 percent objective.	95.0	88.0
201601	3671	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	This could be interpreted as weak commitment to achieving our inflation target.	95.0	88.0
201601	3672	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	If economic growth or inflation was to seem to be on a path that is materially off the median projection path, we know that such a deviation would likely trigger a mitigating policy response.	95.0	88.0
201601	3673	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Now, I acknowledge that many of these concerns about interpretation of the error bands are treated in the proposed appendix.	95.0	88.0
201601	3674	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	A careful reading of the appendix should clarify what the fan charts say and what they don’t say.	95.0	88.0
201601	3675	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	But I’m not sure we should expect a careful reading of the appendix to inform the less familiar reader of the SEP, and the reader who understands the fan charts at first glance already knows what we’re trying to convey.	95.0	88.0
201601	3676	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m not sure I see how emphasizing the inherent uncertainty of economic forecasts, which is a very broad assertion, serves a clear purpose in our communications design.	95.0	88.0
201601	3677	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	It seems like a lot of effort to dissuade people from attaching any significance to our forecast.	95.0	88.0
201601	3678	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said, I know the addition of the fan charts is not intended or expected to be a major communications move, but I’m not sure I see the payoff as greater than the problems that might be caused.	95.0	88.0
201601	3679	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	88.0
201601	3680	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3681	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3682	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to Todd, Bill, and others for all of the work that went into this.	95.0	107.0
201601	3683	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I’m also not enormously supportive of this proposal, although I do have sympathy with the underlying spirit of the proposal, which is to remind the public that any forecast is subject to very large uncertainty bands.	95.0	107.0
201601	3684	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I believe the text that accompanies the SEP already does that.	95.0	107.0
201601	3685	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s worth noting that people have made a lot of references to other central banks.	95.0	107.0
201601	3686	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The other central banks that do present fan charts when they display their forecasts are generally using either consensus forecasts or staff forecasts.	95.0	107.0
201601	3687	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	They’re actual forecasts.	95.0	107.0
201601	3688	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The SEP is quite different; it, obviously, is not a forecast.	95.0	107.0
201601	3689	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s a scatterplot of individual member projections.	95.0	107.0
201601	3690	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The median isn’t comparable to a consensus forecast.	95.0	107.0
201601	3691	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I think there is important information content in seeing the range of differences among Committee participants and the median.	95.0	107.0
201601	3692	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	And most of the people who care deeply about the SEP put a lot of time and resources into understanding the nature of the information that’s being provided.	95.0	107.0
201601	3693	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, as I think was said previously, it’s not obvious what additional information content superimposing errors from other forecasts provides.	95.0	107.0
201601	3694	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	The discomfort is particularly acute with regard to the projected path of the policy rate, due both to the asymmetry associated with the effective lower bound and to the fact that this is a policy instrument over which the Committee has some control rather than an exogenous economic variable.	95.0	107.0
201601	3695	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	But I also have concerns even on some of the economic variables.	95.0	107.0
201601	3696	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	For instance, if I think about inflation right now and I just read some of the text in the most recent SEP surrounding members’ views about the distribution of uncertainty, I think it would be skewed to the downside, whereas these bands, as I understand it, would be, by construction, symmetric.	95.0	107.0
201601	3697	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Again, I do see the value of the underlying desire here to remind everybody how much uncertainty there is regarding our projections.	95.0	107.0
201601	3698	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Perhaps we should spend a bit of time on subjective probabilities.	95.0	107.0
201601	3699	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It does sound like a lot of work, but maybe before going in this direction, we should at least see further work on what that would look like, because it might be a better representation of additional information to provide to the public.	95.0	107.0
201601	3700	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	95.0	107.0
201601	3701	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3702	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3703	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	94.0
201601	3704	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I also appreciate the work of the communications subcommittee and the staff on this subject, which I think is a complicated subject for the Committee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3705	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do support the proposal as laid out by the communications subcommittee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3706	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I consider it very important to represent uncertainty when we’re communicating to the public.	95.0	94.0
201601	3707	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with President Lockhart that maybe a picture is worth a thousand words.	95.0	94.0
201601	3708	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m uncomfortable with either the staff here at this meeting or us communicating anything to the public without putting something around the median projection that shows the amount of uncertainty, because, in general, the public tends to underappreciate the amount of uncertainty associated with economic outlooks.	95.0	94.0
201601	3709	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	You can say in words that, okay, this is very uncertain.	95.0	94.0
201601	3710	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	They might add ½ percent and subtract ½ percent when they should be adding 6 percent and subtracting 6 percent.	95.0	94.0
201601	3711	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it’s very important to make moves in this direction.	95.0	94.0
201601	3712	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Now, I understand that any construction of uncertainty bands will have some inconsistencies.	95.0	94.0
201601	3713	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I think the subcommittee has taken an expedient approach here to get a first pass.	95.0	94.0
201601	3714	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We could do more later, depending on our experience with it if we use it at the March meeting.	95.0	94.0
201601	3715	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee has done a good job of making the tradeoffs and thinking carefully about this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3716	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I do think it gets us closer to meeting an international standard on this dimension.	95.0	94.0
201601	3717	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I agree that we don’t have a consensus forecast.	95.0	94.0
201601	3718	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I would like to work toward that.	95.0	94.0
201601	3719	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve proposed that in the past for this Committee.	95.0	94.0
201601	3720	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I understand that it’s a hard thing for us to do, but that shouldn’t preclude us from trying to represent the uncertainty about our projections.	95.0	94.0
201601	3721	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it’s an improvement.	95.0	94.0
201601	3722	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I also agree with Governor Brainard that maybe we should look at the possibility of a subjective probability in the future.	95.0	94.0
201601	3723	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure everyone will like it, because you do have to answer questions about upper and lower bounds and about what you think can happen.	95.0	94.0
201601	3724	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	That’s not the easiest thing to do, and it would make more work for all of us and all of our staffs.	95.0	94.0
201601	3725	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	But maybe that would be a truer representation within the SEP context of the uncertainty that’s surrounding those kinds of projections.	95.0	94.0
201601	3726	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	With that, I do support the proposal.	95.0	94.0
201601	3727	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	94.0
201601	3728	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	3729	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	95.0	65.0
201601	3730	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	91.0
201601	3731	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I started off thinking I don’t have a strong opinion about the inclusion of fan charts in the SEP.	95.0	91.0
201601	3732	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I guess the idea that they don’t do any harm would make them sort of okay.	95.0	91.0
201601	3733	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have to admit that Governor Brainard’s comments about the symmetry of the bands surrounding the projection is something I need to think carefully about.	95.0	91.0
201601	3734	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	If that were to get in the way of our commentary about how we see the balance of risks as skewed in one direction and if, all of a sudden, people get confused about our comments about the balance of risks compared with this fan chart, the visual, that would be a concern.	95.0	91.0
201601	3735	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I tended to think, coming in, that for the knowledgeable reader, the fan charts are a reasonable way of illustrating the uncertainties already presented in table 2 of the SEP, in which we give error bands.	95.0	91.0
201601	3736	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	And I agree with the recommendation to construct them using the median projections and the historical root mean squared errors for a range of public and private forecasts, as we already do in table 2.	95.0	91.0
201601	3737	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Simple is best.	95.0	91.0
201601	3738	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I certainly take that point.	95.0	91.0
201601	3739	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But the thing that does make me nervous is a technical point.	95.0	91.0
201601	3740	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	There’s a difference between reporting error bands in the table and putting it in a chart where we’re giving a composite hypothesis–type of projection, and I think that can be misleading.	95.0	91.0
201601	3741	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I have concerns that less knowledgeable readers may view any outcome that falls within the fan as being equally likely.	95.0	91.0
201601	3742	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Now, I expressed that to my staff, and they made fun of me because any line is zero probability.	95.0	91.0
201601	3743	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	They’re all sort of the same.	95.0	91.0
201601	3744	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But if you tried to construct some composite hypothesis and do some counting, the ones closest to the median would be higher likelihood than the ones farther apart.	95.0	91.0
201601	3745	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	But you look at the fan, and it seems as though they both had that interpretation.	95.0	91.0
201601	3746	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I would support conveying in some way that outcomes closer to the median are more likely than those toward the edges of the fan.	95.0	91.0
201601	3747	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	To the knowledgeable readers, that sounds silly, but to the ones whom I’m worried about, maybe not.	95.0	91.0
201601	3748	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	One way would be to note this in the explanatory text.	95.0	91.0
201601	3749	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Another way would be to show multiple probability bands, as some other central banks do, using the same methods that you do.	95.0	91.0
201601	3750	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I think this is manageable without any added work.	95.0	91.0
201601	3751	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	It would just be shading a little bit differently, with exactly the same calculations but 30 percent—whatever the choices would be.	95.0	91.0
201601	3752	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Maybe that would help.	95.0	91.0
201601	3753	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Given our expected knowledgeable readership for this communications vehicle, I’m reasonably fine with the proposal, although, as I say, Governor Brainard’s comments about the risk assessment—or my interpretation of them—do make me a little nervous.	95.0	91.0
201601	3754	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	95.0	91.0
201601	3755	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	95.0	65.0
201601	3756	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	95.0	111.0
201601	3757	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I support the proposed changes.	95.0	111.0
201601	3758	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And I’ll just observe that, in my first meeting, I’m getting a sense of the complexity that the subcommittee on communications is dealing with.	95.0	111.0
201601	3759	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	You ain’t seen nothing yet.	95.0	97.0
201601	3760	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	95.0	97.0
201601	3761	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	But you have my great admiration, for, as you all are trying to balance the various tradeoffs, there are no easy answers.	95.0	111.0
201601	3762	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	I’ll just offer my observation with humility because I’m sure you’ve thought about these things before.	95.0	111.0
201601	3763	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	The only concern I have is that I can envision a time when we may want to use forward policy guidance and we do not want to show such wide ranges on the expected outlook for the federal funds rate, and this could then be constraining in such a scenario.	95.0	111.0
201601	3764	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	So I like Stan’s suggestion to start simple and maybe add complexity over time.	95.0	111.0
201601	3765	2016-01-27	meeting	KASHKARI	And if there was a way to embody the Committee’s actual outlook of uncertainty, that may be helpful so that we’re not constraining ourselves in the future.	95.0	111.0
201601	3766	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	3767	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	95.0	65.0
201601	3768	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	104.0
201601	3769	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I would like to add my support for the proposal.	95.0	104.0
201601	3770	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	The addition of fan charts would pictorially emphasize uncertainty regarding macroeconomic projections and hence for the path of the policy rate.	95.0	104.0
201601	3771	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	It would also show that the uncertainty associated with the forecast is much greater than the dispersion of participants’ views, which I think may be less well understood than some other things.	95.0	104.0
201601	3772	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	I’m also pleased that the subcommittee has taken a minimalist approach here, keeping it simple and avoiding difficult methodological and communications issues that lurk if one tries to do too much.	95.0	104.0
201601	3773	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	So I do think that this approach is the most straightforward one to implement and the least likely to leave the public confused.	95.0	104.0
201601	3774	2016-01-27	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	104.0
201601	3775	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3776	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	95.0	65.0
201601	3777	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	102.0
201601	3778	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I, too, support the proposal.	95.0	102.0
201601	3779	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, Governor Brainard laid out the challenges on this matter that we discussed at length.	95.0	102.0
201601	3780	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	As Todd and President Mester mentioned, we went back and forth on issues related to the various approaches that we could try to get at subjective assessments of the risks, those concerning the effective lower bound, and many of the other issues that have been brought up.	95.0	102.0
201601	3781	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, what we’re trying to accomplish here is something very simple, at least as a first step, and that is to get the point of data dependence out there as clearly as possible.	95.0	102.0
201601	3782	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, you look at the median in the SEP, and it says you raise rates n times during a certain period, and all of the attention in the media and the markets is on the number n.	95.0	102.0
201601	3783	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	The idea here is to say, “Yes, we think there’s an appropriate policy rate path, but that’s going to depend on what happens with economic growth, what happens with unemployment, and what happens with inflation.”	95.0	102.0
201601	3784	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s what any good policy strategy would have, and the path of policy will depend on economic circumstances, either up or down.	95.0	102.0
201601	3785	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s really all we’re accomplishing with this proposal, in my personal view.	95.0	102.0
201601	3786	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This issue of bringing in subjective views is really important because we do already have in the SEP a description of people’s assessment of the risks both in terms of the magnitude and in terms of the direction.	95.0	102.0
201601	3787	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Here we basically are punting on that and saying this is only describing the normal historical relationship, and the SEP would still contain the discussion of whether the current circumstances are different from the past 20 years.	95.0	102.0
201601	3788	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, I think the idea of trying to collect better subjective information or something that could be quantitative about the assessment of the magnitude and the direction of the risks is an important step forward.	95.0	102.0
201601	3789	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do struggle with how to aggregate subjective views.	95.0	102.0
201601	3790	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We got to the median as a way to capture the center of the participants, but then, when you look over the history of the SEP, you’ll see that there’s a wide divergence of views about both the magnitude and the direction of the risks relative to history.	95.0	102.0
201601	3791	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s rare that we all—all 19, using David Wilcox’s number of views, or whatever number of views there are in this room—agree that the risks are to one side or the other or where they are.	95.0	102.0
201601	3792	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think how to say “Here’s a median forecast, and then here’s a median assessment of the risks” actually doesn’t work, because often it may be five or six people in the Committee who think the risks are to the downside.	95.0	102.0
201601	3793	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	So the median, of course, would be neutral.	95.0	102.0
201601	3794	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	We do need to think about how to capture this information more effectively, and we couldn’t figure it out, at least so far.	95.0	102.0
201601	3795	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	This baby step, if you will, is to try to have both—the historical pattern of uncertainty along with the verbal description of the risks.	95.0	102.0
201601	3796	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the end, I agree with President Bullard about the long-run goal I still hold to—maybe we’re the two left—that a consensus forecast and a way of representing the consensus views on the risks would be a great place to land at the end.	95.0	102.0
201601	3797	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know that’s been really hard in the past.	95.0	102.0
201601	3798	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I know the staff cringes whenever I even say the term “consensus forecast.”	95.0	102.0
201601	3799	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	I can see Dave Reifschneider and David Wilcox not appreciating my perspective on this, but I do think the median forecast has already helped a bit to show that this may not be a terrible representation of the center of the Committee.	95.0	102.0
201601	3800	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I think maybe further work that we do in terms of describing the uncertainty will help us down the road toward what I think is the right ultimate goal, which is to have some way of representing quantitatively the views of the Committee.	95.0	102.0
201601	3801	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, I support this first baby step, at least, on that longer road.	95.0	102.0
201601	3802	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	95.0	102.0
201601	3803	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	95.0	65.0
201601	3804	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	96.0
201601	3805	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly see some benefit of adding fan charts to the SEP as proposed.	95.0	96.0
201601	3806	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The fan charts would emphasize that the SEP numbers just comprise a modal forecast, one of many possible outcomes.	95.0	96.0
201601	3807	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The charts would also emphasize that at longer time horizons, the level of uncertainty is very high.	95.0	96.0
201601	3808	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I am willing to go along with this proposal.	95.0	96.0
201601	3809	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I do have some concerns that I want to share with the Committee.	95.0	96.0
201601	3810	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The first one is, because the widths of the fan charts are based on historical experience and are unconditional, they’re not really very informative.	95.0	96.0
201601	3811	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They don’t take into consideration where you actually are on the business cycle and in terms of all of the other factors that are influencing the outcome.	95.0	96.0
201601	3812	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re also going to change very slowly over time.	95.0	96.0
201601	3813	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Each quarter, you’re going to publish a fan chart that looks essentially just like the fan chart from the last quarter.	95.0	96.0
201601	3814	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So they don’t really contain a lot of information beyond the first time you put them out.	95.0	96.0
201601	3815	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The second concern is that I’m a little bit less convinced than others about this difficulty of doing subjective histograms based on what people think about uncertainty, because we actually do this in our surveys of the primary dealers and the buy-side participants, and they seem able to construct these histograms.	95.0	96.0
201601	3816	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I find it a little odd that we’re asking others to construct histograms, but we say ourselves that we can’t do it.	95.0	96.0
201601	3817	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you were asked that question at the press conference, Madam Chair, I wonder how you would answer that.	95.0	96.0
201601	3818	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	The third concern is what President Kashkari raised.	95.0	96.0
201601	3819	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think when we’re at the effective lower bound and issuing forward guidance with a commitment, I don’t know what the fan chart for the federal funds rate means in that context.	95.0	96.0
201601	3820	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s very odd to have this wide fan chart for the federal funds rate when we’re actually saying something that contradicts that.	95.0	96.0
201601	3821	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Another issue I have with the fan chart for the federal funds rate is, let’s say we’re at the lower bound, should the fan chart go below zero or not?	95.0	96.0
201601	3822	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s actually pretty tricky.	95.0	96.0
201601	3823	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think it should go below zero, you’re tacitly conceding that our target federal funds rate could go negative.	95.0	96.0
201601	3824	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If you don’t put it below zero, you’re essentially tacitly communicating that negative interest rates aren’t on the table.	95.0	96.0
201601	3825	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel that where you draw that lower bound on the federal funds rate chart is not completely irrelevant in terms of how we communicate.	95.0	96.0
201601	3826	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, in the appendix, you can explain why you’ve done it the way you’ve done it, but whether people will read the appendix and fully appreciate that is a question.	95.0	96.0
201601	3827	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the histograms, I feel much more strongly about the federal funds rate projections than those for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.	95.0	96.0
201601	3828	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the biggest difficulties with these fan charts lie in the federal funds rate, as opposed to the real economic variables.	95.0	96.0
201601	3829	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the federal funds rate is more germane to us, because this is something we actually actively control.	95.0	96.0
201601	3830	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	So I guess I would like to see us try to do a dry run of histograms for the federal funds rate to see what they look like and how they compare with fan charts that were done on the root-mean-squared-error basis.	95.0	96.0
201601	3831	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d just like to see what they looked like.	95.0	96.0
201601	3832	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If they were better, then we could move to that approach, and if not, we could discard them.	95.0	96.0
201601	3833	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would anybody else like to comment?	95.0	65.0
201601	3834	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	95.0	81.0
201601	3835	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	95.0	65.0
201601	3836	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I support the idea of fan charts.	95.0	81.0
201601	3837	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I just want to talk about forward guidance and commitment.	95.0	81.0
201601	3838	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we’ve ever provided forward guidance with commitment.	95.0	81.0
201601	3839	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	We’ve been very careful to word our forward guidance as a prediction about what our future selves will do.	95.0	81.0
201601	3840	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In that instance, I think a fan chart is perfectly appropriate.	95.0	81.0
201601	3841	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	In fact, the fan chart would provide a great way to signal when we do choose to provide forward guidance with commitment, because then we would omit the fan.	95.0	81.0
201601	3842	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would anyone—Todd, Stan, or anyone on the subcommittee—like to comment further on the issues?	95.0	65.0
201601	3843	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	One intermediate approach could be to add the funds rate to the set of questions that the Committee is asked their subjective views on, but not quantify it.	95.0	999.0
201601	3844	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	You’re currently asked whether the risk is balanced, to the upside, or to the downside for economic growth and inflation.	95.0	999.0
201601	3845	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	We don’t ask about the funds rate, so adding the funds rate to that set of questions could be a vehicle for providing the fan chart as the historical stuff and still have this discussion of our subjective views.	95.0	999.0
201601	3846	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	When the two are out of line, we would say they’re out of line:  This is the Committee’s judgment, and this is the historical stuff.	95.0	999.0
201601	3847	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	So it could be an intermediate way of not requiring people to provide a probability distribution for the funds rate but still give us a subjective way of communicating, for example, forward guidance having implications or the lower bound having implications.	95.0	999.0
201601	3848	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I’d also be interested in seeing people’s subjective assessment of the federal funds rate path even if we didn’t actually share it with the public.	95.0	96.0
201601	3849	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s useful information for the Committee, in my opinion.	95.0	96.0
201601	3850	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	95.0	65.0
201601	3851	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, the comments are very interesting, and most of them are things we thought about in the course of trying to figure out what to recommend.	95.0	108.0
201601	3852	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	The staff that was working with us, and probably the whole staff, is incredibly inventive, and you can get charts that reflect bias or direction of the risk, downward or upward.	95.0	108.0
201601	3853	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You could also ask people for their distributions using histograms, as Bill Dudley suggests.	95.0	108.0
201601	3854	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve also heard people say that it’s an illusion to think the dealers are filling in those forms; they have a staff who fills in the forms for them.	95.0	108.0
201601	3855	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s usually the desk economist who sits at the fixed- income trading desk who does those forms, typically.	95.0	96.0
201601	3856	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Their backgrounds aren’t that dissimilar to our backgrounds.	95.0	96.0
201601	3857	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Some of our backgrounds.	95.0	65.0
201601	3858	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Some of our backgrounds.	95.0	108.0
201601	3859	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But I do suggest that we go ahead with this, and that we really take into account the questions that have arisen and that we reflect.	95.0	108.0
201601	3860	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll come back to it in about six months’ time and ask you to fill in two other questionnaires:  One will ask you things about what we might want to put into the next one, and the other will ask about what comments you have on what we’ve done.	95.0	108.0
201601	3861	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll see if we can get better the next time we revise it, which would be somewhere down the road.	95.0	108.0
201601	3862	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	That’s the request I’d make.	95.0	108.0
201601	3863	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to Dennis Lockhart’s question, how many hits this will get?	95.0	108.0
201601	3864	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I think once the Chair is talking about it, the answer is “It’s millions,” particularly if it’s the Chair’s press conferences and if the media wants to pick that up.	95.0	108.0
201601	3865	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	I exaggerate with “millions” probably, but it’ll get a lot of attention, and then we can seek to improve it.	95.0	108.0
201601	3866	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3867	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Yes.	95.0	107.0
201601	3868	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I was reflecting on Bill Dudley’s last comment and the reality that March is going to be a very complicated time for policy, regardless.	95.0	107.0
201601	3869	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	I wonder whether it might be possible to leave off the federal funds rate initially and give some further thought to it, because right now, you’ve made a pretty consequential decision to cut off the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound, so that’s an important message that we would be conveying to the market.	95.0	107.0
201601	3870	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Maybe that’s what we want to do, but I wonder, if this is not essential for March, whether you might want to phase it and do your economic variables in March and give further thought to the federal funds rate.	95.0	107.0
201601	3871	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If I can clarify something, the current chart for the current target of the funds rate is not actually cut off.	95.0	999.0
201601	3872	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Oh, I’m just looking at this picture.	95.0	107.0
201601	3873	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It looks like it is, but it’s not—Bill can correct me if I’m wrong.	95.0	999.0
201601	3874	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	On the basis of the rise in rates in December and the future path with historical accuracy, we get very close to zero, but we are above zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3875	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	And then the text, in the mad rush to get things out, didn’t get fully revised to go from the previous SEP to that SEP.	95.0	999.0
201601	3876	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	So it is really close to zero, and we describe in the text that we think we would impose zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3877	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	But in that chart, we don’t actually have to impose zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3878	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the path came down, then—	95.0	96.0
201601	3879	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	If the path came down again—	95.0	999.0
201601	3880	2016-01-27	meeting	ENGLISH	If the Committee was to choose to not truncate and allow the bottom of that fan chart to go below zero—	95.0	999.0
201601	3881	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a consequential decision either way, though.	95.0	96.0
201601	3882	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s the problem.	95.0	96.0
201601	3883	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s consequential.	95.0	107.0
201601	3884	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	Do we really need to add that to the set of decisions?	95.0	107.0
201601	3885	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think doing it in two phases is pretty difficult and hard to communicate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3886	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So I do worry about introducing the first three, and then, at some later date, adding the federal funds rate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3887	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I think the issue of whether the band potentially goes below zero is important.	95.0	65.0
201601	3888	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did the subcommittee have a strong view that it should not go below zero?	95.0	65.0
201601	3889	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Can I just make a clarifying point?	95.0	999.0
201601	3890	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	I think a literal interpretation of these bands is that, without any elaboration, they would imply that there’s a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could be open to that interpretation—a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could go above or below the band.	95.0	999.0
201601	3891	2016-01-27	meeting	WILCOX	Is that correct?	95.0	999.0
201601	3892	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Yes, that is correct.	95.0	999.0
201601	3893	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	In the example sketched in the appendix to the memo, the SEP would have text saying, “We would choose to cut this off at zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	3894	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The Committee has not previously set the target for the federal funds rate below zero,” and leave it at that.	95.0	999.0
201601	3895	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Now, it would be possible to go further and address that point.	95.0	999.0
201601	3896	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You could add a sentence saying that, without any commitment either way as to whether, in the future, the FOMC might or might not go outside this range.	95.0	108.0
201601	3897	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And the FOMC has taken quantitative easing measures, which could be interpreted as essentially the response when it would call for a below-zero rate.	95.0	65.0
201601	3898	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Presumably, you could clarify some of that in the verbal description in the appendix.	95.0	65.0
201601	3899	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, do you want to say something?	95.0	65.0
201601	3900	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’m waiting to see which direction we’re headed here.	95.0	97.0
201601	3901	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	95.0	65.0
201601	3902	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, I have just a thought on this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3903	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee has discussed the possibility of a negative policy rate during the past five years.	95.0	94.0
201601	3904	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We kicked it around, there are pros and cons, but the Committee never came down and actually did that.	95.0	94.0
201601	3905	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So I think that, at this point, you probably would cut it off, saying the Committee has not done that up to now.	95.0	94.0
201601	3906	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	We reserve the right, of course, to do that in the future.	95.0	94.0
201601	3907	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But, presumably, the text would indicate that this is a convention and has no significance in terms of the Committee’s policy options or intentions, that you’ve used a mechanical approach.	95.0	65.0
201601	3908	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	The other option, which I don’t think the Committee would want to do, would be to follow the approach of the central banks that publish policy rate fan charts.	95.0	999.0
201601	3909	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	Two of them, the Norges Bank and the Riksbank, just publish a fan that’s plus or minus root mean squared errors.	95.0	999.0
201601	3910	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	It goes below zero, and then, in the text, they say that this does not reflect asymmetries in the policy rate or constraints associated with the lower bound that we think may apply.	95.0	999.0
201601	3911	2016-01-27	meeting	CLARK	I don’t know if the Committee would desire that, but there is some precedent.	95.0	999.0
201601	3912	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Did you consider that approach?	95.0	65.0
201601	3913	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because that that might be a reasonable alternative.	95.0	65.0
201601	3914	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	95.0	65.0
201601	3915	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I must admit listening to this, I am troubled about the federal funds rate, because I do think it is dramatically and completely different than forecasting exogenous factors.	95.0	110.0
201601	3916	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Forecasting the federal funds rate is basically, what do I predict I might do, and all of you around this table will do, in reaction to exogenous factors?	95.0	110.0
201601	3917	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	My concern is, we’re in an extremely sensitive period here in the next three to six months.	95.0	110.0
201601	3918	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t want to gum up the works, but it certainly seems to me, the risk/reward of getting this wrong is definitely asymmetrical.	95.0	110.0
201601	3919	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I would rather do a dry run, give the Committee a chance to look at sample charts on the federal funds rate in March, and have another bite at this.	95.0	110.0
201601	3920	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m sensitive to all the work that’s been done and how difficult it is to get a consensus, but the risks associated with this strike me as so asymmetrical.	95.0	110.0
201601	3921	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is such a critical measure and one that we’re in control of.	95.0	110.0
201601	3922	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I do think it is different than forecasting exogenous factors.	95.0	110.0
201601	3923	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3924	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard, go ahead.	95.0	65.0
201601	3925	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	To respond to President Kaplan, sure, we control the funds rate, but we’re also reacting to the other data.	95.0	94.0
201601	3926	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	So if the other data come in in an extreme way, then you’re going to choose a different value for the funds rate.	95.0	94.0
201601	3927	2016-01-27	meeting	BULLARD	This is representing that kind of uncertainty, which I thought was the point of this.	95.0	94.0
201601	3928	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Except it’s different from every other factor because it’s a decision that we actually will make here.	95.0	110.0
201601	3929	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	Better yet, voters rotate.	95.0	110.0
201601	3930	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You have a lot of other factors that we all, again, as a group are in control of.	95.0	110.0
201601	3931	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s a different kind of factor to me.	95.0	110.0
201601	3932	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m not saying it should be treated differently, but I’d want to make sure we had a conviction around the table before we did this.	95.0	110.0
201601	3933	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	95.0	65.0
201601	3934	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Rob, the forecasters are forecasting, and some of them—very few— forecast the federal funds rate.	95.0	108.0
201601	3935	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	But they forecast short-term rates that are very close to the federal funds rate, and they are aware of all of the factors you’ve mentioned—there’s rotation on this Committee, et cetera.	95.0	108.0
201601	3936	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yet they produce forecasts, and those forecasts will be the basis of the root mean squared errors that we use.	95.0	108.0
201601	3937	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	So I see that it’s different.	95.0	108.0
201601	3938	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	As you were talking, I was reflecting on an obituary yesterday in the New York Times for a guy called Marvin Minsky, who was a computer-thinking founder who said he made the critical breakthrough when he persuaded his colleagues that human beings think like machines think, or that machines think like human beings think.	95.0	108.0
201601	3939	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And here we are—we’re thinking in a particular way.	95.0	108.0
201601	3940	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’re predictable.	95.0	108.0
201601	3941	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	It might not look like it, but we are, and I don’t see what the huge difference is.	95.0	108.0
201601	3942	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We react to the environment, we react to each other, and we’re probably fairly predictable, if we’re good at it.	95.0	108.0
201601	3943	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I guess I’m responding to the fact that this was done by the subcommittee on communications, which means this is more about communication than anything else, and I’m coming at it from that point of view.	95.0	110.0
201601	3944	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	We may have conviction in this room, but as it is a PR communication issue, I think some good points have been raised.	95.0	110.0
201601	3945	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	To me, as we’re not under pressure to do this, I just want to make sure we’re comfortable.	95.0	110.0
201601	3946	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	This is a process point I’m raising.	95.0	110.0
201601	3947	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	You may be right and probably are, but I don’t want to create a self- inflicted wound, how’s that?	95.0	110.0
201601	3948	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I hear you.	95.0	65.0
201601	3949	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo, did you want to weigh in?	95.0	65.0
201601	3950	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	I’d like to associate myself with President Kaplan’s position.	95.0	97.0
201601	3951	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody else want to weigh in?	95.0	65.0
201601	3952	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I think some good points have been raised that require a bit of thought.	95.0	65.0
201601	3953	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Madam Chair, they’ve had a bit of thought.	95.0	108.0
201601	3954	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	3955	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, they have.	95.0	65.0
201601	3956	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, I think what I’d like to do is take a straw poll and get a sense of where the Committee is.	95.0	65.0
201601	3957	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We normally decide these matters by taking straw polls of all participants, and I’d like to get a sense of the overall view and the level of concern about this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3958	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps rather than utterly decide every detail about how we’re going to go forward, after seeing what the straw vote looks like, we could sit down and talk again with the members of the subcommittee and the staff about whether there are some changes we can make in the approach, and, in particular, what I present in the press conference, which is going to be important, and we haven’t quite decided that.	95.0	65.0
201601	3959	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe some changes are appropriate or some thought needs to go into that.	95.0	65.0
201601	3960	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But I’d like to take a straw poll.	95.0	65.0
201601	3961	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Can I see how many people would like to go forward with implementing the approach that the subcommittee has recommended?	95.0	65.0
201601	3962	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair, I’m sorry.	95.0	97.0
201601	3963	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	Could you state what the other position will be?	95.0	97.0
201601	3964	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	That you would not want to proceed with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3965	2016-01-27	meeting	TARULLO	At this time.	95.0	97.0
201601	3966	2016-01-27	meeting	HARKER	Yes, at this time.	95.0	999.0
201601	3967	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	In March.	95.0	107.0
201601	3968	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At this time.	95.0	65.0
201601	3969	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Although I think it’s March versus potentially later, right?	95.0	96.0
201601	3970	2016-01-27	meeting	BRAINARD	That’s right.	95.0	107.0
201601	3971	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, maybe we should take that as a separate question.	95.0	65.0
201601	3972	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	95.0	96.0
201601	3973	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we take the timing as separate question—whether we go forward in March, which is a consequential meeting, obviously, or we wait until a later time to move forward with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	3974	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Madam Chair, I think the issue that was raised was that there are some questions to wrestle with.	95.0	96.0
201601	3975	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think some people prefer to wrestle with those questions and answer them definitively, with the presumption that they’ll probably move affirmatively, versus just deciding now to move forward in March.	95.0	96.0
201601	3976	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That seems to be the real question.	95.0	96.0
201601	3977	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I didn’t get a strong sense that people are opposed to this, but I think there are some questions that people feel they really want to make sure are answered correctly, versus just going ahead with this proposal in March.	95.0	96.0
201601	3978	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Those do seem to be the two choices as I hear them.	95.0	96.0
201601	3979	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I agree with Bill.	95.0	91.0
201601	3980	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	You’re okay with that?	95.0	65.0
201601	3981	2016-01-27	meeting	KAPLAN	I think it captures the discussion.	95.0	110.0
201601	3982	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3983	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So let me, then, first ask, how many people would like to go ahead in March to implement the proposal the subcommittee has recommended?	95.0	65.0
201601	3984	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	At least one alternative, which I’ll next ask about, is, how many people are favorably inclined toward going ahead but feel we should wait until a later date and sort out some of the questions on how we would approach this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3985	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	So, first, how many people would like to simply go ahead in March as proposed?	95.0	65.0
201601	3986	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3987	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3988	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	How many people are supportive of this approach in introducing fan charts but would like to wait to think through some of the questions that have been raised, such as, on the symmetry issue, should fan charts go below zero as well as should we necessarily include a funds rate fan chart?	95.0	65.0
201601	3989	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would think through, perhaps a little bit more carefully, exactly what I would present at the press conference, versus what would go into the SEP when it’s published in the minutes.	95.0	65.0
201601	3990	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to see how many people would prefer to wait and think this through a bit more.	95.0	65.0
201601	3991	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3992	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	3993	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And then, finally, is there anybody who thinks that this is just a bad idea—that we should not add fan charts and be done with this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3994	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Because we have considered this on many previous occasions.	95.0	65.0
201601	3995	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I would really not be willing to ask the subcommittee, which has done a huge amount of work and thought through a lot of issues, to go back and try to formulate a totally new proposal.	95.0	65.0
201601	3996	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Ironing out a few details is one thing I would be inclined to ask the subcommittee to do, but going back and considering a significantly different approach, I wouldn’t.	95.0	65.0
201601	3997	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would just like to can this?	95.0	65.0
201601	3998	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	95.0	65.0
201601	3999	2016-01-27	meeting	LOCKHART	I have to be consistent with what I said earlier, so I’ll put my finger up.	95.0	88.0
201601	4000	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4001	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I guess I see a sufficient amount of discomfort with simply forging ahead with this in March to feel comfortable concluding that we should do that.	95.0	65.0
201601	4002	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And I would suggest that we sit down and discuss the issues that have been raised and how we might address them, and then we can return with a revised proposal on how we’re going to do that.	95.0	65.0
201601	4003	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	What did he put it up for?	95.0	108.0
201601	4004	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	To can it.	95.0	65.0
201601	4005	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	If I could just interject one final thing.	95.0	96.0
201601	4006	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this issue about whether we’re potentially willing to entertain a negative federal funds rate is important to this discussion.	95.0	96.0
201601	4007	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, you can’t do it just as a communication issue unless you actually know—	95.0	96.0
201601	4008	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	The answer.	95.0	90.0
201601	4009	2016-01-27	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	95.0	90.0
201601	4010	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	—what people think about that possibility.	95.0	96.0
201601	4011	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Bill, I don’t think that’s true.	95.0	108.0
201601	4012	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	You can simply make a statement that there has been no decision on this issue, and they haven’t been used in the past.	95.0	108.0
201601	4013	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the Committee felt that this is something that just was ruled off the table, that could inform what kind of fan chart one would want to show for the federal funds rate, versus if the Committee decided this is something that’s very definitely potentially on the table, that could inform a different decision on the fan charts.	95.0	96.0
201601	4014	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s all I’m saying.	95.0	96.0
201601	4015	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We can draw a chart that is under specified assumptions, which we will say do not represent a Committee decision.	95.0	108.0
201601	4016	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, but you are proposing cutting it off at zero.	95.0	65.0
201601	4017	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Your proposal that you have on the table is to cut it off at zero.	95.0	65.0
201601	4018	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	If we’re not going to do that, maybe we should think it through, come back to the Committee, and let them know how we would propose to handle it.	95.0	65.0
201601	4019	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I don’t want to continue this discussion, but the fact is, as David said, that we’re showing 70 percent confidence intervals.	95.0	108.0
201601	4020	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	And there is a 90 percent confidence interval that you could also draw, which would probably go below.	95.0	108.0
201601	4021	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	I don’t think there are parts of the band that are feasible when you do that.	95.0	999.0
201601	4022	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	It’s not feasible to get to minus 3 or minus 4, so that will be one issue.	95.0	999.0
201601	4023	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	There’s a mass point somewhere, and that would be the true lower bound, and you can’t go past there.	95.0	999.0
201601	4024	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Because of currency, you’re saying.	95.0	96.0
201601	4025	2016-01-27	meeting	POTTER	Currency, or it’s not effective.	95.0	999.0
201601	4026	2016-01-27	meeting	LACKER	Tangential.	95.0	81.0
201601	4027	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	But wouldn’t showing it going below that feasible lower bound simply say that conditions could materialize that would—historically, starting from a different level of the funds rate—have prompted a very large response that would take the funds rate below a meaningful lower bound, wherever it is, and you’re illustrating that the Committee would have a number of options that could come into play?	95.0	65.0
201601	4028	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It may not be feasible to take the funds rate to minus 2, but further QE or other things certainly are feasible.	95.0	65.0
201601	4029	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	95.0	65.0
201601	4030	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I don’t want to belabor this, but one of the principles when we went into this and when we got to the proposal was the simplicity, right?	95.0	999.0
201601	4031	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	It was important that this be a simple thing.	95.0	999.0
201601	4032	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I may be mischaracterizing it, but the reason we said we’ll truncate at zero is precisely because we didn’t want to signal anything about future policy decisions and we had a history that said we had never gone below zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4033	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	We thought that we could easily say that in words, and that, the first time we showed the fan charts, those points could be said very simply and we could take all this into consideration that we’ve just gone through about the tradeoffs and how we have QE that might get us below zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4034	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	The whole premise of this was, we need a simple way to communicate that there’s uncertainty regarding these forecasts, it’s bigger than the dispersion typically in the SEP, and our policy will be data dependent and respond to economic shocks to the economy.	95.0	999.0
201601	4035	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	So that was the thought process about exactly why we truncated at zero, saying, “Because we’ve never been below zero, we’re truncating this chart at zero.	95.0	999.0
201601	4036	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Of course, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we’re not—.”	95.0	999.0
201601	4037	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	That was kind of the thought process.	95.0	999.0
201601	4038	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	I just wanted to let you know the history of that.	95.0	999.0
201601	4039	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Well, an approach might be to clarify that in the appendix.	95.0	65.0
201601	4040	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Exactly.	95.0	999.0
201601	4041	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, that might be a simple solution.	95.0	96.0
201601	4042	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	Right.	95.0	999.0
201601	4043	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	When you talk at the press conference, presumably the first time you show these, you’re going to want to have some words associated with them, because, unfortunately, the chart that you currently show at the press conference looks like a fan chart even though it’s dispersion.	95.0	999.0
201601	4044	2016-01-27	meeting	MESTER	And so you’re going to want to have some words associated with that, and in those words you can say this.	95.0	999.0
201601	4045	2016-01-27	meeting	DUDLEY	Disagreement versus uncertainty.	95.0	96.0
201601	4046	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4047	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Would it be acceptable to the subcommittee to think through some of this, respond to some of these comments, and come back to the Committee?	95.0	65.0
201601	4048	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	It may just be a matter of clarifying some of the language in the appendix or perhaps waiting until June to go forward with this.	95.0	65.0
201601	4049	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, I think it would be.	95.0	108.0
201601	4050	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll find a subcommittee that will deal with it.	95.0	108.0
201601	4051	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	95.0	108.0
201601	4052	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	This is a highly coveted position.	95.0	91.0
201601	4053	2016-01-27	meeting	EVANS	I’ve already served my term, though.	95.0	91.0
201601	4055	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	I should say that, as you know, this is not the first time we’ve had a conversation like this around the table, and it has always come to a similar fate.	95.0	65.0
201601	4056	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nonetheless, we will try again.	95.0	102.0
201601	4057	2016-01-27	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	95.0	102.0
201601	4058	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	95.0	65.0
201601	4059	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	95.0	65.0
201601	4060	2016-01-27	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	95.0	108.0
201601	4061	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	The meeting is now adjourned, and the Board meeting is ended.	53.0	65.0
201601	4062	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	We will next meet Tuesday and Wednesday, March 15 and 16.	53.0	65.0
201601	4063	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	Lunch is served.	53.0	65.0
201601	4064	2016-01-27	meeting	YELLEN	And for those of you who can stay, Linda Robertson is prepared to give a legislative update.	53.0	65.0
