198708	0	JOHNSON	 In the absence of the Vice Chairman of the FOMC, I'll try to kick things off. I think we need to begin, though, with nominations for the chairmanship of the FOMC. And I'd like to nominate Mr. Greenspan as Chairman of the FOMC. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	1	SEGER	 And I'd like to second. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	40.0
198708	2	JOHNSON	 Are there any objections? [Laughter.] Mr. Chairman. 	3	3	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	3	GREENSPAN	 That was a longer pause than I expected. [Laughter.] I'd like to entertain a motion to move the minutes. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	4	SEGER	 I'll move that. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	40.0
198708	5	GREENSPAN	 If there are no objections, then they are approved. Mr. Cross. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	6	CROSS	 For the past three months, dollar exchange rates have  drifted gradually upward and now average about 6 percent higher  against the G-10 currencies than at the dollar's low point in  early May. Since your last meeting in July, the dollar has risen  on balance by about 1 percent, and at various times it has  experienced both buying and selling pressures. Recently there  has been a general feeling that a better sense of two-way risk  has returned to the market. But looking farther ahead there is  still much skepticism about the future course of the currency in  light of our slow progress in reducing the trade deficit. With  respect to our operations, during the first week of August, when  there were strong upward pressures on the dollar, the Desk  entered the market on behalf of the United States authorities, selling  dollars against marks in coordination with other G-7 central  banks.  A factor underlying the dollar's rise this summer has been  the improving outlook for economic growth in the United States.  The prospects for United States expansion strengthened following release  of several economic statistics, including the second quarter GNP  and the employment data. This improvement in our growth  prospects contrasted with growing disappointment about the  outlook for the German economy.  Another factor contributing to the dollar's rise was the  flare-up of tensions in the Middle East, where disputes about  shipping and riots in Mecca precipitated a significant marking up of dollar rates in the exchange market. With these pressures the  dollar moved above levels at which the market had previously  expected that the central banks might intervene to try to stop  the dollar's rise. Once market participants realized that there  might not be an effective cap placed on the dollar, they tended  to move from short dollar positions to long, and also to purchase  dollar call options.  The upward pressure on the dollar focused on the mark and  not the yen. As compared with Germany, Japanese growth prospects  seemed to be improving and there were reports that Japanese  financial institutions were repatriating capital in response to  rising long-term interest rates and higher loan demand at home.  Moreover, there appears to be much more concern about the impact  of trade on the relationship of the dollar to the yen than to the  mark. Also, there are reports that Japan's oil inventories are  relatively high, whereas Germany's are said to be low, so that  Japan could better withstand a temporary disruption of oil  supply.  On August 4 when the dollar was rising and bidding for the  dollar/mark exchange rate became intense, the United States authorities  sold dollars on the exchange market, and the Desk sold dollars  again on August 6, 7 and 10. All of the operations were aimed at  showing the market that the authorities would provide resistance  to upward pressures on the dollar when these pressures became  significant, without trying to place a ceiling on the exchange  rate. Therefore, we sold dollars only when the dollar was moving  up rather strongly. Though all of the dollars were sold in a  range around DM 1.88 to DM 1.90, the operations were in different  amounts and at different levels. The market appeared to have  understood what we were trying to do and did not feel that we  were trying to drive the dollar down. Intervention was thus seen  as a factor contributing to restraint in the movements of dollar  exchange rates. In total we sold $631 million against marks on  those four days. At various times we were joined by the  Bundesbank, the Bank of England, the Bank of France and the Bank  of Canada.  The operations of the Desk were performed in this manner in  an attempt to preserve a sense of upside risk. Particularly at a  time when market participants remain skeptical about our ability  to deal effectively with our large trade deficit, we want market  participants to feel there is a risk that the dollar might go up  in the short run. Otherwise, the market could quickly revert  back to a one-way street   with the dollar in the downward  direction   just as we saw last spring. The events of last  Friday, after our disappointing trade deficit for June was  announced, illustrated how quickly market psychology can change.  The dollar moved down two to three pfennigs in a matter of  minutes. When the market again found its balance, the dollar was  still trading at high enough levels to persuade market operators  that a new dollar downtrend had not necessarily been put in  place. However, today we have had a second wave of dollar  selling, apparently still in response to the trade numbers, and  the dollar is now about 3-1/2 percent below last week's levels,  both in terms of marks and yen.  As you know, the System's holdings of yen had become quite  depleted as a result of our intervention operations of this  spring. We therefore decided to take advantage of opportunities  presented to us by our customers to purchase modest amounts of  yen for the System. The first such operation took place last  week when we purchased a little more than $36 million equivalent  of yen to replenish our balances. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	7	GREENSPAN	 Comments anyone? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	8	JOHNSON	 I have one, Mr. Chairman. I was looking this morning at the Telerate. A lot of the reasons given on the dollar's decline are that oil traded down yesterday and oil prices are dropping this morning in foreign markets. And I wonder how much of an influence that is having on the exchange rate too; it seems to move in parallel fashion. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	9	CROSS	 It has been mentioned that oil prices have clearly softened. This morning's price is almost half a dollar below what it was yesterday and it's almost a dollar below where it was a week or so ago. This has been cited as another factor. Most of the people that our traders have been talking to seem to think that today's decline in the dollar is perhaps related to that, in part, but after the initial impact of the decline, it seems to be more a reflection of rather sour trade figures. Yesterday in New York, in the latter part of the afternoon, the dollar began to soften without anything very dramatic happening; it was just gradually declining. And we are told that the Japanese are saying that when their markets opened, they began to think that maybe they should cut some of their positions, so there was some selling both in Japan and in Europe subsequently, which brought us down to current levels. It's possible that oil prices are now a factor but more talk seems to be given to this general attitude resulting from the continuing serious problem with the trade deficit and the larger number announced on Friday. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	10	GREENSPAN	 To what extent is the general apparent reduction of tensions in the Persian Gulf, which was obviously the cause of the decline in the oil price, actually the cause of this retrenchment? In other words, periodically, when we see tensions in the world, everyone rushes into the dollar; and, it looks to me as if we are just unravelling that particular position. It strikes me as rather difficult to believe that there is a secondary reaction to a  published news event. Is it possible that the markets are just easing because of the decline in tensions, and people are just reaching for explanations of this sort? Or is there some reason to believe that it's really more than that and that there has actually been some Japanese reevaluation, rather than this view being just somebody's hypothesis. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	11	CROSS	 Really, we don't have enough evidence, other than what people are telling us. When the Middle East tensions flared up here a couple of weeks ago, it was hard for us to see why that, in itself, should have caused the dollar to go up so rapidly. We saw some increase in [the price of] gold, but it came back down. We did not see evidence that it was lots of [unintelligible] flows. It could be that there is a kind of writing down of the dollar in light of the somewhat less troublesome situation in the Middle East. But we don't see much evidence of a lot of movement from this back and forth which would lead to that conclusion; it's possible that people's attitudes are influenced by it and, therefore, they are changing their views about what is the proper level for the dollar, to some extent. It is pretty much a matter of guessing. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	12	GREENSPAN	 What happened to the DM this morning? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	13	CROSS	 Well, the dollar fell in terms of both the DM and the yen. It's now trading at about 1.85-1/4 DM and 147-1/4 yen. So it has declined about 3-1/2 percent, I guess, from the levels prevailing toward the end of last week before the trade figures were announced and whatever has happened that relates to them. It's a substantial move. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	14	PARRY	 What about in relation to sterling? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198708	15	CROSS	 I don't have the sterling quote today. But sterling has been under its own pressure because of the [unintelligible]. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	16	PARRY	 That may indicate whether or not it is related to oil. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198708	17	CROSS	 Well, sterling sometimes acts like a petro¬ currency and sometimes it doesn't. You can't rely on it reflecting what happens in the Middle East. Well, sterling is up to 1.60-1.65. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	18	PARRY	 That's not oil. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198708	19	CROSS	 But it should not move that way if you followed the hypothesis. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	20	PARRY	 That's right. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	45.0
198708	21	GREENSPAN	 Anything else? May I have a motion to ratify Mr. Cross' actions? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	22	CORRIGAN	 So move. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198708	23	GREENSPAN	 Without objection, they're approved. Mr. Sternlight.  	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	24	STERNLIGHT	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The domestic Trading Desk has continued to aim for  essentially unchanged conditions of reserve availability in the  period since the last meeting. New information during the period  gave a mixed picture. M2 and M3 in July grew at only 2-3/4 and 2  percent annual rates, respectively, compared to the 5 and 7-1/2  percent rates for June to September adopted at the time of the  last meeting. At the same time, there were signs of strength in  the exchange value of the dollar, sufficient to prompt some  coordinated intervention to blunt its rise. Meantime, though,  economic data tended to show a bit more strength than expected,  and inflationary concerns were evident both in United States and foreign  markets, punctuated at times by higher prices for oil and other  commodities.  In weighing these developments, the Desk initially  aimed for unchanged conditions. Toward late July, while holding  the path level of borrowing unchanged at $500 million, the Desk  sought to manage reserves with a bias such that deviations in  borrowings would more likely be a bit under than over the path  level. Most recently, the Desk has returned to a more balanced  stance as further data continued to suggest reasonable strength  in economic activity and as early readings on August money growth  suggest a pickup.  Compared to the previous period, the Federal funds  market tended to have a more comfortable tone, with rates  typically toward the lower part of a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent  range. (In much of the previous period, with the same path  borrowing level, funds had been around the high end of that  range.) One exception in the recent period was in the closing  days of July and early August when the Treasury auctioned and  settled a huge volume of securities in a compressed schedule,  creating large financing needs and putting upward pressure on the  funds rate. Higher funds rates emerged again in the last couple  of days with the approach and arrival of settlement date for the  Treasury's mid-quarter financing.  Debt ceiling developments weighed both on the Desk and  the markets during the period. Expiration of two temporary debt  ceilings and last gasp extensions complicated reserve management  and disrupted normal Treasury auction patterns. For the first  time, the System had to allow its entire holding of a maturing  bill issue to run off at maturity because the Treasury was unable  to issue any immediate replacement. Often in the past, it has  come down to the last minute, but exchange arrangements were  possible. However, this time, no Congressional action had been  taken by July 23 when 3- and 6-month bills matured, and the Desk  had to redeem nearly $4 billion of maturing bills. Earlier, a  $600 million bill redemption was undertaken deliberately to drain  redundant reserves.  The $4 billion bill paydown took place midway through  the July 29 maintenance period when there was, fortunately, a  need to drain reserves. The paydown turned a large estimated  need to drain reserves into a modest need to add. The following  period required further reserve additions as the full effect of  the paydown was felt. Nonetheless, reserve operations other than  the bill paydown were generally modest. The Desk sold securities  to foreign accounts early in the intermeeting period when there  was a need to drain reserves and arranged a couple of matched  sale-purchase operations in the market. After the paydown, it  purchased bills from foreign accounts and arranged a series of  RPs, mainly for customer account. Net over the full period,  outright holdings were reduced by about $4.35 billion. While the  debt ceiling forced the timing of the reduction in the System's  portfolio, the period was one that called for draining reserves,  chiefly to offset the impact of declining Treasury balances at  the Fed. Even absent the debt ceiling complications, a  substantial portfolio reduction was in order though probably not  as great as actually occurred, and with different timing.  Despite all the distractions, borrowing turned out  close to the $500 million path allowance, falling a bit short in  the first and third maintenance periods and exceeding it slightly  in the middle period. For the three maintenance periods  completed during the intermeeting interval, borrowing averaged  about $465 million. Nonborrowed reserves alternately fell short  of and exceeded the nominal objectives as excess reserves swung  widely during the period. The bulk of the swings in excess were  predictable, reflecting a sawtooth pattern to reserve carry-ins  at the large banks. The Desk made informal allowances for them,  alternately aiming to come in short of the formal nonborrowed  reserve path and to exceed it. Actual swings were similar to but  a bit wider than the estimates.  Most intermediate and long-term interest rates rose  over the intermeeting period, with the increases concentrated in  the latter half of the period. However, a sharp rally occurred  last Thursday after the 30-year bond auction, and the market has  maintained these gains despite a brief retreat when a larger than  expected June trade deficit was announced last Friday. Yields on  longer term issues topped their May peaks in early August but  have since receded somewhat to show a net rise for the 30-year  Treasury issue of about 40 basis points. That places the long  bond around 8.80 percent, after having pushed briefly a little  over 9 percent in early August.  The rate increases appeared to reflect a general global  disenchantment with fixed-income securities in the face of  concerns about higher inflation down the road, and an increasing  focus on equity markets. In some major foreign markets, notably  Japan, the rate rises were sharper than in the United States Japanese  long-term rates have risen about 100 basis points since early  July, in part due to oil-based inflation fears. The Japanese  market was also unsettled by an unexpected issue of two-year  notes. Sterling yields were up about 80 basis points, largely  reflecting a full percentage point rise in the Bank of England's  intervention rate on August 6. In Germany, long-term rates rose  about 50 basis points.  In the U.S., inflation concerns were heightened by  increases in oil and precious metal prices at the time tensions  in the Persian Gulf heated up, and new economic data suggested a  stronger outlook for the third quarter than was anticipated  earlier. Chairman Volcker's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony,  indicating no recent change in policy where some observers had  sensed a partial reversal of the April-May ""snugging"" move, also  provided some upward push.  The debt ceiling delays also affected trading over the  period. Yields backed up once the ceiling expired on July 17 and  participants became increasingly concerned about the bunching of  the auctions once a new ceiling was passed. The compression of  five auctions totaling about $60 billion of bills and notes  within 4 business days following the first extension of the debt  ceiling appeared to cause somewhat higher auction rates than  would otherwise have prevailed.  One week after these auctions, the Treasury began its  $28 billion refunding auctions a week behind schedule. The pre-  auction dealer talk was that yields would have to back up to  attract investor demand in view of the general market malaise,  the sharp narrowing of spreads between United States and Japanese bonds  since the last refunding, and the shortened period between the  auctions and settlement date for the new issues. As it worked  out, once rates had backed up, there was good bidding interest in  all three auctions and each issue traded up in price following  its sale. The strength of the 30-year auction was especially  notable, with the ratio of bids to awards the highest in three  years.  The Treasury paid down only $1/2 billion in bills over  the period, and raised $18-1/2 billion of new cash from sales of  coupon issues. After the run-up in late July, bill rates have  leveled off or even declined slightly in the last two weeks. In  yesterday's auction the 3- and 6-month issues were sold at 5.97  and 6.12 percent. These were up from the 5.62 and 5.68 percent  rates just before the last meeting. Elsewhere in the short-term  market, among private instruments, rates showed little change  over the period. The rise for Treasury bills seemed to be the  result of an abatement of special factors that had pulled those  rates down earlier notably the stream of bill paydowns and the  prospect of even greater supply interruptions because of the debt  ceiling. The passage of a new temporary ceiling, and subsequent  bunching of auctions, suddenly relieved the earlier technical  shortage.  Currently, bond market sentiment seems to remain on the  wary side. As noted, the anticipations of a System ""de-snugging""  failed to find confirmation in the July Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony, and market participants have been left, at most, with  what some describe as a ""passive de-snugging"" that is, a  willingness of the Fed to see funds rates slip a bit under what  had been the prevalent 6-3/4 percent level. Meantime, market  participants seem impressed with more fundamental factors such as  continuing evidence of economic growth and potential for  inflationary pressure as the trade deficit narrows in real terms  and labor markets tighten. The failure to come to grips with  additional budget deficit reduction measures is also a sobering  factor. Few market participants seem inclined to make much of  the recent slow money growth, given their view of an over-all  satisfactory pace of real economic growth with some likelihood of  re-emergent price pressures.  Request for Additional Leeway  Current projections indicate a high likelihood that the  normal $6 billion leeway for changes in outright System holdings  will not be sufficient between now and the next Committee meeting  scheduled for September 22. The main factor draining reserves is  expected to be a large build-up in Treasury cash balances after  the mid-September tax date. Another debt ceiling crunch at  around that time could affect the problem as it unfolds but most  likely will still leave a need for greater leeway. My  recommendation is to increase the usual leeway to $10 billion  though it should be noted that tax payment estimates can go awry  and we could end up needing even more. However, it would be  hard, this far in advance, to pinpoint a more refined number with  any confidence. "	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	25	JOHNSON	 Mr. Chairman, I'd like to second that recommendation for the additional amount. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	26	GREENSPAN	 Why don't we hold that until we get through the total discussion of Mr. Sternlight's remarks. We'll go to that later. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	27	FORRESTAL	 Peter, in light of the increase in Japanese interest rates, have you detected a decline in Japanese participation in either the debt or equity markets? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
198708	28	STERNLIGHT	 At times, there certainly did seem to be an abatement in their interest in the debt market; as for the equity market, we are continuing to hear that they are pretty active. And they have certainly continued to participate in Treasury auctions; in this last auction they were there in the 10- and 30-year issues. As for purchases in the secondary markets, at times over the period we were hearing of some pulling away from buying in our market as their own rates were pushing higher. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	29	HELLER	 Can I follow up on that one? Both in Germany and Japan, do you see the run-up in rates as mainly a result of policy actions taken or do you see it as a result of general economic conditions in the country changing? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	46.0
198708	30	STERNLIGHT	 Well, Sam Cross or Ted Truman might be in a better position to comment. At least as it was passed along to me, I got a sense that it was a bit more of the policy move type of thing. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	31	CROSS	 In Japan, the short-term rates haven't changed; the long-term rates have gone up sharply. It seems to be a little element of both of the factors that you talked about. Certainly, the market forces led to a substantial increase in their longer-term rates and they have been quite concerned about the vulnerability of their financial situation given the stock market rise, the increase in real estate prices, and so forth. They also have allowed changes in some of these rates, like the long-term prime; they tell us they are resisting this, but at the end of the day it is clear that the long- term rates have gone up substantially. In Germany, I think there has been a little snugging, but again, it is hard to say how much, because there have been some other things going on. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	32	TRUMAN	 I don't have anything to add to Mr. Cross' comments. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	33	GREENSPAN	 Further comments? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	34	JOHNSON	 Peter, on your concerns about September: Are we anticipating, or is the Treasury anticipating, a cash balance problem? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	35	STERNLIGHT	 We are anticipating a sizable buildup. I wouldn't say it's an unmeetable problem at this stage. I don't think we'll approach the record levels that we had last April when their total balance got up to $54 billion or so, and the balance at the Fed  was $30 billion. I think their total balance could get up to the $40- 50 billion range and that could put the balance at the Fed somewhere at $25 billion, or something like that. It could be a substantial reserve-draining factor. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	36	GREENSPAN	 Anything else? I need ratification of two items. First, I'll entertain a motion to ratify the open market transactions since the July meeting. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	37	CORRIGAN	 So move. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198708	38	GREENSPAN	 Any objections? Secondly, we need another motion to approve the increase in intermeeting leeway. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	39	CORRIGAN	 I move on that. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198708	40	SEGER	 I second that. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	40.0
198708	41	ANGELL	 I guess the question is: Why not ask for enough? If $10 billion might not do it, why not ask for $12 billion? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	43.0
198708	42	STERNLIGHT	 Well, I considered that. But for almost any number I would pick, Governor, I could imagine circumstances that would take it a little beyond that. So, I'm picking what I think might well do it, but I just want to put the Committee on notice that it could conceivably come in beyond that. If I presented $12 billion, I'd like to feel more confidence than I can feel at this stage of [unintelligible]. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	43	ANGELL	 My question is: Is there any real danger of erring on the side of having too much leeway to be able to manage the account the way we want to manage it? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	43.0
198708	44	STERNLIGHT	 I wouldn't see it as a danger. I think it may just be that the Committee would want to keep close to the situation and realize that if some even larger increase were needed, you'd like to be informed in some formal manner and have a chance to note that. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	45	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell is raising the right question. This is an extraordinary circumstance. If it happens, I don't think there's any reason not to expand it, so why don't we increase it--what did you want?--to $12 billion. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	46	STERNLIGHT	 As best our projections look. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	47	GREENSPAN	 Give us a number which you sleep well with. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	48	STERNLIGHT	 I was shrinking from that, Mr. Chairman, because I just did not have that degree of confidence, but I'll stick my neck out at $12 billion. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	49	GREENSPAN	 This is a technical problem which does not confront the Committee very often.  -5- 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	50	STERNLIGHT	" It does get published and people will look at it and say: ""Gosh, did they really think it was going to go that high?"" "	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	51	ANGELL	 And I guess the answer is yes. [Laughter.] 	6	63	0.0	1.0	43.0
198708	52	JOHNSON	 The answer is, we want to be prepared if it does . 	6	63	0.0	1.0	44.0
198708	53	GUFFEY	 It is a simple matter, however, to get that authority by wire if the need exists. 	6	63	0.0	1.0	20.0
198708	54	STERNLIGHT	 There has never been any difficulty in getting the authority as we needed it, if a situation arose. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0
198708	55	ANGELL	 Do you want to formally recommend? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	43.0
198708	56	GREENSPAN	 We have to formally change the motion. Was it Jerry Corrigan who made the wrong motion? [Laughter.] 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
198708	57	CORRIGAN	 I think I can make it $12 billion. [Laughter.] 	6	63	0.0	1.0	31.0
198708	58	GREENSPAN	 I assume it is approved. Thank you. Mr. Prell, 	11	11	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	59	PRELL	 The staff forecast has not changed much from that presented  at the July meeting. The overall picture remains one of moderate  growth in real GNP through the end of next year, with domestic  demand likely being damped by somewhat higher interest rates.  Wages accelerate noticeably, but price inflation is only a little  bit faster in 1988 than in 1987.  Looking closely at our projection, we have nudged up very  slightly   a tenth of a percent or two   both real growth and  price inflation over the next six guarters. The economy seems  at this point to have a bit more upward momentum than we had  previously anticipated. Before the Greenbook was sent to the  presses, the key evidence on that score was the labor market  report for July. The report showed a sizable 300,000 gain in  payroll employment, which included 70,000 additional jobs in  manufacturing. The jump in factory payrolls was all the more  striking because it came even as auto industry employment fell  almost 40,000, owing to the influence of inventory reduction  efforts and model changeovers. Moreover, the household survey  indicated a 470,000 increase in employment and a surprising  further decline in the jobless rate, to 6 percent.  The payroll data, along with available physical product  measures, pointed to a strong increase in industrial production  in July. The data we published last Friday revealed not only  an 0.8 percent jump in IP in July, but also upward revisions in  prior months. The more impressive uptrend in industrial activity  squares nicely with the run-up in materials prices this year,  as well as with a tendency toward trade-driven growth.  Developments prior to the Greenbook also suggested that we  might see stronger consumer spending than we had previously projected. For the near term, the announcement of more generous  incentives by the domestic car makers indicated the likelihood  of a bunching of consumer outlays in the third quarter. For  the longer haul, our thinking was influenced by the upward revisions in the personal income and saving data for the past year  or so, and by the continuing surge in the stock market.  The data received late last week were consistent with the  thrust of our analysis. Domestically produced autos sold at an  R.2 to 8.9 million annual rate in the first ten days of August,  depending on whose seasonal factors you employ; the enhanced  incentives were in place for only part of the period, and if  this pace is maintained, enough cars will be sold to eliminate  the overhang of dealer stocks by the end of the quarter, given  low assembly schedules. The July retail sales data also were  favorable; indeed, the key nonauto components were, in combination with upward revisions for the preceding months, a bit  stronger than we had been looking for.  Incoming information on business spending also has been  upbeat, on balance. The June figures on shipments and orders,  coupled with our expectation of good car and truck sales, have  led us to revise upward slightly our forecast of third-quarter  spending on equipment. Meanwhile, the downslide in outlays for  nonresidential structures appears to have abated, with rising  oil drilling activity and strong demand for private educational  buildings offsetting weakness in commercial construction.  On the inventory side, the figures through June suggest  that manufacturers' stocks are quite lean. Given the trends in  orders, we would expect to see some effort to build inventories  in the period ahead. At trade establishments, the picture is  less consistent, but, outside of autos, there seem to be no  major imbalances; the apparent upturn in retail sales of apparel  and furniture in the past couple of months is reassuring in this  regard.  In the housing market, the evidence at Greenbook time  pointed to the leveling off we had expected in activity in June.  This morning we received July housing starts, which were right on  target with our forecast at a 1.61 million unit annual rate    the same pace as in May and June.  Last Friday, as you know, the merchandise trade figures for  June came out, and the deficit for the month was much larger than  the market expected. It was also somewhat larger than the staff  had anticipated. Nonetheless, our estimate of what these numbers  will look like when they are converted to a balance of payments  basis, which relates more directly to the GNP data, indicates that  the trade deficit will be little changed between the first  and second quarters. Since we were not looking for anything other  than sideways movement in the nominal trade balance until next  year, these data would not cause us to revamp our basic view of  the likely contribution of net exports to real GNP over the forecast period. I perhaps should note parenthetically that real  net exports are expected to decline slightly in the third quarter,  owing to the surge in oil imports associated with precautionary  stockbuilding. I should also note that oil inventories are  notoriously elusive in the GNP data, and if they don't show up  on this occasion, GNP could be understated in the current period.  The trade numbers, and the market reaction to them, did  tend to underscore what we have regarded as a key inflationary  risk in our forecast   namely, the possibility that the dollar  may have to depreciate substantially further to produce an  acceptable improvement in our external position.  The recent wage and price indicators have presented a mixed  picture. Abstracting from food and energy price swings, the  latest readings on producer prices for finished goods and consumer  prices for goods and services suggested relatively moderate inflation. Moreover, recent wage and compensation data gave no indication that labor costs, on the whole, had begun to accelerate.  Prices of nonpetroleum imports did post another appreciable  increase between March and June, however; and the prices of domestically produced industrial materials and intermediate components  and supplies have been climbing noticeably, evidently reflecting  reduced pressure from foreign competition and stronger demand in  several industries, as well as the pass-through of higher costs  for petroleum-based products.  It remains our expectation that prices of final goods and  services will decelerate a bit in the second half of the year.  But this slowing is almost entirely attributable to smaller  increases in food and energy prices. The former seems to be in  train, with the July PPI showing a drop in meat, fruit and vegetable prices, and the latter of course depends on the continued  availability of oil from the Persian Gulf region. To date, OPEC  production apparently has run above quota, damping the rise in  oil prices; we have assumed that, when precautionary demands ebb,  output will recede, and the price will remain around the OPEC  target of S18 per barrel. While the possibility exists that  prices will overshoot on the downside, it also is clear that  the oil market constitutes an area of potentially significant  upside inflationary risk in the forecast.  Looking beyond the second half, we continue to project a  reacceleration of inflation, with the fixed-weight price index  for GNP rising almost 4-1/2 percent over the four quarters of  1988, compared with 4 percent on average this year. I perhaps  should note that the inflation rates for both years have been  raised a bit in light of the Commerce Department's GNP revisions,  which revealed, among other things,stronger uptrends in government spending deflators. The basic story has remained the same,  however: we expect that the competing goods effect from rising  import prices, in combination with accelerating labor costs, will  put more upward pressure on the prices of domestic production.  In addition, prices likely will be getting a small boost from  rising federal and state and local excise taxes.  With regard to labor costs, we continue to show compensation  increases moving from the recent 3 to 3-1/2 percent range up to  about 4-3/4 percent by the second half of 1988. We have not  tacked on a minimum wage hike, which of course constitutes another  risk in the outlook. But the greater risk, in our minds, is posed  by the downtrend over the past several months in the unemployment  rate. The drop in the jobless rate has been considerably more  than would be explained by the reported increase in real GNP,  according to the so-called Okun's law formulation. The disparity  may have several explanations: GNP growth may actually have been  stronger than we now think; or we may have reached a point where  labor force participation rates are leveling off; or average productivity could be deteriorating, perhaps because we are running  out of high quality labor; or the drop in unemployment may simply  have been overstated.  The fact is that we don't really know, and we may not know  for some time. We think there is a distinct possibility that the  unemployment rate will bounce up in the next few months, and we  have put a small uptick in our forecast. More fundamentally, the  notion underlying our projection of wages is that, whether the  true jobless figure is 6 percent or a little higher than that,  we basically are now and will be in a zone where general labor  market slack is no longer a source of downward pressure on real  wages. We can't rule out the possibility, though, that the  seemingly moderate output growth we've forecast will push  unemployment significantly lower and put enough pressure on labor  resources that wages will accelerate more than we have forecast.  In the end, we believe our forecast continues to describe  the most probable outcome for output and prices over the next  year or so. However, I must say that we also have an uneasy  feeling that recent developments may be signalling an increased  risk that inflationary pressures will be greater than we have  been anticipating.  Mr. Chairman, I have spoken too long already, so let me  just note that we have distributed to the Committee a summary  of the Administration's revised economic and budget forecast,  issued yesterday in the midsession review document. The CBO's  updated projections are due out tomorrow, and will show an  economic forecast closer to our own and an FY88 baseline deficit  also closer to ours. The $25 billion of deficit-reduction action  we've assumed is less than the congressional budget resolution or  the Administration numbers call for, but given the record, this is  one forecasting risk we are fairly comfortable taking. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	60	PARRY	 I have two questions about the forecast. If you were to take another look at your forecast for the third quarter-- incorporating the most recent data with regard to employment, retail sales, and production--do you think the number you'd come up with would be higher? And is it possible that the weakest quarter of the year, in fact, could turn out to be the second quarter? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198708	61	PRELL	 Well, we won't know for sure what the second quarter looked like even in next week's numbers. At this point, the incoming expenditure flow numbers don't point clearly to an upward or a downward revision. For the third quarter, I suppose if we were to recalculate today, our best guess is that our number would be fractionally higher; I would say that it would not necessarily differ significantly from the second quarter. But, just on the basis of the retail sales data, we could see a number that would be closer to 3 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	62	PARRY	 My second question involves inflation. You have a very sharp drop-off, as you did last month, in the second half's inflation rate in terms of the GNP fixed-weight deflator. It seems a little surprising to me, particularly given the revisions to GNP data that we saw in the last month and also the somewhat brighter glow to the economic statistics. I'm not sure I understand what's causing that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198708	63	PRELL	 Well, if we dissect the forecast, the deceleration is primarily in the consumption area and, in part, that reflects better food prices, as I noted. And, unless something goes seriously awry, the increase in energy prices in the second half will be distinctly slower than in the first half. We may get a little  bulge in the near term, but for the second half as a whole, we are expecting considerable slowing. Also, we have been moderately encouraged by the trend in the non-energy services area for consumer expenditures; it seems to have decelerated a bit over the last 6-12 months, so that has carried through for a little while longer in our forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	64	PARRY	 But you have more than a doubling of the growth rate of PCE, and final sales are up very substantially in the third quarter. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198708	65	PRELL	 Of course, part of that surge in consumption expenditures--and certainly a large part--is in the automobile area where, to get that surge, they're going to have to give some concessions in the way of lower interest rates or a more generous rebate program. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	66	BOEHNE	 I'd like to explore a couple of areas. You made the point that 6 percent unemployment, more or less, is getting into the kind of full employment zone where you start to get inflation pressures. It seems to me that as you look across the country, and even within regions, there is such a variability of unemployment rates that this average can be awfully misleading. Take my District, for example. We have a number of areas where the unemployment rate is around 3 percent. We also have a few areas where the unemployment rate is 8 percent. And I would guess that across the country, you would find unemployment ranges from 3 percent to, maybe, 10 or 12 percent. Doesn't a lot depend on where the additional growth comes from? For example, we're going to see the growth coming in manufacturing. Does that 6 percent mean what you would think it would mean, on average? It seems to me that is the kind analysis which, while it has an appeal, is greatly oversimplified, given the variability. That is one area you might talk about. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198708	67	PRELL	 Well, I did try to highlight some of the geographic disparities in the chart show [presentation to the Committee] last month, where I showed that, regionally, the unemployment rates are substantially different and we have been seeing different wage trends. Clearly, the Northeast is the area where the average unemployment rate has been distinctly lower, and we have not been seeing the wage deceleration, judging by the employment cost index, for example, over the past couple of years. Historically, obviously, the economy has never been perfectly level. We try to compress this into one statistic, but there are always disparities in unemployment rate levels. At the present time, the disparity might be a little greater than it typically has been. But, when you get into the question of where the pressure points are going to be, this is hard to say. Clearly, there is some slack in some of the prime heavy industry areas of the country. On the other hand, some of the industries that may benefit from the improvement in trade are located in areas of the country where the labor markets are a little tighter. For example, some industries in the Northeast will probably be benefitting from increased competitiveness. We approach this question with a degree of humility. We can't state precisely what the natural rate of unemployment is; we assign a fairly broad band, and we recognize that the question of bottlenecks or fortuitous precise matching of the increase in demand to the areas that have the most slack could create some variation in those spots. Basically, though,  we think the anecdotal evidence is there. It's sort of a Sports Illustrated story: Once you're on the cover, it's the kiss of death. The Business Week type of headline that we are now in a crunch is overblown a bit. We have a sense that the labor market has tightened, though we have not seen the pressures on wages in-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	68	BOEHNE	 The other area I'd like to explore is the trade numbers. You made the point that, in the forecast, we count on improvement in foreign demand to more than offset the weaker domestic demand. And yet, if we're moving sideways in terms of real exports-- in a context of weak activity in Germany and real doubts in Japan--how does all that fit together? How do you get a boost from the foreign side when real net exports are moving sideways and you have weakness? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198708	69	TRUMAN	 In nominal terms, you have a slight weakness. We are expecting, after all, that in the translation that you go through, we will end up later this month with a trade balance for the second quarter which is essentially the same, in nominal terms, as we had in the first quarter. But you would still have some small improvement in the second quarter in real terms on top of improvements in both the first quarter and the fourth quarter [of last year]. Basically, the effect of the sustained period of exchange rate depreciation that we have had, despite the slower growth abroad which you quite correctly point to, is now giving an added boost; in fact, it's striking something off. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	70	BOEHNE	 So you expect the improvement in real net exports to continue. Is that-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198708	71	TRUMAN	 That is correct. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	72	PARRY	 Not in the third quarter. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
198708	73	TRUMAN	 In the third quarter, we think we're going to have this special effect with the oil-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	74	BOEHNE	 But out beyond that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
198708	75	TRUMAN	 Beyond that, we expect essentially the same forecast as this time--most of it accounted for by the exchange rate depreciation, taking account of the weak growth abroad. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	76	MORRIS	 I have a gut feeling that the economy in the last half of this year and going into 1988 is going to be stronger than we have projected, and I've been examining numbers trying to figure out where the greater strength will come from. It seems to me that it could well be from the producer durable equipment sector where you show a continued rise in manufacturing capacity utilization throughout the period. In recent months, we've seen a very strong trend in new orders for capital goods. Yet in your projection, after the current quarter, you show only a very modest growth rate. Do you view this as an area of vulnerability in your forecast? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	1.0
198708	77	PRELL	 I think if we were to identify the areas in which we would be most likely to get some upside surprises, that is one. Our forecast for this year for nominal business fixed investment continues to be below what the surveys were indicating a few months ago, and it's clear that orders are picking up. Basically, we have a  forecast, though, that seems in line with historical patterns, giving consideration to the cost of capital and what presumably would be a rather modest accelerator effect here. We don't have output growth on the whole as all that strong, so we have a moderate increase in fixed investment. But that certainly is one of the areas where a surprise would be less shocking to us. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	78	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	79	SEGER	" I guess I just want you to play a ""what if"" game with me. With respect to oil prices--I'm not an expert on foreign affairs or any kind of affairs--but the disruption in the Persian Gulf, I think, definitely has had an impact on oil prices, as you mentioned earlier. But what if they sweep the mines away and the tensions are relieved. Then, if we were to see oil prices coming down, let's say, to $15 or $16 per barrel--that's not my estimate, just assume that would happen--what would that kind of change in this one factor do to your overall forecast? It just seemed to me, as I read through this material a number of times, that the high oil prices, and rising oil prices, were driving many of our concerns on the forecast over the rest of this year and into next year. "	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	80	PRELL	 If I may turn briefly to Mr. Morris' question, one thing that we've had in our minds as a sort of cautionary note on these orders figures and so on, is that we can't tell how much of that might be potential exports; so, at this point those numbers need to be read cautiously. Our view on the oil situation, as I tried to suggest, is that we could see a downside risk. Evidently, there has been a considerable move to stockpile oil. If we get into another one of these swings where there's a movement toward destocking, and the OPEC swing producers don't cut back promptly enough, we could see at least a temporary drop in crude oil prices, maybe to an even lower level than you've suggested. But, basically, we think we have perceived, since the end of last year, a reasonable enough coherence in the OPEC countries in containing production within levels that enable them to sustain prices at their target level. So we tend to think that any crunch is likely to be relatively short-lived and would, perhaps, introduce some [unintelligible] in prices of final products, petroleum products. But we would be quite surprised to see something that was permanent enough to produce a significantly lower trend in energy prices over the forecast horizon. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	81	TRUMAN	 Governor Seger, we have not raised our oil price assumption for next year; in fact, it's the same one we had in February. So, in some sense, you have to have some drawback in order for our forecast to be correct. Obviously, there are some risks: we were talking about the risk that the OPEC agreement that they made late last year would fall apart and that-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	82	SEGER	 I think there's no honor among thieves. As those prices rise, I think those people are going to be more and more tempted to cheat, and they will continue to cheat. They're cheating now in that they're exceeding their own quotas--ones that they set among themselves. I guess I'm not prepared to think that they'll get religion real quickly. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	83	TRUMAN	 Well, that's one of the reasons why you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't; it's one of the reasons why  we had essentially stuck with an assumption that was close to what they were targeting six or eight months ago. What will come out over this forecast period, not certainly that there was cheating among--. The real issue has to do with the behavior of the key producers in the Gulf region--[whether] Saudi Arabia, just as it is now producing more oil, will cut back sufficiently to sustain the price at something like $18 a barrel. One of the factors which is [unintelligible] production over this period more than is necessary to take off being driven by the stockpiling. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	84	GREENSPAN	 I think that the Saudis are a self- correcting mechanism because they have maintained that posted $18 a barrel light Arabian crude price, and if the spot price goes under it, their liftings will fall, because no one is going to pay $18 if the spot is $17-1/2. So, it's a sort of self-correcting mechanism, which worked in the very beginnings of this. And I think that's one of the reasons the cheating is really an issue and was relevant to bringing crude price from, say, $22 a barrel down to $18. But the Saudis have demonstrated that they can lock the price at that level. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	85	PRELL	 Mr. Chairman, of course, [unintelligible]. Governor Seger, if you wanted to adjust your thinking on this in terms of our rule-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	86	SEGER	 That's not my forecast. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	87	PRELL	 But in terms of our rule-of-thumb, $5 a barrel is worth something like a percentage point on the CPI over the course of the year, and significantly less than that, obviously, in GNP prices, in domestic output prices. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	88	SEGER	 Wouldn't that also help our trade balance? Again, it seems to me that the higher price of oil that we are importing has been a negative. I would assume that that would cut current dollar imports, anyway, if nothing else changed. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	89	TRUMAN	 In the short run, I think it's going to be the other way. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	90	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	91	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me comment that I think our forecast parallels the forecast that appears in the Greenbook this time. But a question, I guess to Mike: With regard to the really sharp swing that you have between the third and fourth quarters in personal consumption expenditures, and the resulting buildup in inventories, which we have somewhat [unintelligible] for the period ahead, is that in your forecast totally as a result of the auto sales picture that you've described? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198708	92	PRELL	 Effectively. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	93	GUFFEY	 No other factors-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198708	94	PRELL	 That's the key factor. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	95	GUFFEY	 The other question I would pose has to do with your outlook on inflation and your rather sharp jump in the unit labor  cost that appears between the third and fourth quarters and continues on out through the projected period. It's my impression, at least, that other than the autos that come up in September, the union-labor negotiations [calendar] is very thin, and we can't see where you're getting that kind of a jump in the output, the decrease in productivity, and so forth. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	20.0
198708	96	PRELL	 Well, maybe we didn't successfully answer this, but the productivity numbers are being bounced around by our expectation of what the timing of Labor Day will do to the hours numbers in September. We feel that this is a sound enough arithmetic point, in terms of our understanding of how the data have run over the years. We have a very low September level in these numbers, which affects the average level of hours in the fourth quarter; so we have this gyration of 2 percent growth in productivity in the third quarter going down to 1/2 percent in the fourth. On the compensation side, we have the beginnings of an acceleration in compensation over the second half of this year, but there isn't a big third- to fourth-quarter jump; the big jump there is in the first quarter next year when higher payroll taxes take effect. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	97	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	98	STERN	 We have already touched on this, but have you done some analysis of the impact of higher energy prices on the acceleration in inflation we have seen so far this year? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	41.0
198708	99	PRELL	 Well, I'm not sure what kind of analysis you have in mind. It's clear that it has been a very significant factor. For the year as a whole, we have energy prices contributing 2-1/4 percent, roughly, to the acceleration in the prices of consumption and investment goods. It's clear, though, that the first-half acceleration in consumer prices is largely in energy prices; food prices haven't done so well, but that's a rather small contributor to the first-half acceleration; it's primarily energy prices. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	100	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	101	MELZER	 Mike, I wanted to ask about short- and intermediate-term business demand. How do you conceptualize the slowdown that is occurring there? How would you explain that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198708	102	PRELL	 Short- and intermediate-term business credit? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	103	MELZER	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
198708	104	PRELL	 Well, part of it, we think, is the move to longer-term financing after we had an interruption of the flow, so to speak, when rates backed up earlier this spring. The rates came down a little, and maybe [unintelligible] corporate treasurers began to think that they shouldn't be waiting for still more decline. They seem to have come to market in significant size. As best we can sort these things out, that's the one thing we can put our finger on that the data would seem to support very clearly. We don't see it as reflecting a sudden drop-off in inventory accumulation, for example; the data just don't show that. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	105	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller.  	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	106	HELLER	 Michael, in the federal deficit reduction to $123 billion that the Administration is projecting, can you provide us with more details? Is it mainly on the expenditure side or the revenue side? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198708	107	PRELL	 I haven't had an opportunity to commit all this to memory yet. You're focusing on which year? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	108	HELLER	 On your handout, there is a drop from $158 billion to $123 billion, and then you say with policy action-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198708	109	PRELL	 Basically, we assumed, in addition to some Congressional action that has already occurred, that something akin to their program will be adopted--an action which gives you on the order of $35 billion in deficit reduction. That's on a par with the Congressional budget resolution number as well. The outlay number for 1988 that they have now is $8 billion a month above their January estimate. Obviously, the revenue is the other thing, and the receipts number is $7-1/2 billion below the January estimate. That's largely a reflection of the downward revision in their forecast of corporate income tax receipts. That's the major [unintelligible]. On the outlay side, they have had to respond to the higher interest rates they have seen. They're expecting somewhat higher interest payments and they're also responding to the higher inflation that we've had, which will feed through to a larger cost-of-living adjustment for social security recipients and federal pension recipients. These are the major features of the changes of the baseline for the 1988 budget number. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	110	HELLER	 Thanks. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	46.0
198708	111	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	112	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman, I think the staff has done an unusually good job in describing the outlook, and I know Mike has done a very exceptional job in handling some very difficult questions. I guess I come out pretty close to where Frank Morris is on this. I think that the recent spate of statistics indicates that the economy is really beginning to strengthen quite a bit and a lot of that apparently is resulting from improved exports. I would sort of discount the last figures we got from Census on the trade balance on the grounds that you have a lot of price increases of imported goods in there, and price increases on oil, and probably some anticipatory buying because of the oil problems and also because of protectionist legislation. So, if this is true, then I think we could see some bigger figures than the staff is projecting. We are approaching the end of the fifth year of economic expansion at a time when we would expect bottlenecks to begin to appear, and I think they are in some industries. This is the kind of environment in which we could see wage and cost pressures begin to turn around from what we have been fortunate to have had in the immediate past, along with this further heightening of inflationary pressures and attendant upward pressure on long-term interest rates. So, I think it's a situation where we have to increase the care with which we look at the situation; we're now in a different era from where we were a couple of months or so ago. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
198708	113	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Forrestal.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	114	FORRESTAL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our forecast has changed very, very little since the last FOMC meeting. We still have growth in '87 turning out to be in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent range; if there is any change in the forecast, it is that we now think we may very well get closer to the 3 percent level than to the 2-1/2; so, the forecast really is for growth to be just a tad below 3 percent. If we have any differences with the Greenbook, they're very minor. In '88, I think we may very well get somewhat higher growth. I'm also not as optimistic about the deficit picture; I just have a gut reaction that, given the election year, and so on, it may be difficult to achieve any meaningful improvement there. Last month I mentioned that we had a sizable difference of opinion with the staff about personal consumption expenditures; I see that the staff has adjusted their numbers up, but I still think they're a bit on the low side; but the staff has come a little closer to our forecast, anyhow. On balance, Mr. Chairman, we don't have much difference with the staff forecast on growth. As far as inflation is concerned, we have the deflator rising to about 4 percent or a little more in 1988 and, I must say, this gives me some cause for concern. I think that we were all hopeful that the low numbers we saw in price gains in 1986 were permanent, but I'm beginning to think they are not; and I think that we still seem to be stuck with a trend of inflation that's somewhat higher than we would like to see. At earlier meetings over the past couple of months, I was worried that economic activity could fall on the short side of the forecast. Now I've changed my mind in that I think perhaps the risks are on the other side, as some other speakers have indicated. Revisions to the earlier data and higher activity in the first half suggest that the appreciable decline we have seen in the unemployment rate probably is not a fluke. We kept thinking that there was something wrong with those numbers and that the unemployment rate would go back up. But it hasn't done that. And with the rate at 6 percent, I think we are awfully close to the point where some pressure on wages is likely to emerge, as the staff has indicated. So, in this environment, it seems to me that the inflationary risks of economic activity turning out higher rather than lower are fairly substantial; and it wouldn't take very much, in my judgment, for expectations to build pretty significantly for higher inflation. I'd like to say a word about the District. Economic activity in the Sixth District continues to be fairly good and, in fact, it's gaining momentum. The weak areas in the economy, particularly Louisiana, are beginning to show improvement partially, or perhaps primarily, due to the increase in the price of oil. For example, the number of active rigs in Louisiana and in the Mississippi coast area of Alabama is the highest in two years. So that is fairly good news. The other thing that is perhaps interesting to note is that, whereas a few months ago, people that we talk to around the District were not reporting any significant price increases, now they are indicating that the prices of their raw materials, for example, are going up. And for the first time, we're hearing people say that they are, in fact, able to pass through some of these price increases to their customers. That's a significant change from reports that we had had previously. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
198708	115	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	116	KEEHN	 Our forecast is certainly quite consistent with the staff forecast as it relates to this year. However, I will say that our outlook for 1988 is somewhat stronger. And, I would join those who have commented that, as we go along, the revisions are likely to be up rather than down. Our District has lagged the rest of the country in the recovery, but since the end of last year that has not been the case. As we look at our industries and our indicators, we are tending at least to equal the national numbers. This year, for example, as we have gone through the year, employment increases in our five states have been consistently equal to the national increases. The increases have tended to be on the nonmanufacturing side, but even in the manufacturing category, we are significantly above the low level of manufacturing employment prevailing at the end of 1982. Unemployment continues to be a little higher than the national average, about a percentage point higher; nonetheless, that margin seems to be coming down. And, I do think that some of the manufacturing sectors that have been going through a very difficult period are showing really surprising strength. In steel, for example, which is a very tough industry, the steel plants that are producing sheet steel are about at capacity. Those producing structural steel are lower than that, but nonetheless stronger than you might expect. And, there are a number of other categories in the machinery side that are showing improvement. A large manufacturer of diesel engines in our area is now really having a hard time keeping up with the demand; construction equipment is stronger; and even the railroad equipment business, which has been absolutely moribund, is beginning to show some signs of life. All of this, of course, excludes autos, though the sale numbers for autos, as Mike is suggesting, continue to look like 10 million or more [unintelligible] this year or next year. The production schedules in the third quarter will be down by about 13 percent; and for the fourth quarter, though the schedules are not final, it looks like they'll be down about 5 percent. And the inventories do not seem to be out of line . On the agricultural side, I have just a quick comment. I am almost hard pressed to say that, certainly, we have stabilized; and there are even some signs of improvement. The land values, which in the first quarter were level, at least, did show improvement in the second quarter; those land values continue to move up a bit, albeit from very, very low levels. Nevertheless, transactions that are taking place show some sign of strength in land values. There was, as you know, a recent revision in farm income; and the outlook for this year is for a significant increase and, therefore, those farm income numbers look pretty good. Surprisingly--or at least I find it surprising--the increase in farm income is not a result of higher subsidies, but rather of a decrease in production costs, which is an encouraging sign. So that part of the agricultural sector looks pretty good. Admittedly, we have a long way to go before the harvest, but at this point the growing conditions look good. We would anticipate good crop yields per acre and, in some areas, there will be record production. The overall production will be down by 12 percent; the acreage is down even more-- say, 14 percent; but, again, we have a net improvement in yield. So, I do think the conditions in the District are much improved for the rest of this year and into next year .  But, as I pointed out, there are a couple of key areas. On this trade balance issue, I've had the feeling all year that we were seeing a correction; the people I talk to suggest that that is the case. The June numbers were certainly disappointing. I hope there's nothing fundamental there. But if the major economies in the world do not turn around and begin to pick up and take our exports, this obviously will have a big impact. On the inflation side, we are seeing some of the price increases that Mike mentioned. They are in a couple of categories. Specifically, in steel, one manufacturer increased prices 4 to 6 percent and this time they're sticking--again, at very low levels. But if these price increases begin to become pervasive, and then go through to the labor side, I think the outlook for inflation will be quite different. I don't yet sense that. All the people I talk to who are negotiating labor contracts are continuing to get very good results: reasonably modest increases on an annual basis, and importantly, very good work rule changes, so that productivity and unit labor costs seem to be better. But, I do think these are, of course, the two key areas: the trade balance and inflation. Net, I think the economy, both nationally and in our District, continues to look good and seems to be improving. As we go along here, there is the opportunity for increasing the growth forecast. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
198708	117	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	118	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, our forecast is in basic agreement with the Greenbook forecast, but I'd agree that the risks, in terms of growth, are on the upside, for many of the reasons that have been mentioned. For example, we have assumed the $25 billion deficit- reduction measures which are indicated in the Greenbook, and it's possible that some portion of those measures will not be enacted. That's another area, in this case resulting from the government sector, where we could see a greater boost to GNP, at least until some of the secondary impacts of a greater deficit are felt. Moreover, when we look at the 12th District, the data to us, particularly in the area of employment and retail sales, indicate strong growth. And the discussions I've had over the past month with directors --not only at the head office but also at our four branches--indicate a greater optimism about business prospects than I have ever seen in the year and a half that I've been with the System. I'm more pessimistic on inflation than the Greenbook, since I believe that the fixed-weight price index will continue to advance at a 4 to 4-1/2 percent rate in the last half of this year and remain in that range in 1988. It seems to me that recent tightening in labor markets raises the chances of price increases in 1988, and it certainly heightens my longer-run concerns about inflation. It would appear to me that, at this point, our room to maneuver is rather limited, with the labor market around full employment, nominal short-term interest rates rising about 100 basis points next year--at least in our forecast--and real interest rates rising only slightly. The current forecast that we have and the one that is in the Greenbook hold out little or no prospect of the inflation rate subsiding in the near future. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
198708	119	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	120	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, our forecast also is pretty much in agreement with the staff forecast. We have strengthened our outlook for the national economy for the rest of this year and going  into next year. We think we do have a rate of expansion that is sustainable. Subjectively, it is a little hard for me really to believe all that, given what has been going on in our particular part of the country. While we are seeing a little improvement, we certainly are lagging the rest of the country. Both anecdotally and statistically, we can kind of show that we are working through the trough; but the recovery, to the extent that there is one, is so fragile that it would not take very much to have us continue the downturn that we've been in for the last couple of years. Reference has been made to energy. We have seen a little improvement there, certainly, in terms of perceptions. There has been a little improvement in construction, but it's not in building; it's in roads, public construction, that sort of thing. Manufacturing looks pretty good. In agriculture, we are continuing to see cropland values decline and we are not through yet; of course, we came into this a year or two after the Midwest, in particular. And, of course, everybody reads about the conditions of the financial institutions. One concern that we are hearing, primarily from people in mid-sized and small businesses, is that they're very concerned that they're not going to get credit. And without credit, they're not going to be able to grow and expand and create jobs. This is something that we're hearing more and more. The banks are not willing or able to lend, and a cutoff of credit has occurred; and they don't see very much end to it. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198708	121	CORRIGAN	 Is it because banks and thrifts are getting super conservative? Is that the idea? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
198708	122	BOYKIN	 That's a lot of it, Jerry. The bankers say that there just is not any loan demand. The small and mid-sized businessmen say we have the demand but banks won't take the risk. So, I think it's probably somewhere in between--the banks are not seeing the kind of demand in the loans that they are willing to make. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
198708	123	GREENSPAN	 Governor Johnson. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	124	JOHNSON	 I agree in general with what the Greenbook says and what I've heard about the outlook. I do think it's picking up; it looks better and there is some growing upside risk. However, I have a number of concerns that really cause me to question this view completely, and there are a few problems that I have with the Greenbook forecast, in particular. So, I'm still uncertain, overall. First, the growth that we see appears to be primarily due to the improvement in real net exports; export volume is causing the stimulus that we see right now. And, if that is indeed the case--if most of the growth is coming in the external area rather than in domestic aggregate demand--you have to really ask yourself how much of the potential Phillips-curve type effects on pricing you can get from that kind of growth. And that modest expansion in aggregate demand, I think, is being verified somewhat by the aggregates, as well as by other types of evidence for consumption. You really have to ask how much inflation pressure can be produced by that type of a scenario. When you look at the broader inflation indexes, the CPI, excluding energy, shows some pressure, but the PPI shows no influence outside the energy area. As a matter of fact, it has been decelerating this year, ex-oil. So you really don't see a broad buildup yet on the price side.  Th e staff forecast has rising interest rates, and I think some of their policy assumptions are inconsistent with the forecast. That rise in interest rates, at least if the aggregate models are correct, is going to produce a further weakening in the monetary aggregates. Looking at a further weakening in the monetary aggregates, you have to ask yourself: How much nominal GNP can you get out of those kinds of aggregate growth rates, and does the velocity number that is consistent with that make any sense at all to you? I don't think you can get too much from a rising interest rates scenario out of the aggregates to produce enough nominal GNP to produce a serious risk. The other point I have is on the movement of the dollar. One problem I have on the dollar is what I pointed out yesterday in the Board meeting: we really have had no net depreciation of the dollar this year. Now, there's always the possibility, and I continue to worry about the downside risks on the dollar. I know it has come off a little today; we've talked about some of the reasons. But the fact of the matter is that there has been no net dollar depreciation this year and we're late into the year. The forecast is contingent upon a 10 percent depreciation in '87 to produce the lagged effects on prices in '88. Of course, there are still four months of opportunity for that. But you have to ask yourself, if you're not going to realize that kind of dollar depreciation this year, how are you going to get those lagged effects for '88? The other point is that if the oil price is expected to hover in the $18 range--and it's my feeling that the dollar is being influenced some by the oil price--an oil price in that range will keep the dollar high relative to the currencies of major industrial surplus countries like the mark and the yen. And if the dollar stays stronger because the oil price hovers in the $18 range, how are we going to get the dollar depreciation? On all of these questions, I'm not saying that they can't be overcome, because I see the outlook picking up some, too. But I really haven't resolved these questions in my mind and I think they are serious alternative issues to deal with. So, given these problems, I don't think we have enough evidence to expect a big upward move. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198708	125	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	126	ANGELL	 In many ways, Manley, you've made my speech, because I think what I hear you saying is that there is more uncertainty than some of the comments might indicate. It does seem to me that it's appropriate for us to assume that inflationary pressures need to be dealt with, and that it's appropriate for us to have a monetary aggregate growth path such as we have been having. To me, a 4 percent Ml, M2, and M3 path is, in itself, a rather significant antidote for these inflationary pressures that exist. Even though those inflationary pressures are there, and we are far from having turned the corner in abating these price increases, there might be some possibility that we will be successful if we are willing to maintain a monetary aggregates growth path such as we have. And there's something that I notice when I get out in the country and I talk to farmers and people in the oil business and realtors: there is a sense of unease that's in our country that really goes against what you were suggesting, Si, in regard to farm income. It is true that 1986 was a record year for net cash farm income; and 1987 is going to be another record above that record. But what I notice is that there is a conservatism, or even a super conservatism, that exists. Those  people who are the survivors, and those businesses that are successful, are the ones that kept their borrowing down. I notice no rush to borrow; I notice no stories from the entrepreneur types about how it makes sense to borrow money to do this or to do that. I notice instead that the fast-food business is not quite what it was, and that owning houses doesn't seem to be quite the way to profit. And I notice some unease and a scare out there that moderates behavior. So, it might be that this growth path of the monetary aggregates could bring a stop to the commodity price rises that we've seen during the last year, beginning last August. And if these commodity price rises do abate and the inflation expectation goes away, there is some possibility that deflationary forces could once again return. I think what we need to do at this point is to be open: to look at the various possibilities and to see if we can do the trick of getting commodity price rises stopped in sufficient time before they feed back into the wage/price cycle. If that can be accomplished, then it seems to me that a 4.1 percent GNP deflator and a 4.5 percent increase in the fixed-weight index for 1988 is totally unacceptable. We just must not let that occur. But having said that, let's not get ourselves too ready for an overkill. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
198708	127	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	128	STERN	 Well, I am considerably more comfortable with the Greenbook forecast at this meeting than I was in July, because it seems to me that the thrust of the latest statistics on the economy, with the revisions, serves to bolster the underpinnings and credibility of that forecast, at least in my mind. I think the revisions are important, as well, in this story because I think they help to put things in a more consistent picture. Throughout the expansion, it seems to me, we've had consistently strong increases in employment and we were seeing weaker increases than I would have expected in GNP and so forth; and at least in my mind, some of that gap has been reduced. I think we are looking at an economy that really has been performing rather well. That's certainly consistent with what's going on in the Ninth District. I have talked before about the two-tier economy and the divergence between what's happening in the urban areas, which are doing well, and the rural areas. But the latest developments suggest that that gap has diminished; that is, the rural economies are doing better, in part because agriculture is doing better, and in part because other aspects of the natural resource industries that the rural area of the Ninth District depends on are doing better. And that's encouraging. I might also comment on the fact that I've received a number of unsolicited reports from businessmen in the District about increased interest in export opportunities--that is, potential foreign customers coming to them to explore the possibilities of sales abroad of various products. This is everything from the high-tech end of the world to some very basic commodities. Again, I think that's consistent with what we have seen happening in the economy recently and what our forecasts suggest. I do think that, with all that good news, we probably are approaching a critical point when it comes to inflationary pressures. As Mike indicated, I think you can attribute much of the acceleration in the broad price indexes so far this year to the effects of higher  energy prices. But I think that looking forward, we have a number of things on the horizon that give me some pause even if energy prices level off or maybe even come down a bit from here. One is clearly what we're seeing in the bond market here and elsewhere around the world, where there are some signs of heightened inflationary expectations that manifest themselves in long-term rates. Secondly, I guess I'm not confident at all that in fiscal 1988 we'll achieve a Federal budget deficit significantly below this year's level. In fact, it could could be higher, if we're not a bit lucky. And, finally, as far as the labor market goes, I don't know what the natural rate of unemployment is, but whatever it is, we certainly have to be a lot closer to it today than we have been recently. And not surprisingly, if you look at unemployment by various demographic groups, as you would expect, we are at the lowest rates of unemployment in general since 1980 and, in some cases, since 1977. For some groups you have to go back to 1977, at least using quarterly average data, to find unemployment rates that low. I think we have benefitted heretofore from the rigidities in the wage determination process with which we are all familiar; I'm not talking just about what goes on with unions, but just the way business is run. But I don't think that we can count on those rigidities in that wage determination process always working in our favor, particularly if price indexes start to move up here. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
198708	129	GREENSPAN	 Vice President Hendricks. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	130	HENDRICKS	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our views of economic conditions closely parallel the staff's forecast in the Greenbook. As some others have suggested, there are a couple of areas where we differ a bit. One is in the growth of income, and the other is in consumption. On balance, it appears to us that the economy is picking up strength. Employment, output, and exports are expanding, as we see it, and we have noticed a jump in prices. Comments by our directors and others support this view. Even the hardest hit sectors --commercial construction, agriculture, and metals--are said, particularly by our directors, to be enjoying a period of stability and possible turnaround. So it's not surprising, I guess, that we would suggest that our forecast shows more strength, on balance, than is indicated in the Greenbook. 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
198708	131	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	132	SEGER	 I hope that the staff forecast is right on target, but I do have some questions and some doubts, I guess. One of them that I expressed yesterday at the staff briefing [to the Board] involves our emphasis on the trade turnaround. I'm just not convinced that we will get as much of a boost to the overall economic picture from the trade turnaround as we are counting on in the forecast either for the rest of this year or in 1988. It was mentioned earlier that some of the trading partners have economic situations that are far short of robust. So I think that's a key factor. Also, no one has mentioned it, but there are trade barriers out there that business people tell me about. And some of the obvious ones involve trying to get into the Japanese market. Also, I'm not convinced that the dollar is going to fall as much as we're assuming in our forecast. I realize it can be banged down but, as Governor Johnson said, there are things going on that may prevent that from happening. Also, the staff is talking about some gradual upward drift in interest rates. That may  happen, depending, of course, on what policy stance we take. But I guess I don't see as much of a bite on the economy from that upward drift as I might have expected. Looking at autos--and this would be more of a near-term situation than for '88--I think it's going to be a lot tougher to reduce those inventories than apparently you think, Mike. Some of the specific makes have over a 100-day supply; that's not worked down easily even at 1.9 percent interest rates. One of the reasons they have so many is they haven't a lot of sex appeal in the models; they may have to just give them away on some Saturday night, I don't know. Anyhow, I think it's a lot greater challenge than -- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	133	JOHNSON	 That's pretty awful. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	44.0
198708	134	SEGER	 That's right. I don't like it myself. My final comment involves inflation, and here Governor Angell made my point about commodity prices. I don't think it's guaranteed that these are going to just keep rising. We all know that commodity prices are very volatile and influenced by many, many things above and beyond monetary policy. And I believe, as he said, that there are factors at work that may, as a matter of fact, keep those under control. Particularly when I think about the crude oil situation, I'm not certain that we're going to get what's in the staff forecast. On the labor market shortage, I just don't think there is a. labor market; I think there are all sorts of labor markets--for different skills, for different industries, and for different geographic areas. So I don't know that it makes any sense even to talk about a natural rate of unemployment because I just don't know how to use it as a guide. Finally, one of the things that I really don't think we're emphasizing enough is the real change in managerial attitudes. I see more backbone among corporate executives in their labor negotiations than I've seen in my whole working career, which goes back a long time. And I'm really delighted to see that they no longer assume that they can just pass through these higher labor costs--which they used to do, particularly in the major industries. Also, the company heads are more and more aware of import competition, more and more aware of the need to be efficient and to get even more efficient. They're pushing the employees for moves that would enhance productivity. This is going on all the time in the auto negotiations. The emphasis is on job security; there is even talk of freezes on actual wages. To the extent that there are pay adjustments, in a number of major companies they are making sure that the productivity gains do offset them because the 1.1 percent--or whatever the overall national number is-- is not what the productivity gains are in specific companies. And so, I think, they are tending more and more to tie their own wage settlements to their own productivity enhancement moves. And I think that's all to the good. I put all that together and I don't see zero inflation, but I don't see 4-1/2 percent heading towards 14 percent either. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
198708	135	GREENSPAN	 President Corrigan. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	136	CORRIGAN	" Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we'll probably get a little better sense of things when we get back to work in earnest in September and businesses start doing their planning for 1988. But, as I look at things right now, first, I think that the outlook for the economy is better--not that I thought that it was all that bad to begin with. And second, I have to conclude that the inflation risks have risen. In terms of the ""body english"" that can  be put on that, some can say--as I think Mike Prell did a long time ago--that one way to look at it is simply with a higher degree of confidence that something approaching 3 percent real growth could be realized. I would simply add that, in the current circumstances, I do think we have to keep in mind that something like the staff forecast for real growth isn't far from what is optimal, considering the need to effect the external adjustments that we have all been talking about and to maintain some hope that the inflationary process does not get away from us, as a number of people have suggested. On this all-important question of the external adjustment, for what it's worth, the New York staff forecast is a little stronger overall in real GNP. Interestingly enough, it is also one in which there is no assumption of further dollar depreciation in 1988, but despite that, we get a better showing in the trade account and the current account in nominal terms and end up at about the same place in real terms. Now, the reasons for those differences, I think, are important. One is that we do have slightly stronger growth--not a gangbuster pace by any means--but marginally stronger growth in the non-U.S. industrialized world than is in the staff forecast. A second factor, of course, is that without the second or third J-curve effect, the nominal effects work in the right direction. And finally, we do have United States export prices going up more rapidly than the staff forecast does. Each one of those, obviously, is a big ""if"" and, taken together, they are a lot of ""ifs"". But the key point is that they do suggest at least the possibility that you could get an outcome that is better in nominal terms and about the same in real terms, without having to rely on a further depreciation of the dollar, with its inflationary implications and the risk, of course, that further depreciation of the dollar could get away from us. I think that is important for another reason. I tend to look a lot at what I call ""a domestic savings gap"" in trying to figure out where we are in terms of capital and savings requirements. As things stand right now, and assuming a Federal budget deficit in 1988 somewhere in the $150 to $160 billion range, the fact of the matter is that we have made precious little progress in reducing the so-called domestic savings gap. If the budget deficit next year is in that $150-$160 billion range, and if total net private investment is only about 5 percent of the GNP, which is darn small, the savings gap relative to GNP is still going to be 2-1/2 percent or more of GNP. It is still going to be $145 or $150 billion in absolute terms--not down at all from its peak in 1985 or 1986. So, that fundamental disequilibrium is still there. In fact, it has not improved much at all, despite the reductions that we have seen in the budget deficit, because the saving rate for the economy as a whole has slipped off its peaks of 1985 and 1986--not decisively, but enough so that the problem, both in relative and absolute terms, is still very much with us throughout the forecast period. That in itself says to me that we have to be especially cautious, because one way or another that residual is going to have to be filled from abroad, if interest rates and exchange rates are going to remain consistent with the kind of economic profile that the forecasts are talking about. On the inflation question, I can be very brief and simply say that a number of us, including myself, have fretted in the past about crossing that threshold of 4 percent in the deflator and 5 percent in the consumer price index; and it seems to me that the consensus view, though not the universal view, among private economists and others is  that we are there. That, I think, is the reality. As things stand right now, I can postulate conditions that would produce a result better than that, but I certainly don't think that those are the likely outcome. Indeed, I guess I'd be on the side that says that I could also postulate conditions in which, heaven forbid, we could find ourselves looking at 5 percent on the deflator and 6 percent in the consumer price index. If we get to that point, then we are looking at a situation that inevitably carries with it the risks of highly destabilizing consequences for the real economy here and around the world. Indeed, I think the lessons of the past are clear: if you wait to see that kind of problem staring you in the face, the costs of unwinding it are going to be exponentially greater than the costs of checking it in the first place.

198708	138	HELLER	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think the overall numbers, which are rather satisfactory, are good not because the aggregate economy is really good, but because the sectors which have been weak so far are the sectors that are picking up. If you keep that in mind, I think the inflation picture also will look a little different than it does when looking at the aggregate economy as a whole. We are eliminating the sectoral imbalances in trade and in the government sector as well as in the regional sectors that were pointed out before. Overall, I think that makes for a healthier economy because, in essence, we are pulling the weak sectors up without really hurting the strong sectors at the present time. Consumers are still moving forward but at a rather subdued 4-1/2 percent pace in the overall forecast. And I agree with what President Morris said earlier: that the investment picture may actually be a little better than the numbers of 3.8 to 4.2 percent next year suggest. I'd be slightly more optimistic there, but not all that much. On the export front, I think also that our growth will be sustained in the double- digit area; 12 percent in the Greenbook is certainly sounding good. Turning to the price area, because we're having that pickup in sectors that previously were very subdued, we should not experience the burst in prices that would be associated with an overall Phillips curve. Therefore, I also think the employment gains which have been achieved are in areas and in sectors, such as manufacturing and agriculture, that were previously very, very depressed indeed. Overall, I think the producer price index, as has been pointed out, is rather stable. And I agree with what Mr. Corrigan just said: the final user prices, the GNP prices, are drifting up at a 4.5 percent rate. But then again we have to ask ourselves--this really should be reserved for the next part of our discussion, but let me bring it up-- if we're having monetary growth right now of 5 percent and we're having price increases of 4 to 5 percent, what does that mean for the real economy if you want to make that equation square? I certainly disagree with the view of the world that we're having a zero growth. So something else will have to give. Either we have to produce a lot more money or price increases will not be sustained at a very healthy consolidation phase of the economy; and I don't really see very major risks on either side. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	46.0
198708	139	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey.  	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	140	GUFFEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I've already made comments with respect to our outlook and our general agreement with the Greenbook forecast. I'd like to make this very brief, in view of the time. The regional economy that we're experiencing in the Tenth District has some positive outlook to it in the sense that, as others have already commented, the agricultural sector is having and will have one of its best years, with this major rise in net farm income. There has been a good crop. The red meat industry is in very, very good shape. As a result, there has been some uptick, or at least modest turnaround, in what had been falling agricultural land values. One survey shows that from the first quarter to the second quarter, agricultural land values have increased about 1-1/2 percent; and that's to be contrasted with a long period of declining land values. I would just note, however, that the sales that have translated into that greater land value number are one of two kinds: 1) cash transactions in which neighboring producers are picking up depressed or troubled land ownership; or 2) the Farm Credit System is offering very attractive financing rates to move land off of their books in order to avoid any additional loss. I would just note that, as a result of this, the margins in the production of red meat are very good at the moment. However, the inventory is beginning to build, and we would expect that there would be little or no additional pressure on prices from the food sector as a result of the [uninteligible]--no real hope of increased commodity prices either in terms of crops or red meat. Lastly, there is some optimism being generated in the energy sector. There is some drilling now taking place; the rig count is up modestly from a month or two ago. So, psychologically, given what we see, we would expect things to continue to improve but at a very slow rate. In the commercial real estate area, we have overbuilding in Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, which is depressing that market; and those conditions, obviously, rose out of the depressed conditions of agriculture and energy that they depend on greatly. We believe things are looking up, but we have a long upward pull to get back to better conditions than we have now. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
198708	141	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	142	MELZER	" I wanted to pass on just one piece of anecdotal information that bears to some extent on what Jerry and Bob Heller were saying: one businessman in our District in the shoe business mentioned to me that they're running at essentially 100 percent of capacity now. I sense that's close to true in textiles, and, at least in some respects, in the steel area. So I mention that. I guess what concerns me, when you think about this external adjustment process that Jerry talked about, is that we shut down capacity so quickly over this period of years that I think we are bumping up against capacity constraints in those industries a lot sooner than anybody could have anticipated. I asked a logical follow-up question to this executive: ""Well, are you going to expand capacity?"" In that case, they have closed facilities that they could probably reopen without a major capital investment. But, basically, the message was that chief executive officers and financial officers, having been through this period of shutting capacity down for so long, are going to be very slow to make the investment to reopen. As a result, even in these industries that have been depressed, I think the pressures on the labor markets are apt to build a lot faster, because the investment is not going to follow as quickly as it might have in a more orderly  period, if you will. I wanted to pass that on; I thought that was interesting. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
198708	143	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	144	KELLEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to spend just a second on a little different perspective. There has been a very good staff forecast and a lot of very good comment on it. But it might be worthwhile to put our attention just a little on whether or not there may be some very fundamental long-range changes running underneath the surface of the world economy and our economy. If there's an analogy there, it may be what happens in the sea: you have the Gulf stream running up the East Coast from south to north; the storms come and go and calms come and go; and the tide shifts back and forth with the Gulf stream still running north up the coast. It kind of dominates everything in the long run. I wonder if there's any of that effect going on in the world economy. I see several things out there that could be fundamentally deflationary in the long term. That's not to quarrel with the kind of forecast that we're seeing here over the forecast period. But it seems to me that if we can avoid falling into the protectionist sinkhole--and maybe we won't--that there is a super abundance of pretty capable labor across the world that's waiting to produce, and it's currently grossly underemployed. And there's capital that's mobile enough to get there to set up factories and economic capabilities, and do whatever is necessary to employ that still quite low-cost labor. And we're going to be competing with that labor. In a great many commodity areas there is a worldwide abundance of capacity. Absent political events, there's plenty of energy for the next few years at least. The world is coming into a surplus of farm commodity production on an aggregate basis; there are lots of metals, and so forth. The third factor may be that it probably was inflationary to increase the enormous levels of international debt that we now are struggling with, but it probably is going to be deflationary to try and service that debt, now that we have it. There's a lot of pressure on a lot of economies to produce in order to earn foreign exchange to try to service their debt. So there are some things out there which seem to me to possibly be exerting a [unintelligible] deflationary effect. And, while I see the pressures that we have over the forecast period, and I would not quarrel with those, I think that maybe these long-run deflationary effects under the surface might damp that, as they play through in the inflation numbers. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
198708	145	GREENSPAN	 Mr. Boehne, do you have any comments you'd like to make at this time? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
198708	146	BOEHNE	 No, I have none. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
198708	147	GREENSPAN	 I'd like to make just a few observations. We spent all morning, and no one even mentioned the stock market, which I find quite interesting in itself. I think it's important in the sense that as an economic force, history tells us sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. It's conceivable to me, however, that this may be one of the times in which we may begin to see some opening up in the capital goods markets. It's very dull; appropriations are not expanding at a rapid rate, but they are expanding. And I think what the new orders are showing is a mixed bag. Mike mentioned that there may be some exports in those orders,  but we also may be seeing an increase in the share of the total domestic capital investment markets because, remember, those figures are orders at domestic facilities only. And the one thing that seems to be appearing in the numbers, in real terms, is that irrespective of the nominal trade figures, the share of capital investment coming from abroad has been increasing dramatically, although it's now beginning to taper off. That will create a much stronger set of new orders figures for equipment, as we see in the aggregate appropriation numbers and the aggregate investment numbers. I'm a little concerned that we may be looking at more than the opening up in this area that the staff numbers show, in part, because I think profit figures are moving fairly quickly. The ability to pass through prices is another way of saying margins are opening up. And we are beginning to see very clear evidence in a number of areas that we are picking up some form of potentially significant profit expansion. That would lead me to conclude that we could very well be running into trouble at these monetary aggregate levels; but my impression is--at least my hope is-- to get to it a little later. But we may be looking at the possibilities of a turn in velocity numbers at this stage. I think the presumption that velocity will stay somewhere down in this area, or even approximate the staff forecast, may be wishful thinking. I think there is more of a potential on the inflation side, on the nominal GNP side, at fairly low credit and monetary aggregate expansion than I think we're willing to admit, if for no other reason than I think we're merely projecting the most recent past. I think that is turning; and if it turns, we'll have some possibly significant difficulties. On the exchange rate question, even though the staff forecast, as I understand it, has implied profit margins on imported goods flat at very low levels --meaning that the import prices of goods shipped into the United States are essentially reflecting very little change in profit margins--I think history tells us that that doesn't ■happen often either. The evidence suggests that, from these levels, the likelihood is for more of an increase in those margins --meaning an increase in import prices relative to the exchange rate. What I conclude from all this myself is that, while the staff forecast is in a way the most likely forecast, I'd be inclined to suppose that the risks are clearly on the upside, both on volume and on price. And my last forecast is that that's likely to be the way Mike will come out the next time around. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0

198708	152	KOHN	" In some respects the Committee faces what has become a familiar  situation in interpreting incoming financial and other data as background  for its decision today. Growth of the broad monetary aggregates remains  sluggish relative to their annual ranges, but other indications in financial  markets and the economy do not suggest that the thrust of policy has been  especially restrictive.  Growth of the monetary aggregates picked up in July, and recent  data suggest that a further acceleration is in train this month. The blue-  book paths encompass growth in the aggregates roughly in line with the expected trend of income over coming months, as the effects of earlier increases in interest rates ard the opportunity costs of holding deposits  abate.  The acceleration is anticipated to be especially marked for M3,  which was depressed by unusually weak bank credit growth in July. This  aggregate would be expected to remain under the lower end of its long-run  range through September, but to climb within that range during the fourth  quarter, given the staff's projection of a moderate pace of credit expansion  at depository institutions and reasonably normal funding patterns for that  credit.  M2, however, is sufficiently below its range that the faster  growth rates envisioned would still leave it well short of the Committee's  long-run target range in September, and raise serious questions about the  attainability of that range for the year. Under the unchanged reserve conditions assumed for alternative B, M2 is projected to grow at a 5 percent  rate over June to September, which would require expansion at about a  11-1/2 percent pace in the last three months of the year to hit the lower  end of the range in the fourth quarter. Even under alternative A, whose  easier reserve conditions should have a considerable impact on money growth  in the fourth quarter, attainment of the M2 range would be uncertain.  The Committee has stated that M2 growth below its range could be  acceptable, depending on the circumstances. Looking at it from the perspective of the demand for money, the principal reason for the weak growth this  year and associated -rise in velocity, just as it was for the strong growth  and velocity declines in 1986, seems to have been market interest rate movements and changes in opportunity costs given the lagging response of deposit  rates, especially on the liquid money assets.  But growth of M2 has been weaker than might have been expected  frcm interest rate effects alone, at least based on historical relationships  embodied in our money demand equations. To an extent, this result may be  an aspect of the apparent moderation in overall growth of household financial  assets (abstracting frcm stock market wealth) that seems to have developed  this year, perhaps as a counterpart to reduced debt accumulation under the  new tax laws. In addition, demand deposits have been unusually weak, possibly  reflecting greater interest sensitivity than evident earlier as compensating  balances come to more nearly dominate holdings. This may well show through  into M2, since demand deposit weakness is less likely to involve shifting  into other M2 assets than is weakness in OCD. In its projections, the staff  has allowed for some ongoing shortfall in Ml and M2 growth relative to model  results, but not as much as has been evident earlier this year, with our  courage bolstered by the more robust pattern that seemed to be developing  over late July and early August.  Viewed from a broad economic perspective, relatively slow money  growth this year may be considered appropriate in circumstances of higher  inflation ard inflation expectations, and stimulus to the economy from an  improvement in the external sector. Reflecting this situation, other  indicators of the thrust of monetary policy do not appear to suggest that  the deceleration in money growth thus far will result in a weaker economy  than might be consistent with progress towards the long-run goals of price  stability, growth, and international balance and some signals suggest  that, if anything, forces or at least fears of inflation are still very  much in evidence, despite the behavior of money.  For example, the rise in nominal interest rates, which has played  such a key role in the money story, has accompanied a pickup in inflation  expectations and therefore does not seem to signal a comparable rise in  in real rates. Measured from last fall, one year ahead projections of  inflation in the greenbook, by outside forecasters, and by survey  respondents have increased up to 1 percentage point, just short of  the rise in one-year Treasury bill rates over the period, implying only a  small increase in real interest rates. Using these various alternative  measures of inflation expectations, this one-year real rate is estimated at  around 2-1/2 percent, not unusually high by historic standards. In circumstances in which a major boost to economic growth is expected to arise from  a continued improvement in external imbalances, a somewhat higher real  interest rate may be needed to restrain domestic demand especially in the  absence of definite prospects for continued progress in reducing federal  government budget deficits. Certainly, the behavior of the stock market  this year does not suggest that investors view monetary policy as having  been unduly restrictive; and the backup in bond yields in the United States  and elsewhere around the world recently seems to indicate a sensitivity in  financial markets to the possibility that the effects of rising prices are  more likely to dominate credit markets over the years ahead than is the  impact of any weakness in economic growth. This is reflected in the domestic  yield curve as well, which remains upward sloping, and is steeper than last  fall when many expected that weakness in the economy in 1987 would necessitate  an easing of policy this year.  Other sensitive indicators have shown mixed signals over the past  few months, but when viewed relative to late last year also seem to indicate  that policy has not been a particularly restrictive force. Commodity  prices have been relatively flat in recent weeks, but are well above levels  of last fall. And while the exchange rate has risen on balance since  late May, in terms of other G-10 currencies, it remains about 6 percent  below its level of last November.  As Mike noted, the staff forecast entoodies a view that demands on  the United States economy will be reasonably strong, and the margin of unusued  resources in the economy is sufficiently narrow that a further rise in  nominal interest rates and restrained money growth will be needed to keep  inflation from accelerating substantially, especially given the boost  to prices in the forecast from a further dollar decline. Concern about  an outlook along these lines might argue for a near-term tightening of  reserve, conditions, as under alternative C, or a tilt in the directive so  that the Account Manager would be particularly sensitive to the need to  tighten should additional information point toward strengthening price  pressures. Such a tilt would be consistent with a view that current conditions  might not yet warrant a tightening, but that the risks of damping the  economy unduly by moving to that side in response to incoming information  are far less at this point than the risks of spurring additional inflation by  moving to an easier stance, without very strong evidence that a satisfactory  path for the economy required such an easing.  An alternative view might stress the weakness of the aggregates,  various downside risks to the economic outlook and the implications for the  price picture of continuing moderate behavior of labor costs. It is difficult  to dismiss the aggregates altogether their growth last year, along with  the dollar's depreciation was one of the few indicators we had that monetary policy was reasonably expansive and that the economy in 1987 might be  stronger than the consensus view. If the slower money growth were contributing to the firmer dollar, this might have important implications for the  outlook. A dollar that remained strong along with sluggish activity abroad  would tend to produce both weaker prices and domestic economic growth than  in the staff forecast. Such a view would be consistent with at least a  balanced directive under unchanged reserve conditions, on the grounds that  the odds on a more restrained outcome should not be downplayed without  additional evidence of strength in prices or the economy. In particular,  if the aggregates were considered to have some informational content,  further shortfalls in M2 might even weigh towards reducing reserve pressures.  And, if the downside risks were thought to be particularly strong, this  view might imply a tilt toward ease or even choice of alternative A.  In any case, Mr. Chairman, the staff has included the usual array  of ""mights"" and ""woulds"" in the draft directive that could be used to indicate more of a readiness to move toward ease or tightening. The draft  directive also contains some wording suggestions should the Committee wish  to change the emphasis on various factors conditioning intermeeting adjustments. In particular, the Committee may want to consider whether the dollar  should have the same prominence it now has, which evolved through the  period of severe downward pressure on the dollar. Finally, in view of the  weakness in the aggregates, the staff has supplied language that would  indicate that faster growth than the Committee's short-run specifications  would be acceptable, provided there were no evidence of troubles on the  inflation or dollar fronts; this would allow for the possibility that  should some of the earlier weakness begin to be reversed, the desk would  not necessarily weigh that heavily on the side of seeking firmer reserve  conditions.

198708	154	GREENSPAN	 As we sit here, the dollar seems to be dropping. Maybe we ought to adjourn for awhile. I would like to open the floor now for a general policy discussion and some indications on the directive and borrowing requirements and any tilt that you would like to express as we go on. The Vice Chairman starts off. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	155	CORRIGAN	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I can be rather brief. As I said earlier, in the totality of circumstances that we face, I view something like the staff forecast as about as close to optimal as we can get right now. But I also regard the risks in that forecast as being strongly asymmetrical on the side of the economy being stronger and the inflation rate being higher. Because I have that view as to the asymmetries of the situation, and because I regard the risks of that type of an outcome to be potentially so severe, I would favor, at this point, a modest move in policy that would take the borrowing level to $600 million--in other words, something between ""B"" and ""C"". It's not that I think that kind of a move in and of itself is going to be decisive; but I do think that it will be enough of a move to show through in the marketplace, and to convey a sense of concern on the part of this Committee as to the potential for things working in an adverse way. I see that kind of an approach as relatively risk-free in that the initial change that it would carry, whether in terms of interest rates or things like that, is inconsequential as far as the forecast for the economy is concerned. I do not regard signal value as being inconsequential. So, on the theory that a stitch in time may indeed be worth nine, I would proceed along those lines. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	156	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	157	BOEHNE	 Mr. Chairman, I think that there is a case to be made for some tightening for all the reasons that have been stated: the risk of inflation in the economy and also the history of probably waiting too long. I am not ready to make that move at this point. I have enough doubts, and I think there are enough uncertainties, about the outlook for inflation and other aspects of the economy. The sentiment around this table has fluctuated a good bit in recent months, and I think we very well may be heading into a period where some tightening is appropriate; but I think it is premature at this point. I would favor a directive that would maintain the $500 million of borrowing, something along the lines of alternative B. However, I would give the directive an asymmetrical tilt indicating that if policy needs to be changed in the intermeeting period, that we would more likely lean in the direction of some snugging than some easing. So, I would be for no change, alternative B, with some asymmetrical wording that would tilt it in the direction of some tightening, should a change be necessary. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198708	158	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	159	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, I was going to say that, ordinarily, I would have been in favor of some slight tightening, but I also was going to say that I would be reluctant to do that in light of the dollar's strength in the foreign exchange market. However, given what you have just said, perhaps my thinking will change a little. I also was going to say that I thought the strength of the dollar was temporary, so I guess the markets are proving me right in advance. Given my view about the economy and what I see as the  potential for more inflation, particularly in early 1988, I think that we probably should make the move now, recognizing that there are some uncertainties in that forecast. I wouldn't want to do anything very dramatic, but I would opt for what I would describe as alternative B-plus with borrowing at about the $600 million level. That implies that I am willing to accept M2 growth that is below its range for the year; and I think it is pretty doubtful that we would be able to get it up to the bottom of the range in any case, unless we did a very pronounced easing of policy. I am willing to accept lower than intended growth, certainly, in preference to easing policy at this time. As far as the directive is concerned, I would suggest that we tilt slightly toward firming and keep an asymmetric directive that would enable us to firm even more, if circumstances required. As for the various clauses that the staff has indicated in the Bluebook, I would stress the indications of inflationary pressures and general business activity the most and downgrade the dollar. Also, I would keep that sentence in the directive that would allow for greater M2 and M3 growth--that we would tolerate that if it occurred. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
198708	160	GREENSPAN	 I would like to raise a point with respect to that. This directive goes through a very short period of time. And I'd raise the question as to whether or not it is really an operational directive at all, because by the time this is actually something that is likely to happen, we are beyond the period which we are focusing on, with respect to policy in any event. That's at least my view; I don't know how the rest of you read that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198708	163	GREENSPAN	" Well, I am referring to the sentence ""Somewhat faster growth in the broader aggregates would be acceptable in the absence of indications of worsening price pressures and substantial weakness in the dollar, given the shortfall of these aggregates from their annual averages."" What I am basically saying is that we are not going to learn a great deal more about what those aggregates are doing between now and the termination of the time frame to which this directive applies. So, I am not quite certain whether the directive has any operational significance because of the shortness of the time frame. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

198708	168	GREENSPAN	 That is all I meant. President Parry.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	169	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, I believe a strong case can be made for alternative C and I would characterize that, at least in terms of anticipated effects on interest rates, as being a small move. In July, several Committee members expressed the view that a tighter policy would be necessary in the coming months and I think developments since then strengthen that view. Most data released since our last meeting suggest that the economy and inflationary pressures are picking up. Inflation in the first half was over 4 percent and real growth was at a very strong 3-1/2 percent rate. Data that we have seen so far on economic activity in July-- particularly employment data, retail sales, industrial production--indicate that the economy remains strong in the current quarter. Given that it takes a long time for our actions to affect inflation, I believe we should make a policy adjustment. If we delay much longer, until inflation has really gained momentum, more severe action will be required to bring inflation under control. For those reasons I would support the adoption of alternative C as presented by the staff. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0

I think that we might need to move further in the event we get a period of pronounced weakness in the dollar. There has been so much talk in the foreign exchange market about the inevitability of a further leg down in the dollar that that seems to be the conventional wisdom. For that reason, this recent weakness in the dollar has the potential, I think, of generating a test of the earlier lows; that's just potential; I am not forecasting that. If that should turn out to be the case, we probably would have to make another move prior to the next meeting. But I think the evidence of greater strength in the economy would certainly support a modest move at this time of the sort that Mr. Corrigan outlined. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198708	174	ANGELL	" It seems to me that we need to remind ourselves that these minutes will be published six weeks from now, around the time of the next meeting. It just seems to me that we ought to be somewhat careful about making asymmetric statements when there is this much uncertainty. I think the real question is what do we do, not the question of symmetric or asymmetric. I would prefer a symmetric ""B"". Now, that puts me at the far end of those who have been speaking so far. I do believe that the monetary aggregate growth paths are quite different from those we had in the period that led to the price pressures we are now seeing; and I think it is a mistake for us to react with the monetary aggregates behaving in this nice 2 to 4 percent growth range, which might very well be the right path for the long run. Yet, as you anticipated, Mr. Chairman, and I would agree with you, we do have this change in velocity. It would be a mistake for us, then, to go to $600 million on borrowing, because $600 million will certainly be a vote for a lower monetary growth path. The members of the Committee know that I have not favored returning the monetary growth paths back to within our target ranges for the year; I have favored coming in below the ranges. But, just as a year ago, we were undoubtedly somewhat careless in not recognizing the 15 percent  monetary growth path when we made that discount rate change last August, I think it could be just as much a mistake for us to move now before we see the need. I am prepared to make adjustments as might be needed if commodity prices and the exchange value of the dollar were to move in such a direction as to make inflation and our worst fears realized. I would want to move at that point, but I am not willing to take a hard position now for minutes to be published six weeks from now based upon our feelings. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	175	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	176	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, I would favor alternative B. I would favor basically no change from current policy, and I say that because I guess I am not totally convinced that the economy is going to be quite as strong as perhaps some others believe. I question that inflation is a problem at this point. Granted, when you determine or realize it is a problem, you are pretty far down the road, so that a certain amount of anticipation is desirable. But, given the fact that the interval between this meeting and the September meeting is pretty short compared to some of the intervals, and that the need for a policy shift is less than convincing--to me, at least--I would stick with alternative B, the $500 million borrowing assumption. Rather than being symmetrical, though, I would have a sentence in there that would allow a little tightening by the Desk, if that should become necessary. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
198708	177	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	178	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, I would be in agreement with the position that Jerry Corrigan laid out. For reasons that have been well stated, it certainly seems to me that the economic opportunities at this point are on the upside and not on the downside. On the inflationary pressures, though admittedly far from conclusive, we may be going through something of a bubble here. Nonetheless, the signs are there and I do think it is appropriate that we begin to move against that. I find the aggregates' performance this year to have been erratic. They may emerge on a more predictable basis, but as yet I don't see the evidence of that. Therefore, I find the alternatives, in terms of aggregate growth rates, to be a little awkward. Accordingly, I would prefer to deal with the borrowing level and, given the circumstances, I think a borrowing level between ""A"" and ""B"", namely, $600 million, would be appropriate. In terms of the wording of the directive, I would be in favor of ""would"" for [greater] restraint and ""might"" for lesser restraint. And I do think that this sentence on the next page [of the Bluebook] does, at least preliminarily, convey the reverse meaning. I think we might fiddle with the language on that to get a more appropriate wording. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
198708	179	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	180	BLACK	" As Bob Parry indicated, Mr. Chairman, a number of us at the last meeting thought that we were probably going to have to let interest rates rise over the next 12 to 18 months if we were going to prevent this underlying rate of inflation from accelerating. And it seems to me that this expectation is even more likely now, in view of the information that we have had since then. At the same time, I am not exactly sure when it will be appropriate for us to take that action; but I believe that it will probably be sooner than I would  i/18/87 -29- have thought at the time of the last meeting. I am also well aware that the history of the System has been that, generally, we have not moved fast enough against inflation. So, I tend to try to compensate for that. Despite that, since there is a good deal of uncertainty out there, I believe the best case for now is to stick with alternative B. I would make it asymmetrical with the ""would"" on the tightening side and the ""might"" on the other. I think the Board staff's statement with regards to the ""as well as"" clause does suggest that it would be helpful to shift that around to deemphasize the borrowing side; as for the weakness of the dollar, that may deserve some further thought. I think there is also another argument: that we ought to put restraint of the business expansion high on that list if we are going to change the list around. And I would not put in that sentence on the undershoot of the aggregates at all. And I say this with the sneaking suspicion that later on down the road, I am going to look back and say, ""I wish I had been where Jerry Corrigan and those others were"". "	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
198708	181	GREENSPAN	 Governor Heller. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	182	HELLER	 Basically, I am for no change, as I said earlier. I believe that we are in a period of sectoral catchup and the monetary growth is very subdued at the present time. So, I would like to keep it at alternative B with a $500 million borrowing target and I would do two changes: 1) I would upgrade the importance of inflation, and maybe give it sole prominence in the first sentence; and 2) I would downgrade the dollar, as Presidents Forrestal and Black mentioned earlier. We are way above the lows that the dollar reached earlier, and to say that we want to react now to weakness in the dollar would probably be inappropriate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	183	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	184	STERN	" Well, as I suggested earlier, I think that the principal risk we are likely to face, over time, is higher inflation. The key question in my mind is one of timing. I don't have the sense that the inflation problem is a fait accompli. On the other hand, I don't think we can afford to sit back and wait until it is obvious, for reasons mentioned earlier about the cost of undoing it once it is in place. Balancing those two considerations, I am not prepared to go as far as alternative C, but I do view something between ""B"" and ""C"" as perhaps a positive, helpful, preemptive strike at this point in time. That entails, in my judgment, relatively little risk to the economic outlook; also, if it turns out that we were wrong, it would not be terribly difficult to undo. And from that perspective, I think it merits consideration as well. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198708	185	GREENSPAN	 Is that $600 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	186	STERN	 Right around there, yes. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198708	187	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	188	SEGER	 I'm in favor of no change, which is alternative B, $500 million borrowing target, for three main reasons. One is, as I think Governor Angell emphasized, the uncertainties that we are facing. Another reason is that there aren't that many weeks between this meeting and the next FOMC meeting; we have another chance, very  soon, to look at things and change our approach, based on additional readings of the economy. The third reason is that I just don't see that the economy is currently boiling. The forecast certainly does look pretty good; but, again, I question whether or not we're going to see the hit from the trade turnaround in the way that many are expecting. So, for those reasons, I would like to propose keeping reserve pressures as they are. And, in the statement, I would deemphasize the impact of the dollar on what we are doing. Also, I don't want to tilt the directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
198708	189	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Hendricks. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	190	HENDRICKS	" We see a further acceleration in prices this year and next, and believe that the risk is on the upside. Therefore, I believe it's reasonable, at this point, to increase the pressure on bank reserves by moving toward the ""C"" path. I'm not particularly picking the C alternative, but favor a $600 million borrowing objective. "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	191	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	192	MELZER	" I definitely would put the priorities on the side of worrying about inflation as opposed to the recovery. I would favor ""B"" with a tilt toward tightening. I could certainly accept a $600 borrowing target, although I'm not voting, so I don't need to accept it. I'd feel particularly strongly about moving if I felt that we were sort of maintaining a 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent funds rate against a very strong demand for reserves. Now, as you pointed out before, Mr. Chairman, on the velocity argument, maybe we won't see that. We're certainly not maintaining a lower funds rate than would otherwise prevail through rapid reserve injection here; but that's where I come out. I would be inclined to leave language in there about the dollar. I think if we lost control of the dollar on the downside, we could kick off that whole cycle that we dealt with just a couple of months ago; and I'd be very sensitive to weakness in the dollar in the language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
198708	193	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	194	KELLEY	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would prefer staying with ""B"", largely for the reasons I outlined a few minutes ago. I think that the underlying trends are going to tend to damp both the inflation that is showing up and also, perhaps, the robustness of the expansion that we're in. However, I do recognize the short-term tendencies toward some inflationary movement here. So, I would also like to see the language be asymmetric in the direction of tightening. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198708	195	GREENSPAN	 What do you want [on borrowing], alternative B? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	196	KELLEY	" I would stay with ""B"", the $500 million. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198708	197	JOHNSON	 I guess I see some firming signals and, as I said, a little more upside risk than I did before. But, a lot of the early warning signals--some of the financial market signals--are not showing us as strong a concern as they did at our last meeting. So, I'm a little reluctant to see us stick our neck out too far. I guess I'm somewhere around alternative B with asymmetric language to give us  the option of a potential tightening if we see firmer signs. But, sort of like Wayne, I'm not sure I want to commit myself to anything on instinct; I've got to have a little more evidence. When people read the minutes in six weeks, they'll look at what was going on when we made those decisions. The thing that has happened since the last meeting is that the real economy is showing more firmness, but that's about all I see right now. Maybe we'll be ready for a tightening move later, but for now I favor alternative B, with asymmetric language. I am for deemphasizing the dollar a little because, as I said earlier, I see it somewhat influenced by the oil price; and I'm not sure that the declining oil price, which might send the dollar down, is something we should be worried about. The dollar declined significantly, consistent with the decline in oil prices in 1986, and we saw inflationary expectations break in the face of that; we tried to resist the dollar's downward move; it certainly wouldn't have been a resistance against inflationary expectations. I'd like to avoid that kind of a problem. I think the dollar is still an important issue, but I think it depends on what's influencing it. So, I would rather highlight inflationary expectations and just leave the dollar as a proxy for that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	198	GREENSPAN	 $500 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	199	JOHNSON	 Yes, $500 million, with asymmetric language. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	200	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	201	GUFFEY	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A good deal of comment has already been made about the growth--that it's perhaps a bit stronger than we were expecting last month. But, I would just note that if you believe the forecast, and I think virtually everybody agrees with the Greenbook, you're only looking at 2-3/4 percent growth in the third and fourth quarters. That doesn't seem to me to be overly expansive. And, there is considerable uncertainty as to the inflation outlook, at least in my mind. To be sure, prices are quite likely to be up, but as a result of feeding through on import prices; and I'm not at all sure that a bit tighter monetary policy is an appropriate prescription under those circumstances. As a result, I would favor ""B"", with $500 million borrowing, until some additional evidence comes along. I would note, in that respect, for those who believe that the aggregates are important and that there is some informational content in them, that they're growing at a very nominal rate now. As a result, to further tighten at this point, in anticipation of some higher prices, seems to me. to be inappropriate. So I would go for ""B"" with a $500 million borrowing level until some more information surfaces that would lead us away from that. Lastly, I would prefer to leave the language with respect to the dollar in the directive because, in my view, monetary policy has to act against a depreciation in the dollar that becomes fast, no matter what the cause. And, as a result, I would leave it in, and I would even leave it at a fairly high level of visibility in the directive. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198708	202	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. If we averaged everybody, we'd get a different result than if we averaged the voting members by themselves. I don't know if this is a typical result of this type of activity.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	203	ANGELL	 The people who don't vote don't have to be responsible. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	204	GREENSPAN	" I'll put that on the record. It's fairly obvious that this is a unanimous vote for alternative B, and I would read it as a mild--maybe slightly more than mild--majority for a tilt in the language. There is some desire to move inflation and business expansion up in the language and the dollar down. The average borrowing requirement amongst the voting members is a shade under $550 million. For those of you who are keeping score, I'd opt for ""B"" with $600 million and a definite tilt. Basically, my own view is that the risk of snuffing out this expansion at this stage with mild tightening is extraordinarily small. My view is not so much that we know a great deal about what's going to happen in the fourth quarter and beyond. I just find it rather difficult to perceive a set of forces which can bring this expansion down when you have the following: lead times in the delivery of materials and investment goods as short as we have now, which presupposes that the markets are basically tight on inventories; clear evidence of an expanding capital investment market; and, in effect, pretty much a full adjustment in consumer expenditures [unintelligible] I think we are likely to get as a result of the income adjustments from the tax bill and other elements. I do not believe that this is strictly a [unintelligible] trade issue myself, but I think there is more to it than the trade balances that are emerging. And when you begin to see order impacts in some of the basic raw materials, such as in steel and aluminum, and the extraordinary behavior of the textile industry, which is surprising even with all the restrictions, I wouldn't join my colleagues here who consider this a set of very uncertain things. I think what is uncertain is how it materializes; but, I've seen this before, and this doesn't look uncertain to me. I may eat those words in six weeks, but it has a tone to it which I, frankly, find not really inflationary yet; there is no evidence in the wage data that I see. In any event, that's the way that I come out; and that's the way I read everybody else. I guess we can structure some language which I suspect would pretty much grasp the issue. Let me describe it. On the operational paragraph, it would read: ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions."" As you know, we can either put this in terms of ""somewhat greater reserve restraint"" or ""slightly greater reserve restraint"". As I listened to the discussion, I read it as ""somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, behavior of the aggregates, and developments in the foreign exchange market. I don't know whether or not that would be acceptable or whether anyone would suggest some rephrasing. I think I was capturing what I heard, but I will accept revisions. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	205	ANGELL	 I wasn't quite certain what the vote was in regard to the dollar's position. I would be among those who would like to leave the dollar as being an important indicator, somewhat more prominent. But I may be out-voted, I'm not sure. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	206	GREENSPAN	 Frankly, it's a close vote. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	207	STERN	 I agree with Wayne, in part because when this directive is published it would seem to me to be an awkward time to  have downplayed the dollar if the dollar continues to do what it has been doing the last three or four days. I don't think you gain much. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198708	208	BOEHNE	 I agree with that, Mr. Chairman. I don't think we ought to downplay it. We may be feeling more comfortable about the dollar just now, but it wouldn't take very much for us to find ourselves in a very uncomfortable position. And six weeks from now it will be more attention-getting if we change the emphasis than if we leave it alone. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198708	209	HELLER	 Let me speak on the other side. I don't think we're writing here for the press release only; we're talking about the operational paragraph. If we have the dollar right up front, as soon as we get the kind of weakness that we are getting now, if sustained for another day or two, it could be seen as an indication that we have to tighten monetary policy. And that is not what the majority, at least of the voting members, was agreeing to. So, I agree with the Chairman in moving the dollar to a lower position. Let me note that it still is in the same sentence. We haven't split it into two sentences, as we have done many times before. So, it's a very modest downgrading; it's just the order in which we are reading it rather than a cardinal distinction. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	210	GREENSPAN	 Can I ask a question? We had the strength of the business expansion at the bottom of the list the last time. As I read it, there's a fairly strong consensus to move that up. Would there be any objection to moving that as #2 after inflationary pressures? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	211	SPEAKERS	 That would be good. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	212	GREENSPAN	" So the question really gets down to two things: the relative positioning of the foreign exchange markets and the behavior of the aggregates ""as well as"" phrase. If we move the business expansion issue up, I would be willing to leave the sentence the same as it was the last time. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	213	BOEHNE	 That makes a lot of sense. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198708	214	MORRIS	 I agree. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198708	215	GREENSPAN	 Is there agreement on that? On the issue of the M2 and M3 growth rates, which were 5 and 5-1/2 percent, there were some suggestions of going to 5 to 6 percent in this context, which would be reasonable as far as not wanting to be splitting M2 and M3 apart. As I read the data and alternative B, I would assume that we might want to say through the September period-- that this approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of around 5 to 6 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	216	ANGELL	 I would really favor making that broader and going 3 to 6 percent. It seems to me that you could have a circumstance in which the aggregates were growing at 3 percent and, for other reasons, you still might want to tighten.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	217	GREENSPAN	 One of the problems is that it's such a short time frame that that issue can be difficult to implement. Does anyone else have views on this? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	218	HELLER	 As long as we don't read a move to 3 to 6 percent as an indication that we are aiming for 4-1/2 percent, or something like that, and that is where the policy should be directed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	219	GREENSPAN	 I thought that maybe the 5 to 6 percent was really a forecast of what is likely to happen, irrespective of monetary policy. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	220	ANGELL	 I guess I'd want to hear Don Kohn's comments on that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	221	KOHN	" Well, our best guess was that under alternative ""B"" we'd have M2 growth of 5 percent and M3 growth of 5-1/2 percent; but, as you well know, there is a wide range of error around that. As I said in my briefing and the Bluebook, that presumes that money and income grow a little more closely together than they have over the last couple of quarters. That could fall short; I can't rule out that possibility. The question is whether you would want to react; but with the aggregates after the ""as well as"" clause at the end of the sentence, I'm not sure how strong any reaction would be, in any case. "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	222	ANGELL	 How about going to 4 to 6 percent then? It just seems to me that 5 to 6 percent is so narrow. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	223	GREENSPAN	 Let me ask another question. In your judgment, what is the average lead time between monetary policy and the aggregates. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	224	KOHN	 Well, it's several months, clearly; as I think I indicated, whatever we do now will have its principal impact in the fourth quarter. But it is also true that this goes the other way a little: that is, whether incoming data that suggested the aggregates were running outside a range of 5 to 6 percent or 4 to 6 percent should have any influence on a proposal that Mr. Sternlight might make on the borrowing objective is not quite the same as saying you're actually going to have the effect. You can react and then assume that your effect would be somewhere down the road. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	225	GREENSPAN	 Let me ask you this. Does anybody object to 6 percent as the upper limit? Are there any objections to 4 percent on the downside? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	226	CORRIGAN	 I wouldn't object. I would just offer a historical caution, for what it's worth. I think we have to be a little bit careful about jiggling around these quarterly objectives at mid-quarterly meetings, especially when we are so near the end of the quarter. It can convey something more than I think we had in mind. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	227	JOHNSON	 I'd like to second what Jerry says. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	228	CORRIGAN	 I think it's better to leave them close to where they were at mid-quarter.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	229	JOHNSON	 I agree with Wayne's point that it is likely that they could come in there. I would want to change the whole language in terms of clarifying what we are saying if we go to 4 to 6 percent. I would want to make clear that though we're assuming no change in policy, the aggregates may come in in the 4 to 6 percent range. But that's not what it could imply. So, I'd rather just leave it alone. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	230	GREENSPAN	 Leave it alone, meaning what? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	231	ANGELL	 You're going to leave it at 5 to 7-1/2 percent? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	232	JOHNSON	 Well, 5 to 6 percent may be okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	233	ANGELL	 If we're changing the top one, why is there any harm in changing the bottom one? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	234	GUFFEY	 The alternative is to state it in terms of about 5 percent for both. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0
198708	235	ANGELL	 About 5 percent would be fine. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	236	GREENSPAN	 Would 5 percent be acceptable to everybody? What's the general view on that next sentence? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	237	STERN	 Take it out. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
198708	238	GREENSPAN	 The general view is for just dropping it. Anybody object to that? Strongly? That leaves us with the funds rate. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	239	CORRIGAN	 & 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	240	BOEHNE	 Keep it the same. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
198708	241	ANGELL	 4 to 8 percent. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	242	HELLER	 I think that this is something we should consider sometime in the future. That 4 to 8 percent is such a barn door; it's very wide. At some future time we may want to narrow that down a little. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	243	JOHNSON	 That has always been the range used in the past, just to convey within the reserve target-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	244	HELLER	 Wrong direction. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	245	GREENSPAN	 If you narrowed it, you are really saying that you're targeting-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	246	ANGELL	 --the federal funds rate. I think it would be the wrong signal, in light of the 1976 experience. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	247	GREENSPAN	 Let me just ask, we haven't quite got to the borrowing target-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	248	ANGELL	 I thought there were seven votes for five hundred; that was the way I counted. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	249	HELLER	 $525 million.  	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	250	GREENSPAN	 I don't like people who are good at arithmetic. $525 million? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	251	ANGELL	 I don't think anybody will know it's $525 million; you don't tell anybody. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	252	GREENSPAN	 Well, you know something, I don't know the answer to the question. The point being that I don't know what the convention is here--whether you average these things, which you can, or whether you take the majority. What has been the convention? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	253	CORRIGAN	 The convention, I think, Mr. Chairman, is that you do not average that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	254	GREENSPAN	 If you don't average, then the figure is $500 million. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	255	CORRIGAN	 The majority is-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	256	JOHNSON	 That is going to lead to other [unintelligible]. If it turns out to be an average number, you're going to have people low-balling it until it clears the average. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	44.0
198708	257	HELLER	 $536 million is the average! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	258	CORRIGAN	" I think it is hard to average it. One other thing that is done, in terms of trying to sense where the critical mass is, if I could put it that way, or where the Committee might stand, is that the Chairman has been known from time to time to ask people what their preferences are as opposed to what they could live with. In this particular case, you may have some shadings of opinion around those borrowing numbers, for example, based on the question of symmetry or tilt that would go with them--in other words, the ""woulds"" and the ""mights"". I, myself, certainly would not dissent, at this meeting, over the difference between $600 million and $500 million in the context in which there was some tilt along the lines that Governor Johnson has suggested. So, you do have some play; but I don't think that most members of the Committee would be comfortable with averaging the borrowings. I think that can get to be quite awkward when there are larger differences, as there may be, than the difference between $500 million and $600 million. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
198708	259	MORRIS	 You also have the authority, of course, to call a telephone conference meeting to reconsider the borrowing level in the event, say, we get extreme weakness in the dollar, which I think is a possibility. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	1.0
198708	260	ANGELL	 We already have that in the tilt of the directive, anyway. That is, you can go firmer, based upon developments, without calling a Committee-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	261	HELLER	 If you start out with a base of $600 million and then you have the language with the tilt, it gives you a very different environment than if you start with a base of $500 million and have the tilt in. $500 million with a tilt in it gets you right to the range where everybody may well want to be--in the $520 to $550 million range, or whatever--while $600 million with a tilt in it would get you a lot closer to--  5/18/87 -37 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	262	KELLEY	 The tilt is worth $25 to $50 million dollars. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	48.0
198708	263	BERNARD	 In the operational paragraph, there's a problem that Mr. Cross and Mr. Truman pointed out on the factual portion of lines 24 to 26. The dollar, at least as of an hour ago, instead of having risen further, was unchanged. I don't know what the latest figure is, so that needs to be changed to make it factually correct. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	264	HELLER	 Roughly unchanged. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	46.0
198708	265	BERNARD	 About unchanged. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	266	CROSS	 It's, on balance, unchanged; it has been up and down. 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	267	ANGELL	 I think that would be appropriate. Change that. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
198708	268	GREENSPAN	 I'd like it reread just to be certain. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	269	BERNARD	" ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Somewhat greater reserve restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, and the behavior of the aggregates. This approach is expected to be consistent with growth in M2 and M3 over the period from June to September at an annual rate of around 5 percent. Growth in Ml, while picking up from recent levels, is expected to remain well below its pace during 1986. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate consistently outside a range of 4 to 8 percent. "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	270	KOHN	" Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, I thought I heard the Committee express the view that they wanted to retain the ""as well as"" in front of the aggregates. Normand, just read-- "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	271	GREENSPAN	 Right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
198708	272	BERNARD	 Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Corrigan Yes Governor Angell Yes President Boehne Yes President Boykin Yes Governor Heller Yes Governor Johnson Yes President Keehn Yes Governor Kelley Yes Governor Seger Yes President Stern Yes 	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
198708	273	GREENSPAN	 As I read it, the next meeting is September 22. Thank you for your patience, ladies and gentlemen. 	1	1	0.0	1.0	47.0
