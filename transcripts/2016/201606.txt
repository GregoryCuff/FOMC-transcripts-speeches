201606	0	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201606	1	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, today’s meeting will be in its entirety a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.	50.0	65.0
201606	2	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	50.0	65.0
201606	3	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	50.0	108.0
201606	4	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201606	5	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As I think almost everyone here knows, Tom Baxter will retire from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in September.	50.0	65.0
201606	6	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This was to be the last FOMC meeting that he attended, but he recently decided that his to-do list was sufficiently lengthy that, in order to actually retire as planned, he would need to stay in New York to work rather than attend today’s meeting.	50.0	65.0
201606	7	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think it is entirely appropriate, though, that we recognize him in absentia.	50.0	65.0
201606	8	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom’s well- deserved retirement will follow 36 years of service to the New York Bank, at which he has served as general counsel since 1995.	50.0	65.0
201606	9	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom also has been deputy general counsel of the FOMC the past two decades, attending 106 regularly scheduled Committee meetings.	50.0	65.0
201606	10	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom’s contributions to the work of the Federal Reserve were especially crucial during the recent financial crisis when the Federal Reserve needed to design and implement a broad range of effective lending programs to help support the financial system and the economy, in many cases in a matter of days, if not hours.	50.0	65.0
201606	11	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Tom was at the center of many of those efforts.	50.0	65.0
201606	12	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We appreciate all that Tom has done for the Federal Reserve, for the New York District, and for the country, and I’m sure that I speak for all of us in wishing him the best in retirement.	50.0	65.0
201606	13	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe Vice Chairman Dudley would also like to make some remarks about Tom.	50.0	65.0
201606	14	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, my views are very much the same as yours, Madam Chair.	50.0	96.0
201606	15	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think Tom played a key role in the System throughout his long career.	50.0	96.0
201606	16	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	He will especially be remembered for his leadership at the time of the 9/11 attack and during the financial crisis, figuring out with Scott Alvarez and many others exactly what we legally could do to save the financial system from collapse, and that was not an easy task.	50.0	96.0
201606	17	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, of course, I appreciate the support he has given me during my tenure.	50.0	96.0
201606	18	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, 21 years as general counsel meant that he was serving under three different New York Federal Reserve presidents, and in some ways he’s tracked your own career at the Federal Reserve, Madam Chair, basically being the deputy counsel to the FOMC when you were Governor, when you were president of the San Francisco Fed, Vice Chair, and now the Chair.	50.0	96.0
201606	19	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I imagine that he’s pretty high up in the hierarchy of attending meetings at the Fed—probably not quite in “Don Kohn” territory [laughter], but maybe in the top 10 or 20.	50.0	96.0
201606	20	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wish he could be here today, but I think it’s important to acknowledge his contributions and wish him all the success in whatever comes his way after his retirement.	50.0	96.0
201606	21	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it’s not really a retirement.	50.0	96.0
201606	22	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s a retirement from the Federal Reserve.	50.0	96.0
201606	23	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The idea that Tom would actually retire [laughter], that’s just not going to happen.	50.0	96.0
201606	24	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	50.0	96.0
201606	25	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	50.0	65.0
201606	26	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Next, I wanted to provide you with a brief update on the long-run framework project.	93.0	65.0
201606	27	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As Thomas and Simon noted in their March 7 memo to the Committee, the analysis is being conducted by five main work groups.	93.0	65.0
201606	28	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The first three so-called foundational groups are focusing on lessons from the crisis, the foreign experience, and money markets.	93.0	65.0
201606	29	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	These groups have conducted workshops with academics, market experts, and central bankers, and their work has been presented and reviewed in Systemwide plenary sessions that have been well attended and very productive.	93.0	65.0
201606	30	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In addition to these foundational groups, two framework groups are conducting analysis, one focused on interest rate targets and operating regimes and another on a range of issues associated with the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.	93.0	65.0
201606	31	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	These framework groups have also held workshops with a range of experts from inside and outside the System.	93.0	65.0
201606	32	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we anticipate that the work of the three foundational groups will be presented to the FOMC at the July meeting and that of the two framework groups at the November meeting.	93.0	65.0
201606	33	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As background for the July presentation, you will receive summary memos from each of the three foundational work groups early next month, and the research directors will receive several background memos later this month.	93.0	65.0
201606	34	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	At the meeting, staff presentations will review the material provided in the memos, and we will reserve ample time for FOMC participants to ask questions and to offer their views on the key issues raised by the memos and staff presentations.	93.0	65.0
201606	35	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Now, at this time, does anyone have questions or comments about these plans?	93.0	65.0
201606	36	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	93.0	65.0
201606	37	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	93.0	65.0
201606	38	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The next item, before we turn to our regular agenda items, is that I wanted to update you on our meeting schedule for next year.	50.0	65.0
201606	39	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As you know, a draft meeting calendar for 2017 was circulated to the Committee earlier this month, and we received no objections from participants.	50.0	65.0
201606	40	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We had planned to publish the calendar this Friday.	50.0	65.0
201606	41	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Unfortunately, we just learned that a newly scheduled international meeting and its potential knock-on effects on the scheduling of other international meetings will raise a question about the workability of part of the proposed FOMC schedule.	50.0	65.0
201606	42	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And we are now looking into those complications.	50.0	65.0
201606	43	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Depending on the outcome, we may be able to move ahead with the currently proposed FOMC schedule possibly as soon as this Friday, or, conceivably, we may need to change the date of the March meeting, potentially by moving it either a week earlier or a day later.	50.0	65.0
201606	44	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And we will get back to you as soon as we possibly can if that proves necessary.	50.0	65.0
201606	45	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Meanwhile, we want to ask that, for now, you reserve on your calendar the dates that have been proposed.	50.0	65.0
201606	46	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions about that?	50.0	65.0
201606	47	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	50.0	65.0
201606	48	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	49	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So we can now turn to the first agenda item, the Desk briefing, and let me turn to Simon to do that.	61.0	65.0
201606	50	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201606	51	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows changes in domestic asset prices over various periods this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	52	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, the net changes in risk asset prices over the intermeeting period, shown in the final column, were mild compared with the swings experienced through April.	61.0	999.0
201606	53	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the decline in the 10-year Treasury yield was relatively large.	61.0	999.0
201606	54	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the past few days, “Brexit” concerns have lowered global risk asset prices and created additional safe-haven demand.	61.0	999.0
201606	55	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recall that, in the previous Desk briefing, I reported that although the FOMC was not viewed as an important factor in sparking the financial turbulence at the start of the year, more-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communication in March was viewed as an important factor in calming markets.	61.0	999.0
201606	56	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In this intermeeting period, market participants were surprised by the less accommodative tone of the April FOMC minutes and related Federal Reserve communications regarding the release, but the asset price impact outside of the movement in short-term rates was relatively subdued.	61.0	999.0
201606	57	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The top-right panel shows the evolution of market-implied expectations of a rate hike occurring at or before the July FOMC meeting, in relation to how expectations evolved ahead of liftoff in December.	61.0	999.0
201606	58	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown by the light blue line, the impression of a less-accommodative stance generated around the time of the release of the April minutes had a sharp effect on the perceived probability of a move at the June or July meetings, one similar in magnitude to the effect of the September 2015 FOMC statement on liftoff expectations, albeit in the opposite direction.	61.0	999.0
201606	59	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This effect was undone by the much weaker-than-expected May employment report, and the market- and survey-implied probability of a hike happening at this meeting declined to effectively zero.	61.0	999.0
201606	60	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the average probability distribution for the federal funds rate at year-end from the Desk surveys was little changed over the period, with the average probability attached to a decrease or no change in the target rate more or less constant.	61.0	999.0
201606	61	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, compared with the January survey, views have consolidated a bit in the 51-to-100 basis point bucket, at least in part because of the lack of additional rate hikes to date.	61.0	999.0
201606	62	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The median respondent now views one rate hike by the end of this year as the most likely outcome, down from two hikes in April and three hikes in January.	61.0	999.0
201606	63	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows how the survey- and market-implied rate paths through 2018 have shifted over this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	64	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	During the sharp repricing of near-term rate expectations in mid-May, there was little follow-through into the market-implied rate path past 2016, and after the May employment report the market-implied path continued the striking flattening we have seen since the December rate increase.	61.0	999.0
201606	65	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the survey-implied mean path has remained little changed compared with our January Desk surveys, the earliest surveys using our current probabilistic question format.	61.0	999.0
201606	66	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the surface, this difference between the changes in survey expectations and the market-implied path may suggest a further decline in term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	67	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the comparison between the aggregate survey-implied mean path and the market-implied path neglects much of the richness in expectations that we glean from the Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	68	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows individual survey respondents’ 2017 year-end target rate probabilities.	61.0	999.0
201606	69	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Here, red identifies primary dealers and blue signifies market participants.	61.0	999.0
201606	70	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses are ordered from lowest to highest mean, and the various shades differentiate respondents from one another.	61.0	999.0
201606	71	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As you can see, most of the respondents have bimodal distributions for the level of the policy rate, which include a “low rate” mode that, across respondents, mostly lies in the range of negative ¼ to positive ¼ percent, and a “higher rate” mode, which varies substantially across respondents and ranges from about 1 to 3 percent.	61.0	999.0
201606	72	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	When we compare individual density forecasts with the 2017 market-implied expectations for the target rate, we find that quite a few respondents have implied mean expectations that are at or below rates implied by market prices.	61.0	999.0
201606	73	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thus, it is possible to reconcile the flattening of the path over the first half of the year with a switch in the identity of the marginal investor to one who believes more strongly in the lower-rate model.	61.0	999.0
201606	74	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In this case, the market-implied path would be an accurate reflection of physical expectations for the target rate path without the need to appeal to term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	75	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, the fact that so many investors place nonnegligible probability on a return to the effective lower bound is consistent with large negative term premiums in futures markets.	61.0	999.0
201606	76	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That is, there are few investors who would be prepared to sell a futures contract on the basis of a belief that rates will be considerably higher with substantial probability and many investors who want to hedge against their perceived significant probability of returning to the lower bound.	61.0	999.0
201606	77	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thus, the futures market will clear at prices that embed negative term premiums.	61.0	999.0
201606	78	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Forward measures of inflation compensation declined notably over the period, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	79	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The declines came in spite of a 10 percent increase in spot oil prices, a notable decoupling of the relationship we have highlighted in our briefings over the past year.	61.0	999.0
201606	80	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have attributed the increase in oil prices to various global supply disruptions.	61.0	999.0
201606	81	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, the declines in longer-dated measures of inflation compensation were reportedly driven by the below-expectations May employment report and the less-accommodative-than-expected FOMC communications regarding the minutes.	61.0	999.0
201606	82	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In a new Desk survey question, we asked respondents to discuss whether the relationship between spot oil and far-forward measures of inflation compensation had changed recently and, if so, why.	61.0	999.0
201606	83	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses highlighted that market understanding of the relationship remains tenuous, but a number of respondents took the opportunity to highlight that their view of the Fed’s reaction function had changed over the intermeeting period, as the less accommodative Federal Reserve communications came despite there being no substantive change, in their view, of the economic outlook.	61.0	999.0
201606	84	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As far-forward inflation compensation in the United States settled near record lows, comparable measures in other advanced economies remained stuck at very low levels, as shown in the top-left panel of your second exhibit.	61.0	999.0
201606	85	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants continue to point to these measures as a clear indicator of concerns about global growth and the efficacy of monetary policy, particularly in Japan and the euro area, in which monetary easing programs of unprecedented size and scope appear to be having little effect on investors’ confidence in inflation returning to mandate- consistent levels over the longer run.	61.0	999.0
201606	86	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The recent fall in interest rates globally has generally been even more pronounced in longer-dated nominal yields, as shown by the red dots in the top-right panel, as longer-term real interest rates have also declined.	61.0	999.0
201606	87	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	It is important to note that Treasury yields are high relative to G-4 peers, and market participants continue to suggest global portfolio rebalancing out of lower-yielding euro-area and Japanese government bonds into the United States is pressuring domestic rates lower.	61.0	999.0
201606	88	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will examine the low level of longer-term rates in the United States further in his briefing.	61.0	999.0
201606	89	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Despite record low forward nominal rates that many interpret as signaling heightened concern about the longer-run global growth picture and the efficacy of monetary policy, the middle-left panel shows that near-term equity and interest rate implied volatility, the dark blue and red lines, remained at or below their historical averages and levels reached earlier this year for most of the period, with a recent uptick from Brexit-related concerns.	61.0	999.0
201606	90	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Developed market currency volatility, the light blue line, has spiked recently and is noticeably above its historical average.	61.0	999.0
201606	91	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As reflected in the middle-right panel, the recent increase in currency implied volatility appears to reflect mostly the repercussions for sterling of the very immediate risk of Brexit.	61.0	999.0
201606	92	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	But even before Brexit came squarely onto investors’ radar screens, there was a meaningful increase in implied volatility on the yen.	61.0	999.0
201606	93	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Investors expect that the pound will depreciate broadly should a vote to leave the EU prevail and believe there could be appreciation pressures on safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc.	61.0	999.0
201606	94	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	To date there is little indication these moves would be disorderly.	61.0	999.0
201606	95	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the past few days there appears to be more impact of Brexit concerns on euro- area asset prices as the referendum date gets closer and polls indicate a very close decision.	61.0	999.0
201606	96	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In view of how close the polls are on the support for the “leave” and “remain” camps, we expect to see volatility increase further in the trading days up to the vote.	61.0	999.0
201606	97	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The bottom-left panel shows a kink in equity-implied volatility in the United Kingdom and Europe around the June 23 referendum date, with levels of implied volatility on the FTSE rising above that seen during the February market turbulence.	61.0	999.0
201606	98	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	By comparison, the implied volatility curve for US equities shows a small kink.	61.0	999.0
201606	99	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The spillover effects of Brexit in the euro area would be expected to be more acute than in the United States due to the tighter links between the UK and euro-area economies and negative implications of the vote for European political cohesion.	61.0	999.0
201606	100	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Shaghil will discuss Brexit further.	61.0	999.0
201606	101	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In stark contrast to market discussion over Brexit, concerns regarding China and its FX policy were not primary points of focus among market participants over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201606	102	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The renminbi depreciated a bit against the US dollar, but unlike earlier in the year, this had little effect on global risk sentiment.	61.0	999.0
201606	103	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The dark blue line in the bottom-right panel shows that the renminbi’s exchange value against the dollar is now roughly back to where it was in January when the market was highly sensitive to the risk of a sudden devaluation of the renminbi.	61.0	999.0
201606	104	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, the light blue line shows that the CFETS Index, which represents the renminbi’s effective exchange rate against a basket of 13 currencies, has depreciated by roughly 5 percent year-to- date.	61.0	999.0
201606	105	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, investors continue to have deep concerns about the risk of a sharp slowing in Chinese growth and the ability of China’s highly leveraged financial system to withstand the effects of this slowing.	61.0	999.0
201606	106	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the top-left panel of your last exhibit, the effective federal funds rate remained near the middle of the target range over the intermeeting period amid typical volumes.	61.0	999.0
201606	107	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Secured rates trended modestly lower, with average GCF and triparty repo rates a few basis points below their prior-period averages.	61.0	999.0
201606	108	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The decline in GC repo rates has largely been ascribed to larger-than-expected cash inflows into the repo market over recent weeks.	61.0	999.0
201606	109	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Despite lower GC repo rates in late May, the volume of overnight triparty repo trades conducted below the ON RRP offering rate remained very low, as shown in the top-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	110	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Further, the slight increase in activity below the overnight RRP rate—less than 1 percent of total volume over the second half of May—was composed almost entirely of trades by entities that do not have direct access to the overnight RRP, shown as the dark blue area in the panel, and activity below the overnight RRP rate from our counterparties remained negligible.	61.0	999.0
201606	111	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Looking ahead, there is heightened attention on the potential consequences of SEC money market reform implementation later this year.	61.0	999.0
201606	112	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants continue to highlight the possibility of large and rapid shifts in money fund investor allocations in response to the October 14 deadline, which could result in volatility in short-term interest rate markets and increased usage of the overnight RRP facility.	61.0	999.0
201606	113	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, a recent survey of money market fund complexes conducted by the Desk found that respondents expected $410 billion, on average, to flow out of prime funds between now and the October effective date of the SEC reforms, with the bulk of these outflows expected to occur in August and September.	61.0	999.0
201606	114	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Prime funds are shortening maturities in anticipation of these redemptions, and it is possible that the private sector will be unable to increase its balance sheet offered to prime funds on an overnight basis to meet this increase in demand.	61.0	999.0
201606	115	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This dynamic could display some parallels with financial reporting dates, when less private-sector balance sheet is available for prime fund investment and overnight RRP usage increases.	61.0	999.0
201606	116	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Also, like we see with financial reporting dates, we would anticipate such increased usage from this shortening in maturities of prime funds to be temporary until they have better insight about the size of outflows.	61.0	999.0
201606	117	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	On the other hand, if the outflows are as large as expected, the shift itself may have both temporary and permanent effects on money markets and overnight RRP usage.	61.0	999.0
201606	118	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The survey found that 80 percent of anticipated investor outflows, or around $320 billion, were expected to move into government funds, with the remainder moving to a combination of bank deposits and short-term investment vehicles falling beyond the scope of the SEC money market fund reform initiative.	61.0	999.0
201606	119	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Respondents were also asked how they expected inflows to government funds to be allocated, given a choice of holding securities outright, engaging in repo, or placing funds in Federal Reserve RRPs.	61.0	999.0
201606	120	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The responses indicate that usage of the ON RRP facility is expected to increase by approximately $90 billion.	61.0	999.0
201606	121	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Market participants note a high level of uncertainty regarding their views on the potential magnitude of reallocation to Federal Reserve RRP in the run-up to the October conversion date and whether such flows would be permanent or temporary.	61.0	999.0
201606	122	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While a number of firms expressed a preference for reallocating funds to the private repo market as opposed to RRPs with the Fed, they see their decisions as highly dependent on the pace of outflows and the availability of close substitutes with higher rates like Treasury bills or private market triparty repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	123	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In addition to the uncertainty regarding what instruments the outflows from prime funds will end up in, we also do not know how the scale of individual prime and government funds will be affected by these substantial changes in the money fund industry.	61.0	999.0
201606	124	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For example, we could see a number of firms that are currently counterparties fall below the $5 billion requirement to be an RRP counterparty or growth in smaller funds with assets under management below the $5 billion requirement as funds try to specialize to specific investor needs.	61.0	999.0
201606	125	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	This additional cash outside the Fed’s counterparty system could lead to an increased instance of repo trading below the overnight RRP offering rate.	61.0	999.0
201606	126	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For now, usage of the overnight RRP facility, shown in the middle-right panel, has remained below levels seen in early 2016, a trend that continues to be associated with increased availability of private-sector balance sheet for repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	127	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Daily average overnight triparty repo volumes between dealers and customers have remained elevated, reaching multiyear highs of nearly $300 billion in mid-May.	61.0	999.0
201606	128	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Around the time of the April FOMC meeting, we understood the principal driver of the elevated volumes to be increased need for financing on the part of dealers due primarily to elevated foreign central bank reserves sales and Treasury bill supply.	61.0	999.0
201606	129	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	However, Treasury GC repo volumes have continued to increase through the second quarter of 2016, despite evidence of a decline in dealers’ financing needs from slowing reserves sales and substantial declines in Treasury bills outstanding.	61.0	999.0
201606	130	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recent dealer conversations reveal that some have become more willing to expand their repo books, citing more comfort with balance sheet management amid current regulations, firm- specific factors, and attractive opportunities to intermediate via matched book repo.	61.0	999.0
201606	131	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Turning to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, expectations for the timing of a cessation of some or all reinvestments continued to be pushed out, according to the most recent Desk surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	132	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As market participants have over recent months come to expect a slower pace of policy rate normalization, their views on the timing of a change to the reinvestment policy have also shifted out.	61.0	999.0
201606	133	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the median expectation has shifted out from approximately one year ahead following the December FOMC to one and a half years ahead in the June surveys.	61.0	999.0
201606	134	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In calendar terms, this corresponds to a one-year delay in the expected timing of a change to reinvestment policy, from December 2016 to December 2017.	61.0	999.0
201606	135	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS continued to proceed smoothly, in accordance with the FOMC’s reinvestment policy.	61.0	999.0
201606	136	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Similar to the prior intermeeting periods, MBS reinvestment purchases continued to be somewhat elevated at around $30 billion per month, largely the result of elevated mortgage prepayment activity associated with the ongoing level of longer-term interest rates.	61.0	999.0
201606	137	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	We continue to execute Treasury rollovers at auction in line with FOMC policy.	61.0	999.0
201606	138	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While on the topic of reinvestments and rollovers, we would like to update the Committee on staff contingency planning with regard to operations to maintain the size of the Treasury portfolio, summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61.0	999.0
201606	139	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Recall that our current policy is to roll over all maturing proceeds of SOMA Treasury holdings into newly issued securities pro rata at auction.	61.0	999.0
201606	140	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In the event that the Desk is unable to roll over Treasury securities at auction, the size of the SOMA portfolio would decline unless the Desk were to reinvest by purchasing Treasury securities in the secondary market.	61.0	999.0
201606	141	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Under the current directive, my view is that the Desk does not have such authority from the Committee.	61.0	999.0
201606	142	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Inability to roll over could be caused by technical or operational issues or errors related to the auction or rollover process or by a change to the auction calendar.	61.0	999.0
201606	143	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	For example, on February 25 of this year, the seven-year auction was rescheduled for the next day.	61.0	999.0
201606	144	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Although this did not prevent the Desk from rolling over maturing SOMA holdings at auction, a longer delay would have, as the auction would not have settled on the same day that the maturing funds were received.	61.0	999.0
201606	145	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In such a scenario, the Desk, if directed to do so, could make purchases in the secondary market in order to maintain the size of the balance sheet.	61.0	999.0
201606	146	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Much like MBS reinvestments, these purchases would occur over a period of days or weeks so as to ensure smooth market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201606	147	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The Desk will prepare procedures to seek Committee direction through a notation vote and prepare operational procedures for announcing and conducting such secondary market purchases in the unlikely event of a delayed or rescheduled auction in the future.	61.0	999.0
201606	148	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	In a continuing effort to enhance our preparedness to act in pursuit of the Committee’s objectives, the staff also conducted a number of small-value operational tests over the intermeeting period.	61.0	999.0
201606	149	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	These tests, along with a list of upcoming exercises, are summarized in the appendix of the handout.	61.0	999.0
201606	150	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Finally, as noted in the staff memo circulated to the Committee on Brexit, barring extreme circumstances, we do not see a UK vote to leave the EU causing a breakdown in financial market functioning.	61.0	999.0
201606	151	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Weekly US dollar liquidity auctions are offered by the BOE, BOJ, ECB, and SNB on the understanding that the swaps with the Federal Reserve can be used to fund demand at these auctions.	61.0	999.0
201606	152	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	The BOE announced that it stands ready to provide liquidity both in sterling and dollars to a wide range of counterparties through its liquidity framework, and its US dollar auctions are currently scheduled for one day prior and six days following the referendum.	61.0	999.0
201606	153	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	While market-implied measures of US dollar funding stress remain well below levels at which the demand by UK banks at the BOE’s dollar operations would be economical, we are operationally ready for a number of contingencies.	61.0	999.0
201606	154	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	We will update the Committee if there is a significant increase in funding stress, and the Chair would consult the Committee, if possible under the circumstances then prevailing, should a draw on the swap line be requested outside of the regular auction schedule.	61.0	999.0
201606	155	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61.0	999.0
201606	156	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That concludes my prepared remarks.	61.0	999.0
201606	157	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61.0	65.0
201606	158	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Simon or comments?	62.0	65.0
201606	159	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62.0	65.0
201606	160	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62.0	65.0
201606	161	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63.0	65.0
201606	162	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Can I have a motion?	63.0	65.0
201606	163	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	63.0	108.0
201606	164	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63.0	65.0
201606	165	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	63.0	65.0
201606	166	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63.0	65.0
201606	167	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And I guess we are moving along expeditiously and ready to turn to the economic outlook.	11.0	65.0
201606	168	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Today Jeremy Rudd is going to begin a series of chart-show briefings.	11.0	65.0
201606	169	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201606	170	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Our exhibits are in the packet titled “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation.”	11.0	999.0
201606	171	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In table 1 of your first exhibit, I’ve summarized our near-term outlook.	11.0	999.0
201606	172	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Since the April Tealbook the news on economic activity has been mixed, with the recent data on the labor market and business investment coming in worse than expected and the latest readings on consumer spending and net exports surprising us to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	173	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see if you look at line 1 of the table, we continue to expect that real GDP growth will pick up from its unimpressive first-quarter pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	174	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	However, we’ve marked down our near-term projection to reflect our view that there’s now less momentum in hiring and business spending than we had previously thought, and also we now expect residential investment to recover more gradually than we had in April.	11.0	999.0
201606	175	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Given the mixed nature of the incoming data—and how little hard evidence on the current quarter we actually have in hand at this point—it’s worth asking how much confidence we should have in our projection of a second-quarter pickup.	11.0	999.0
201606	176	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To help answer this question, panel 2 shows second-quarter nowcasts from various models, including the Board’s dynamic factor model—the red line—and some of the nowcasting models that are maintained elsewhere in the System—the blue dashed lines; the staff’s judgmental projection, which is what’s in the Tealbook, is shown as the black line.	11.0	999.0
201606	177	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see, the 70 percent confidence interval around the Board’s factor model, which is that gray shaded region in the panel, is still nearly 3 percentage points wide.	11.0	999.0
201606	178	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This morning we received the May retail sales report, which came in stronger than expected, with upward revisions to March and April.	11.0	999.0
201606	179	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The retail sales data, along with other pieces of spending data that we received after the Tealbook closed, leave our first-quarter real GDP growth estimate unrevised at 1.2 percent but imply an upward revision to our second-quarter growth projection of 0.2 percentage point, which puts our Q2 forecast at 2.1 percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	180	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The Board’s factor model was also surprised by these data; as of this morning, its second-quarter GDP growth nowcast is 3¼ percent, which is up about ¼ percentage point from a week ago.	11.0	999.0
201606	181	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The next four panels summarize the medium-term outlook.	11.0	999.0
201606	182	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	My focus here is on comparisons between the June Tealbook and our forecast from last December, which is when the Committee moved the federal funds rate above the effective lower bound.	11.0	999.0
201606	183	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 3, relative to December we’ve lowered projected real GDP growth in 2016 and nudged it up over the subsequent two years.	11.0	999.0
201606	184	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, what that leaves us with at the end of 2018 is a level of GDP that’s essentially unrevised relative to our December projection.	11.0	999.0
201606	185	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The main sources of the revisions that we put through since December are summarized in panel 4.	11.0	999.0
201606	186	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 5 and 6 give the outlook for the labor market, again with the comparison being made with our December Tealbook projection.	11.0	999.0
201606	187	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Starting with payroll employment, panel 5, the incoming data imply a sharply lower pace of job gains over the first half of this year than what we expected in December.	11.0	999.0
201606	188	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In our current projection, we have largely looked through this weakness, which seems at odds with what we’re seeing in other indicators.	11.0	999.0
201606	189	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In fact, in light of our downgraded outlook for productivity growth, the projected level of payrolls at the end of 2018 is actually slightly higher than in our December forecast.	11.0	999.0
201606	190	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Meanwhile, our unemployment rate forecast, which is shown in panel 6, is little changed from the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201606	191	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, panel 6 also indicates that the current level of the unemployment rate is now just a bit below our estimate of the natural rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	192	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As we’ve pointed out in the past, there are other margins of labor market slack besides those captured by the unemployment gap; in the next exhibit, I provide our assessment of where several of those additional margins currently stand.	11.0	999.0
201606	193	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 1 plots the labor force participation rate against the staff’s judgmental estimate of its trend.	11.0	999.0
201606	194	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Over the past couple of years, the participation rate has fluctuated widely but currently stands a little below its estimated trend.	11.0	999.0
201606	195	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 2, if we combine the participation rate gap with the unemployment rate gap, we get the gap between the employment-to-population ratio, and the staff’s estimate of its trend is basically close to zero right now.	11.0	999.0
201606	196	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Another potential margin of labor underutilization is the share of those employed who are working part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	197	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This is shown by the black line in panel 3.	11.0	999.0
201606	198	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you look at that line, you can see that this series has now retraced most of its increase over the previous recession; however, if you compare it with the blue line, which shows a predicted value of that series on the basis of its historical relationship with the unemployment rate, you can see that there’s still some gap or some unusually elevated level of part time for economic reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	199	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Although this unusually elevated level plausibly represents an additional margin of labor market slack, in aggregate terms it’s probably not overly large:  If we were to close it, it would probably lead to an increase in aggregate hours—and, hence, aggregate labor input— on the order of maybe 0.4 percent, which would in turn translate to maybe ¼ percent on real GDP.	11.0	999.0
201606	200	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 compares our estimate of the unemployment gap—the black line—with two other variables that have historically tended to move relatively closely with it; namely, households’ view of job availability as measured by the Conference Board— that’s shown by the blue line—and small businesses’ view, as measured by the NFIB, of the difficulty that they’re having in filling job openings—that’s the red line.	11.0	999.0
201606	201	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	On the basis of on a mechanical choice of scaling of those two alternative series, you can see that these series currently bracket the value of our own gap estimate right around now.	11.0	999.0
201606	202	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Finally, panels 5 and 6 compare the extent to which different racial and ethnic groups have shared in the broader improvement in labor market conditions.	11.0	999.0
201606	203	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 5 shows that the differentials in jobless rates across these groups are now close to where they were prior to the 2007–09 recession, with blacks and Hispanics still suffering notably higher rates of unemployment.	11.0	999.0
201606	204	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And, as shown to the right, for involuntary part-time work, the gap for both blacks and Hispanics relative to whites remains higher than it was in the years just before the recession.	11.0	999.0
201606	205	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In the next exhibit, I review some of the considerations that help inform the staff’s judgmental assessment of labor- and product-market slack.	11.0	999.0
201606	206	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One traditional approach to gauging the extent of slack has been to look at the behavior of inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	207	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Unfortunately, as the Phillips curve—the relationship between slack and inflation—has become flatter over time, this approach no longer works as well as it used to.	11.0	999.0
201606	208	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 1 and 2 show why, by means of a couple of stylized examples.	11.0	999.0
201606	209	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If inflation’s long-term trend is stable—say, it’s tied down by well-anchored inflation expectations—and if we’ve already controlled for the other determinants of inflation besides slack, such as, say, imported goods prices, then periods in which the unemployment rate is below its natural rate—and, hence, the unemployment gap is negative—should be associated with above-trend inflation, and vice versa.	11.0	999.0
201606	210	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This relation is captured by the red line in panel 1, which provides an example of a relatively steep Phillips curve.	11.0	999.0
201606	211	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Specifically, what the figure shows is a downward- sloping relationship between the unemployment gap—which is plotted on the horizontal axis—and deviations of inflation from its trend—which is measured by the vertical axis.	11.0	999.0
201606	212	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	(Note that the data constructed for this example—like the real-world inflation data—include a certain amount of unexplainable noise, which is why the relationship doesn’t fit perfectly and, hence, the black dots don’t lie right on the red line.)  Importantly, when the Phillips curve is steep, unemployment doesn’t have to move too far away from the natural rate for us to reliably see above- or below-trend inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	213	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Here, for instance, in panel 1, if the unemployment rate is just ½ percentage point or more below its natural rate—which would put us in the red region of the figure—then inflation usually tends to be above its trend:  In this example, detrended inflation will be less than zero only about one-fifth of the time.	11.0	999.0
201606	214	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Similarly, when the unemployment rate is ½ percentage point or more above its natural rate—which puts us in the blue region—inflation is usually below its trend, with detrended inflation coming in greater than zero only about one-fifth of the time.	11.0	999.0
201606	215	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The behavior of inflation, therefore, is going to be reasonably informative in pinning down the level of the natural rate when the Phillips curve is steep.	11.0	999.0
201606	216	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But when the Phillips curve is flat—panel 2—the situation is quite different:  Even if the unemployment rate is more than 1½ percentage points above or below its natural rate, we’re about equally likely to see above-trend inflation as we are to see below-trend inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	217	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Hence, when the Phillips curve is flat—which we think is currently the case—the behavior of inflation will not tell us very much about how much slack is present in the economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	218	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, one way you can try to to deal with that problem is to try to bring additional information to bear, in the form of, say, other relationships like Okun’s Law or a production function, or other variables that might tell us something useful about slack.	11.0	999.0
201606	219	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This additional information can be exploited in a relatively unrestricted way through the use of a time-series model, or, alternatively, you can impose the stronger restrictions implied by theory in the context of a fully specified structural model.	11.0	999.0
201606	220	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 3 reports output gap estimates from three time-series models maintained by Board staff.	11.0	999.0
201606	221	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The range of the models’ point estimates is given by the gray shaded region, and the staff’s judgmental estimate of the output gap is shown as the black line.	11.0	999.0
201606	222	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In broad terms, these various gap estimates move relatively similarly.	11.0	999.0
201606	223	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Right now, these three time-series models generally point to a little more tightness in resource utilization than what’s implied by the staff’s judgmental estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	224	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	A similar pattern is obtained if we consider the range of estimates of the natural rate of unemployment that are implied by these models (these are given by the gray shaded region in the next panel), and again, these suggest somewhat greater tightness in utilization than what the staff’s estimate would imply.	11.0	999.0
201606	225	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In panel 5, I present output gap estimates from the three DSGE models that are currently maintained as part of the System’s DSGE modeling project (once again, the Board staff’s judgmental estimate is shown here in the picture as the black line).	11.0	999.0
201606	226	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Over history, the range of DSGE model estimates is somewhat wider than what you see for the time-series models.	11.0	999.0
201606	227	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	More recently, however, these models’ gap estimates have converged and point to somewhat less tightness in utilization than what’s reflected in the judgmental estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	228	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Depending on what you look at, what class of models, you can get relatively different current estimates for the output gap.	11.0	999.0
201606	229	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	I’d further note that the analysis that I’ve presented here pertains only to point values and doesn’t even attempt to characterize the degree of statistical uncertainty that typically surrounds these sorts of estimates.	11.0	999.0
201606	230	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Finally, in panel 6 I provide updated estimates of the short-run real natural rate of interest from the three DSGE models, in which this rate is defined as the real risk-free short-term interest rate that would be obtained in the absence of nominal rigidities.	11.0	999.0
201606	231	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Here, the range of model estimates is shown by the gray shaded region, but the solid line gives the model’s median estimate.	11.0	999.0
201606	232	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In the wake of the 2007–09 recession, the models saw the real natural rate of interest as having been pushed well below zero; by the end of 2018, however, all of the models expect the natural rate to be positive, with a median estimate of around 1¼ percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	233	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Your next exhibit relates to the inflation component of your dual mandate.	11.0	999.0
201606	234	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panels 1 and 2 summarize the revisions that the staff have made to the inflation outlook since the December Tealbook.	11.0	999.0
201606	235	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from the black line in panel 1, the net revisions that we’ve made to total PCE price inflation have been relatively small.	11.0	999.0
201606	236	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For core PCE price inflation, revisions to which are shown in panel 2, the largest revision is to the current year, 2016, and reflects an upward surprise to first- quarter core inflation—which is captured by the yellow region of the second stacked bar—that we’ve mostly interpreted as noise.	11.0	999.0
201606	237	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, in the March round we edged down our judgmental estimate of underlying inflation 5 basis points, to 1.75 percent; this adjustment is captured by the gray portions of the bars.	11.0	999.0
201606	238	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We had left this assumption unrevised since the June 2014 Tealbook; as we noted in March, we made the revision in response to continued low levels of market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation and in response to the decline we had seen in the Michigan survey measure of longer-term expected inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	239	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see from panel 3, the preliminary June value of the Michigan measure, which is the red line in the figure, fell to 2.3 percent, which is the lowest level ever recorded for that series.	11.0	999.0
201606	240	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This measure can be quite noisy from month to month.	11.0	999.0
201606	241	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Even so, a smoothed value of the series—given in the blue line in the panel—shows a relatively steady decline over the past couple of years.	11.0	999.0
201606	242	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We continue to think that a portion of the decline in this measure of expectations is attributable to the low rates of headline inflation that we saw last year.	11.0	999.0
201606	243	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Indeed, when we try to control for the effect of food and energy price changes, the resulting estimate of the trend—which is the green line in the picture—manifests a much less pronounced decline of late, and it does not fall outside of the historical 70 percent range of the series, which is given by the gray shaded area.	11.0	999.0
201606	244	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Of course, this finding doesn’t rule out the possibility that a more persistent reduction in inflation expectations actually is under way.	11.0	999.0
201606	245	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 4 summarizes results from a number of models that we also use to inform our view of underlying inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	246	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you compare the first two columns of figures, the point estimates from every model except for the time-varying parameter VAR (which is the model shown in line 4) have declined since late 2007.	11.0	999.0
201606	247	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If we throw out the very low reading coming from the TIPS-based model, which is shown on panel 3, the most recent point estimates run from 1.6 to 2 percent, with an equal-weighted mean of 1.7 percent—which is about the same as our judgmental assumption.	11.0	999.0
201606	248	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Panel 5 shows three of the measures of labor compensation that we follow.	11.0	999.0
201606	249	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We have not revised our compensation forecast much in response to the incoming data since April; in particular, we think that the recent acceleration in the productivity and costs measure of business-sector hourly compensation—which is shown in the figure by the blue line—leaves it out of line with its fundamental drivers, and so we don’t expect this current pace to continue.	11.0	999.0
201606	250	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, the ECI came in about as expected in the first quarter, and I’d point out that we anticipate that the 12-month change in the ECI—which is the black line in the figure—will move up to 2¼ percent in the current quarter as an unusually low reading from last year drops out of the calculation.	11.0	999.0
201606	251	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Although the staff closely monitor compensation developments, for some time we have tended to put relatively little weight on movements in labor compensation when we prepare the judgmental forecast for price inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	252	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Simply as an empirical matter, we can no longer find any evidence of pass-through of labor costs to prices if we use compensation measures that are based on the productivity and costs data.	11.0	999.0
201606	253	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Moreover, even ECI-based labor cost measures—for which we still do find evidence of pass- through—appear to have had almost no material effect on price inflation in recent years.	11.0	999.0
201606	254	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To illustrate this latter point, panel 6 uses a vector autoregression, or VAR, to decompose actual price inflation movements—the black line—into a baseline forecast and the cumulative effects of various structural shocks as identified by the VAR model.	11.0	999.0
201606	255	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For example, the solid red line plots the VAR’s baseline forecast (which is obtained from a dynamic simulation of the VAR starting in 2001) plus the estimated effects of shocks to the unemployment gap.	11.0	999.0
201606	256	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	When these unemployment gap shocks are included, the model can track actual inflation tolerably well (the red line sort of tracks the low-frequency movements in the black line; if I were to add in all of the model’s shocks, it would track actual inflation perfectly).	11.0	999.0
201606	257	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The dashed red line then shows what happens if I also add in shocks to ECI-based trend unit labor costs.	11.0	999.0
201606	258	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you can see, the dashed red line lies very close to the solid red line.	11.0	999.0
201606	259	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What that means is, the VAR attributes very little of the movement in core inflation over this period to labor cost shocks.	11.0	999.0
201606	260	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	I want to be clear here:  We don’t actually think that labor costs are immaterial for pricing.	11.0	999.0
201606	261	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Rather, we think that in a world in which inflation expectations are well anchored and, therefore, wage–price spirals are a thing of the past, observed year-to- year movements in price inflation are likely to mostly reflect a mix of changes in slack, supply shocks, and idiosyncratic variation, not independent movements in labor cost growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	262	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Shaghil will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201606	263	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The contour of our foreign outlook is hardly something to write home to Mom about, even if she had FOMC clearance.	11.0	999.0
201606	264	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	[Laughter]	11.0	999.0
201606	265	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As can be seen from line 1 of the table in exhibit 5, we see growth abroad reaching its trend pace of about 2¾ percent in the second half of this year and staying there through the remainder of the forecast period.	11.0	999.0
201606	266	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	While this suggests that the eagerly-awaited global recovery is all but done, we would not characterize foreign economic conditions as having returned to “normal” for several reasons.	11.0	999.0
201606	267	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	First, we appear to be having a dip in the current quarter.	11.0	999.0
201606	268	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As shown in panel 2, even though the pickup in foreign real GDP growth in the first quarter to 2½ percent was a little larger than we had estimated, more recent indicators have disappointed, leading us to mark down second-quarter foreign GDP growth to 1¾ percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	269	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The step-down in growth is concentrated in the advanced foreign economies, or AFEs (line 2 of the table), and primarily reflects transitory factors—wildfires in Canada that have disrupted oil production and an earthquake in Japan—the effects of which should reverse.	11.0	999.0
201606	270	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Moreover, in our baseline view, UK activity should reaccelerate after UK citizens vote to remain in the EU.	11.0	999.0
201606	271	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Growth in the emerging market economies, or EMEs (line 7), is estimated to have remained at its first-quarter pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	272	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Chinese growth (line 8) looks set for a moderate pickup in the current quarter, but Mexican GDP (line 10) should decelerate from its first-quarter surge.	11.0	999.0
201606	273	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The second reason the foreign recovery doesn’t feel normal is that inflation (shown in panel 3), especially in the AFEs, is continuing to run low—even core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	274	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Remaining pockets of slack in some regions, such as in the euro area, help explain some of this weakness, but inflation is running below target even in countries, such as the United Kingdom, whose output gaps are nearly closed.	11.0	999.0
201606	275	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Third, it is taking an unusual amount of stimulus to achieve what we are now thinking of as trend growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	276	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As noted in panel 4, the ECB’s monetary policy remains very accommodative, and its balance sheet is slated to expand further.	11.0	999.0
201606	277	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We think the Bank of Japan will likely ease further, and the government has also announced a postponement to 2019 from 2017 of the planned consumption tax hike.	11.0	999.0
201606	278	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And we don’t expect policy rates to start rising in Canada and the United Kingdom until next year.	11.0	999.0
201606	279	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As I alluded to earlier, we also recognize that the “new normal” likely involves trend growth that is lower than it used to be.	11.0	999.0
201606	280	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Labor productivity growth (panel 5) has been declining in both the AFEs and EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	281	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In EMEs, this primarily represents structural factors such as demographics (particularly in China), the process of economic convergence, and supply bottlenecks in some countries.	11.0	999.0
201606	282	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Some of the decline in the AFEs could be structural as well, as discussed in our Tealbook box on the topic, but it may also reflect lingering effects of the global financial crisis.	11.0	999.0
201606	283	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Consistent with these trends, as shown in panel 6, we have revised down our estimate of potential growth for both types of economies over the past several years.	11.0	999.0
201606	284	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In this challenging global environment with monetary policies near their limits, it is more difficult to counter negative shocks, and risks to the outlook become more worrisome.	11.0	999.0
201606	285	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	So where do we now stand on our familiar downside risks to the global outlook?	11.0	999.0
201606	286	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Turning to exhibit 6, the recent increases in oil prices (panel 1) from very low levels have reduced the risk of severe financial instability or extraordinary belt- tightening in some oil-producing economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	287	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We judge this benefit to exceed the cost to those economies that have benefited from the low oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201606	288	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	However, at this point, a further rise in oil prices would probably be a minus, on balance, for the global economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	289	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	On Chinese risks, the message is also mixed.	11.0	999.0
201606	290	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Depreciation pressures on the Chinese renminbi (panel 2) have eased this year, and capital flows and foreign exchange intervention have been relatively muted.	11.0	999.0
201606	291	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Earlier in the year, this was because the dollar’s generalized depreciation enabled the renminbi to appreciate against the dollar (the black line) even as the exchange value of the basket (the blue line) was falling.	11.0	999.0
201606	292	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	More recently, markets have taken in stride the depreciation of the renminbi against the dollar as the dollar has generally strengthened, and of the basket, but this could change and exchange rate concerns could flare up again.	11.0	999.0
201606	293	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Also, the rapid credit growth encouraged by authorities to keep the economy expanding is further boosting corporate debt and, thus, the risk of financial problems down the road.	11.0	999.0
201606	294	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Consequently, we wouldn’t push risks associated with China to the back burner.	11.0	999.0
201606	295	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Continuing our world tour of risks, Brexit looms large, as Simon discussed.	11.0	999.0
201606	296	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	A leave vote next week could trigger significant additional spillovers to global markets.	11.0	999.0
201606	297	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To provide a sense of the impact of this on the US economy, as noted in panel 3, we ran two simulations using our SIGMA model:  a “moderate” one in which the reaction of global financial markets is relatively muted, and a more “disorderly” one (presented in the Tealbook) in which there are greater spillovers in terms of borrowing spreads and dollar appreciation.	11.0	999.0
201606	298	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As shown in panel 4, our results imply that Brexit would take off about ¼ percentage point from US growth under the moderate scenario (the green line), and a larger negative effect under the disorderly scenario (the red line), resulting in a lower path of the federal funds rate (panel 5).	11.0	999.0
201606	299	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In view of the uncertainties, the range of possible outcomes is, of course, broader.	11.0	999.0
201606	300	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Brexit is not the only risk emanating from the AFEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	301	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Greece’s problems are not yet resolved, and long-run inflation expectations in the AFEs have been falling, which increases the risk that high real interest rates in an environment of a zero-lower-bound constraint could impede progress in some economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	302	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Another key risk involves spillover effects from US monetary policy normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	303	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	One such spillover, discussed in the next exhibit, is that financial stresses in the EMEs could ratchet up, putting a hurt on their real economies.	11.0	999.0
201606	304	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Our baseline view is that EMEs will be able to manage US monetary policy normalization without facing consequences that are too adverse.	11.0	999.0
201606	305	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As suggested by our in-house EME vulnerability index (the red line in panel 1), in many dimensions— including improved policy frameworks, greater exchange rate flexibility, and adequate foreign exchange reserves—EMEs are much less vulnerable than in the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s.	11.0	999.0
201606	306	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	That said, both our vulnerability index and EMBI global spreads—a measure of investor perceptions of creditworthiness—have been trending up a bit over the past few years.	11.0	999.0
201606	307	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Some of this upturn reflects the run-up in credit to the private sector shown in panel 2, especially to nonfinancial corporations (the blue portions of the bars).	11.0	999.0
201606	308	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This creates the risk that US policy normalization and resultant increases in borrowing costs might lead to financial distress in EMEs.	11.0	999.0
201606	309	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Panel 3 depicts an event study of the response of EME spreads to surprises in the federal funds rate following FOMC announcements.	11.0	999.0
201606	310	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As indicated by the regression line, unexpected hikes in the policy rate do boost EME spreads, but it is a moderate effect—a 100 basis point increase in the policy rate is associated with a 44 basis point increase in spreads.	11.0	999.0
201606	311	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This means that the cumulative market surprise in US tightening implied by our baseline federal funds rate path through 2018 should result in about a 65 basis point increase in the EMBI global spread.	11.0	999.0
201606	312	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	But this is very uncertain, and spreads could certainly rise more.	11.0	999.0
201606	313	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To examine the consequences of a sharp rise in financial stresses, I estimate a simple equation (presented in panel 4) in which EME growth is a function of its own lag, aggregate growth in the advanced economies (both the United States and AFEs), and current and lagged value of the EMBI global spread.	11.0	999.0
201606	314	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As noted in the inset box, a 100 basis point rise in spreads is associated with a decline in EME growth of ¼ percentage point in the long run, with the short-run drag being substantially larger.	11.0	999.0
201606	315	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The fit of the model is quite good.	11.0	999.0
201606	316	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To assess spillovers in a stress scenario, I assume that EME global spreads rise 250 basis points in the third quarter—about half that seen during the global financial crisis—and do not return to current levels until end-2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	317	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The hit to EME growth according to this model, shown in panel 5, would be sizable, although well short of crisis proportions.	11.0	999.0
201606	318	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Adverse effects of FOMC policy normalization on foreign growth would, of course, hurt the US external sector—the subject of your next exhibit—with the effects compounded if there was also a bigger rise in the dollar than we are expecting.	11.0	999.0
201606	319	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As indicated in panel 1, in our baseline, we are expecting some further appreciation of the dollar, especially against the AFE currencies.	11.0	999.0
201606	320	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This appreciation reflects the fact that, as depicted in panel 2, we are projecting a larger increase in the federal funds rate than the market, and we assume that as the market raises its expected path of rate tightening in response to ongoing surprises, the dollar will rise.	11.0	999.0
201606	321	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	We calibrate the responses to these surprises on the basis of the historical reaction of the dollar to US monetary policy announcements (the black line in panel 3), which implies a 1.5 percent appreciation of the dollar against the AFE currencies following a 100 basis point policy surprise.	11.0	999.0
201606	322	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Of late, however, the response of the dollar has been considerably greater—the same relationship following all FOMC meetings since June 2014 is shown by the pink line.	11.0	999.0
201606	323	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	While we cannot conclude from such a short period that there has been a structural break in the historical relationship, we have nodded a bit in that direction by increasing our baseline 1.5 percent coefficient to 2.5 percent.	11.0	999.0
201606	324	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	This boosts the slope of our dollar path a bit, other things equal, but, as I mentioned earlier, the dollar could rise much more in response to policy surprises.	11.0	999.0
201606	325	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Accordingly, we presented a “Stronger Dollar” alternative scenario in your Tealbook (not shown), in which the dollar rises an additional 10 percent, leading to moderate declines in US GDP growth and core inflation from their baseline paths.	11.0	999.0
201606	326	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Even without a surge in the dollar, as you can see from line 1 of the table, net exports continue to be a drag on US GDP growth in our forecast, though this drag diminishes by 2018 as the flattening of the dollar kicks in.	11.0	999.0
201606	327	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In the first quarter, extraordinarily surprising weakness in imports (line 2) made the contribution of net exports slightly positive, but we are expecting that to reverse as import growth moves toward the pace we would expect, in view of the behavior of the dollar and faster US GDP growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	328	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	With the flattening of the dollar, we are also seeing core import prices (panel 4) rising for the first time in nearly two years.	11.0	999.0
201606	329	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	In fact, this morning, May import prices printed a little higher than we were expecting, and we have boosted somewhat our forecast for second-quarter core import price inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	330	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	To sum up, with growth abroad settling at a moderate pace, we see a gradual ebbing of the headwinds from the foreign sector on the US economy.	11.0	999.0
201606	331	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	But the global recovery has yet to become self-sustaining, and plenty of downside risks remain, which perhaps are worth writing home to Mom about.	11.0	999.0
201606	332	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Jason will now continue our presentation.	11.0	999.0
201606	333	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Thank you, Shaghil.	11.0	999.0
201606	334	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	I will be referring to the packet labeled “Material for Briefing on the Summary of Economic Projections.”	11.0	999.0
201606	335	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	To summarize briefly:  Compared with the SEP in March, your economic projections have not changed much, but many of you revised down your assessments of the levels of the federal funds rate that will be consistent with those projections in 2017, 2018, and over the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201606	336	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In addition, more of you now see the risks to inflation as balanced than as weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	337	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 1 summarizes your economic projections, which are conditional on your individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.	11.0	999.0
201606	338	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the top panel, the median of your projections for real GDP growth is 2 percent for each year from 2016 through 2018, equal to the median of your projections of its longer-run pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	339	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Looking at your individual projections, a majority of you project that real GDP growth this year will be at or slightly above your individual assessments of its longer- run pace.	11.0	999.0
201606	340	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Most of you forecast that economic growth will pick up a bit next year and will remain at or above your estimate of its longer-run pace in 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	341	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	I should note in passing that one participant did not submit longer-run projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	342	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	That fact will be noted in the SEP materials that will be released to public.	11.0	999.0
201606	343	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the second panel, the median of your projections for the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent this year, 4.6 percent for the next two years, and 4.8 percent in the longer run.	11.0	999.0
201606	344	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	A large majority of you project that the unemployment rate will be at or a bit below its longer-run normal level through 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	345	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections for headline PCE inflation moves up from 1.4 percent this year to 1.9 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018, when almost all of you project that inflation will be equal to or within 0.1 percentage point of the Committee’s objective.	11.0	999.0
201606	346	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Turning to the bottom panel, the median projections for core inflation also increase gradually over the next three years.	11.0	999.0
201606	347	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 2 compares your current projections with those in the March SEP and with the forecasts from the March and June Tealbooks.	11.0	999.0
201606	348	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the top panel, the median path of your projections for real GDP growth edged down this year and next as compared with March and is below the Tealbook forecast over the medium term.	11.0	999.0
201606	349	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you attributed your downward revisions to growth to recent soft readings on economic activity, such as those on business spending, as well as the weaker-than-expected employment report for May.	11.0	999.0
201606	350	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Notably, the range of your projections for GDP growth has become wider for the next two years and for the longer run, mainly as a result of changes to the bottom end of the range.	11.0	999.0
201606	351	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median of your forecasts for unemployment, shown in the second panel, is essentially unrevised at all horizons.	11.0	999.0
201606	352	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As can be seen in the third panel, the median of your projections for total PCE inflation for this year was revised up 0.2 percentage point, but the medians are unrevised for 2017 and 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	353	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you attributed a higher inflation projection for this year to stronger-than-expected readings on inflation in recent months as well as the stabilization of oil prices.	11.0	999.0
201606	354	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median inflation projections through 2018 continue to lie a bit above the Tealbook baseline projection, although the difference has narrowed since March, particularly in the near term.	11.0	999.0
201606	355	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median path of your forecasts for core PCE inflation, shown in the fourth panel, ticked up for this year and the next.	11.0	999.0
201606	356	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 3 provides an overview of your assessments of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	357	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median projection, indicated by the red horizontal lines in the top panel, stands at 0.9 percent at the end of 2016, suggesting two rate hikes by the end of this year, 1.6 percent at the end of 2017, and 2.4 percent at the end of 2018.	11.0	999.0
201606	358	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The median projection for the federal funds rate at the end of this year is unchanged from the March projections (which are shown in the bottom panel).	11.0	999.0
201606	359	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Still, it is worth noting that a majority of you revised down your individual forecasts, that the mean declined 19 basis points, and that now only two of you have year-end projections above 1 percent, compared with seven in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	360	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	All but a few of you revised down your funds rate forecast over the next two years, and the median funds rate projections for 2017 and 2018 are now lower than in March by 38 and 62 basis points, respectively.	11.0	999.0
201606	361	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Many of you expressed a view that increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years will need to be gradual in light of a short-term equilibrium real interest rate that is currently low and will only rise slowly—a phenomenon several of you attributed to persistently low productivity growth and other headwinds.	11.0	999.0
201606	362	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Some of you cited risk-management considerations arising from the proximity of the effective lower bound as a reason for a cautious approach to normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	363	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	With respect to the longer-run federal funds rate, about half of you lowered your projections 25 basis points, and the median now stands at 3 percent compared with 3¼ percent in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	364	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Participants attributed the downward revisions to a number of factors, including global demographic dynamics, weak productivity growth, and a slower pace of potential growth.	11.0	999.0
201606	365	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As in March, almost all of you anticipate that the appropriate level of the funds rate at the end of 2018 will remain below your individual judgments of its longer-run level, but the median shortfall—at 62 basis points—is now wider than it was in March.	11.0	999.0
201606	366	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown by the red diamonds in exhibit 3, the median federal funds rate that a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule prescribes for the end of this year, conditional on your individual projections for core inflation, the unemployment gap, and the longer-run federal funds rate, shifted up slightly since March, boosted mainly by higher projections of core inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	367	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In contrast, the prescriptions for 2017 and 2018 shifted down a bit as a result of downward revisions to the longer-run federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	368	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Still, all of you continue to project levels of the federal funds rate for this year and next that are well below the prescriptions of the rule, and only one of you projects the federal funds rate in 2018 to be higher than suggested by the rule.	11.0	999.0
201606	369	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	In fact, for most of you, the gaps between your projections of the federal funds rate and the rule’s prescriptions have widened since March at all forecast horizons.	11.0	999.0
201606	370	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Exhibit 4 shows your assessments of the uncertainty and risks surrounding your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	371	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As shown in the figures to the left, you continue to view the uncertainty about your projections as broadly similar to its historical average.	11.0	999.0
201606	372	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As in March, most of you also see the risks to your projections of GDP growth and the unemployment rate as broadly balanced, as illustrated in the top two figures to the right, but quite a few of you see the risks to growth as weighted to the downside and risks to unemployment as weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	373	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Moving to the two bottom-right figures, in contrast to March, a majority of you now see the risks to your inflation projections as broadly balanced rather than as tilted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	374	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	A couple of you pointed to the firming of some measures of inflation in recent months as contributing to the change in your risk assessment.	11.0	999.0
201606	375	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Among those who continue to judge that the risks to inflation are weighted to the downside, almost all cited recent declines in certain measures of longer-run inflation expectations as a reason for your assessment.	11.0	999.0
201606	376	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The final exhibit explores the extent to which the gap between your projections for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate and the prescriptions of a non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule are correlated with your assessments of the risks to your economic projections.	11.0	999.0
201606	377	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The top two panels focus on your assessments of the risks to your projections for PCE inflation.	11.0	999.0
201606	378	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The blue line in the first panel displays, across SEP dates, the median value of the Taylor rule residuals for 2016.	11.0	999.0
201606	379	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The blue line in the second panel displays the same variable on the basis of your projections for 2017.	11.0	999.0
201606	380	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As you can see, the median Taylor rule residuals for both 2016 and 2017 have generally become larger since September 2014, indicating that your funds rate projections have moved further below the prescriptions of the Taylor rule.	11.0	999.0
201606	381	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The red lines in the first two panels show, over the SEP dates, the net fraction of participants who assessed that the risks to PCE inflation are weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	382	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Over time, more of you judged the risks to your inflation projections to be weighted to the downside.	11.0	999.0
201606	383	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The co-movement between the median residuals and the net fraction is notable.	11.0	999.0
201606	384	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The bottom two panels plot the same blue lines—the median Taylor rule residuals—against the net fraction of participants who assessed that the risks to the unemployment rate are weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	385	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Over the past year and a half, more of you judged the risks to the unemployment rate to be weighted to the upside.	11.0	999.0
201606	386	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The co- movement here between the net fraction and the Taylor rule residuals is more modest.	11.0	999.0
201606	387	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	One potential rationale for co-movement between your risk assessments and the Taylor rule residuals could be the proximity of the ELB:  When the risks to the real economy and especially inflation are significantly skewed to the downside, you adopt a risk-management approach to policy normalization.	11.0	999.0
201606	388	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	As a result, you deem it appropriate to provide a greater amount of accommodation relative to a Taylor rule benchmark that uses your modal forecasts for inflation and the unemployment rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	389	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Another rationale, which could be complementary to the first one, is that the widening Taylor rule residuals reflect your assessments that the short-term equilibrium real interest rate has moved down, reducing the scope for providing policy accommodation through the federal funds rate.	11.0	999.0
201606	390	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	This in turn increases the vulnerability of the economy to adverse shocks.	11.0	999.0
201606	391	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	Thank you.	11.0	999.0
201606	392	2016-06-15	meeting	WU	The three of us would be happy to take your questions.	11.0	999.0
201606	393	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any questions?	12.0	65.0
201606	394	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The floor is open for questions for any of our presenters.	12.0	65.0
201606	395	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	12.0	65.0
201606	396	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	12.0	111.0
201606	397	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Jeremy, on exhibit 4, looking at inflation in panel 2, you have the yellow bars labeled “other.”	12.0	111.0
201606	398	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think you said that that was noise.	12.0	111.0
201606	399	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	For 2016.	12.0	999.0
201606	400	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	For 2016.	12.0	111.0
201606	401	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Could you talk a little bit more about how much confidence you have in that noise?	12.0	111.0
201606	402	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It just looks large.	12.0	111.0
201606	403	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Yes, so one thing to point out is that it actually isn’t that large—given the volatility that we tend to see quarter to quarter in inflation, it’s not absolutely huge.	12.0	999.0
201606	404	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In fact, when we brought this exhibit into the Tealbook a few rounds ago, we pointed out that what we were showing as the range of the y-axis was calibrated on the basis of the confidence interval from a year, year-and-a-half-ahead forecast—I believe it was the 2017 confidence interval, as we were jumping off in, say, December 2015.	12.0	999.0
201606	405	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	So that gives you a way to calibrate how large that yellow residual is.	12.0	999.0
201606	406	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The reason why we are more convinced that it’s noise now than we were is because we’ve basically seen recent inflation readings come in closer in line with our forecast, except for the portion of that miss that we label the nonmarket component of PCE prices.	12.0	999.0
201606	407	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t think there’s much signal in nonmarket prices.	12.0	999.0
201606	408	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	They’re very erratic from quarter to quarter, and we don’t think there’s a lot of persistence or information about inflation trends in that portion.	12.0	999.0
201606	409	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In addition, we just saw a number of anomalous movements in January 2016 that pushed up inflation for the year as a whole.	12.0	999.0
201606	410	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	They were in some strange categories—like in the goods category, I believe jewelry had a very large spike that, at the time, seemed inexplicable and later didn’t—	12.0	999.0
201606	411	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think President Williams said he was purchasing in January.	12.0	111.0
201606	413	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s true.	12.0	102.0
201606	414	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Exactly.	12.0	111.0
201606	415	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We didn’t expect that to be repeated, and recently things have come in more or less in line with our forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	416	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We’re reasonably confident that that was basically transitory volatility in this series.	12.0	999.0
201606	417	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Okay.	12.0	111.0
201606	418	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	12.0	111.0
201606	419	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12.0	65.0
201606	420	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	94.0
201606	421	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at exhibit 8, panel 1, which is real dollar indexes.	12.0	94.0
201606	422	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I guess I wasn’t quite sure what the experiment was here.	12.0	94.0
201606	423	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The dashed lines are the April Tealbook, and then the other lines are the 100 basis point surprise?	12.0	94.0
201606	424	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	No, panel 1 is just our baseline forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	425	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the dashed lines?	12.0	94.0
201606	426	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the solid lines?	12.0	94.0
201606	427	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	The solid line is our current forecast, and the dashed lines are our April Tealbook forecast.	12.0	999.0
201606	428	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I see.	12.0	94.0
201606	429	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	So the dollar jumped against the emerging market currencies, and we have a higher starting point.	12.0	999.0
201606	430	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And then we have the slope obtained on the basis of market reactions to surprises to the path of policy rates in the US and foreign economies.	12.0	999.0
201606	431	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	432	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So during your presentation, you were talking about 100 basis point surprises.	12.0	94.0
201606	433	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So what were you talking about?	12.0	94.0
201606	434	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	What I was talking about was, basically, I think you’re referring to the EME exhibit, maybe.	12.0	999.0
201606	435	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Yes, well, I’m not sure.	12.0	94.0
201606	436	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Why don’t we abstract from which panel exactly the surprise was and just talk about the rationale behind our dollar forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	437	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I guess my question is, why would you want to talk about a 100 basis point surprise in the funds rate?	12.0	94.0
201606	438	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Oh, sorry.	12.0	999.0
201606	439	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	That was just to talk about the slope of this black line in panel 3, which is based on the historical relationship between the response of federal funds futures to FOMC announcements and the 1-day change in the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	440	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Then if you want to talk about 25 basis points, divide the slope of 1.5 by 4.	12.0	999.0
201606	441	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	442	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The reason that’s relevant is because of the way we forecast the evolution of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	443	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We start with the basic presumption that the current level of the exchange rate should incorporate the markets’ expectations about anything that happens in the future.	12.0	999.0
201606	444	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So if the markets expected the federal funds rate to rise by a certain amount and they expected the euro- area interest rate to fall by a certain amount, that would already be incorporated into the current level of the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	445	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We would not expect the dollar to move in the future as the market saw the changes in the interest rates that it expected.	12.0	999.0
201606	446	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	However, the staff forecast is for a steeper rise in the federal funds rate than the markets expect.	12.0	999.0
201606	447	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So we assume that as the markets perceive this higher-than-expected interest rate, they will respond by bidding the dollar up.	12.0	999.0
201606	448	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Now the question becomes:  Well, how do we tell, when the market experiences a surprise interest rate, how do we tell how much that should affect the dollar?	12.0	999.0
201606	449	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And in order to come up with an estimate of that sensitivity, we look at the past history of the responses of the dollar to surprises in the interest rate, using the FOMC announcements as a way to take a clear reading on that expectational change.	12.0	999.0
201606	450	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	451	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I think that’s fair.	12.0	94.0
201606	452	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So these estimates in panel 3 are on a one- day window, it looks like.	12.0	94.0
201606	453	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201606	454	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Whereas what’s going to happen if you think that the market expects a lower funds rate and the Committee expects a higher funds rate, that information is going to be revealed over a very long time period.	12.0	94.0
201606	455	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So what do you do with that when you look at the dollar?	12.0	94.0
201606	456	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We’re making the assumption that the effect of changes in market expectations of the interest rate in short periods can basically be linearly transferred to what should happen over a long period of time.	12.0	999.0
201606	457	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And we have some support for that, because if you did a very similar experiment in which you looked at changes in 10-year yields from before to after FOMC announcements, they also map in a systematic way into changes in the dollar.	12.0	999.0
201606	458	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And if you then take into account the fact that changes in 10-year yields are kind of related in a systematic way to changes in short yields, you get a similar relationship.	12.0	999.0
201606	459	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We think that, by and large, this approach toward calibrating the sensitivity of the dollar to interest rate changes works, although considering how incredibly uncertain the dollar forecast is anyway, we could be splitting some hairs here.	12.0	999.0
201606	460	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	461	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s suppose the Committee did what’s in panel 2 here, which is the solid black line, and the market expected the dashed line below, so we’re surprised over the next couple of years with higher rates.	12.0	94.0
201606	462	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The dollar’s going to be stronger than the baseline.	12.0	94.0
201606	463	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is going to have an effect on net exports, and that’s the top line in the bottom table.	12.0	94.0
201606	464	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Is this correct?	12.0	94.0
201606	465	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Exactly.	12.0	999.0
201606	466	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	12.0	94.0
201606	467	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, just with the caveat that this is what is built in.	12.0	999.0
201606	468	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I assume you are talking about how things work in our baseline.	12.0	999.0
201606	469	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	In other words, as the actual interest rate exceeds market expectations, that boosts the dollar in the way shown in the baseline, panel 1.	12.0	999.0
201606	470	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then we get this net exports contribution to GDP.	12.0	94.0
201606	471	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then we get the net exports contribution, exactly, shown in table 1.	12.0	999.0
201606	472	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I actually calculated the net exports contribution to GDP during the previous expansion, 2001 to 2007, and I got numbers that look about like this, slightly negative numbers.	12.0	94.0
201606	473	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I am interpreting this as almost nothing happens.	12.0	94.0
201606	474	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, a couple of things.	12.0	999.0
201606	475	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Number one, that previous expansion, the first part of it was, indeed, a period of dollar strength.	12.0	999.0
201606	476	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So you typically—let’s put it this way—	12.0	999.0
201606	477	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Surprise dollar strength?	12.0	94.0
201606	478	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, not necessarily.	12.0	999.0
201606	479	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But it was a period of dollar strength.	12.0	999.0
201606	480	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And so, right now, as we move into looking at the effect of the dollar on the trade forecast, we now can leave behind the expectations element.	12.0	999.0
201606	481	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We take it as given that the dollar had a certain trajectory.	12.0	999.0
201606	482	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The dollar peaked in 2002, so the dollar was actually very strong for much of our previous expansion.	12.0	999.0
201606	483	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And, more generally, dollar strength does tend to be correlated with our expansions.	12.0	999.0
201606	484	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So it should not be a surprise that during our previous cyclical expansion, we did have a negative contribution of net exports to GDP growth.	12.0	999.0
201606	485	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All that said, it should be noted that looking forward, and as you alluded to, these contributions of minus 0.3 percentage point, minus 0.4 percentage point, they are not very large.	12.0	999.0
201606	486	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	They are getting into a very manageable size.	12.0	999.0
201606	487	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12.0	94.0
201606	488	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12.0	65.0
201606	489	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I was looking at the international forecasts.	12.0	96.0
201606	490	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	You have another disappointment in terms of global growth, yet an environment in which monetary policies around the world are supposedly very accommodative.	12.0	96.0
201606	491	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	How do you square the circle?	12.0	96.0
201606	492	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	What do you think is fundamentally going on?	12.0	96.0
201606	493	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And there are a couple of completely alternative sort of scenarios.	12.0	96.0
201606	494	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	One scenario would be that monetary policy stimulus isn’t as great as we think it is, and so then we have to come up with an explanation for that.	12.0	96.0
201606	495	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	One possible explanation is maybe monetary policy stimulus becomes attenuated over time, because over time people buy things, it pulls things forward, and that means they don’t buy those things in the future, or maybe household savings reacts to the low level of interest rates by deciding that they have to save more.	12.0	96.0
201606	496	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s one possible explanation.	12.0	96.0
201606	497	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Another possible explanation is there is a global saving glut.	12.0	96.0
201606	498	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it just seems like it would be useful to dive in a little bit more into this issue of why we consistently see global economic weakness in an environment in which monetary policy is super stimulative, supposedly.	12.0	96.0
201606	499	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t feel like we have a coherent story reconciling those two things.	12.0	96.0
201606	500	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think I would interpret it as implying that there are still fragilities.	12.0	999.0
201606	501	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Even though this is a trendlike pace in global growth, there are still fragilities in the economies.	12.0	999.0
201606	502	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And, therefore, the policy support is required.	12.0	999.0
201606	503	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So is this a headwinds type of story, and the headwinds will dissipate over time, and eventually we will do better?	12.0	96.0
201606	504	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Yes.	12.0	999.0
201606	505	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	It’s not that we will do better.	12.0	999.0
201606	506	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	As you can see in the forecast, we have a lower trend—period.	12.0	999.0
201606	507	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And it stays at 2.8 percent.	12.0	999.0
201606	508	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	When you look at Japan and Europe, you have to sort of say that it’s not really working, right?	12.0	96.0
201606	509	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They are supposedly having these very stimulative monetary policies, and it’s not really working.	12.0	96.0
201606	510	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t feel like we have a coherent story about why that is.	12.0	96.0
201606	511	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, it is worthwhile to distinguish between the average and the marginal effects of these monetary policies.	12.0	999.0
201606	512	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	You could argue persuasively, I think, that doing additional QE or moving further into negative interest rates at this point might not be effective.	12.0	999.0
201606	513	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	It would be hard to argue with that.	12.0	999.0
201606	514	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, it’s unambiguously clear that actual interest rates, both short term and long term, are incredibly low.	12.0	999.0
201606	515	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly by that metric, monetary policies are extraordinarily easy.	12.0	999.0
201606	516	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then if you said, “Well, why is—”	12.0	999.0
201606	517	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	“Easy” or “stimulative”?	12.0	96.0
201606	518	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Those are different things.	12.0	96.0
201606	519	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All right.	12.0	999.0
201606	520	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Let me just start by saying “easy” in the sense of any firm that wants to invest and actually hire people and build a factory can do so for virtually no cost of funds.	12.0	999.0
201606	521	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So, to me, that suggests clearly that there are huge headwinds on spending itself.	12.0	999.0
201606	522	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We know that’s true in the corporate investment side, in which corporations are earning far more profits around the world than they are investing, and they are returning that cash to their shareholders via dividends and buybacks.	12.0	999.0
201606	523	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then we know that consumption has not been particularly strong.	12.0	999.0
201606	524	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I would say, for starters, it is obvious there are very strong headwinds against spending.	12.0	999.0
201606	525	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And then, on top of that, whether monetary policy has lost its oomph, I think we could make an argument that certainly marginal policy stimulus has.	12.0	999.0
201606	526	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But, as I say, I think the fault must lie on the part of the spenders and why they don’t spend.	12.0	999.0
201606	527	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Clearly, interest rates are now so low that money for investment can be had for nothing.	12.0	999.0
201606	528	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	See, my suspicion is that we are sort of mistaking level for change in monetary policy.	12.0	96.0
201606	529	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, when you ease monetary policy, when you change the level of rates, you have an effect on spending.	12.0	96.0
201606	530	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you stay at that level, it sort of loses its effect.	12.0	96.0
201606	531	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And we can look at the level and judge from the level obtained from Taylor-rule formulations and others that policy is really accommodative.	12.0	96.0
201606	532	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But, in fact, the degree of accommodation is actually lessening over time.	12.0	96.0
201606	533	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I feel like we haven’t really entertained this possibility seriously, and the reason why we haven’t is we’ve never really been in this situation before in which you’ve stayed at a level of interest rates that are very low for a very long period of time.	12.0	96.0
201606	534	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Typically, what happens is you go to this low level of interest rates, which generates a cyclical recovery.	12.0	96.0
201606	535	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wonder, is it worth—	12.0	96.0
201606	536	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	It is certainly worth arguing—	12.0	999.0
201606	537	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I can only address the domestic component of that, and there I’d say the picture is a bit mixed.	12.0	999.0
201606	538	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	With respect to portfolio policy, we’ve considerably downgraded our estimates of the effect of increases in the size of the portfolio since the time of QE1, which we thought was redressing serious bond market dysfunction, and we thought that had a very big effect on economic activity.	12.0	999.0
201606	539	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And, progressively over time, the estimates that are implicit in the projection show smaller effects from increments to the size of the portfolio.	12.0	999.0
201606	540	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	On the traditional component, the funds rate component, I invert your hypothesis and say that, at the margin, we are assuming that what’s implicit in the forecast, I think, roughly speaking, is that the margin changes in the path of interest rates—not just the funds rate today, but the path of interest rates—have, roughly speaking, the same effect as before.	12.0	999.0
201606	541	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it’s the intercept, I would say, that has shifted down.	12.0	999.0
201606	542	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And so, you know, this is reflected in our own 25 basis point adjustment in long-run r*.	12.0	999.0
201606	543	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think your comments are very well taken, but they incorporate, as you know, an ongoing pitched battle between people like Larry Summers and Paul Krugman and Ken Rogoff and Ben Bernanke, all of whom have different answers to the very question that you are asking.	12.0	999.0
201606	544	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And I think what you are exposing is that, for lack of a better way to put it, the staff are not smarter than the combination of Larry Summers, Ken Rogoff—	12.0	999.0
201606	545	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Don’t give up.	12.0	96.0
201606	546	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	12.0	96.0
201606	547	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So we have to take a pragmatic stand with, on the one hand, balancing— we don’t know the answer to that question, but we need to try to recalibrate the projection realistically so that we think it’s giving you a sensible picture of how aggregate demand will evolve.	12.0	999.0
201606	548	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And I think that our assessment is that it takes a lower level of interest rates at this point now than we thought it did.	12.0	999.0
201606	549	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be consistent with monetary policy attenuation, that you gradually keep lowering your intercept term over time to—	12.0	96.0
201606	550	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, I am not sure what you mean by “attenuation.”	12.0	999.0
201606	551	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think when I hear “attenuation,” what—	12.0	999.0
201606	552	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean that a given level of interest rates has a diminished effect on economic activity over time—the same level.	12.0	96.0
201606	553	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Okay.	12.0	999.0
201606	554	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	That’s the part I think I am agreeing with.	12.0	999.0
201606	555	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The piece that I was taking issue with was, at the margin today, if you considered a decision tree with branches on it, roughly speaking I think we’d say you’d get the same amount of oomph today at the margin if you did the optometrist’s comparison of “better A” or “better B.”	12.0	999.0
201606	556	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Does 25 basis points get you the same amount?	12.0	999.0
201606	557	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t necessarily disagree with that.	12.0	96.0
201606	558	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I would say that the 25 basis points would give you “X” amount in period 1, but “X minus something” in period 2, and “X minus something greater” in period 3.	12.0	96.0
201606	559	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, the effect of that cut would peter out over time.	12.0	96.0
201606	560	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s really what I’m suggesting.	12.0	96.0
201606	561	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer would like to join this debate.	12.0	65.0
201606	562	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Discussion.	12.0	97.0
201606	563	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Discussion.	12.0	108.0
201606	564	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks, Madam Chair.	12.0	108.0
201606	565	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think you’re talking about levels and rates of change.	12.0	108.0
201606	566	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	12.0	96.0
201606	567	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Exactly.	12.0	65.0
201606	568	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	When the FOMC introduced the large-scale purchases of domestic assets, it was a change in policy.	12.0	108.0
201606	569	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Furthermore, it hadn’t been anticipated.	12.0	108.0
201606	570	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	When it happened, we got a fairly big reduction in long-term interest rates at the time.	12.0	108.0
201606	571	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, if that expansionary policy stayed in place forever, we would have expected long-term interest rates to rise gradually back up partway as the economy strengthened, until they reached a new level.	12.0	108.0
201606	572	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, we had expected, all of us, that that strengthening process would be led by the interest-sensitive sectors, namely residential investment, and to a lesser extent, business investment.	12.0	108.0
201606	573	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, it didn’t happen.	12.0	108.0
201606	574	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What we were expecting to come in didn’t come in.	12.0	108.0
201606	575	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	At the same time, productivity growth seems to be very low.	12.0	108.0
201606	576	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	With productivity and investment both low—what have we got to spur the economy other than continued accommodative monetary policy?	12.0	108.0
201606	577	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	As of now, we haven’t gotten either the productivity growth or investment we might have expected.	12.0	108.0
201606	578	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think it’s the headwinds story.	12.0	999.0
201606	579	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And I think the crucial question is whether those headwinds are temporary or permanent, right?	12.0	999.0
201606	580	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And so—	12.0	999.0
201606	581	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Or are the headwinds just time?	12.0	96.0
201606	582	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean—	12.0	96.0
201606	583	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	If you look out to 2021 through 2025, the forward interest rate in Japan is minus 4 basis points.	12.0	999.0
201606	584	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	That’s pretty low.	12.0	999.0
201606	585	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Which implies that it’s not a headwind.	12.0	96.0
201606	586	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It implies it’s more a permanent feature of the environment.	12.0	96.0
201606	587	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Well, it’s why people think that it’s more a permanent feature—	12.0	999.0
201606	588	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	Yes, think it is, but it’s a pretty low border.	12.0	999.0
201606	589	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, anyway, thank you.	12.0	96.0
201606	590	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	We will all think about these things.	12.0	999.0
201606	591	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further—yes, President Lockhart.	12.0	65.0
201606	592	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	88.0
201606	593	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Back to Steve, if I could, and I’m asking you because you’ve talked on this subject before.	12.0	88.0
201606	594	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Exhibit 7, panels 1 and 2—if I interpret this correctly, with the exception of China debt, the picture doesn’t look elevated relative to conditions in ’94 and ’97.	12.0	88.0
201606	595	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And you could conclude, looking at the vulnerability index, that it’s reasonably flat and that there’s no strong signal there.	12.0	88.0
201606	596	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	But then I look at the China debt and the EME composite with the dark blue for corporations and the red for households, and it pushes quite a bit above ’97 and ’94.	12.0	88.0
201606	597	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Could you update your thinking for us on China debt-related  risk?	12.0	88.0
201606	598	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And I would note that there’s been a fair amount of publicity recently of major investors who are focused on this and shorting.	12.0	88.0
201606	599	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So if you overlay short interest on this picture, how much risk do you get?	12.0	88.0
201606	600	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Sure.	12.0	999.0
201606	601	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll say a few things because you’ve addressed the question to me, but Shaghil’s actually pretty expert on this, so he can add on.	12.0	999.0
201606	602	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Just a couple points.	12.0	999.0
201606	603	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Number one, indeed, for the other countries, it falls below that Mexico ’94 and Asia financial crisis line.	12.0	999.0
201606	604	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But those were pretty bad crises, and a lot of the countries here almost make it up to the Mexico ’94 line.	12.0	999.0
201606	605	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And so, for that reason, we are looking at all the EMEs very closely—and a lot of other analysts are, too—because, as you can see, just looking at the numbers, all of these countries have experienced very substantial increases in debt to GDP.	12.0	999.0
201606	606	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	So just the fact that they haven’t made it up to those lines doesn’t mean there’s no cause for worry.	12.0	999.0
201606	607	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The second point is, China, of course, is way above those lines, so it is more of a tangible risk.	12.0	999.0
201606	608	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	If China were, in fact, to have a hard landing, that could easily spill over to all these EMEs that are below the line.	12.0	999.0
201606	609	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	China therefore poses a substantial risk.	12.0	999.0
201606	610	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	How big a risk?	12.0	999.0
201606	611	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The fact of the matter is, it’s very hard to gauge.	12.0	999.0
201606	612	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	What we know is that if we just look at China alone, it’s got corporate debt to GDP that’s over 200 percent of GDP.	12.0	999.0
201606	613	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	And it’s grown very rapidly.	12.0	999.0
201606	614	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Both the size and the fact that it’s grown rapidly are considered the best possible signals of an impending crisis.	12.0	999.0
201606	615	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	If China were any other EME, it likely would have had its crisis already.	12.0	999.0
201606	616	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	But China has very rapid growth, and that growth can paper over a lot of ills.	12.0	999.0
201606	617	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Also, the government has a very solid fiscal situation relative to most EME governments, with a huge stockpile of foreign exchange reserves, and most of that debt that Chinese corporations owe is in local currency, not in foreign currency.	12.0	999.0
201606	618	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	All those things help it.	12.0	999.0
201606	619	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	The long and the short of it is, it’s very hard to gauge how great the risk is in China, but it’s certainly very, very substantial.	12.0	999.0
201606	620	2016-06-15	meeting	KAMIN	Shaghil, is there anything you’d like to add to that?	12.0	999.0
201606	621	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	Well, just to emphasize that point about mitigants, that a lot of this lending is just state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises.	12.0	999.0
201606	622	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And China has plenty of resources to capitalize those banks—at a cost, of course, so it has these mitigants that other countries don’t have and can sustain a high level without crisis.	12.0	999.0
201606	623	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	I think the hard-landing scenario may be in the tail risk, but I think there’s a more significant risk that China could significantly slow without a hard landing.	12.0	999.0
201606	624	2016-06-15	meeting	AHMED	And I do think it’s underappreciated, what effect a less-than-hard landing slowing would have on the rest of the world.	12.0	999.0
201606	625	2016-06-15	meeting	POTTER	But, in terms of people shorting, I think that’s not as big a factor as it was earlier this year, except for one prominent investor.	12.0	999.0
201606	626	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	12.0	65.0
201606	627	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12.0	999.0
201606	628	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I want to go back to a few comments that were made about corporate investment and ask for your thinking on why this has been so low.	12.0	999.0
201606	629	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	One of the things that my staff pointed out to me is that, if you look at a graph of net private nonresidential fixed assets versus nonfarm private employees, we’re well above trend because of the Great Recession—which makes sense, right?	12.0	999.0
201606	630	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Do you lay a lot of people off?	12.0	999.0
201606	631	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But you’re starting to see that return to trendline.	12.0	999.0
201606	632	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So one story is that we will start to see that pick up as firms get back to trend in terms of capital stock relative to employees.	12.0	999.0
201606	633	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Have you looked at that in terms of your forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	634	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	It’s the one area that I worry about with respect to spending, because consumer spending is robust, it’s strong, but we’re not seeing business investment picking up.	12.0	999.0
201606	635	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But there may be a reason for that, in that we had a lot of capital, we’re now reaching a trend ratio, and that should start to pick up.	12.0	999.0
201606	636	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Have you thought about that?	12.0	999.0
201606	637	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Has that been built into your forecast?	12.0	999.0
201606	638	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One thing that we have looked at is the capital-to-effective-worker ratio, which is a measure of capital relative to workers adjusted for productivity.	12.0	999.0
201606	639	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Another way to put that is, it’s the capital-to-potential-output ratio that you want to look at.	12.0	999.0
201606	640	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And potential output is slowing, and therefore we would expect the growth rate of the capital stock to slow.	12.0	999.0
201606	641	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There was a FEDS Notes article that was written a year or two ago by some of my colleagues that tried to adduce that as one of the explanations for why the rate of growth of the capital stock might not be as rapid in a period in which potential growth is slower.	12.0	999.0
201606	642	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, one thing we have trouble doing is trying to gauge exactly where the target capital stock should be, and if we’re behind or ahead of that.	12.0	999.0
201606	643	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We tried to do it a lot in the late ’90s.	12.0	999.0
201606	644	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We never had a lot of luck in measuring capital overhang or something like that, so we don’t usually try to look at a particular target level for the capital stock and then key the forecast off that.	12.0	999.0
201606	645	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What we do is, our full fundamentals model backs out our investment forecast by looking at the growth rate of business output.	12.0	999.0
201606	646	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To the extent that business output has been doing what it’s doing, we can explain, over most of recent history, what’s been going on with business investment, except very recently.	12.0	999.0
201606	647	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Very recently, it’s very difficult for us to explain why it’s been so weak.	12.0	999.0
201606	648	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	One of the things that one of my colleagues presented on Monday in her pre-FOMC briefing was the possible explanations as to what could be driving that weakness and how much we think those explanations carry water.	12.0	999.0
201606	649	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And the answer is, I think it’s pretty hard for us to explain what’s going on with recent softness in business investment.	12.0	999.0
201606	650	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Even if you combine all of those explanations, and we have something quantitatively, we can’t really get most of the way there, which suggests it could just be bad luck, noise, or something like that.	12.0	999.0
201606	651	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But we don’t really have a satisfactory reason for why it’s been so weak recently.	12.0	999.0
201606	652	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Our thinking is very similar to yours.	12.0	999.0
201606	653	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’m going to try to boost the citation count for my colleagues.	12.0	999.0
201606	654	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The FEDS Notes article that Jeremy referenced was written by Eugenio Pinto and Stacey Tevlin, and that’s available on our website.	12.0	999.0
201606	655	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The model that they present there does a good job of accounting for business fixed investment, I think, through about the third quarter of last year, something like that.	12.0	999.0
201606	656	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In our assessment, it’s the last couple of quarters that have been a bit of a puzzle.	12.0	999.0
201606	657	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	And there’s no real reason that you can give why that’s the case?	12.0	999.0
201606	658	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	As Jeremy mentioned, Ekaterina Peneva summarized a variety of hypotheses.	12.0	999.0
201606	659	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Corporations have expressed some concern about weakness in their profits.	12.0	999.0
201606	660	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve wondered about spillover from the drilling and mining collapse into other elements of investment.	12.0	999.0
201606	661	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	A number of outside analysts have pointed to the possibility that uncertainty is unusually high, perhaps related to geopolitical concerns or domestic political concerns.	12.0	999.0
201606	662	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	These things have an air of plausibility to them.	12.0	999.0
201606	663	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re very hard to test, empirically, how significant they are.	12.0	999.0
201606	664	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s not more than a sense, but I think I’d agree exactly with the summary that Jeremy gave, which is, our sense is that they probably account for some of the weakness in the past few quarters.	12.0	999.0
201606	665	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it’s an inherently volatile series.	12.0	999.0
201606	666	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We think it’s been puzzlingly weak the last couple of quarters.	12.0	999.0
201606	667	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an element of concern for us.	12.0	999.0
201606	668	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you.	12.0	999.0
201606	670	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Any further questions?	52.0	65.0
201606	671	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	52.0	65.0
201606	672	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, I suggest we take a break, maybe for about 20 minutes, and return around 3 pm .	52.0	65.0
201606	673	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay, folks.	52.0	65.0
201606	674	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let us resume.	13.0	65.0
201606	675	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think we can begin our economic go- round.	13.0	65.0
201606	676	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to call on President Bullard first.	13.0	65.0
201606	677	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	678	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to devote my comments today to the St Louis Federal Reserve’s new characterization of the outlook for the US economy.	13.0	94.0
201606	679	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The St Louis Federal Reserve is changing its characterization of the US macroeconomic and monetary policy outlook.	13.0	94.0
201606	680	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	An older narrative that the Bank has been using since the financial crisis ended has now likely outlived its usefulness, so it is being replaced by a new narrative.	13.0	94.0
201606	681	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The hallmark of the new narrative is to think of medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in terms of regimes.	13.0	94.0
201606	682	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The concept of a single long-run steady state to which the economy is converging is abandoned and replaced by a set of possible regimes that the economy may visit.	13.0	94.0
201606	683	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Regimes are generally viewed as persistent, and optimal monetary policy is viewed as regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	684	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Switches between regimes are viewed as not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	685	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The upshot is that the new approach delivers a very simple forecast of US macroeconomic outcomes over the next two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	686	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Over this horizon, the forecast is for output growth of 2 percent, unemployment of 4.7 percent, and inflation of 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	687	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In light of this new approach and the associated forecast, the appropriate regime-dependent policy rate path is 63 basis points over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	688	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	My remarks today will describe how this regime could be upset by switches in fundamental factors that may cause changes in the recommended setting of the policy rate path.	13.0	94.0
201606	689	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It is a good time to consider a regime-based conception of medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes.	13.0	94.0
201606	690	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Key macroeconomic variables, including output growth, unemployment, and inflation, appear to be at or near values that are likely to persist over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	691	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think of this as the mean outcome of the “current regime.”	13.0	94.0
201606	692	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, the situation can and will change in the future, but exactly how is difficult to predict.	13.0	94.0
201606	693	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Therefore, the best we can do today is to forecast that the current regime will persist and set policy appropriately for this regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	694	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If there’s a switch to a new regime in the future, then that will likely affect all variables, including the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	695	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But such a switch is not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	696	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Consistent with the regime-based concept, the new approach does not contain projected long-run values for either macroeconomic variables or the policy rate; that is, the forecast simply stops at two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	697	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, the new narrative views medium- and longer-term macroeconomic outcomes in terms of a set of possible regimes that the economy may visit instead of a single, unique steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	698	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	By doing this, we are backing off the idea that we have dogmatic certainty about where the US economy is headed in the medium and longer run.	13.0	94.0
201606	699	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We are trying to replace that dogmatic certainty with a manageable expression of the uncertainty surrounding medium- and longer-run outcomes.	13.0	94.0
201606	700	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	By doing so, we hope to provide a better description of the nature of the data dependence of monetary policy in the period ahead.	13.0	94.0
201606	701	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Fundamental factors determine the nature of the regimes in play.	13.0	94.0
201606	702	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One important fundamental is productivity growth.	13.0	94.0
201606	703	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The average productivity growth rate in the United States has been low since at least 2011.	13.0	94.0
201606	704	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think of this as a “low productivity growth” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	705	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We know from past observation of the US economy that productivity could switch to a “high growth” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	706	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If such a switch occurred, it might have important effects on many variables but especially on output growth, which would be higher.	13.0	94.0
201606	707	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Because we view the low-productivity-growth regime as very persistent, for purposes of forecasting, we simply assume that we will remain in the low-productivity-growth regime—and hence the “low output growth” regime—throughout the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	708	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The idea that productivity may switch to a high-growth regime is not incorporated in the forecast directly but is an upside risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	709	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The switch to the high-growth regime is viewed as possible but not forecastable.	13.0	94.0
201606	710	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But simply having a high- and low-productivity-growth regime is insufficient to describe the current macroeconomic situation.	13.0	94.0
201606	711	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are at least two other fundamental factors that have to remain in their current state to maintain the status quo.	13.0	94.0
201606	712	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One of these fundamentals is the real rate of return on short-term government debt.	13.0	94.0
201606	713	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This return is very low today by recent historical standards, perhaps less than negative 1 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	714	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In our framework, we view this as a “low real rate” regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	715	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The alternative regime, which has been observed historically, is for a considerably higher value of this rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	716	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, we view the current low-real-rate regime as very persistent.	13.0	94.0
201606	717	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So, for purposes of forecasting, we simply assume that we will remain in the low-real-rate regime through the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	718	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A switch to the “high real rate” regime is possible and, if it occurred, would likely affect many variables in the system, including the appropriate policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	719	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But the possibility of such a switch does not enter directly into the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	720	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, it is a risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	721	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Let me note that although the real return to short-term government debt is low today, the real return to capital does not appear to have declined meaningfully.	13.0	94.0
201606	722	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, we prefer to interpret the low real rate of return on short-term government debt not as reflecting low real returns throughout the economy, as in the simple New Keynesian model, but instead as an abnormally large liquidity premium on government debt.	13.0	94.0
201606	723	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We sometimes refer to this value as r† to distinguish it from the more commonly discussed r*.	13.0	94.0
201606	724	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A third fundamental is the possibility of recession, perhaps driven in part by a collapse in asset prices—as occurred for the housing crisis during the 2006–09 period—or other factors.	13.0	94.0
201606	725	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We are currently in a “no recession” state, but it is possible that we could switch to a “recession” state.	13.0	94.0
201606	726	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If a switch occurred, all variables would be affected, but, most notably, unemployment would rise substantially.	13.0	94.0
201606	727	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Again, the possibility of such a switch does not enter directly into the forecast because we have no reason to forecast a recession, in light of the data available today.	13.0	94.0
201606	728	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The possibility of a recession is, instead, a risk to the forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	729	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described a very basic set of fundamental factors as following regime-switching stochastic processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	730	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The current configuration is, one, low growth; two, low real rate on short- term government debt; and, three, no recession.	13.0	94.0
201606	731	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Conditional on this configuration, our forecast is the one I described at the beginning of my remarks.	13.0	94.0
201606	732	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The recommended policy rate is then regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	733	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The value of 63 basis points for the policy rate over the forecast horizon could be viewed in terms of a one-year Fisher equation with expected inflation at 2 percent.	13.0	94.0
201606	734	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The value of the real rate in the low-real-rate regime of short-term government debt—the so-called r†— would then have to be the value that would solve this equation.	13.0	94.0
201606	735	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That would be minus 137 basis points.	13.0	94.0
201606	736	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If you look at the ex post real rate, as measured by the one-year nominal Treasury yield less the 12- month Dallas Federal Reserve trimmed mean inflation rate over the past three years, it has been very close to this value.	13.0	94.0
201606	737	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are risks to this forecast in the sense that any of these fundamental factors could switch to alternative values, thus knocking the system out of the current regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	738	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the risks to this forecast aside from those associated with switching in one of the fundamentals?	13.0	94.0
201606	739	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We think a key risk not expressed in the regime-switching part of the description may be on inflation.	13.0	94.0
201606	740	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described a situation in which Phillips-curve influences on inflation are negligible.	13.0	94.0
201606	741	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Low unemployment and generally strong labor markets, despite being in place throughout the forecast horizon, do not put upward pressure on inflation in the forecast we have described.	13.0	94.0
201606	742	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It could be that meaningful Phillips-curve mechanisms return and drive inflation higher even though nothing else about the situation as we have described it has changed.	13.0	94.0
201606	743	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is one risk.	13.0	94.0
201606	744	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, this forecast says little about incoming data on inflation expectations, which, according to market-based measures, seem to be too low to be consistent with the forecast we are describing.	13.0	94.0
201606	745	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The approach presented here also says little about the risk of asset price bubbles, a factor that often enters the actual policy discussion.	13.0	94.0
201606	746	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The forecast values for output growth, inflation, and unemployment in the new St Louis Federal Reserve forecast are only somewhat different from those given under the previous narrative.	13.0	94.0
201606	747	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The main difference in the new approach is in the characterization of the recommended future FOMC policy via the projected policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	748	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In the previous narrative, we had a dogmatic medium- and long-run outcome for the economy expressed in terms of a single long-run steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	749	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In that formulation, all variables tend to trend toward values that are consistent with the assumed long-run outcome.	13.0	94.0
201606	750	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This includes the policy rate, which trended toward a value of 350 basis points, higher than it is today.	13.0	94.0
201606	751	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If the Committee moved at a pace of 25 basis points per year, it would take 14 years to reach such a value.	13.0	94.0
201606	752	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In the new narrative, uncertainty about possible medium- and longer-run outcomes is more explicitly taken into account.	13.0	94.0
201606	753	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The economy does not necessarily converge to a single steady state but, instead, may visit many possible regimes.	13.0	94.0
201606	754	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Regimes can be persistent, as we think the current one may be.	13.0	94.0
201606	755	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The timing of a switch to an alternative regime is viewed as not forecastable, so we simply forecast that the current regime will persist.	13.0	94.0
201606	756	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Policy is regime- dependent, leading to a recommended policy rate path that is essentially flat over the forecast horizon.	13.0	94.0
201606	757	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, the flat policy rate characterization is conditional on no switches occurring.	13.0	94.0
201606	758	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If a switch does occur, then the policy rate would have to change appropriately.	13.0	94.0
201606	759	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is a form of data dependence.	13.0	94.0
201606	760	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We have described some of the risks to this forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	761	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And taking these risks into account, we think that, on balance, the policy rate path may be somewhat higher than the one we are forecasting over the next two and a half years.	13.0	94.0
201606	762	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In this sense, we think there’s some upside risk to our forecast.	13.0	94.0
201606	763	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, by describing the expected policy rate path as essentially flat with some upside risk, and with no presumption about a long-run outcome, we hope we can provide a better description of our view of the current policy situation in this narrative as opposed to the previous formulation.	13.0	94.0
201606	764	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	765	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	766	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13.0	65.0
201606	767	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201606	768	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The data we’ve received since April have been mixed, which leaves considerable uncertainty about what to infer about the pace of progress toward our goals.	13.0	107.0
201606	769	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve found it helpful to think about the range of scenarios that might be plausibly consistent with the mix of data we’ve received so far.	13.0	107.0
201606	770	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At one end of the range is the scenario in which activity continues to increase at the 2 to 2½ percent pace of the past three years, the economy has effectively reached full employment, and resource constraints should soon start to bind, putting stronger upward pressure on inflation and nominal wage growth.	13.0	107.0
201606	771	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data offer some support for this scenario:  Consumer spending rebounded strongly in April and retail sales were strong in May, net exports appear to be exerting less of a drag on activity, and some labor market indicators suggest little slowing.	13.0	107.0
201606	772	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, initial claims for unemployment insurance remain near cyclical lows, and JOLTS job openings are at a cyclical high.	13.0	107.0
201606	773	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, with the unemployment rate having reached the median participant’s estimate of the longer-run rate and the staff estimating that the output gap is closed, it could be argued the economy has reached full employment.	13.0	107.0
201606	774	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And some indications of a step-up in nominal wage growth and higher production costs for businesses could portend that resource constraints should soon start to bind.	13.0	107.0
201606	775	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For example, compensation per hour in the business sector increased 3.7 percent over the past four quarters.	13.0	107.0
201606	776	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	When combined with anemic productivity growth, this has implied an increase in unit labor costs of nearly 3 percent over the same period.	13.0	107.0
201606	777	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this “binding resource constraint” scenario, price pressures should soon become noticeable, with full employment reached and demand growth continuing to exceed supply by a healthy margin.	13.0	107.0
201606	778	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	If the outlook evolves in accordance with this scenario over the second half of this year, we should expect to see the unemployment rate continue to climb.	13.0	107.0
201606	779	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE inflation should move up steadily, nominal wage growth should accelerate, and inflation expectations should begin to move up.	13.0	107.0
201606	780	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the other end of the plausibly consistent range is a scenario in which the recent employment report heralds a downshift in activity and labor market momentum.	13.0	107.0
201606	781	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this “downshift” scenario, growth would move noticeably lower, and resource utilization would flatten out and possibly edge down even though the labor market hasn’t yet fully recovered.	13.0	107.0
201606	782	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of the recent data could be consistent with this scenario.	13.0	107.0
201606	783	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Over the past 12 months, manufacturing output has barely increased, while overall industrial production has fallen about 1 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	784	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Assuming the staff projection for second-quarter GDP growth is correct, even with this morning’s positive read on retail sales, real GDP growth since the end of last summer looks to average only around 1.5 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	785	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The staff’s estimate of 2016 potential output growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	107.0
201606	786	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	If activity continued at this subdued pace, this would suggest no further progress on employment and could jeopardize progress toward our inflation goal.	13.0	107.0
201606	787	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent slowing has been concentrated in the business sector, which may reflect the continued strength in the dollar, weak foreign demand, and recent bouts of financial turbulence.	13.0	107.0
201606	788	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Business fixed investment has declined in the past two quarters and appears to be flat in the current quarter, a highly unusual outcome outside periods around recessions.	13.0	107.0
201606	789	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recently, this weakness appears to have spread to business hiring.	13.0	107.0
201606	790	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Job growth in the past two months averaged only 100,000 after adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike, not meaningfully above current estimates of the breakeven payroll job growth consistent with the unemployment rate remaining constant as the labor force returns to trend.	13.0	107.0
201606	791	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The three-month moving average of the flow of workers from unemployment to employment—a proxy for hiring—has fallen since February.	13.0	107.0
201606	792	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Here, too, such a decline is unusual outside of periods around recessions.	13.0	107.0
201606	793	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	By these measures, both the labor market and the recent GDP data could be construed as signaling that growth is little different from potential.	13.0	107.0
201606	794	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this downshift scenario, activity could turn out to have slowed to a pace that is barely sufficient to keep resource utilization at current levels.	13.0	107.0
201606	795	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, between these two possibilities, we could expect to see a scenario of continued slow progress.	13.0	107.0
201606	796	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In such a scenario, growth would turn out to be somewhat below the 2.3 percent average pace over the past three years but rapid enough to put very gradual upward pressure on resource utilization.	13.0	107.0
201606	797	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, while the economy is near full employment, some slack still exists, as evidenced by the still-depressed employment share of prime-age men that’s still more than 2 percentage points below pre-crisis norms.	13.0	107.0
201606	798	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And supply curves are flat enough to require substantial further increases in resource utilization to push inflation to our 2 percent goal.	13.0	107.0
201606	799	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In this scenario, employment would continue to move higher through some combination of lower unemployment and higher participation; job growth would remain above breakeven levels; but progress on inflation would continue to be slow, with inflation reaching our 2 percent target only at the end of the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	800	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	At the same time, because the forces that have pushed down the neutral rate in recent years appear to be highly persistent, including forces emanating from abroad and very depressed productivity growth, the appropriate path of policy would likely be very shallow, and today’s policy settings would likely be closer to neutral than previously expected.	13.0	107.0
201606	801	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, my baseline forecast is for this continued slow progress scenario, but the data picture so far is sufficiently clouded that it could potentially be consistent with any of these scenarios.	13.0	107.0
201606	802	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a consequence, additional data over the next several months will be particularly valuable to narrowing the bands of uncertainty and allowing us to be more confident about the outlook and the appropriate path for policy.	13.0	107.0
201606	803	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In view of this uncertainty, it’s also important to consider possible risks to inflation and activity.	13.0	107.0
201606	804	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Here we’ve seen recent improvement in conditions supportive of progress on inflation over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	805	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The price of oil, in particular, has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the year.	13.0	107.0
201606	806	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in January.	13.0	107.0
201606	807	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, non-oil import prices look likely to firm this quarter after a year and a half of declines.	13.0	107.0
201606	808	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, the persistently low level of inflation, together with signs of a deterioration in inflation expectations, suggests that downside risks remain.	13.0	107.0
201606	809	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With some survey-based measures of inflation expectations having moved lower in recent years, the preliminary June Michigan measure of inflation expectations touched an all-time low earlier this month.	13.0	107.0
201606	810	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, both swaps and TIPS market-based measures of inflation compensation have recently moved lower again even as the price of oil has moved higher, reversing the correlation that was apparent earlier.	13.0	107.0
201606	811	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the TIPS measure is now close to the low it touched earlier this year.	13.0	107.0
201606	812	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the foreign outlook continues to present downside risks to activity and inflation, as we heard earlier today.	13.0	107.0
201606	813	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Most immediately, there is the possibility of a vote for Britain to leave the EU, which could unsettle financial markets and create a period of uncertainty while the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU is renegotiated.	13.0	107.0
201606	814	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	We can’t rule out a significant adverse reaction to such an outcome in the near term, such as a substantial jump in financial risk premiums.	13.0	107.0
201606	815	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, we cannot dismiss the possible reemergence of risks surrounding China and other emerging market economies.	13.0	107.0
201606	816	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Although capital outflows from China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased, should those exchange rate pressures vis-à-vis the dollar reemerge, financial stress could return—a development that would affect not only China but also emerging markets linked to China via supply chains and commodity exports and, of course, conditions here.	13.0	107.0
201606	817	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	While authorities in China have taken steps to limit the extent of any slowdown, there is an evident tension in policy between reform and stimulus.	13.0	107.0
201606	818	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	And the effect of the stimulus may already be waning.	13.0	107.0
201606	819	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	High and growing levels of corporate debt, excess capacity, and risks in the shadow banking sector could create continued vulnerabilities over the medium term.	13.0	107.0
201606	820	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, global markets are likely to remain fragile for some time.	13.0	107.0
201606	821	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Growth in advanced economies remains highly dependent on extraordinary unconventional monetary policy measures.	13.0	107.0
201606	822	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With conventional policy in many countries continuing to be constrained near the effective lower bound, this skews risks to the downside and may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.	13.0	107.0
201606	823	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, recent work by the staff that was also referred to earlier provides support for the observation that, over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to monetary policy surprises than previously.	13.0	107.0
201606	824	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, while the easing in financial conditions is very welcome, it’s important to recognize that fragility remains and an important reason for the fading of the recent turbulence was the expectation of more-gradual US monetary policy tightening.	13.0	107.0
201606	825	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the policy reaction function, turbulence could well return.	13.0	107.0
201606	826	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	107.0
201606	827	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	828	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201606	829	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201606	830	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Even without the disappointing payroll numbers we received on June 3, we would very likely have waited to decide whether to change the interest rate until our July meeting because of the economic uncertainties for the United Kingdom and the European Union that a decision by the United Kingdom to leave the EU would create and because of the wider economic and financial consequences, including for the United States, that such a decision could cause.	13.0	108.0
201606	831	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Delaying raising the interest rate would have been the right decision.	13.0	108.0
201606	832	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We would, in any case, have been focusing today and tomorrow on what decision we should make in July and in the FOMC meetings that follow.	13.0	108.0
201606	833	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If the decision next Thursday is for Brexit, we will likely need at least another month, and probably more than that, after July to begin to understand the consequences of that decision for the British, European, and other economies.	13.0	108.0
201606	834	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Whatever the referendum decision on British membership in the EU, we will also have to appraise the recent weakening in payroll data.	13.0	108.0
201606	835	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In light of the May payroll data and the downward revision to payrolls in April, the main question we will need to answer in July is whether recent data may be a result of the start of a significant slowdown in employment growth or, rather, reflect the month-to-month noise that is likely to appear in any macroeconomic time series.	13.0	108.0
201606	836	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have only one more set of payroll data to help us choose between these hypotheses.	13.0	108.0
201606	837	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If we conclude that employment growth is slowing significantly, then, in order to judge whether we are at least maintaining the important progress we have made toward our full employment mandate, we will have to pay more attention to the number of additions to payrolls that are needed to maintain full employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	838	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The answer depends on the trend in the labor force participation rate.	13.0	108.0
201606	839	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In their forecast, the staff projects average monthly increases in employment as 160,000 this year, increasing to 190,000 next year, and slowing to 150,000 in 2018.	13.0	108.0
201606	840	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	This path is sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate to 4.3 percent at the end of 2018, with the unemployment rate estimated to decline late in 2018 from 4.5 to 4.3 percent.	13.0	108.0
201606	841	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	From these data, I conclude that, following the publication of the first estimate of 160,000 for the net payroll increase in April, we should have been more vigorous in explaining to the public that although that number was below our forecast and that of others, it was still adequate to prevent increases in unemployment, conditional on plausible behavior in the participation rate—though, of course, that is not the case for the May payroll data.	13.0	108.0
201606	842	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Just to explain, I was amazed that there were so many headlines about adverse data following the 160,000 number.	13.0	108.0
201606	843	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Actually, the data were adverse from the viewpoint of expectations but were not adverse from the viewpoint of employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	844	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One small point before continuing our discussion of our June, July, and later decisions—I wondered, at one stage, whether the adjustment the staff has made to the monetary policy rule used to construct the forecast could be a case of a self-fulfilling forecast, leading the median SEP monetary policy forecast path to come closer to the path implied by the new rule introduced by the staff.	13.0	108.0
201606	845	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I concluded that it probably is not such a case and that, by basing the staff forecast on what appears to be a more plausible path for the funds rate, the staff has made the forecast more helpful for us.	13.0	108.0
201606	846	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, back to my current thinking about July.	13.0	108.0
201606	847	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t believe we should send any strong signal to the markets this month about our July decision, even—or especially—in the form of a Brexit outcome conditional statement.	13.0	108.0
201606	848	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But we should certainly continue to deepen our internal discussion.	13.0	108.0
201606	849	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	First, there are at least four reasons why we might want to make no change in the interest rate at our next meeting.	13.0	108.0
201606	850	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One, the economy might, by then, look significantly weaker than we had hoped and than it does now.	13.0	108.0
201606	851	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Two, we might have concluded, on the basis of recent declines and indicators of the expected inflation rate, particularly in the Michigan series, that the trend of inflation is declining.	13.0	108.0
201606	852	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to add a word about that.	13.0	108.0
201606	853	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve never been quite clear in the Michigan series as to what entitled us to deduct 100 basis points from the average of the Michigan series before we started and then to conclude that what we had was an estimate of expected inflation.	13.0	108.0
201606	854	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think what we may equally likely have had is a bunch of people who took a very long time to absorb what was actually happening, saw that for the past decade or so they’d been overestimating the rate of inflation and are gradually beginning to reduce the rate of inflation that they expect.	13.0	108.0
201606	855	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They have now hit 2.3 percent.	13.0	108.0
201606	856	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got another at least 0.3 percentage point, maybe 0.5, to go until they get to what is actually happening.	13.0	108.0
201606	857	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m not entirely clear about how to relate to the Michigan numbers, although I know how we have treated them for some time.	13.0	108.0
201606	858	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Three, the global economic situation may be problematic, though the staff forecasts offer a stronger global economy than we had feared earlier this year.	13.0	108.0
201606	859	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, four—this is why we might want to make no change at the next meeting—risk-management factors, arising from our proximity to the effective lower bound, would come into play.	13.0	108.0
201606	860	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Second, why might we want to increase the interest rate at our July meeting, thus moving farther along the road to normalization of asset prices and of the economy as a whole?	13.0	108.0
201606	861	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, one reason is, we might conclude—based in part on the higher rates of wage increase that we’ve seen recently and a core PCE price inflation rate that is at about 1.5 percent—that we are close to our targets, that the inflation rate is within close reach of 2 percent, and that we are already at very near full employment.	13.0	108.0
201606	862	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Two, we might want to put the interest rate back into action as a price that affects the timing of investment by increasing the cost of waiting to invest—a point that was made in the literature of the 1980s, notably in Ben Bernanke’s PhD thesis.	13.0	108.0
201606	863	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, three, we might want to increase the distance of the interest rate from the effective lower bound, in particular because it’s far from clear what, on balance, the very low interest rates are buying us.	13.0	108.0
201606	864	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Third, what should we be doing on the research front?	13.0	108.0
201606	865	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, one, we need to continue to work on improving our estimates of r*.	13.0	108.0
201606	866	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, two, we need to continue to analyze the factors that affect r*, such as the rate of technical progress on the capital stock and by asking what factors, including infrastructure, determine the effective capital stock.	13.0	108.0
201606	867	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Here I’m concerned about the fact that we keep asking “What is r*?” without asking “What is it that the rest of the economy could do by changing their policy such that r* would become higher?”	13.0	108.0
201606	868	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That leads to, three, the suggestion for research of quantifying the “only game in town” argument by refining the estimates of the effects on growth of the three arrows—monetary policy, fiscal policy, and structural reforms.	13.0	108.0
201606	869	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And, four, analyzing how much we should take expected foreign economic developments into account.	13.0	108.0
201606	870	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Finally, I want to discuss briefly an issue that is close to a set of issues that I expected at least one participant in the meeting might mention.	13.0	108.0
201606	871	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That participant has already spoken, and he didn’t quite mention the issues I thought he would, but I will continue.	13.0	108.0
201606	872	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I was originally surprised to read and to hear criticisms of data dependency—which one sees in the commentary on what the FOMC is doing all the time—which strikes me as the only way to deal with the uncertainties that the future presents to us.	13.0	108.0
201606	873	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The main disadvantage of data dependency emphasized by critics appears to be that the markets may not know until quite near the meeting, or even until the FOMC’s decision is announced, what the interest rate decision will be.	13.0	108.0
201606	874	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Most market participants appear not to like that, and they express their dislike in the press and in the surveys that the New York Federal Reserve undertakes.	13.0	108.0
201606	875	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, what’s the alternative?	13.0	108.0
201606	876	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Presumably, it’s forward guidance, which carries with it the difficulty of changing the guidance—something we saw in the taper tantrum.	13.0	108.0
201606	877	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, the reason for data dependency is fundamental:  The future is uncertain.	13.0	108.0
201606	878	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s not a whole lot we can do about that.	13.0	108.0
201606	879	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So, one way or the other, modern monetary policy will continue to have to be data dependent.	13.0	108.0
201606	880	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The effect of data dependency on the economy and on market participants depends on the structure of the financial system, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to the economy, and the quality of monetary policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201606	881	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We have to keep working to make monetary policy more effective.	13.0	108.0
201606	882	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Obviously, we’re all doing that, but we should not blame data dependency for the difficulties that uncertainty about the future creates for market participants.	13.0	108.0
201606	883	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	However, I do believe that criticisms of the data dependency of our decisions relate, in large part, to our failure to emphasize to the public and to market participants how uncertain the future is.	13.0	108.0
201606	884	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	One of my reactions to my first SEP was to say that I could not fill in certain entries because I had no idea what the growth rate would be three years from now.	13.0	108.0
201606	885	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, I ended up filling in the form, although I must admit that I didn’t feel any the wiser as to what the future growth rate would be.	13.0	108.0
201606	886	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I believe we need to emphasize our uncertainty about the future, for that way we will be informing the public about the uncertainties that beset our SEP forecast and preferences as well as about our policy decisions.	13.0	108.0
201606	887	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And it will come as no surprise to any of you that I believe we can best do that by including fan charts in the presentations of the SEP results.	13.0	108.0
201606	888	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201606	889	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You weren’t ready for that?	13.0	108.0
201606	890	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I was waiting for it.	13.0	97.0
201606	891	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Oh, good.	13.0	108.0
201606	892	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, you can shut me up very easily.	13.0	108.0
201606	893	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	No, no, no.	13.0	97.0
201606	894	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	More on that in July.	13.0	108.0
201606	895	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13.0	108.0
201606	896	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	For now, the bottom line is that we should leave July open and await information that will, I hope, reduce the uncertainties that we face.	13.0	108.0
201606	897	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That decision—the July decision—is truly data dependent, as it should be.	13.0	108.0
201606	898	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	108.0
201606	899	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	900	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13.0	65.0
201606	901	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	102.0
201606	902	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Setting aside the employment report for the moment, the data since our April meeting have been consistent with continued moderate expansion.	13.0	102.0
201606	903	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, consumer spending has been surprisingly positive, boosted by rising incomes and favorable financial conditions.	13.0	102.0
201606	904	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent readings on inflation have also been encouraging.	13.0	102.0
201606	905	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Core inflation is running at 1.6 percent over the past year, and transitory factors that had been pushing inflation down are receding.	13.0	102.0
201606	906	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, oil is now trading consistently around $50 a barrel.	13.0	102.0
201606	907	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Ignoring the employment report is akin to asking, “Other than that, Mrs.	13.0	102.0
201606	908	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Lincoln, how did you like the play?”	13.0	102.0
201606	909	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job gains in May were modest, and previous months were revised down.	13.0	102.0
201606	910	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, some of the drop-off in May was due to the Verizon strike.	13.0	102.0
201606	911	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But even adjusting for that, the published establishment data suggest a noticeable downward trend in job growth in recent months.	13.0	102.0
201606	912	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the slowdown in job gains seems out of tune with other recent indicators, like initial claims for unemployment insurance and household surveys on labor market conditions.	13.0	102.0
201606	913	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what signal should we take from this?	13.0	102.0
201606	914	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our first step in extracting the signal from the noise is to do a bit of averaging.	13.0	102.0
201606	915	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Payroll gains over the past three months, adjusted for the effects of the Verizon strike, averaged a little more than 125,000 jobs per month.	13.0	102.0
201606	916	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s still a step-down from last year but well ahead of the 80,000 to 100,000 jobs we need to keep up with labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	917	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Work by my staff suggests that even this number likely understates the underlying trend.	13.0	102.0
201606	918	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Exploiting county-level data on weather patterns, they assessed the contribution of monthly variation in local weather conditions to the job numbers.	13.0	102.0
201606	919	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	They found that, once one accounts for the effects of unusual weather patterns as well as the Verizon strike, job gains have averaged closer to 150,000 jobs for the past three months.	13.0	102.0
201606	920	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And the adjusted number for May is only modestly below this pace, as opposed to the downward trend that we see in the unadjusted data.	13.0	102.0
201606	921	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the basis of this analysis and my own forecast for spending growth, I expect to see job gains averaging around 150,000 per month for the remainder of the year—again, after adjusting for the effects of the Verizon workers coming back.	13.0	102.0
201606	922	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, that’s definitely lower than the 230,000 jobs per month we saw last year, but it still means that we’ll be adding something like 1.8 million jobs this year, which, again, is well above the increase in the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	923	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I therefore expect the unemployment rate to drift further below the natural rate over the course of the year, reaching about 4.5 percent by year-end.	13.0	102.0
201606	924	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	With the economy having reached full employment with only 2 percent GDP growth, my staff and I have revisited the issue of the long-run growth rate of potential output.	13.0	102.0
201606	925	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the long run, two factors determine the speed at which the economy can grow in a balanced manner: labor productivity and the size of the labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	926	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we looked over the past 40 years:  Total economy productivity—that is, GDP per hour for the total economy—has typically run between about 1 and 1¼ percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	927	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Since the ’70s, we’ve only deviated from this pace during the information technology boom of the late ’90s and early 2000s.	13.0	102.0
201606	928	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, the crystal ball is hazy about when the next technological revolution will arrive, although I assure you that everyone who works within an hour of me believes it’s already happening.	13.0	102.0
201606	929	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, in the meantime, a reasonable benchmark is that total economy productivity growth in the range of 1 to 1¼ percent is the normal incremental growth that we should expect in the future.	13.0	102.0
201606	930	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This benchmark is consistent with the views expressed by Bob Gordon in his recent book, in my colleague John Fernald’s extensive work along with colleagues here at the Board, in research by the New York Fed, and in the literature on general purpose technologies.	13.0	102.0
201606	931	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Moreover, since educational attainment is unlikely to rise the way it did during much of the 20th century, the future pace of productivity growth will likely be at the lower end of this historical range.	13.0	102.0
201606	932	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	By that I mean not much above 1 percent, and that is my modal forecast for longer-run productivity growth for the total economy.	13.0	102.0
201606	933	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the next ingredient of potential output growth—the labor force: The notable development here is that the world is turning gray.	13.0	102.0
201606	934	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The CBO projects that the labor force in the United States will grow about 0.5 percent per year over the next decade, and that’s a considerable drop from what we’ve experienced in the past 40 years.	13.0	102.0
201606	935	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The transition of women to the labor force is long complete, and baby boomers are already retiring.	13.0	102.0
201606	936	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That means that, unlike the 1970s and ’80s, demographics will hinder rather than boost potential output growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	937	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Putting these two ingredients—about 1 percent total productivity growth and the demographics— together, my new long-run forecast for potential GDP growth is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	938	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is, admittedly, a far cry from the 3 percent rates engrained back from our college days, but demographic trends are difficult to bend, and in many ways the die has already been cast.	13.0	102.0
201606	939	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The slowdown in long-run growth isn’t unique to the United States.	13.0	102.0
201606	940	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We heard about that in the briefing earlier today.	13.0	102.0
201606	941	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In recent research by Kathryn Holston and Thomas Laubach here at the Board and myself, using the Laubach-Williams model, we also find secular declines in potential GDP growth in Canada, the euro area, and the United Kingdom.	13.0	102.0
201606	942	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I should note that we find large declines in the estimates of the natural rate of interest in these regions as well.	13.0	102.0
201606	943	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that brings me to my favorite topic:  r*.	13.0	102.0
201606	944	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic forces link the potential for growth and the natural rate of interest.	13.0	102.0
201606	945	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Along with this more subdued view of the US economy’s longer-run potential growth rate, I’ve lowered my long-run estimate of the natural rate of interest to 1 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	946	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, my projection for the long-run value of the federal funds rate is 3 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	947	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, my views in this regard match those that we saw in the Tealbook.	13.0	102.0
201606	948	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	All in all, I expect the economic expansion to proceed at a moderate pace, with GDP growth a touch under 2 percent this year.	13.0	102.0
201606	949	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Output and unemployment gaps have essentially closed already.	13.0	102.0
201606	950	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with substantial monetary stimulus still in play, I expect these aggregate indicators to overshoot their marks this year.	13.0	102.0
201606	951	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	This necessitates a continued gradual removal of policy accommodation over the next few years to bring output growth back below the rate of potential growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	952	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, my own projection has GDP growth slowing to around 1½ percent next year and in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201606	953	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	With labor markets forecast to be tight for three straight years, I expect inflation pressures to continue to build up and for there to be a modest overshoot by inflation of our 2 percent inflation target in 2018.	13.0	102.0
201606	954	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As a result, I foresee the need to raise the funds rate above the long-run natural rate at the end of 2018 in order to bring the economy back to full employment and push inflation back to our 2 percent objective.	13.0	102.0
201606	955	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	From my estimate of the long-run growth rate, you can already figure out that I’m respondent number 16.	13.0	102.0
201606	956	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have one last comment in terms of President Bullard’s detailed discussion concerning these various regimes.	13.0	102.0
201606	957	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I obviously don’t come to that same conclusion.	13.0	102.0
201606	958	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the things that I find in thinking about these issues is:  Is the macroeconomy fundamentally not behaving the way we would expect it to?	13.0	102.0
201606	959	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m drawn to Jeremy Rudd’s exhibit 4, panel 6—the VAR decomposition of core market-based inflation—or other analysis that Board and other economists have done, which basically shows that core inflation is behaving more or less as you would expect to see in a period of reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations.	13.0	102.0
201606	960	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve seen dramatic increases in employment, declines in unemployment, over the past several years, reflecting, I think, very strong effects of monetary policy in boosting economic growth above potential, working in the way that we would expect to see.	13.0	102.0
201606	961	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see the gaps closing.	13.0	102.0
201606	962	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see, personally, inflation not far from a basic Phillips-curve model.	13.0	102.0
201606	963	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not drawn at this time to see what is broken in our fundamental view of how monetary policy works in terms of affecting aggregate demand, how the Phillips-curve relationship works.	13.0	102.0
201606	964	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, as we know—as you can see in this picture—the data move around.	13.0	102.0
201606	965	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s “noise,”	13.0	102.0
201606	966	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think, as Jeremy referred to it.	13.0	102.0
201606	967	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But these are residuals to any of our equations.	13.0	102.0
201606	968	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And when I look at the estimates of r*, the biggest driver of those, both for the United States and for the other countries in the recent work that we’ve been doing, is declines in long-run growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	969	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I consider that a standard result in pretty much any macroeconomic model that you write down, that if you have slower long-run trend growth, you’re going to have lower real interest rates.	13.0	102.0
201606	970	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think there are a lot of other factors at play, too, and we’ve talked about some of those in terms of a global saving glut, other risks, changes in risk premiums.	13.0	102.0
201606	971	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I guess I’m not feeling, right now, why I would want to abandon this basic framework of how I think about it.	13.0	102.0
201606	972	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I’m not trying to have a debate.	13.0	102.0
201606	973	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just thought I’d respond because I thought those were very interesting remarks.	13.0	102.0
201606	974	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13.0	102.0
201606	975	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	976	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13.0	65.0
201606	977	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Could you just clarify the numbers you used?	13.0	108.0
201606	978	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You used this estimate for natural long-run growth.	13.0	108.0
201606	979	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Assuming that we all live 70 years, which is no longer true, does that mean that income will double in each lifetime?	13.0	108.0
201606	980	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Okay, so you’re asking me a question I can answer and a question that I will get wrong.	13.0	102.0
201606	981	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll do the one I can answer, which is that our estimate of long-run trend growth for GDP is 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	982	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Per capita?	13.0	108.0
201606	983	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	No.	13.0	102.0
201606	984	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, 1 percent productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	985	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m sorry, thank you, 1.6 percent for potential GDP.	13.0	102.0
201606	986	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, 1 percent on productivity and 0.6 percentage point on labor force growth, is how it works out.	13.0	102.0
201606	987	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Roughly 1.05 and 0.55, I think, is what we have.	13.0	102.0
201606	988	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I think about this is, go back to the ’70s and ’80s.	13.0	102.0
201606	989	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	How did we get potential growth at 3 percent?	13.0	102.0
201606	990	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, we basically had this 1.25 percent productivity growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	991	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had a lot of labor force growth.	13.0	102.0
201606	992	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	The reason we think of 3 percent as normal is because the labor force during that period was growing fast.	13.0	102.0
201606	993	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Productivity was bad.	13.0	102.0
201606	994	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s why it was called the productivity slowdown.	13.0	102.0
201606	995	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the other thing is, even within the productivity of that 1¼ percent that we had, some of that was basically increases in human capital per person.	13.0	102.0
201606	996	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Educational attainment was moving up year by year about two- or three-tenths.	13.0	102.0
201606	997	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Today the best estimates from the various economists are that educational attainment per person for the next 5 to 10 years will probably be only adding maybe 0 to 0.1 percentage point to productivity.	13.0	102.0
201606	998	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s how I get to something like 1 to 1.1 percent for productivity growth and something like 0.5 for labor force.	13.0	102.0
201606	999	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So that’s potential GDP of 1.6 percent.	13.0	102.0
201606	1000	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t know how to answer your other question—I’m not going to try to do the math.	13.0	102.0
201606	1001	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Seventy years—you’ll double your income level.	13.0	96.0
201606	1002	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, right.	13.0	102.0
201606	1003	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s all downside risk.	13.0	102.0
201606	1004	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13.0	65.0
201606	1005	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	94.0
201606	1006	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Just to respond a little bit to President Williams, I think that you asked, “Well, what’s broken?”	13.0	94.0
201606	1007	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Our gaps are close to zero, but the policy rate is way below what we would associate with the normal steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	1008	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And I think what we’ve done is struggle with that by saying, “Okay.	13.0	94.0
201606	1009	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The productivity growth rate is moving around,” as you just described.	13.0	94.0
201606	1010	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Or, “Maybe the value of r* is different from what we’re used to.”	13.0	94.0
201606	1011	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And all we’re doing is saying that maybe those are following switching processes instead of mean-reverting processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	1012	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	If you thought r* was low today but is going to revert to the steady- state value, or productivity growth is low today but it’s going to revert, then everything would go back to the old steady state.	13.0	94.0
201606	1013	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then you’d have this upward-sloping path for the policy rate.	13.0	94.0
201606	1014	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What we did is replace those with switching processes.	13.0	94.0
201606	1015	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So you just stay at the low r* or the low productivity for the next two-and-a-half years, and you don’t make a prediction about the long run.	13.0	94.0
201606	1016	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And then you say, “Well, the policy is regime dependent.	13.0	94.0
201606	1017	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So as long as we’re in this regime, this is the best we can do while we’re in the regime.	13.0	94.0
201606	1018	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It may switch in the future, and we’ll certainly look out for that, but we’re not going to be drawing pictures in which it’s going back to some presumed mean in the long run.”	13.0	94.0
201606	1019	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1020	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13.0	65.0
201606	1021	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201606	1022	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like the Tealbook, my modal forecast has not changed much.	13.0	90.0
201606	1023	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I expect growth to be somewhat faster than potential, the unemployment rate to decline below the natural rate, and both core and total PCE inflation rates to be only slightly below 2 percent by the end of next year.	13.0	90.0
201606	1024	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The monetary policy assumption that goes with this forecast is for two increases in the federal funds rate this year and then more frequent increases in subsequent years, as the forecast expects us to hit the inflation target and to exceed full employment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1025	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The same is roughly true of most private forecasters—relatively little change in the outlook since our April meeting.	13.0	90.0
201606	1026	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	A key question is why so little change in the forecast has produced such wide fluctuations in the market perceptions of the appropriate path of monetary policy.	13.0	90.0
201606	1027	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the model forecasts produced by our bank and the Tealbook both changing little, it might plausibly turn to the risks and uncertainties surrounding the forecast as an explanation for market movements.	13.0	90.0
201606	1028	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook did a nice job of considering scenarios that I felt were most relevant to assessing risks.	13.0	90.0
201606	1029	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I found it interesting that the staff viewed the uncertainty surrounding their projection as being quite similar to the average over the past 20 years.	13.0	90.0
201606	1030	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Looking at the first scenario, the “Recession” scenario, seemed to be the right place to start.	13.0	90.0
201606	1031	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I personally think the risk of a recession remains quite low.	13.0	90.0
201606	1032	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think the most recent labor market report was quite disappointing.	13.0	90.0
201606	1033	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The negative surprise on both payroll employment and on labor force participation probably do warrant waiting for more data to assess whether the most recent report is an anomaly.	13.0	90.0
201606	1034	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My current assessment is that it is.	13.0	90.0
201606	1035	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	First-quarter GDP estimates have been moving up, and my forecast for the second quarter is for growth exceeding 2 percent.	13.0	90.0
201606	1036	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	One interpretation of that pattern is that seasonal growth patterns have not been well captured by the BEA, and that averaging over the first half may be more appropriate than focusing on quarterly patterns.	13.0	90.0
201606	1037	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My estimate of average growth for the first half of 2016 is about equal to my estimate of potential, consistent with my view that spending data do not seem to be a harbinger of a broader slowdown.	13.0	90.0
201606	1038	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Spending data also are likely to be buoyed by the easing of financial conditions that we have seen.	13.0	90.0
201606	1039	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With longer-term rates lower, markets are provided a more accommodative financial environment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1040	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Furthermore, initial claims data do not seem to portend widespread concern by employers.	13.0	90.0
201606	1041	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My working assumption is that the most recent employment report reflects the temporary effects of the Verizon strike plus the kind of monthly fluctuation that can occur in view of the error inherent in estimating monthly payroll employment.	13.0	90.0
201606	1042	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Still, additional data will be helpful in determining whether that assessment is correct.	13.0	90.0
201606	1043	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The second scenario that I found relevant was the “Disorderly Brexit” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201606	1044	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with a more adverse scenario than expected by the staff and conditioned on a leave vote, the Tealbook scenario does not expect the unemployment rate to rise back to 5 percent.	13.0	90.0
201606	1045	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Interestingly, on a recent trip to Europe, the central bankers I spoke with were unanimous about the greatest risk to financial stability, and it was not Brexit—it was the electoral process and possible outcome in the United States.	13.0	90.0
201606	1046	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The fact that, a few weeks before the Brexit vote, the big concern of Europeans was not the United Kingdom possibly leaving the European Union but the US elections highlights why using elections to defer monetary policy actions can be tricky and why many in the market think it is unlikely we’ll tighten later in the year, a topic I will return to tomorrow.	13.0	90.0
201606	1047	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	The scenario I am most worried about is the “Weaker Productivity” scenario.	13.0	90.0
201606	1048	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	For reasons I will explain, this is the scenario most likely to result in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201606	1049	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	With growth a little over 2 percent during the recovery, the unemployment rate has been declining much more than we have expected.	13.0	90.0
201606	1050	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is quite possible that growth averaging a bit above 2 percent, as in both my forecast and that of the staff, could result in an unemployment rate even lower than the significant decline below full employment already in the staff forecast, and that’s where the risk of recession enters.	13.0	90.0
201606	1051	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Historically, it is almost unprecedented in such circumstances that the unemployment rate returns just to the natural rate without undershooting it and culminating in a recession.	13.0	90.0
201606	1052	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	My biggest concern is that we could be repeating that pattern.	13.0	90.0
201606	1053	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	90.0
201606	1054	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13.0	65.0
201606	1055	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201606	1056	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My SEP forecast remains close to my December and March submissions.	13.0	104.0
201606	1057	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see real GDP increasing about 2 percent this year, somewhat faster than its potential rate.	13.0	104.0
201606	1058	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I expect the labor market to continue to tighten, with unemployment declining to 4½ percent by the end of this year and remaining near there in 2017 and ’18.	13.0	104.0
201606	1059	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see core inflation coming in this year at 1.6 percent and moving up to 2 percent by 2018 as the economy tightens further and as the effects of past dollar appreciation and the plunge in oil prices fade.	13.0	104.0
201606	1060	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I wrote down two rate increases for this year and three for each of the next two years, admittedly with low levels of confidence.	13.0	104.0
201606	1061	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Over the past three years, a strong labor market has allowed the Committee to look through sometimes volatile readings on GDP.	13.0	104.0
201606	1062	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Payroll growth averaged well over 200,000 per month from the beginning of 2013 even through the latest readings in May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1063	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate declined over that period by more than 3 percent, including three-tenths this year and eight-tenths over the past 12 months through May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1064	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And, like others, I have taken the view that the stronger labor market data, not the GDP data, are the better measure of the underlying strength and cyclical position of the economy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1065	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The strength of the labor market and the quickly tightening unemployment gap provided perhaps the best argument for raising the federal funds rate last December for me.	13.0	104.0
201606	1066	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And now payroll growth has hit a soft patch, with April and May jobs reports averaging about 100,000 jobs per month on a strike-adjusted basis, and, at this point, the range of plausible explanations for the apparent sudden weakening in payrolls is quite wide.	13.0	104.0
201606	1067	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	First, it could be just noise, resembling the temporary slumps we have seen in previous years.	13.0	104.0
201606	1068	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Six-month average payroll job growth plunged well below 200,000 in 2012 and then recovered, and there were other weak periods in 2013 and 2014 as well, but those too were followed by payroll growth well above 200,000.	13.0	104.0
201606	1069	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Second, alternatively, the April and May readings could be a sign that growth from now on will be accompanied by smaller, but still significant, job gains, which would point to stronger productivity growth.	13.0	104.0
201606	1070	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And a third and more negative possibility is that it could turn out to be a sign of weakening demand.	13.0	104.0
201606	1071	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Of course, it is very hard to have much conviction about which of those explanations is the right one at this point.	13.0	104.0
201606	1072	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My baseline, though, is a combination of the first two explanations rather than the last.	13.0	104.0
201606	1073	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In this view, job growth has probably slowed but not nearly as much as suggested by the April and May job reports.	13.0	104.0
201606	1074	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Survey measures of both employers and individuals concerning the ease of filling or finding jobs indicate a healthy labor market.	13.0	104.0
201606	1075	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Wages are increasing faster than the combination of productivity and inflation, leading to rising real unit labor costs, which is consistent with the uptick in the labor share of income over the past year.	13.0	104.0
201606	1076	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	With unemployment roughly at the natural rate, wages now clearly if gradually rising, and indicators suggesting at most a modest margin of slack, perhaps we may see the arrival of slower payroll job growth as firms begin to respond to higher labor costs.	13.0	104.0
201606	1077	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	It is comforting to see a rebound in activity for Q2 and upward revisions for Q1 as well.	13.0	104.0
201606	1078	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Consumption increased robustly in April, led by strong retail and auto sales, and auto sales remained strong in May.	13.0	104.0
201606	1079	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Today’s strong retail sales report represents another welcome positive note, and conditions are quite supportive of strong consumption, including solid real income gains, a high ratio of household wealth to income, and a healthy level of consumer confidence.	13.0	104.0
201606	1080	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Investment has been weak, however, with business fixed investment falling in Q4 and Q1 and expected to edge down further in the current quarter.	13.0	104.0
201606	1081	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	A portion of the weakness stems from the lower oil prices, but the softness outside of the oil sector is troubling, as it suggests continued business expectations of weak demand and also a weaker path for capital deepening and, hence, the path of productivity.	13.0	104.0
201606	1082	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation seems to be firming a bit, with core at 1.6 percent over the past 12 months through April, up a little bit from the prior year.	13.0	104.0
201606	1083	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	And, of course, core is still being held down by the indirect effects of lower oil prices and, more importantly, the declines due to the strength of the dollar.	13.0	104.0
201606	1084	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Looking through those factors, I see underlying inflation as being fairly close to 2 percent, and the fading of those influences should move core and total inflation to 2 percent over the medium term, particularly as resource utilization tightens further.	13.0	104.0
201606	1085	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation expectations, however, continue to raise concerns, and this underscores the need to actually achieve 2 percent inflation.	13.0	104.0
201606	1086	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Productivity growth has been anemic, to be generous about it.	13.0	104.0
201606	1087	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I expect productivity to rise only gradually, which is one reason why I expect the unemployment rate to decline over the remainder of the year to 4½ percent.	13.0	104.0
201606	1088	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I see the domestic risks as nearly balanced despite the weaker labor data.	13.0	104.0
201606	1089	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The risks posed from abroad remain to the downside, and although they have diminished and markets have calmed substantially since the turmoil of the first two months of the year, if the Brexit vote is to leave, there may be ramifications for our economy and for the path of policy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1090	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Inflation and growth remain low in many European economies and in Japan.	13.0	104.0
201606	1091	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	While China’s stimulus measures should support growth in the near term, the ongoing buildup of debt there is worrisome, and there’s also remaining uncertainty about China’s exchange rate policy.	13.0	104.0
201606	1092	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Despite our increase in the federal funds rate in December, financial conditions have actually eased somewhat on net since then, with interest rates down, the dollar down, and equity prices up.	13.0	104.0
201606	1093	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In part, these developments reflect the market’s expectation that the Committee’s withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be even slower than had been expected.	13.0	104.0
201606	1094	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	The changing expectations reflect the ongoing learning of how low rates need to be to achieve our mandate, and I suspect that the learning process on that score is not yet complete.	13.0	104.0
201606	1095	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In the meantime, I have lowered my estimate of the long-run federal funds rate to 2.75 percent.	13.0	104.0
201606	1096	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To wrap up, while I do expect both spending and labor market data to remain solid for the next few quarters, the weaker recent labor market data suggest reason for caution in the near term.	13.0	104.0
201606	1097	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	104.0
201606	1098	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	104.0
201606	1099	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1100	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13.0	65.0
201606	1101	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	103.0
201606	1102	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Outside of the services sector, economic growth remains subdued in the Tenth District.	13.0	103.0
201606	1103	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Job growth is weak in areas dependent on energy production and manufacturing, while job growth continues to be relatively strong in areas concentrated in service sectors.	13.0	103.0
201606	1104	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Although job growth in the District continues to lag the nation, gains in service-sector employment have led to a modest improvement in overall District growth in recent months.	13.0	103.0
201606	1105	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The housing market in the region continues to strengthen.	13.0	103.0
201606	1106	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Housing starts have improved notably this year, and home prices continue to rise as inventories have tightened.	13.0	103.0
201606	1107	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Mortgage delinquency rates also have trended lower except for energy-concentrated counties.	13.0	103.0
201606	1108	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Despite recent increases in energy prices, financial stress for District energy companies continues.	13.0	103.0
201606	1109	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Recently, four large energy firms headquartered in the region filed for bankruptcy, and credit ratings for several others have been marked lower.	13.0	103.0
201606	1110	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, past-due loans at our banks with energy exposures have been increasing and rose sharply in the first quarter of this year.	13.0	103.0
201606	1111	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, the District’s agricultural economy remains relatively weak, although futures prices for some key agricultural commodities have increased in the past few weeks, primarily because of supply disruptions in South America.	13.0	103.0
201606	1112	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Even so, farm income for 2016 is expected to be subdued.	13.0	103.0
201606	1113	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to the national outlook, the May employment report was a surprise and has given me pause for how to interpret its signal.	13.0	103.0
201606	1114	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Clearly, manufacturing and the energy sector are still shedding jobs, and the question remains whether these adjustments are going to spill over more aggressively into the service sectors.	13.0	103.0
201606	1115	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I take some reassurance from broader labor market measures.	13.0	103.0
201606	1116	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the Kansas City Federal Reserve Labor Market Conditions Indicators report two conditions being better than average in terms of the overall level of activity.	13.0	103.0
201606	1117	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The other component, though, which captures momentum or the pace of improvement and is highly correlated with the Board staff’s LMCI, has declined since January, although it’s still a bit above its historical average.	13.0	103.0
201606	1118	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Whether the recent slowing reflects demographics or a slowing in activity will take time to determine.	13.0	103.0
201606	1119	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, the picture for aggregate demand, at least for the consumer, is quite positive.	13.0	103.0
201606	1120	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The University of Michigan consumers’ assessment of current economic conditions is at its highest levels since July 2005.	13.0	103.0
201606	1121	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	We’ve seen improvements in recent consumption data, such as retail sales and autos.	13.0	103.0
201606	1122	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Household balance sheets also continue to strengthen, and wage growth has been steadily increasing.	13.0	103.0
201606	1123	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The median measure of wage growth in the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s wage tracker, which tracks wage gains for individuals from one year to the next, is rising at its fastest rate since the crisis.	13.0	103.0
201606	1124	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	The overall distribution has also shifted higher as the 25th and 75th percentiles hit post-recession highs.	13.0	103.0
201606	1125	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of my real GDP forecast, I have marked it down modestly in 2016 and 2017 but otherwise expect growth to be slightly above trend.	13.0	103.0
201606	1126	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of risks, the decline in corporate profits, elevated inventory levels, and weak business fixed investment all suggest the corporate sector is facing some headwinds.	13.0	103.0
201606	1127	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, core inflation looks to have firmed, increasing 2.1 percent in the first quarter relative to the prior quarter at an annualized rate.	13.0	103.0
201606	1128	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	And I expect it to remain near 2 percent for the remainder of the year.	13.0	103.0
201606	1129	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	An interesting anecdote from one of our directors who noted that, as a result of lower margins in his retail business, his firm has hired a consultant to assist with implementing targeted price increases.	13.0	103.0
201606	1130	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	This is the first such report I’ve heard related to raising prices.	13.0	103.0
201606	1131	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	With the economy above full employment, output growth expected to increase faster than trend, rising wages, and the increase in commodity prices, I see support for inflation in the period ahead.	13.0	103.0
201606	1132	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to watch the lower longer-term inflation expectations, both market- and consumer- based measures, for signals.	13.0	103.0
201606	1133	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	But more broadly, in my view, current inflation rates seem consistent with price stability.	13.0	103.0
201606	1134	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13.0	103.0
201606	1135	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1136	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13.0	65.0
201606	1137	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1138	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to improve, but there has been some deceleration in overall growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1139	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 5 percent in April, with the bulk of the increase arising from higher labor force participation as employment growth remained solid.	13.0	999.0
201606	1140	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Our manufacturing index nudged back into positive territory, but most of the subindexes, such as those for new orders and shipments, remained slightly negative.	13.0	999.0
201606	1141	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturers, however, continue to retain an optimistic view, with the future general activity index at 29.8, which is exactly its nonrecessionary average, and all future subindexes remain solidly in positive territory.	13.0	999.0
201606	1142	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Like the nation, my region’s manufacturing activity may have bottomed out.	13.0	999.0
201606	1143	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Nonmanufacturing activity in the District continues to grow modestly at a somewhat slower-than-historical rate as reflected by our Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey headline activity index, which ticked up to 18.2 in May.	13.0	999.0
201606	1144	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Like our manufacturers, area service providers remain relatively optimistic with respect to future activity.	13.0	999.0
201606	1145	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Our Beige Book contacts reported a slight-to-modest improvement in economic conditions.	13.0	999.0
201606	1146	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Homebuilders have reported that economic activity increased only slightly during a somewhat soggy—some would say quite soggy—May.	13.0	999.0
201606	1147	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Permits have leveled off in the multifamily sector of the market, but single-family housing is showing signs of accelerated activity.	13.0	999.0
201606	1148	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	House prices are appreciating at a moderate pace, growing at less than half of the US average.	13.0	999.0
201606	1149	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Only in the Philadelphia metro area could one classify the housing market as vibrant.	13.0	999.0
201606	1150	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Consumers continue to spend at a modest clip, and the growth rate of bank lending has accelerated.	13.0	999.0
201606	1151	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In our recent survey of labor market conditions, one-third of responding firms in the region indicated that it was harder to retain workers, as opposed to only 5 percent who found it easier.	13.0	999.0
201606	1152	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Additionally, 44 percent indicated they were increasing wages for select job categories, while 15 percent indicated they were increasing wages across the board.	13.0	999.0
201606	1153	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	One-half indicated they would be increasing employment, and a majority intended to increase wages for new hires.	13.0	999.0
201606	1154	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thus, our contacts’ responses are consistent with the modest acceleration in wage growth occurring nationally and much of what we are seeing in the JOLTS data.	13.0	999.0
201606	1155	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Overall, the Philadelphia region should see steady, if unspectacular, growth, and contacts are generally upbeat about the future.	13.0	999.0
201606	1156	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, the latest employment report is a cause for concern.	13.0	999.0
201606	1157	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	It is also a bit puzzling, as economic activity appeared to have strengthened of late.	13.0	999.0
201606	1158	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The two series seem a bit disconnected, with robust employment and weak demand in Q1 and a pickup in activity and a weakening in employment in the current quarter.	13.0	999.0
201606	1159	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Job openings in April were at historic highs, and unemployed workers continue to find jobs at a healthy pace.	13.0	999.0
201606	1160	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In any event, labor market behavior will weigh heavily on my views of appropriate monetary policy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1161	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	My forecast of real economic activity is fairly consistent with that of the staff and is little changed from the one I made in March.	13.0	999.0
201606	1162	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	An important assumption underlying my view is that the labor force participation rate will continue to be largely governed by secular forces and will continue to decline over my forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1163	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I don’t believe that the recent decline in the labor force participation rate is an indicator of a significant weakening in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1164	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I therefore project that the unemployment rate will hold steady over the remainder of the year before declining and remaining at 4.4 percent over the last two years of the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1165	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I expect that output growth will accelerate over the remainder of the year, averaging around 2 percent before rising slightly to 2.3 percent in 2017 and returning to approximately trend after that.	13.0	999.0
201606	1166	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	My view on inflation is that we will see a path that returns to target a bit faster than the path presented in the Tealbook, perhaps by the end of the year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1167	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	With unemployment falling below its natural rate, oil prices rising, and a fairly stable dollar, I don’t believe price increases will be delayed for much longer.	13.0	999.0
201606	1168	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	That viewpoint drives me to anticipate two additional rate hikes this year and then increases of 1 percent in both 2017 and 2018, leaving the funds rate slightly below my 3.25 percent longer-run neutral level.	13.0	999.0
201606	1169	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thus, I believe that accommodation should not be fully withdrawn by the end of the forecast horizon, and that normalization should proceed gradually.	13.0	999.0
201606	1170	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1171	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	13.0	65.0
201606	1172	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	110.0
201606	1173	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Starting with energy:  As you all know, the price of oil has firmed at $50 a barrel.	13.0	110.0
201606	1174	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This reflects an expectation that global supply and demand will get into rough balance by the early part of 2017.	13.0	110.0
201606	1175	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	There are those who predict it will happen sooner, in the latter half of ’16, and those who expect it will be later.	13.0	110.0
201606	1176	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	The point is, the trend is clear—we’re heading toward balance.	13.0	110.0
201606	1177	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This balance has been artificially accelerated, though, in the past few months by recent outages, particularly in Nigeria and Canada, but this balancing trend continues and is particularly underpinned by expected demand growth of approximately 1.2 million barrels a day in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1178	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of this trend, our contacts suggest the price of oil should continue to firm in 2016 and ’17.	13.0	110.0
201606	1179	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking beyond that to 2018 through 2020, our base case is that the price of oil is likely to gravitate up to between $70 and $80 a barrel, with a spike risk as high as $100 a barrel—again, 2018 to 2020.	13.0	110.0
201606	1180	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	As we’ve discussed before, long-lived projects over the past few years have been shelved or put on hold by most major oil companies.	13.0	110.0
201606	1181	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	These projects take as long as 5 to 10 years to complete but have production lives in excess of 20 years.	13.0	110.0
201606	1182	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	These projects fundamentally increase global oil supply as opposed to shale projects, which tend to rapidly decline over the first three years of production.	13.0	110.0
201606	1183	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking at shale, $50 oil is helpful, but many shale properties still will not be viable at this price and will remain dormant.	13.0	110.0
201606	1184	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	On the basis of our discussions with contacts in the industry, we think that prices are going to need to move up toward $60 and higher in order to spur a meaningful increase in deployment of rigs.	13.0	110.0
201606	1185	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This is why, for the time being, we’re likely to see more bankruptcies and restructurings in the energy sector for the remainder of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1186	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Turning to the District, then, this is the first time since I’ve been coming here that the headwinds from energy for this District are now beginning to dissipate.	13.0	110.0
201606	1187	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In fact, we have now increased our jobs growth forecast for Texas, which was ½ to 1 percent—we’ve now increased it to 1½ percent in 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1188	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This compares with 1.3 percent job growth in 2015.	13.0	110.0
201606	1189	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin are continuing to grow and benefit from continued migration of people and firms to the state of Texas.	13.0	110.0
201606	1190	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Houston also has positive migration trends, but those trends have not been sufficient to offset headwinds from energy.	13.0	110.0
201606	1191	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing in Dallas, San Antonio, and Austin remains strong.	13.0	110.0
201606	1192	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Housing prices in Houston we believe declined in the first quarter of 2016.	13.0	110.0
201606	1193	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	As with the nation, manufacturing in the Eleventh District continues to be weak, but the service sector is showing steady, moderate growth.	13.0	110.0
201606	1194	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking at a cross section of Texas-based companies that operate throughout the United States, they are reporting, despite the retail sales report today, a modest slowing in consumer spending in the month of May.	13.0	110.0
201606	1195	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Exceptions to this slowing include beauty, health care, and some consumer staples, but as these companies reported last month, they are seeing a consumer with improving capacity to spend but becoming more cautious, possibly due to political uncertainty, but they haven’t been quite able to figure it out.	13.0	110.0
201606	1196	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Many companies are also quick to cite increases in regulation and rules—at the national, state, and local levels—which are impediments to their efforts to build their businesses.	13.0	110.0
201606	1197	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	They particularly cite the effect of new overtime rules, which, combined with disruption, are causing them to explore much more fully the use of technology, which allows them to better control and even reduce their head count.	13.0	110.0
201606	1198	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I think this is a growing trend we are seeing.	13.0	110.0
201606	1199	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Others cite the challenge of disruptive competitors.	13.0	110.0
201606	1200	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Most of them that don’t make profits have unlimited sources of capital—Amazon is a good example—and basically make no incremental margin but offer convenience and dynamic daily pricing that could be changed at any point during the day, and many companies are struggling with how to deal with this threat, which also is giving them pause.	13.0	110.0
201606	1201	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In response to sluggish demand and this high threat of disruption, many companies we speak with are now much more cautious about new capital spending and expanding capacity.	13.0	110.0
201606	1202	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Except for skilled trades, such as nursing, technology, and building trades, most companies we talk to report very little in the way of wage pressure or trouble finding an ample supply of new employees for hire.	13.0	110.0
201606	1203	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Looking to the outlook and the SEP, I have not made major changes to my economic projections since those I submitted in March.	13.0	110.0
201606	1204	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Our GDP forecast for 2016 is the same as the Tealbook, and it is based on the expectation of a strong consumer.	13.0	110.0
201606	1205	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We have a little bit higher path of unemployment in the out-years, probably due to our expectation of weaker growth.	13.0	110.0
201606	1206	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Our breakeven job estimate for job growth necessary to keep the unemployment rate constant over the next 12 months is now at approximately 120,000 jobs per month, on the basis of the view that much of the decline in the participation rate from 2007 to today reflectedthe aging of the workforce.	13.0	110.0
201606	1207	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Further, by 2024, we expect this participation rate to decline to below 61 percent on the basis of continued aging in the workforce, which, as we’ve discussed earlier, is going to lower, in our view, potential GDP growth in the future.	13.0	110.0
201606	1208	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Finally, the Dallas trimmed mean inflation rate continues to run between 1.8 and 1.9 percent.	13.0	110.0
201606	1209	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	It’s been very consistent and gives us continued confidence that we will reach our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term.	13.0	110.0
201606	1210	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We continue to expect growth outside the United States to, on balance, create risk to our US GDP forecast.	13.0	110.0
201606	1211	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In particular, I am concerned about overcapacity outside the United States, particularly in China; aging demographics in all advanced economies; and high levels of debt to GDP, particularly again in China.	13.0	110.0
201606	1212	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Weak growth prospects, both here and overseas, and strong demand for safe assets, as we’ve all discussed, have put greater downward pressure on the neutral rate.	13.0	110.0
201606	1213	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I believe we will continue to be vulnerable to periodic bouts of tighter financial conditions—in the short run, potentially from Brexit; and in the longer run because of turmoil in China and beyond this year into 2017.	13.0	110.0
201606	1214	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We think the pressures for a devaluation there are building.	13.0	110.0
201606	1215	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Again, it won’t happen this year, but pressures are building into next year, and we’re seeing that as highly likely, on the basis of contacts that we’re speaking to.	13.0	110.0
201606	1216	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	That will have some jarring effect, depending on the size of the devaluation when it happens.	13.0	110.0
201606	1217	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Accordingly, my SEP funds rate path is slightly shallower than my submission in March.	13.0	110.0
201606	1218	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you.	13.0	110.0
201606	1219	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1220	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13.0	65.0
201606	1221	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1222	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Economic activity and sentiment in the Fourth District remain consistent with continued moderate growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1223	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Bank’s diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions moved down slightly from plus 16 at the time of our April meeting to plus 9, a reading indicating moderate growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1224	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	After exhibiting some deterioration in the first quarter, District manufacturing has stabilized, and our manufacturing contacts expect further improvement in the months ahead.	13.0	999.0
201606	1225	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Steel producers were encouraged by recent increases in product prices but remain uncertain about the sustainability of those increases.	13.0	999.0
201606	1226	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Due to recent increases in oil prices, some projects in the energy sector that had been placed on hold are now moving forward.	13.0	999.0
201606	1227	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturers are investing, but mainly in maintenance and process improvement equipment.	13.0	999.0
201606	1228	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some contacts said that reluctance on the part of businesses to invest in large-scale capacity-expanding projects reflects concern about the overall longer-run direction in the economy and not concerns about the economy in the near term or their own firm’s performance, which has been strong.	13.0	999.0
201606	1229	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In their view, a rise in interest rates would not deter spending plans.	13.0	999.0
201606	1230	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	One contact in the commercial real estate sector said that while low interest rates were helpful to his clients in terms of their capital investment, low rates were not a primary motivator.	13.0	999.0
201606	1231	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Rather, the regulatory and political environments were seen as stronger headwinds to capital spending than potentially rising interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201606	1232	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Labor markets in the District remain healthy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1233	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Federal Reserve staff estimates that District employment grew 1.2 percent over the year ending in April.	13.0	999.0
201606	1234	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate has remained low and stable, with the April estimate at 5.1 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1235	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District results of the special System inquiry on employment, wages, and labor shortage are comparable to the averages across all Districts.	13.0	999.0
201606	1236	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More than twice as many firms expect to increase rather than decrease employment over the next 12 months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1237	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Nearly 40 percent of Fourth District firms report that it’s getting harder to retain workers, somewhat higher than the national average.	13.0	999.0
201606	1238	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Nearly two-thirds of firms hiring expect to increase starting wages for some or selected job categories, and nearly three-fourths said they couldn’t find qualified job candidates to fill at least some of their open positions.	13.0	999.0
201606	1239	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	A shortage of applicants plus a lack of skills of those who do apply appear to be the main factors driving the shortage.	13.0	999.0
201606	1240	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Wage levels don’t appear to be the key factor.	13.0	999.0
201606	1241	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The survey results are in line with the anecdotal reports we’ve been receiving from business contacts for quite some time and with the recent National Federation of Independent Business survey.	13.0	999.0
201606	1242	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The NFIB survey indicates that worker availability has become increasingly constrained over the expansion and is now at the level consistent with past expansion peaks.	13.0	999.0
201606	1243	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I interpret these results as suggesting that labor supply issues are having a significant effect on labor markets, both at the District and national levels.	13.0	999.0
201606	1244	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, the disappointing May jobs report got my attention.	13.0	999.0
201606	1245	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some of the weakness in May reflects the Verizon strike.	13.0	999.0
201606	1246	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Some of the downward revisions to May and April reflect revised seasonal adjustment factors.	13.0	999.0
201606	1247	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Even so, the report indicates weaker employment growth than we’ve been seeing.	13.0	999.0
201606	1248	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Averaging through the past three months and adjusting for the strike, the average increase for payrolls is 120,000 jobs per month.	13.0	999.0
201606	1249	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	This is a step-down from the more than 200,000 per month gains we saw over last year and earlier this year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1250	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	But let’s keep this in perspective.	13.0	999.0
201606	1251	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	One thing we have learned over this expansion is that we shouldn’t take too much signal from one month’s report.	13.0	999.0
201606	1252	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Payroll growth slowed in March 2015, early in 2014, and late in 2013, but these episodes did not ultimately signal a reversal in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1253	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More recently, you might recall that last summer we were concerned about a couple of weaker payroll reports as well, but then payroll growth strengthened.	13.0	999.0
201606	1254	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Cleveland staff analysis documents that in the midst of an ongoing expansion, it’s not unusual to see employment growth slow down for a brief period and then kick back up on a sustained basis.	13.0	999.0
201606	1255	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In addition, we should be expecting some slowdown in the pace of job growth as the economy nears full employment.	13.0	999.0
201606	1256	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The bigger surprise may have been the very strong reports that came earlier this year, which seemed out of sync with the weaker output growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1257	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Now output growth is picking up while payroll growth is slowing.	13.0	999.0
201606	1258	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Job growth over the past three months exceeds the 75,000 to 120,000 per month range of trend growth estimates from various models.	13.0	999.0
201606	1259	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	So even if the reduced current pace is sustained, it will be sufficient to put further downward pressure on the unemployment rate.	13.0	999.0
201606	1260	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Finally, other labor market data do not suggest a marked deterioration of the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1261	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Significant slowdowns in employment growth are usually accompanied by a marked rise in unemployment claims.	13.0	999.0
201606	1262	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Instead, initial jobless claims are close to cyclical lows, and continuing claims are the lowest they’ve been in over a decade.	13.0	999.0
201606	1263	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The April Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey was positive, with the job openings rate at a record high and the quits rate near pre-recession levels.	13.0	999.0
201606	1264	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, just as I discount taking a strong signal from May payrolls, I don’t read the sharp drop in the unemployment rate last month as indicating a significant tightening in the labor market.	13.0	999.0
201606	1265	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The drop reflects not only a decline in unemployment, but also an outsized decline in the participation rate.	13.0	999.0
201606	1266	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In light of the month-to-month volatility, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a reversal in participation in the near term.	13.0	999.0
201606	1267	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In constructing my SEP for this round, I decided to avoid erring on the side of reading too much into a single jobs report.	13.0	999.0
201606	1268	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions, household balance sheets that have improved greatly since the recession, continued improvement in labor markets, and low oil prices.	13.0	999.0
201606	1269	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	First-quarter output growth was weak, but incoming data indicate it was not as weak as originally estimated.	13.0	999.0
201606	1270	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Many of the nowcasts of second-quarter growth suggest it will rebound to between 2 and 2½ percent, led by a strong pickup in consumer spending.	13.0	999.0
201606	1271	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect housing to continue to improve and to support growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1272	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Business investment has been quite weak, but I believe it will pick up modestly over the forecast horizon, in line with overall growth.	13.0	999.0
201606	1273	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On balance, I slightly marked down my growth forecast for 2016 to recognize the relatively weak first quarter, but otherwise I made little change to my growth, unemployment, and inflation projections since the March SEP.	13.0	999.0
201606	1274	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Overall, I expect growth to be slightly above trend over the next couple of years, which will support further improvement in labor markets and a gradual return of inflation to our targeted 2 percent over the forecast horizon.	13.0	999.0
201606	1275	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the economy is at maximum employment from the standpoint of what monetary policy can do, and I expect a slowing in the pace of labor market gains compared with last year and earlier this year.	13.0	999.0
201606	1276	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	By the end of 2018, I project that the economy will be near its steady state.	13.0	999.0
201606	1277	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	We’re already seeing acceleration in some of the wage measures like average hourly earnings, in line with anecdotal reports of increasing wage pressures across a range of industries.	13.0	999.0
201606	1278	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Inflation measures have gradually risen as the effects of previous declines in oil prices and the strengthening of the dollar have faded, consistent with the dynamics anticipated by the FOMC.	13.0	999.0
201606	1279	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Headline PCE and CPI inflation moved up from the very low levels reported last year, and they’ve been stable at a little more than 1 percent in recent months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1280	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Measures of core inflation have also remained at levels above last year’s lows, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI measure has continued to edge up, reaching nearly 2½ percent in April, its highest level since April 2009.	13.0	999.0
201606	1281	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Stable inflation expectations are an important component of inflation dynamics.	13.0	999.0
201606	1282	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	At this point, I view inflation expectations as reasonably well anchored and expect them to remain so, but I am monitoring readings carefully.	13.0	999.0
201606	1283	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Longer-run inflation expectations in the preliminary June Michigan survey notably fell to 2.3 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1284	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Analysis by the Cleveland Federal Reserve staff indicates that the Michigan expectation series is fairly noisy from month to month, so it’s too soon to say whether the recent softness is signaling the beginning of a more pronounced and sustained decline in expectations, but this certainly does bear watching.	13.0	999.0
201606	1285	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Better news comes from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	13.0	999.0
201606	1286	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In May, the survey’s median 10-year PCE inflation measure moved back up to 2 percent, and the 10-year CPI inflation measure increased to 2.2 percent.	13.0	999.0
201606	1287	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Our bank’s five-year, five-year-forward measure of inflation expectations, which is based on a model that incorporates survey measures of expectations as well as market data on nominal Treasury yields and inflation swaps, has been stable at about 1.9 percent in recent months.	13.0	999.0
201606	1288	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	As usual, there are risks associated with my forecast, but I see the risks as roughly balanced at this point.	13.0	999.0
201606	1289	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Should inflation expectations show a more significant downward move, this would pose a downside risk to my inflation projection.	13.0	999.0
201606	1290	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	On the other hand, too slow a withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation while unemployment continues to decline has the potential to create upside risks to inflation over the medium run.	13.0	999.0
201606	1291	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Risks to financial stability associated with very low interest rates appear so far to be contained.	13.0	999.0
201606	1292	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect them to remain so, provided we gradually normalize interest rates.	13.0	999.0
201606	1293	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	However, failure to do so increases these risks.	13.0	999.0
201606	1294	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I expect financial market volatility to continue to increase as the United Kingdom’s June 23 vote about whether to leave the European Union approaches.	13.0	999.0
201606	1295	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the United Kingdom votes to stay, I expect this volatility to be short lived, with no implications for the medium-run outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1296	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the United Kingdom votes to exit, this volatility could be longer lasting.	13.0	999.0
201606	1297	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If it were to develop into a more general tightening of credit conditions, it would have implications for the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1298	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Given my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon remains appropriate, as the economy continues to make progress on our dual- mandate goals.	13.0	999.0
201606	1299	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The timing of the rate increase and the overall slope of that gradual path will depend on how the economy and forecasts evolve.	13.0	999.0
201606	1300	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Reflecting the slightly weaker growth forecast for 2016, my federal funds rate path is slightly shallower than in my March projection.	13.0	999.0
201606	1301	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I do not think the Committee is “behind the curve” yet, but I am seriously concerned that we will forestall rate increases for too long because of the uncertainties clouding the outlook from meeting to meeting even as we continue to make cumulative progress on our goals.	13.0	999.0
201606	1302	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	An abundance of caution might suggest waiting for more clarity before acting.	13.0	999.0
201606	1303	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	However, that depends on which risk you’re taking into account.	13.0	999.0
201606	1304	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Waiting too long to act in the hope that things will get clarified risks waiting too long, and so increasing the risk to financial stability and raising the potential of overshooting, requiring sharper rate increases in the future—an eventuality that poses its own set of risks to the outlook.	13.0	999.0
201606	1305	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	It also puts at risk our future ability to use the nontraditional monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve developed to deal with the recent financial crisis and recession.	13.0	999.0
201606	1306	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If we fail to glacially navigate back toward a more normal policy stance, I believe there’s considerable chance that these tools will effectively be off the table because they will have been deemed by the public as ultimately ineffective.	13.0	999.0
201606	1307	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I know this is not the usual sort of risk we consider, but it does weigh on my mind as I contemplate appropriate policy.	13.0	999.0
201606	1308	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	999.0
201606	1309	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1310	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13.0	65.0
201606	1311	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201606	1312	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Relative to our previous round, the reports from my directors and other business contacts were a mixture of small positives and negatives.	13.0	91.0
201606	1313	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Overall, the tone was quite similar to my discussions prior to recent FOMC meetings, and on balance their comments seem consistent with growth proceeding along at the 2 percent or so pace that we’ve experienced over the past year.	13.0	91.0
201606	1314	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Starting with the positive reports, my contact at Caterpillar said his dealers were getting more business by refurbishing mining equipment.	13.0	91.0
201606	1315	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	He also noted that the recent federal highway bill appeared to have state governments floating bonds to gear up for infrastructure spending, though it is unlikely to come online before 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1316	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	More generally, several contacts pointed to improved commercial construction.	13.0	91.0
201606	1317	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And making lemonade from the weak May labor market report, labor developments did not appear to coincide with any major decline in business attitudes.	13.0	91.0
201606	1318	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With the exception of one or two financial market contacts, no one else was getting bent out of shape over the employment numbers.	13.0	91.0
201606	1319	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Now, for the negatives.	13.0	91.0
201606	1320	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Even though my contacts generally were on an even keel, they indicated that business sentiment remained quite weak.	13.0	91.0
201606	1321	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	For example, one of my banking directors reported on a survey of 75 of the largest companies in Michigan, only a dozen or so of the 75 think the economy will improve over the next 18 months—the rest are about equally split between things staying the same or getting worse.	13.0	91.0
201606	1322	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Another director who is a member of the US Business Roundtable noted the same lack of confidence among most of the CEOs in the nation’s largest firms.	13.0	91.0
201606	1323	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, one contact characterized today’s business leaders as being like the children of the Depression era.	13.0	91.0
201606	1324	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Scarred by the Great Recession, they are highly attuned to reasons to worry about the outlook, and CEOs do not want to undertake any capital expenditures or workforce expansions that entail even a small risk of getting help ahead of the product demand.	13.0	91.0
201606	1325	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Factoring the anecdotes in with our analysis of the incoming macroeconomic data, our bank’s real GDP forecast continues to be similar to the Tealbook’s.	13.0	91.0
201606	1326	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We, too, see growth at about 2 percent this year and then a bit stronger in 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1327	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We currently think that there’s a little more slack in labor markets than the Tealbook does, but under our forecast this is eliminated by mid- 2017.	13.0	91.0
201606	1328	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	To be sure, the May labor market report increased uncertainty over the strength of the expansion.	13.0	91.0
201606	1329	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It and the GDP data are reminders that the economy still faces substantial headwinds and that the equilibrium real interest rate is still quite low, and our Chicago forecast is predicated on a more accommodative policy rate path than the Tealbook.	13.0	91.0
201606	1330	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Still, while there are important risks, I remain reasonably confident that an appropriately accommodative policy will keep us close to our employment mandate.	13.0	91.0
201606	1331	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I cannot express a similar confidence about reaching our inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201606	1332	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Let me frame my discussion with the familiar taxonomy used by the Board staff’s inflation model.	13.0	91.0
201606	1333	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The model forecasts increasing inflation due to three factors.	13.0	91.0
201606	1334	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	First, there’s an unwinding of the transitory effects of lower energy prices and the higher dollar.	13.0	91.0
201606	1335	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Second, the short-run Phillips curve will dictate rising inflation, due to the reduction and eventually overshooting of resource slack.	13.0	91.0
201606	1336	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And, third, there is the pull of the inflation attractor—I guess sometimes it’s referred to as underlying inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1337	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is the factor that captures inflation expectations and other elements of price- setting behavior that induce a stochastic trend into actual inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1338	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So where do we stand on these stories?	13.0	91.0
201606	1339	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Well, the transitory disinflationary effects are waning.	13.0	91.0
201606	1340	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	On slack, we can debate whether or not any slack remains in labor markets, but in view of the flat slope of the Phillips curve, even the Tealbook’s overshooting is not going to provide much boost to inflation.	13.0	91.0
201606	1341	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So that leaves us with the inflation attractor.	13.0	91.0
201606	1342	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Will there be enough pull to get us to 2 percent?	13.0	91.0
201606	1343	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m skeptical, on account of the current state of inflation expectations.	13.0	91.0
201606	1344	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook forecast embeds an assumption of a gradual target-reverting updrift in the attractor from 1¾ percent in 2017 to 2 percent by 2020, and it is this updrift that lifts the inflation forecast to target in 2020.	13.0	91.0
201606	1345	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	However, as of today, I think there are important downside risks to this assumption.	13.0	91.0
201606	1346	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, in the near term, I could see the attractor falling even further below 2 percent.	13.0	91.0
201606	1347	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	None of my contacts talk about anticipating more pricing power when formulating their business plans, even if they wanted to.	13.0	91.0
201606	1348	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Most worrisome, measures of inflation expectations may be slipping.	13.0	91.0
201606	1349	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Despite this year’s welcome news on energy prices, the dollar, and core inflation, TIPS inflation compensation has moved sideways at very low levels, and household measures of inflation expectations have fallen to new lows.	13.0	91.0
201606	1350	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	We have mostly discounted such developments going back to the fall of 2014.	13.0	91.0
201606	1351	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is a long period to think we are only observing statistical noise and coincidences.	13.0	91.0
201606	1352	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	My SEP submission involves an assumption that we could solidify inflation expectations by communicating a stronger commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.	13.0	91.0
201606	1353	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This commitment would be reflected in the Committee’s forward guidance comments.	13.0	91.0
201606	1354	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Importantly, my view of appropriate policy includes communications of a very shallow projected path for policy normalization, conditional on economic and inflation developments.	13.0	91.0
201606	1355	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	If this works, inflationary expectations will solidify back in line with 2 percent, and the attractor will pull inflation up to target within a reasonable amount of time.	13.0	91.0
201606	1356	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It is critically important that it does, because I do not see the upward force from the other factors as being adequate to bring inflation close to target over the forecast period to 2018.	13.0	91.0
201606	1357	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In contrast, if a steeper path of policy rate normalization is socialized with the public without further economic and inflation improvements, my inflation concerns become stronger on the downside.	13.0	91.0
201606	1358	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	91.0
201606	1359	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1360	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13.0	65.0
201606	1361	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	81.0
201606	1362	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Economic conditions in the Fifth District have continued to improve since the previous FOMC meeting, although survey results have been somewhat mixed.	13.0	81.0
201606	1363	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The business activity index from our survey of manufacturing firms fell last month to right around the breakeven level, negative 1 in May versus the April reading of plus 14.	13.0	81.0
201606	1364	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Our contacts attribute the softening in manufacturing to weakening exports, and they say that manufacturers that do not export are healthy.	13.0	81.0
201606	1365	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Meanwhile, our services-sector revenue indicator fell slightly but remained firmly in a positive territory, at plus 11.	13.0	81.0
201606	1366	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The fall in the overall services indicator was due entirely to the retail component, which is very, very volatile—it went from plus 37 in April to plus 1 in May.	13.0	81.0
201606	1367	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The employment indicators in our surveys continue to show expansion.	13.0	81.0
201606	1368	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They’re strongly positive except for retail, for which the index is right around breakeven.	13.0	81.0
201606	1369	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Wage indicators also remained solidly positive in our survey.	13.0	81.0
201606	1370	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	These figures are consistent with continuing reports we hear of firms having difficulty hiring, including reports that some commercial builders are turning down jobs because their plates are full and expanding their workforce is just too difficult.	13.0	81.0
201606	1371	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We heard no reports of cutbacks in planned hiring over the intermeeting period.	13.0	81.0
201606	1372	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Richmond is home to a large national online job search firm that specializes in hourly, low-skilled jobs—think retail and restaurants.	13.0	81.0
201606	1373	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They have 1.4 million job postings on their site, which, for comparison, is about one-fourth the size of the JOLTS job openings number, although the JOLTS definition of a job opening is a little stricter than just the posting.	13.0	81.0
201606	1374	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So it’s not directly comparable, but it gives you a sense of the size of the firm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1375	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They’re reporting a 30 percent year- over-year increase in openings posted on their site, and that’s predominantly expanded postings from existing clients.	13.0	81.0
201606	1376	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, the number of people registered with them to search for jobs has been fairly stable.	13.0	81.0
201606	1377	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The average wage growth for postings on their site was up over 10 percent from the summer of 2014 to the summer of 2015, which is the way they compile and report these things.	13.0	81.0
201606	1378	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And their survey indicates it’s expected to be up more than 10 percent again this summer.	13.0	81.0
201606	1379	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They say that job seekers are becoming increasingly selective.	13.0	81.0
201606	1380	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The number of applications the typical job seeker submits in their first 30 days on the site is declining, and they have also seen a noticeable shift in the stated reason for searching away from “I need a job” toward “I want a better job.”	13.0	81.0
201606	1381	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think this sheds light on the national labor market data.	13.0	81.0
201606	1382	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, the big news on the national front was the May jobs report—employment growth much weaker than expected, but the unemployment rate declined substantially.	13.0	81.0
201606	1383	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The decline, as was noted, was the result of household unemployment being relatively flat and a steep decline in the labor force.	13.0	81.0
201606	1384	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As others have noted, it’s not uncommon to get an employment report that’s out of line with ongoing trends, and I think the May report may turn out to be a fluke.	13.0	81.0
201606	1385	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The contribution of the Verizon strike bolsters that possibility.	13.0	81.0
201606	1386	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But the downward revisions in previous months’ payroll numbers suggest we may be seeing a sustained downturn in employment growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1387	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Over the past three months, average monthly employment growth has stepped down from over 200,000 per month to about 100,000 per month.	13.0	81.0
201606	1388	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I guess that’s a larger number if you adjust for the Verizon strike, as President Williams did, but still lower than 200,000.	13.0	81.0
201606	1389	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If a slowdown in employment growth persists, I think there are two ways to interpret this.	13.0	81.0
201606	1390	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Here I’m following Governor Brainard’s paradigm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1391	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	One is that employment growth is slowing because final demand is weakening, and, obviously, nonresidential fixed investment has contracted for two straight quarters now.	13.0	81.0
201606	1392	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The decline in payroll growth could reflect continuing weakness in this and other related fields.	13.0	81.0
201606	1393	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The other interpretation is that the economy has reached its trend growth path, which is something we’ve been anticipating for some time.	13.0	81.0
201606	1394	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Labor supply constraints are starting to bind in this scenario, and employment growth will be limited by the growth in the working-age population.	13.0	81.0
201606	1395	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think there are arguments for either of these interpretations, but to me the case for supply constraints seems more convincing.	13.0	81.0
201606	1396	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Since the recession, the US economy has grown at a fairly steady 2 percent annual rate, and the unemployment rate has steadily declined.	13.0	81.0
201606	1397	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Apparently, various frictions in adjustment costs prevented us from reducing the overhang of unemployed and discouraged workers at a pace any more rapid than we actually saw over that period.	13.0	81.0
201606	1398	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We’ve always known, however, that at some point, absent shocks, the underutilization of labor resources would be eliminated, and at that point growth would be governed by demographics and productivity growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1399	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This expectation has been evident in the SEP numbers in recent years, showing real GDP growth moderating and the unemployment rate flattening out over the forecast horizon.	13.0	81.0
201606	1400	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think we need to take seriously the idea that the May employment report is indicating that this transition has arrived sooner than we thought.	13.0	81.0
201606	1401	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At our March meeting, every participant said that the longer-run unemployment rate was greater than or equal to the May number of 4.7 percent.	13.0	81.0
201606	1402	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So the notion that labor market resources are fully utilized shouldn’t be too controversial.	13.0	81.0
201606	1403	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If resource utilization remains stable, employment growth should match the trend determined by demographics.	13.0	81.0
201606	1404	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Estimates of that trend range between 50,000 and 100,000.	13.0	81.0
201606	1405	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There has been some commentary about that number in reports so far.	13.0	81.0
201606	1406	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So the May employment report is consistent with the notion that we’ve now converged to that trend path.	13.0	81.0
201606	1407	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Of course, the May report, as Governor Brainard noted, is also consistent with the first interpretation that demand growth is weakening and we’re in danger of a recession, but I don’t think that the other labor market data support that interpretation.	13.0	81.0
201606	1408	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For one, firms haven’t been cutting back on hiring plans, so we can discern job opening rates have increased significantly over the past three years—as was cited before from the JOLTS report—and at this point there isn’t any sign that that trend is reversing.	13.0	81.0
201606	1409	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, prior to the previous recession, job opening rates flattened out in 2006 and had declined noticeably when the cyclical peak arrived in December of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1410	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In addition, layoff rates remain stable and initial unemployment insurance claims are at extremely low levels by historical standards.	13.0	81.0
201606	1411	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So firms haven’t been scaling back on their workforce in anticipation of weak demand.	13.0	81.0
201606	1412	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, initial claims began rising in the fourth quarter of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1413	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Quits rates continue to increase and are up 8½ percent year over year.	13.0	81.0
201606	1414	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In contrast, the quits rate hit a plateau in 2005 and began falling in the summer of 2007.	13.0	81.0
201606	1415	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The notion of weakening demand during an emerging economic downturn, therefore, doesn’t seem to me consistent with these gross flow data, nor is it consistent with broader evidence on second-quarter spending picking up from the first quarter, as Governor Brainard pointed out.	13.0	81.0
201606	1416	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Given the data in hand, I find the supply constraint interpretation more compelling.	13.0	81.0
201606	1417	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Now, I recognize that the seasonally adjusted flow of workers from “unemployed” to “out of the labor force” in the CPS jumped 300,000 from March to May.	13.0	81.0
201606	1418	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This is a fairly choppy series, though, if you take a look at it.	13.0	81.0
201606	1419	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And I think it’s too soon to make too much of it.	13.0	81.0
201606	1420	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For example, the flow rose by over 400,000 from February to April of 2014 but then obviously reversed course.	13.0	81.0
201606	1421	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, the total number of workers out of the labor force fell nearly 1 million from September to March, the recent rise in labor force participation looks like a return to the previous trend.	13.0	81.0
201606	1422	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	If we are running into increasingly binding resource constraints, you would expect some effect on wages and prices.	13.0	81.0
201606	1423	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As I and many others have pointed out, we actually have seen a clear rise in the rate of nominal wage growth over the past year or two, and the Tealbook points out that real wages are rising faster than labor productivity.	13.0	81.0
201606	1424	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, core inflation has been firming, and it is running higher than expected on net this year—2.1 percent at an annual rate versus a median projection of 1.6 percent in the March SEP.	13.0	81.0
201606	1425	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Obviously, the policy implications of these two scenarios are diametrically opposed.	13.0	81.0
201606	1426	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Demand weakness calls for further delay in raising rates, whereas supply constraints call for avoiding delay or, if anything, suggest a steeper rate path.	13.0	81.0
201606	1427	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I have left my funds rate projection unchanged in this submission.	13.0	81.0
201606	1428	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Furthermore, if labor supply constraints are limiting growth, I think we need a shift in how we communicate.	13.0	81.0
201606	1429	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think we should no longer suggest, as the statement does now, that we are dissatisfied with current labor market conditions, and we should find a way to convey to the public—someone else mentioned this, I think—that the monthly employment growth of around 100,000 is quite reasonable and not cause for alarm.	13.0	81.0
201606	1430	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I would like to, finally, just add a comment or two elaborating on President Williams’s comments, and this is all a follow-up from Vice Chairman Dudley’s question.	13.0	81.0
201606	1431	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There is a large literature on the determinants of economic growth over time and a huge number of models and economic analysis that abstract from monetary policy.	13.0	81.0
201606	1432	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Expanding that class of models to encompass a nontrivial role for monetary policy is the signal achievement of economics in the past 40 years.	13.0	81.0
201606	1433	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	For many analytical purposes, it’s very useful to conceive of business cycles as fluctuations around a steady state in which the determinants of growth fluctuate around constant means.	13.0	81.0
201606	1434	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But that shouldn’t distract us from the possibility of the fact that those distributions could shift over time—and indeed, I think this a major message we can take away from this economic expansion.	13.0	81.0
201606	1435	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	There’s no rule written down in nature or that we can divine that those should be constant distributions over time, and President Williams’s analysis is an example of that.	13.0	81.0
201606	1436	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As for monetary policy effectiveness, for many analytical purposes, linearizing around such a steady state delivers models with a small system of equations that closely resemble the IS- LM models that were popular in the ’60s and ’70s.	13.0	81.0
201606	1437	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think, similarly, that shouldn’t distract us from the likelihood that significant asymmetries are relevant to monetary policy and growth.	13.0	81.0
201606	1438	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In particular, I think the capacity of monetary policy to disrupt and interfere with growth is arguably much greater than the capacity of monetary policy to achieve growth substantially greater on a sustained basis than the pace given by those fundamental determinants that President Williams referenced.	13.0	81.0
201606	1439	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1440	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13.0	65.0
201606	1441	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201606	1442	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	My comments will be devoted entirely to the labor market, beginning with whether we should take much of a signal from that May employment report—a topic many of you have already addressed—and, if so, what is being signaled.	13.0	97.0
201606	1443	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Then I will turn to the question of how I think we should assess the labor market even if the May numbers prove to be an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1444	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As, again, many of you have already noted, if taken at face value, the May numbers reflect a very rapid deceleration in job growth, seemingly across a wide range of industries.	13.0	97.0
201606	1445	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Even adding back all 35,000 striking Verizon workers, we still have a slowdown considerably more pronounced than consensus expectations and considerably short of even low-range estimates of the number of jobs required to absorb new entrants.	13.0	97.0
201606	1446	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, as many of you have noted, there are some grounds for believing that the May report may be an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1447	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, there is the usual caution about noisiness in any one month’s data.	13.0	97.0
201606	1448	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Second, there are some other labor market indicators, such as first-time unemployment claims and a Conference Board survey, which continue to suggest improvement.	13.0	97.0
201606	1449	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I wouldn’t draw any conclusions, though, from the JOLTS report, which some people have mentioned, because the report that was issued last Wednesday is for April, not for May, so it doesn’t really reflect the same set of labor market developments.	13.0	97.0
201606	1450	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, the unemployment rate ticked down 0.3 percentage point.	13.0	97.0
201606	1451	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, that reduction in unemployment was entirely due to an unusually large reported drop in labor force participation, a data series that is, if anything, more prone to noisiness than the others.	13.0	97.0
201606	1452	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So, all in all, I don’t think there is enough information with which to answer the signal versus aberration question.	13.0	97.0
201606	1453	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, there’s at least one other possible explanation, which is that increasing numbers of businesses are hitting the pause button in advance of a national election, a phenomenon that is often observed in democracies around the world because economic policy directions can depend so much on electoral outcomes.	13.0	97.0
201606	1454	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	However, while acknowledging that any view has to be tentative, I lean slightly toward taking some signal from the May numbers because of the numbers for those working part time for economic reasons and temporary business employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1455	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The first—part time for economic reasons—increased 468,000, or about 8 percent, in a single month.	13.0	97.0
201606	1456	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Even if one takes the not unreasonable position that the level of PTER may not go all the way down to pre-crisis levels because of structural labor market changes, this much of a jump in a single month, even with some discount for noise, does suggest that there’s something more than an aberration.	13.0	97.0
201606	1457	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This suggestion is reinforced by the decline of 21,000 in temporary health services employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1458	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, in absolute terms, this is a less impressive number than the PTER change, but it does represent an unusually large decline in that category for a month neither at the end of the Christmas rush nor at the end of the summer.	13.0	97.0
201606	1459	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The reason these two numbers incline me toward taking some signal from the May report is that they both can be early indicators of employers beginning to pull back on their workforces in ways that are relatively less disruptive internally than actually laying people off.	13.0	97.0
201606	1460	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So assuming for a moment that there is some signal in the employment report, what is being signaled?	13.0	97.0
201606	1461	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Well, again, several of you have already mentioned some possibilities, and I count three.	13.0	97.0
201606	1462	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, the May numbers may reflect a reduction in hiring to levels that seem more consistent with near-trend growth in GDP.	13.0	97.0
201606	1463	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Many have expected such a slowing, just not this abruptly.	13.0	97.0
201606	1464	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	If this turns out to be the case, then the argument that has been advanced for further increases in the federal funds rate would seem to me to be weakened considerably, since there would be no need to slow employment growth further in order to foreclose a substantial overshooting of full employment, which proponents of this argument presume is associated reasonably directly with the risk of an overshoot of the 2 percent target.	13.0	97.0
201606	1465	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	A second possibility, in my view a less likely though not trivial one, is that the numbers portend a slowdown throughout the economy that is also reflected in the soft business investment numbers, and that would raise the question of whether more, rather than less, accommodation was appropriate.	13.0	97.0
201606	1466	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And third is the argument that hiring has slowed down for supply-side reasons—this is the one Jeff was just articulating—that employers cannot find qualified workers to hire.	13.0	97.0
201606	1467	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This argument, I think, does have some plausibility within some discrete sectors, such as construction and some parts of the IT industry, but I find it also to be somewhat less likely as a broader application, since it’s not consistent either with what’s been observed in prior expansions, with the broad-based nature of the hiring slowdown, or with the possible signals of increasing slack I mentioned earlier.	13.0	97.0
201606	1468	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Moreover, at the lower end of the labor market, in which technical skills or qualifications are not so important, the issue is probably more one of wage increases and the related issue of pulling people back into the labor market.	13.0	97.0
201606	1469	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But let’s now assume that the May numbers are an aberration and that we revert to higher levels of job growth, lower than the 200,000 or better performance we have been at for the past couple of years but still solidly in the mid-to-high 100,000s range.	13.0	97.0
201606	1470	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The first point worth noting here is that in the past nine months, most of which had job creation of near or above 200,000, the unemployment rate has been essentially unchanged because the rate of job growth needed to meet workforce increases is probably around 100,000.	13.0	97.0
201606	1471	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	We have had, by this calculus, about 800,000 or 900,000 new jobs filled by people coming back into the workforce—that is, the jobs have been filled from slack not captured in the standard U-3 measure during or even after the time when some had declared the economy had reached full employment.	13.0	97.0
201606	1472	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, this is as good a time as any to note, once again, that staff estimates of full employment—as well as estimates of many others who find little slack in the economy—have become largely detached from price inflation.	13.0	97.0
201606	1473	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Instead, they rely on estimates of such structural factors as labor force participation.	13.0	97.0
201606	1474	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	While this approach is interesting for labor economists to pursue in light of the flattened Phillips curve, its utility for monetary policy decisions seems to me at least somewhat questionable.	13.0	97.0
201606	1475	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This limited utility is underscored by the reality that the standard errors for estimating the natural rate are relatively high and by the fact that staff estimates find the unemployment rate to have been well below the natural rate for significant periods, such as 1997 to 2001, during which both core inflation and long-run inflation expectations were essentially flat.	13.0	97.0
201606	1476	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Turning back to the present, wages have been accelerating in only a very measured way.	13.0	97.0
201606	1477	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, as shown in a recent interesting report by economists at Morgan Stanley, the diffusion of accelerating wages across industries has been unusually gradual for an expansion and, with a few high-profile but less economically consequential exceptions, concentrated in lower-wage jobs— the very areas in which people only marginally attached to the workforce or out of it altogether are most likely to be able to reenter.	13.0	97.0
201606	1478	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And I actually think this is somewhat consistent with the anecdote that President Lacker was telling a few minutes ago.	13.0	97.0
201606	1479	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	While the same Morgan Stanley report expects that some continued improvement in the labor market would lead to a continued diffusion of higher wage increases in middle-income jobs, they continue to expect that this would be at a measured pace, with no indication of a job market running hot.	13.0	97.0
201606	1480	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, it is worth repeating that if and as accelerating wage increases do diffuse more broadly through the economy, the size and timing of their effect on price inflation of tightening labor markets remain unclear.	13.0	97.0
201606	1481	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As an anecdotal matter, I note that recent NABE and Duke surveys suggest that while an increasing number of firms do expect to increase wages more, they generally do not expect to be able to pass those increased costs along through greater price increases.	13.0	97.0
201606	1482	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	At a more theoretical level, I would further note that there is increasing evidence for the proposition that the flattening of the Phillips curve that we have observed at work in recent years actually took place over roughly 20 years from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s and has been fairly stable since then.	13.0	97.0
201606	1483	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Furthermore, as demonstrated by the recent paper by Blanchard, Cerutti, and Summers, this flattening, by and large, occurred not just in the United States, but also around the world.	13.0	97.0
201606	1484	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Both of these circumstances would imply, though of course not prove, that even if a snapback to a steeper Phillips curve were to occur in the United States, it is unlikely to happen quickly or simply because labor markets were approaching pre-crisis conditions.	13.0	97.0
201606	1485	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Adding these observations to the fact that growth has not been running particularly hot and it’s been only somewhat above what most of us estimate to be the trend, this, again, does suggest a circumstance in which—unless there is some evidence to the contrary—the effect of tighter labor markets on price inflation, while real, will be somewhat attenuated.	13.0	97.0
201606	1486	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The foregoing is not an excuse for complacency about inflation, of course, or a reason to disregard a sustained period of accelerating or high wage increases.	13.0	97.0
201606	1487	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it is a reasonable basis for presuming that the causal link between employment and wages on the one hand and inflation on the other will play out only over time.	13.0	97.0
201606	1488	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Accordingly, we should have ample time to react, and it doesn’t seem as though there is a high risk of falling “behind the curve.”	13.0	97.0
201606	1489	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, in light of recent readings on both market- and survey-based inflation and for the reasons that President Evans discussed a few minutes ago, a good case can be made for the proposition that there is as much risk to the downside for inflation as there is to the upside.	13.0	97.0
201606	1490	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	97.0
201606	1491	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1492	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13.0	65.0
201606	1493	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201606	1494	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff and I found connecting the dots for this meeting a bit of a challenge.	13.0	88.0
201606	1495	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	What we’re hearing from District contacts is not very consistent with the perspective on the economy and outlook that takes a negative signal from the recent employment report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1496	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, businesses reported little change in the economic environment in the most recent cycle compared with earlier in the year.	13.0	88.0
201606	1497	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Our contacts describe an economy on a moderate growth path.	13.0	88.0
201606	1498	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Most contacts are not seeing evidence of weakening, and most remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook.	13.0	88.0
201606	1499	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	For the most part, Main Street in my District related “steady as she goes” economic conditions.	13.0	88.0
201606	1500	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We continue to question our contacts about the weakness of business investment.	13.0	88.0
201606	1501	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	In this case, we got feedback largely in line with the data.	13.0	88.0
201606	1502	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Much of the deployment of new capital is replacement, not expansion.	13.0	88.0
201606	1503	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	At this juncture, we’re not hearing much that would point to improvement in business fixed investment spending in the near term.	13.0	88.0
201606	1504	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The feedback from the economic trenches lines up well with the probable growth outcome for the first half.	13.0	88.0
201606	1505	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We are assuming a second-quarter bounceback that—taken with the first quarter, which we expect to be revised up to slightly above 1 percent—produces first-half growth a little below 2 percent.	13.0	88.0
201606	1506	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	This conclusion is supported by our GDP tracking estimate for the second quarter.	13.0	88.0
201606	1507	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	As of this morning, with the retail sales and inventory numbers included in the computation, our nowcast stands at 2.8 percent for the second quarter.	13.0	88.0
201606	1508	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The forecast I submitted for this meeting projects growth on basically a 2 percent path over the forecast horizon.	13.0	88.0
201606	1509	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect 2 percent growth to be sufficient to absorb the remaining slack in the labor market and push the inflation trend to target next year.	13.0	88.0
201606	1510	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So 2 percent growth, accompanied by effective achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, is my baseline.	13.0	88.0
201606	1511	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Around that outlook, I currently see somewhat more downside risks than upside.	13.0	88.0
201606	1512	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	An important risk question, of course, which many have discussed, is how to interpret the recent employment report and, more generally, how to size up the labor market picture.	13.0	88.0
201606	1513	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The labor market picture is more muddled than it’s been for some time.	13.0	88.0
201606	1514	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	While I am not taking as much negative signal from the payroll survey as could be taken in isolation, I am not interpreting the household survey—that is, the drop in the unemployment rate particularly—as all positive news.	13.0	88.0
201606	1515	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	About one-third of the decline was due to an unusual flow of unemployed persons out of the labor force.	13.0	88.0
201606	1516	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The majority of our District interactions with contacts preceded the May jobs report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1517	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	However, in the week following the report, we asked a number of contacts, including our directors, how much signal to take from the soft jobs number.	13.0	88.0
201606	1518	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	On the whole, our contacts did not hold perceptions of the labor market consistent with the jobs report.	13.0	88.0
201606	1519	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	On the contrary, we heard a number of anecdotal reports of growing tightness in labor markets.	13.0	88.0
201606	1520	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Worker turnover has become a significant problem in some regions and industries.	13.0	88.0
201606	1521	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s contribution to the recent System labor market survey did not reveal a meaningful drop-off in the demand for workers.	13.0	88.0
201606	1522	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Even with mixed information, I am not dismissing the possibility that the slowing trend in employment gains over the past three months signals an incipient growth slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201606	1523	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	One other comment on downside risk:  Recently my attention has been drawn to the declining trend in corporate profits.	13.0	88.0
201606	1524	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Corporate profits could tell us something about how to interpret both business investment and employment data.	13.0	88.0
201606	1525	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My staff and I have to do more work on how much  weight to give to the profits decline as a causal factor in a possible slowdown.	13.0	88.0
201606	1526	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And we’ll be doing that work in coming weeks.	13.0	88.0
201606	1527	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So, in light of my perception of greater uncertainty associated with my forecast and the tilt of risks to the downside, I am comfortable with a wait-and-see stance at this meeting.	13.0	88.0
201606	1528	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	More on that tomorrow.	13.0	88.0
201606	1529	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	88.0
201606	1530	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1531	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	13.0	65.0
201606	1532	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank, you, Madam Chair.	13.0	111.0
201606	1533	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The Ninth District economy continues to perform well.	13.0	111.0
201606	1534	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Jobs are relatively plentiful, while qualified workers are relatively scarce.	13.0	111.0
201606	1535	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I made my first trip to the Bakken a few weeks ago, and I expected to find a bust—that’s how it’s characterized in the national media—but that’s actually not what I found.	13.0	111.0
201606	1536	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A lot of the froth is off the market, and many of the temporary workers who came there to work the oil fields have gone home.	13.0	111.0
201606	1537	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But the underlying employment situation is actually still quite healthy and robust, and there is actually a lot of optimism there.	13.0	111.0
201606	1538	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The recent uptick, obviously, in oil prices has helped.	13.0	111.0
201606	1539	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Several large new infrastructure projects are getting started, including a new almost $4 billion oil pipeline from the Bakken to southern Illinois and a new large refinery in western North Dakota.	13.0	111.0
201606	1540	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But my takeaway was, if even the Bakken employment situation is pretty healthy, I think that speaks well for the overall robustness of the employment situation nationally.	13.0	111.0
201606	1541	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	My overall take on the national economy is, I don’t see a sign of imminent crisis nor do I see signs of unsustainable growth and imminent overheating.	13.0	111.0
201606	1542	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Rather, I expect continued modest growth, coupled with low and stable inflation.	13.0	111.0
201606	1543	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	However, I am concerned about the low global inflation environment and long-term nominal rates that are at or near record lows in many major economies.	13.0	111.0
201606	1544	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The United States doesn’t seem to be immune to this low global inflation.	13.0	111.0
201606	1545	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	The Michigan survey that many people have mentioned for long-term expectations has just fallen to a record low.	13.0	111.0
201606	1546	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m trying to make sense of what we’re seeing in the global economy and what it means for how we think about monetary policy here.	13.0	111.0
201606	1547	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Vice Chairman Dudley’s question, I thought, was a good one earlier in the day, and I have a theory that President Evans mentioned, which is psychological scarring from the crisis.	13.0	111.0
201606	1548	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It could explain a lot of the things that we are seeing—the persistence of the low-rate environment, the global nature of some of the trends that we are seeing, the low investment, the high savings.	13.0	111.0
201606	1549	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I can’t quantify it, and I don’t have a model behind it.	13.0	111.0
201606	1550	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I will certainly work with my staff and, maybe, Board staff—if you have ideas on this, I think it is worth looking at.	13.0	111.0
201606	1551	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Because if we are in for a period of extended psychological scarring, I think it’s going to affect how we think about monetary policy not just in the forecast horizon, but, potentially, much further beyond that.	13.0	111.0
201606	1552	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you.	13.0	111.0
201606	1553	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13.0	65.0
201606	1554	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13.0	65.0
201606	1555	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201606	1556	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Our baseline forecast, like everybody else’s, hasn’t really changed much since the March meeting.	13.0	96.0
201606	1557	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We expect real GDP growth at slightly more than 2 percent over the remainder of the year, and we do continue to expect inflation to move gradually back toward our 2 percent objective over the next few years.	13.0	96.0
201606	1558	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the funds rate, we’ve had two interest rate hikes penciled in for 2016, going back to the December 2015 meeting, and we’re sticking with that for the time being.	13.0	96.0
201606	1559	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think there is a risk that our forecast could slip back to one or even no hikes for 2016 by the time we get to the next SEP round in September.	13.0	96.0
201606	1560	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Longer term, we have reduced the number of rate hikes in 2017 to two from three, and, like many others, we’ve lowered our long-run federal funds rate projection another ¼ point to 3 percent.	13.0	96.0
201606	1561	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we all have this sort of Bayesian model—the longer we stay in this very low interest rate environment, the more we say, “Well, okay, another quarter.”	13.0	96.0
201606	1562	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So to sum up, we made only marginal adjustments to our modal growth and inflation forecast and only small downward adjustments to our federal funds rate trajectory, but we are more worried about the downside risks to our growth, inflation, and interest rate forecast than we were at the time of the April meeting.	13.0	96.0
201606	1563	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, I judge the data as mixed.	13.0	96.0
201606	1564	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, we’ve had a very strong retail sales report and PCE report for April, and I was gratified by the May retail sales report today, because there was some risk that it was going to reverse the strength that we saw in April.	13.0	96.0
201606	1565	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And, in fact, it was actually a bit stronger than expected.	13.0	96.0
201606	1566	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So that’s good news.	13.0	96.0
201606	1567	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But against this, we’ve seen continued weakness in investment, and we’ve seen softness in services activity, at least judging by recent declines in the nonmanufacturing ISM index.	13.0	96.0
201606	1568	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Real GDP looks like it’s picked up after a weak first quarter, but the rebound is quite modest.	13.0	96.0
201606	1569	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if we take our nowcast number of 2.8 percent, we’re talking about 2 percent growth for the first half of the year, and that’s probably on the high side of most estimates at this point.	13.0	96.0
201606	1570	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Of the greatest concern, of course, is the fact that the household and payroll employment reports were unambiguously weak.	13.0	96.0
201606	1571	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the effect on the labor market, I’m where Governor Tarullo is.	13.0	96.0
201606	1572	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I do suspect that the most recent payroll figures exaggerate the degree of deterioration of the US labor markets, but I do take some signal from the data.	13.0	96.0
201606	1573	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted at the most recent meeting, although there was some prospect that the gap between the strength in payroll growth and the weakness in real GDP could be closed by stronger real GDP growth, there was also the possibility the gap could be closed by weaker employment growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1574	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think about what’s happened since then, we’ve really closed the gap in both ways, somewhat stronger real GDP growth and a somewhat weaker labor market.	13.0	96.0
201606	1575	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And it seems to me like we should put some signal on both of those things.	13.0	96.0
201606	1576	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the weakness in the payroll figures, several other measures, I think, harken to some the notion that there has been a significant slowing.	13.0	96.0
201606	1577	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the one- month, three-month, and six-month diffusion indexes for private industry payrolls, for example, they’ve all fallen very sharply over the past two months, and the one-month and three-month private industry diffusion indexes are at their lowest levels since early 2010.	13.0	96.0
201606	1578	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in connection with President Mester’s point, there has been slowing in the labor market before, but if you look at the diffusion index, this seems a little bit bigger than what we’ve seen earlier in the cycle.	13.0	96.0
201606	1579	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, some people might argue—and Jeff, I think, made this point—that the slowdown in payroll growth reflects supply constraints rather than weakness in the demand for labor.	13.0	96.0
201606	1580	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I suppose that’s possible, but I don’t find that argument particularly compelling, because we don’t have one national labor market.	13.0	96.0
201606	1581	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We have hundreds of local labor markets at different degrees of labor market slack.	13.0	96.0
201606	1582	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if the labor market was improving and we were getting to full employment, I would never expect to hit the wall and see a very, very sharp slowdown in payroll growth in a month or two, because I just don’t think you’d run out of an available supply of labor at the same time in all of these different labor markets across the country.	13.0	96.0
201606	1583	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the evidence from past expansions, it basically suggests that when the economy reaches what’s viewed as full employment, what happens is the unemployment rate flattens out, but the job gains actually tend to persist in line with the growth rate of real activity, and what happens is that an increasing share of the hires comes from those who are induced by improvement in the labor market to enter the labor force.	13.0	96.0
201606	1584	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think it’s premature to conclude from the wage compensation data that we’ve reached full employment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1585	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t view the pickup in wage compensation as very large.	13.0	96.0
201606	1586	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the ECI, there’s basically been none, at least to date, although we’re expecting an uptick with the next report.	13.0	96.0
201606	1587	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the trend of average hourly earnings, I think it’s a modest uptick, but somewhat less than what I would evaluate as consistent with reaching full employment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1588	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the growth side, I have several concerns.	13.0	96.0
201606	1589	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	First, I’m a little bit less sanguine about consumer spending, in view of the fact that we’re actually transitioning from a period in which we had very strong real income gains supporting consumer spending to a situation in which real income gains are going to be distinctly slower now because the growth of hours worked has slowed, and we’ve had an uptick in energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201606	1590	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So the situation is exactly the reverse of what it was earlier in the year.	13.0	96.0
201606	1591	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, I also worry about the chronic weakness that we’ve seen in investment spending.	13.0	96.0
201606	1592	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Not only has it been persistent, but the election season could contribute to further weakness.	13.0	96.0
201606	1593	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s because an election can increase uncertainty about future policies, and that increased uncertainty can raise the option value of deferring investment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1594	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	There was an interesting cross- country study of the effect of elections on investment spending by Brandon Julio and Youngsuk Yook in the February 2012 issue of the Journal of Finance.	13.0	96.0
201606	1595	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And they concluded, after looking at all of these different countries and all of these different elections, “In the period leading up to the election, investment expenditures decline by an average of 4.8 percent, controlling for growth opportunities, cash flows, and economic conditions.”	13.0	96.0
201606	1596	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So one could argue that this year’s election in the United States is highly uncertain in several respects not only at the presidential level, but also with respect to which party will be in the majority in the US Senate and, as a consequence, what policies will result.	13.0	96.0
201606	1597	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So it seems to me the option value of waiting in terms of investment has presumably increased in the current environment.	13.0	96.0
201606	1598	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, we shouldn’t be surprised if the softness in investment spending persists and probably actually even worsens a bit.	13.0	96.0
201606	1599	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also have a bit of concern about inventories.	13.0	96.0
201606	1600	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They could prove to be a more persistent drag on growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1601	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The rate of inventory accumulation has been pretty high now for the past eight quarters, more than $70 billion at an annual rate each quarter, and so this has really pushed up the business inventories-to-sales ratio over time.	13.0	96.0
201606	1602	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So getting inventories back down to normal levels will require a lower inventory accumulation rate, which implies that inventories will likely be a drag on the economy for a while.	13.0	96.0
201606	1603	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I raise this issue because inventory cycles—maybe not so much recently, but if you go back to past economic history, they have, at times, been important in influencing the pace of economic activity.	13.0	96.0
201606	1604	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Speaking about monetary policy, another concern I have is that US monetary policy may not be as accommodative as we think it is.	13.0	96.0
201606	1605	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I know that several estimates of the equilibrium real short-term rate are currently close to zero, and that suggests that maybe we’re roughly 100 basis points above the actual real short-term rate.	13.0	96.0
201606	1606	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think the measurement of the equilibrium real short-term rate is imprecise and model dependent.	13.0	96.0
201606	1607	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We also have to reconcile the notion that monetary policy is relatively accommodative with the fact that we’ve only been growing at a 1.5 percent rate over the past few quarters.	13.0	96.0
201606	1608	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Another aspect that I think about the monetary policy normalization story may also be in doubt:  One motivation we’ve had for an upward path for short-term rates has been the notion that the headwinds holding back growth will gradually subside over the next few years, and that will push up the neutral real short-term rate.	13.0	96.0
201606	1609	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I ask myself the question, why should we expect these headwinds to subside to any appreciable degree from here?	13.0	96.0
201606	1610	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	If they haven’t subsided much in the seven years since the end of the Great Recession, why is this going to happen in the next year or two?	13.0	96.0
201606	1611	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It could be that these headwinds that we talk about are much more persistent:  global savings glut, lower productivity growth, and tighter lending standards for residential mortgages.	13.0	96.0
201606	1612	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	When you think about the Great Depression, those headwinds lasted for decades, presumably.	13.0	96.0
201606	1613	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So my bottom line is that there’s a reasonable likelihood that we may not have much more to do in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation in order to get back to neutral.	13.0	96.0
201606	1614	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve been pretty negative up to now, so I’m going to give you some balance, focusing on what I see as some of the more positive aspects of the outlook.	13.0	96.0
201606	1615	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me, and I think this is the sentiment around the table, that recession risks are low.	13.0	96.0
201606	1616	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We have had decent trends in real income, we have accommodative fiscal and monetary policy, and we have buoyant financial market conditions.	13.0	96.0
201606	1617	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The stock market has recovered, long-term rates have fallen, and the dollar has been relatively stable.	13.0	96.0
201606	1618	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel like we have a pretty supportive environment for continuation of growth.	13.0	96.0
201606	1619	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, some of the drag we’ve seen in terms of real GDP should diminish or reverse.	13.0	96.0
201606	1620	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I noticed that the staff forecast for trade shows it’s a continued drag but less drag in the period ahead than what we’ve had in the past, which makes sense to me, as the broad trade-weighted dollar has steadied over the past six months or so and the drag on investment, as was noted by many, from the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity is certainly lessening at a minimum and may actually be ending.	13.0	96.0
201606	1621	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side of the ledger, my views haven’t really changed much.	13.0	96.0
201606	1622	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I continue to think that if the growth materializes, then we don’t really have to worry too much about inflation.	13.0	96.0
201606	1623	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But if the growth doesn’t materialize, then there’s a risk inflation will stay stuck below our 2 percent objective.	13.0	96.0
201606	1624	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I do get a little worried about the decline in the TIPS five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation measure, especially in light of the fact that, earlier, we tended to explain it away because it was just correlated with the decline in energy prices.	13.0	96.0
201606	1625	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a little bit more difficult to do now that energy prices are heading in the opposite direction.	13.0	96.0
201606	1626	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I guess I take a little bit of signal from the University of Michigan five-year inflation expectations measure.	13.0	96.0
201606	1627	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think, on the other hand, if you look at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s three-year median estimate, that’s been pretty stable over this year.	13.0	96.0
201606	1628	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t show a clear trend downward, so I take a little bit of comfort from that.	13.0	96.0
201606	1629	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We think this is a better survey—we ask the question better, have a broader sample, and we ask a lot of the same people the same question over time.	13.0	96.0
201606	1630	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So the bottom line for me is, I think we should just hang out, get more information, see what happens in terms of Brexit, and then think really carefully about what we should do about monetary policy.	13.0	96.0
201606	1631	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But more on that tomorrow.	13.0	96.0
201606	1632	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13.0	96.0
201606	1633	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, my thanks to everyone for an interesting discussion of the economic outlook and risks.	13.0	65.0
201606	1634	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to add a few brief comments of my own.	13.0	65.0
201606	1635	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Prior to June 3, I would have said that things were going well.	13.0	65.0
201606	1636	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Labor market indicators, on the whole, were favorable and suggested continued improvement into the spring.	13.0	65.0
201606	1637	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The incoming data showed a sizable pickup in consumer spending after the winter’s weakness, as expected, and the housing sector continued its gradual recovery.	13.0	65.0
201606	1638	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Global economic and financial conditions had improved somewhat further and increased my confidence that the drag on the US economy due to external factors would gradually abate later this year and beyond.	13.0	65.0
201606	1639	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, indicators of business investment outside the energy sector had remained puzzlingly soft, but with firms still willing to expand their workforces, I was optimistic that capital spending would gradually pick up in response to stronger household spending and foreign growth.	13.0	65.0
201606	1640	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the price data had come in about as I expected, consistent with my forecast that inflation would move up to 2 percent over the next two years or so, conditional on further labor market improvement, reasonably well-anchored inflation expectations, and roughly stable prices for oil and non-energy imports.	13.0	65.0
201606	1641	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Under those circumstances, my view was that another ¼ percentage point increase in the target range would soon be warranted, although I was inclined to wait until the July meeting to act in order to verify that any fallout from the Brexit vote would, indeed, be minor, in view of the fact that the cost of waiting a few weeks while clearly signaling a high probability of acting seemed low.	13.0	65.0
201606	1642	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But the release of the May labor market report puts a considerably different light on matters, as many around the table have noted.	13.0	65.0
201606	1643	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Although I don’t think we should make too much out of one report, the May report was remarkably weak.	13.0	65.0
201606	1644	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Adjusting for the effects of the Verizon strike, payrolls increased only 73,000 in May, and the figures for March and April were marked down a total of 85,000.	13.0	65.0
201606	1645	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As a consequence, the average increase over the past three months, while admittedly somewhat better than the May figure, was just 125,000 per month, representing a marked and abrupt slowdown in employment growth whether measured relative to average monthly gains of 220,000 over the preceding three months or the 230,000 per month pace seen last year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1646	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And while the unemployment rate in May fell to 4.7 percent, this reduction reflected another large decline in labor force participation, as many of you noted.	13.0	65.0
201606	1647	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Indeed, the rise in labor force participation that we had seen since last summer has been largely reversed in the past two months.	13.0	65.0
201606	1648	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This development suggests that recovery along that dimension has been much more limited than I had thought.	13.0	65.0
201606	1649	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, involuntary part-time employment jumped, leaving the broad U-6 measure of labor utilization little changed since the beginning of the year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1650	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you noted, the implications of this disappointing news are not at all clear.	13.0	65.0
201606	1651	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	One possibility is that these data are simply an aberration, as many of you suggested, that will disappear with the release of additional employment data.	13.0	65.0
201606	1652	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Lending support to this interpretation is that other timely labor market indicators did not deteriorate.	13.0	65.0
201606	1653	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Weekly initial claims have continued at a low level.	13.0	65.0
201606	1654	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Consumer expectations for labor market conditions were relatively upbeat in May, and net hiring plans by small businesses have changed little since the start of the year.	13.0	65.0
201606	1655	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And on the basis of what I heard around the table, and also the results from the recent survey the Banks conducted in their Districts, our contacts’ assessment of the economy and the labor market don’t seem to have deteriorated significantly, although some of you did note that firms don’t seem particularly upbeat, either.	13.0	65.0
201606	1656	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, while payroll employment and the unemployment rate are two of the most reliable indicators we have, they are both subject to considerable sampling error.	13.0	65.0
201606	1657	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	For example, the 90 percent confidence interval on monthly payroll gains is plus or minus 115,000, according to the BLS.	13.0	65.0
201606	1658	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A second possibility is that the reported slowdown in employment growth is real but reflects a lagged response on the part of firms to the weakness in aggregate spending seen late last year and this winter.	13.0	65.0
201606	1659	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Such a slowdown would arguably be consistent with the recent weakness in non-energy-related business investment.	13.0	65.0
201606	1660	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	On the whole, this interpretation could be a relatively benign one for the economic outlook.	13.0	65.0
201606	1661	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In light of the recent rebound in consumer spending, the ongoing recovery in the housing market, and the improvement in global financial and economic conditions, the odds seem reasonably good to me that overall activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, and if so, we should expect to see a pickup in employment growth relatively soon.	13.0	65.0
201606	1662	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A third possibility is that firms may now be finding it very difficult to hire qualified workers, resulting in employment growth downshifting to a pace more in line with its sustainable long-run rate, as President Lacker suggested.	13.0	65.0
201606	1663	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Such a deceleration does have to occur at some point, as a stable unemployment rate probably requires average payroll gains to settle down at less than 100,000 per month in the longer run.	13.0	65.0
201606	1664	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But if such a persistent slowdown has just occurred, its abruptness is puzzling.	13.0	65.0
201606	1665	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Also, this tight labor market story is difficult to square with the jump in involuntary part-time employment, decreased demand for temporary workers, and wage growth that remains fairly subdued.	13.0	65.0
201606	1666	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But if it is true, and in line with Governor Tarullo’s suggestion, I think it suggests little need to tighten, as the current stance of monetary policy has already, under that interpretation, succeeded in slowing employment growth to a more sustainable pace, assuming that wage growth doesn’t start to accelerate unduly.	13.0	65.0
201606	1667	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, the May report could be a harbinger of a more general and persistent slowdown in the overall economy.	13.0	65.0
201606	1668	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	This is not my expectation, and I remain cautiously optimistic that the overall economy will expand at a moderate rate over the remainder of the year—and that employment growth will pick up noticeably in the next few months.	13.0	65.0
201606	1669	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But with the data we have in hand today, I cannot dismiss the possibility that domestic demand, which has been quite resilient in the face of a range of headwinds in recent years, may now be faltering.	13.0	65.0
201606	1670	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	So where does that leave us?	13.0	65.0
201606	1671	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the policy implications are clear.	13.0	65.0
201606	1672	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We need to leave policy unchanged until we have a better sense of the true state of the labor market and the broader economy.	13.0	65.0
201606	1673	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Perhaps we may achieve this as early as the July meeting if the June labor market report shows a marked rebound in payroll growth and significant upward revisions to prior months’ data.	13.0	65.0
201606	1674	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Clearly, we would also like to see relatively strong, and hence reassuring, readings on spending and production.	13.0	65.0
201606	1675	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But due to the limited amount of information we will receive in the next five weeks, some important questions may well remain unresolved by the time of our next meeting, so I think we will need to be prepared to be patient in order to confirm that conditions are evolving in line with our baseline expectations.	13.0	65.0
201606	1676	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13.0	65.0
201606	1677	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It is reasonably early, so let’s turn to Thomas for his briefing on monetary policy.	21.0	65.0
201606	1678	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Then we can start at a reasonable hour tomorrow and discuss policy.	21.0	65.0
201606	1679	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Be animated here, Thomas.	21.0	97.0
201606	1680	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I will do my best.	21.0	999.0
201606	1681	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21.0	999.0
201606	1682	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21.0	999.0
201606	1683	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In financial markets, one notable development in recent years has been the sizable decline in longer-term Treasury yields.	21.0	999.0
201606	1684	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	That decline continued over the intermeeting period, leaving the 10-year yield close to historic lows.	21.0	999.0
201606	1685	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Before turning to the draft policy statements, I will briefly explore some of the factors that may have contributed to this decline and consider what it might suggest for the Committee’s policy communications.	21.0	999.0
201606	1686	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The top-left panel of exhibit 1 illustrates the extent to which the decline in the 10- year Treasury yield has surprised the forecasters on the Blue Chip panel and has led them to repeatedly mark down their projections for the path of the 10-year yield.	21.0	999.0
201606	1687	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, as of mid-2014—that’s the yellow line—forecasters expected the 10-year Treasury yield to rise about 140 basis points over the coming two years; in fact, it declined 70 basis points.	21.0	999.0
201606	1688	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The track record of the staff’s projections for longer-term rates over this period is quite similar.	21.0	999.0
201606	1689	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This ratcheting down in the expected path for longer-term Treasury yields in part reflects shifts in the expected path of the federal funds rate, as illustrated on the right.	21.0	999.0
201606	1690	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Notably, these shifts occurred even as outcomes for the labor market and inflation were about as expected.	21.0	999.0
201606	1691	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The exhibit on the “Evolution of the Staff Forecast” that’s always shown in Tealbook A nicely illustrates this point:  It shows that, from the staff’s perspective, the unemployment rate has declined slightly more than predicted, while core inflation has been only slightly to the low side of earlier projections.	21.0	999.0
201606	1692	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The same is broadly true for the Blue Chip forecasters.	21.0	999.0
201606	1693	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Taken together, these results suggest that the economy has required a lower-than-anticipated path for the federal funds rate in order to sustain progress toward the Committee’s mandated objectives— that is, short-run r* has fallen to very low levels, as many of you noted in your SEP comments.	21.0	999.0
201606	1694	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The middle two panels review evidence on two other factors likely influencing longer-term yields.	21.0	999.0
201606	1695	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	First, as shown by the solid line to the left, the nominal term premium as calculated using the Kim-Wright model or, as shown by the dashed- dotted line, derived by the staff from the Blue Chip survey has trended down in the past several years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1696	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Although we cannot say for sure what underlies this move, the divergence in nominal yields between the United States and other advanced economies, reflecting in part diverging monetary policies, appears to be one factor.	21.0	999.0
201606	1697	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, investors appear to have revised down their views on inflation in the longer run.	21.0	999.0
201606	1698	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown to the right, some market- and survey-based measures of longer-run expected inflation have moved lower over the past two years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1699	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Furthermore, with inflation running persistently low and the global economic outlook still soft, investors likely see a lower probability of an upside inflation surprise, and some may see a greater likelihood of a downside surprise, potentially reducing the inflation risk premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1700	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The left column of the table at the bottom left shows the results of using Blue Chip surveys in combination with the staff’s term structure model of nominal and real yields to quantify the contributions of various factors to the change in the 10-year yield between the June 2014 and June 2016 Blue Chip surveys.	21.0	999.0
201606	1701	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The second and fifth lines decompose the total decline in the 10-year yield into changes in the expected path of the short-term rate over the life of the 10-year note and changes in the nominal term premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1702	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The bulk of the decline is estimated to reflect lower term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201606	1703	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Lines three and four dig deeper and provide estimates of the real and inflation components of the change in expected short rates; lines six and seven do the same for term premiums.	21.0	999.0
201606	1704	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This decomposition points to a drop in the inflation risk premium as the most important driver of the decline in the 10-year yield over the past two years.	21.0	999.0
201606	1705	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	To focus more directly on the longer-run determinants of yields, the right column of the table shows the same two decompositions for the 127 basis point decline in the 5-year, 5-year forward yield.	21.0	999.0
201606	1706	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The total change in this yield reflects a 52 basis point decline in expected short rates 5 to 10 years into the future and a 75 basis point drop in the corresponding term premium.	21.0	999.0
201606	1707	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Notably, as shown on line 3, most of the change in expected short-term nominal rates between 5 to 10 years ahead is due to lower expected short-term real rates, consistent with estimates indicating that r* has declined.	21.0	999.0
201606	1708	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Among the term premium components, the inflation risk premium again explains the bulk of the change, as investors may have come to view longer-term fixed-coupon nominal assets as increasingly valuable hedges against lower-than- anticipated inflation.	21.0	999.0
201606	1709	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	But the real risk premium has come down as well, as investors may also increasingly value insurance against periods of low real interest rates.	21.0	999.0
201606	1710	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Although this decomposition may help identify some of the sources of unanticipated developments, the size and persistence of the forecast errors highlight our limited ability to predict how these factors will evolve.	21.0	999.0
201606	1711	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The staff has responded to the persistence of surprisingly low rates by again reducing the estimates of the nominal term premium and longer-run r* in the Tealbook.	21.0	999.0
201606	1712	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Many of you have successively lowered your estimates of longer-run r* in your projections.	21.0	999.0
201606	1713	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	As we discussed in April, shifts in trend productivity growth, one of the likely determinants of the longer-run level of r*, are difficult to recognize in real time.	21.0	999.0
201606	1714	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	And the term premium is affected by a number of difficult-to-predict factors, including the global economic outlook and associated policy responses as well as the future path of the SOMA portfolio.	21.0	999.0
201606	1715	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Another source of uncertainty is how longer-term inflation expectations will evolve, as they appear to have remained low even as labor markets have tightened, core inflation has firmed, and oil prices have risen.	21.0	999.0
201606	1716	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The box at the bottom right summarizes several potential implications for your policy communications.	21.0	999.0
201606	1717	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The experience of the past couple of years suggests that we are in a period of elevated uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate and the evolution of inflation expectations and, hence, elevated uncertainty about the policy rate path consistent with achieving the Committee’s mandated objectives.	21.0	999.0
201606	1718	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In such an environment, policy necessarily needs to be made in a more adaptive way, as indeed your changes to your policy rate paths in recent SEP submissions illustrate.	21.0	999.0
201606	1719	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	This uncertainty also highlights the importance of communicating, as in paragraph 4 of the postmeeting statement, that the policy rate path associated with achieving and sustaining your labor market and inflation objectives will depend on “realized and expected economic conditions” relative to your objectives.	21.0	999.0
201606	1720	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, in your communications, you may be well served by continuing to emphasize that the policy rate path that will be associated with achieving your objectives is in no way preset.	21.0	999.0
201606	1721	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the draft alternatives for your consideration tomorrow, the important differences across the three drafts are their assessments of the information received over the intermeeting period and their implications for the Committee’s policy decision.	21.0	999.0
201606	1722	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the recent news, alternative B would emphasize the crosscurrents in the recent data but would indicate that the Committee’s modal outlook has not changed.	21.0	999.0
201606	1723	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	With respect to the policy decision, alternative B would indicate that the Committee still expects to raise the target range for the funds rate gradually but avoids signaling the likely timing.	21.0	999.0
201606	1724	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	It would suggest that, as in April, the Committee judges that it is prudent to wait and see that the economy is evolving as expected before deciding when next to raise the target range for the funds rate.	21.0	999.0
201606	1725	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	With alternative B, the Committee would communicate that the policy rate path in the period ahead will remain data dependent.	21.0	999.0
201606	1726	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, investors will also look to the SEP for guidance on the Committee’s thinking about the timing of the next rate increase and the path of the funds rate thereafter.	21.0	999.0
201606	1727	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The first version of paragraph 3 in alternative C would indicate that the Committee views the recent data positively, implying that it views the economy as still on track.	21.0	999.0
201606	1728	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Accordingly, it would provide a strong signal that an increase in the target range may come in July or September.	21.0	999.0
201606	1729	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The second version of paragraph 3 in alternative C would indicate sufficient confidence that the Committee will achieve its statutory goals to raise the funds rate target at this meeting, which would be a significant surprise to investors.	21.0	999.0
201606	1730	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Like alternative B, alternative C would continue to emphasize that the path for the federal funds rate will be data dependent.	21.0	999.0
201606	1731	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative A would suggest a change in the Committee’s expectations for policy normalization in light of the recent disappointing data on employment and inflation compensation, the downside risks to the outlook, and the persistence of inflation below the Committee’s objective.	21.0	999.0
201606	1732	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	It would indicate that the appropriate policy rate path is lower, and that a decision to increase the target range would be deferred until the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced and inflation is closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.	21.0	999.0
201606	1733	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally, compared with alternatives B and C, it expresses less confidence in the expectation that the target federal funds rate will rise over time.	21.0	999.0
201606	1734	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, I should point out that the draft alternatives in the handout include the changes that we circulated to the Committee yesterday afternoon.	21.0	999.0
201606	1735	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	In alternative B, the final sentence in paragraph 1 acknowledges the roughly 25 basis point decline in far-forward breakeven inflation and, indirectly, the 0.2 percentage point decline in the Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations.	21.0	999.0
201606	1736	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair, that concludes my prepared remarks.	21.0	999.0
201606	1737	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	21.0	65.0
201606	1738	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Questions?	22.0	65.0
201606	1739	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	22.0	65.0
201606	1740	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Just a question.	22.0	91.0
201606	1741	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Since my earlier comments today and the fact that I anticipate we’re going to mention inflation expectations in our statement tomorrow, I was slightly chastened by Governor Fischer’s critique of the Michigan survey expectations.	22.0	91.0
201606	1742	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	When he spoke about deducting 100 basis points from the average Michigan number—some type of change on the level of inflation expectations measured by the survey relative to what we’re actually targeting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1743	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Does the staff have a response to that critique?	22.0	91.0
201606	1744	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll take a crack at that.	22.0	999.0
201606	1745	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We have one of the world’s experts here.	22.0	999.0
201606	1746	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	One starting place is to note that the question that’s asked of the respondents in the Michigan survey is quite vague.	22.0	999.0
201606	1747	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re asked, “Now, about prices in general, what do you expect over the next 12 months, and what do you expect over the next 5 to 10 years?”	22.0	999.0
201606	1748	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So I think it would strain credulity to expect a randomly selected household to have a specific view about a specific price index, but our view has always been that it would be pushing things a bit hard to assume that they’re answering specifically about the PCE price index or the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1749	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	So, historically, I think we’ve been quite willing to forgive an intercept, and that’s exactly what we’ve done in fitting our Phillips curve equations.	22.0	999.0
201606	1750	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Jeremy.	22.0	999.0
201606	1751	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This is actually in exhibit 4 of the “Material for Staff Presentation on the Economic and Financial Situation,” panel 4.	22.0	999.0
201606	1752	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That estimate is shown as “Phillips curve (Michigan)” and it is the estimate one gets from using the Michigan survey in a Phillips curve and allowing for an intercept adjustment that is estimated from the data.	22.0	999.0
201606	1753	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The idea is that what we view all of these survey-based expectation measures as is noisy indicators of the underlying long-term trend in inflation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1754	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	What the intercept of that kind of equation tells you is that over history, in order to get a particular observed inflation outcome as defined by, say, the core PCE price index, you had to have a wedge in that equation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1755	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, how you estimate that—you can debate whether it’s actually a sensible thing to do even—	22.0	999.0
201606	1756	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But as soon as you take the view that it’s used for a forecasting relationship, the actual index level itself is of far less importance than its co-variation with the thing that you’re targeting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1757	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That’s what I was expecting.	22.0	91.0
201606	1758	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably we don’t think consumers make the hedonic adjustments in the consumer price index, I would expect.	22.0	96.0
201606	1759	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Well, there’s actually a second point about the Michigan survey that’s important to note, which is that a lot of people say a priori that the Michigan survey is ridiculous, because it’s obviously so high it’s biased—and so it’s not a good measure of an index like the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1760	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t really know what the raw prices that consumers are facing look like compared with the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1761	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	As you said, the CPI is heavily massaged.	22.0	999.0
201606	1762	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The BLS links prices of goods and services in the index with prices outside of the index, it makes quality adjustments, and it does other things to produce this index.	22.0	999.0
201606	1763	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That’s even more true for the PCE price index.	22.0	999.0
201606	1764	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It covers bundles of goods and services that aren’t necessarily what consumers have in mind when they think about what their current consumption costs are.	22.0	999.0
201606	1765	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There’s an interesting paper by Moulton and Moses that appeared a number of years back in which they talk about the amount of quality adjustments being made in order to fit observed price quotes into the estimated CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1766	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s a pretty large adjustment.	22.0	999.0
201606	1767	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, whether that can really—	22.0	999.0
201606	1768	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	What order of magnitude?	22.0	96.0
201606	1769	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	An order of magnitude sufficient enough that you could almost make the Michigan survey look reasonable compared with, say, the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1770	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Now, you don’t want to necessarily look at that estimate and say, “Okay, all of those changes are obviously just statistical messing around.”	22.0	999.0
201606	1771	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	When you go to buy a tub of yogurt, and it’s 8 ounces versus 16 ounces, that kind of adjustment may be sensible, although there are a number of problems with even those sorts of adjustments that people who worry about price measurement do point out.	22.0	999.0
201606	1772	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	There’s not linear pricing for a lot of things—things that are sold in bulk are cheaper, that sort of thing.	22.0	999.0
201606	1773	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	So a lot of what’s being done to the price quotes that are then entering the CPI could be separating them from the kinds of prices that people are actually seeing and reacting to.	22.0	999.0
201606	1774	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	On the other hand, if you take the Michigan survey, and if you regressed it on, say, food, energy, and core CPI inflation, let’s say, the weights that you get are pretty close to the relative importance weights that you get for those components in the CPI.	22.0	999.0
201606	1775	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	This suggests that it’s not a completely irrational measure.	22.0	999.0
201606	1776	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But it might be that the change in the measure, as opposed to the absolute level, is what you need to focus on if you want to think about what it means for price developments.	22.0	999.0
201606	1777	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22.0	65.0
201606	1778	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	First of all, I compliment you on that learned discourse, but I took Governor Fischer’s critique to be that, in view of our uncertainty about the determinants of that gap, a very sharp and precise assumption that long-run inflation expectations are fixed for all time seems unwarranted.	22.0	81.0
201606	1779	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The fixity is an issue.	22.0	999.0
201606	1780	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Of course, it’s very hard to discern changes in that from other sorts of changes, like changes in the natural rate or something that might affect the inflation equation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1781	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	In terms of the precision of the estimate—we did give the 70 percent range of that estimate.	22.0	999.0
201606	1782	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	If you use it in a price equation, that particular wedge is actually surprisingly well estimated because you’re basically estimating a mean, and so the more observations you have, the precision of the mean increases reasonably rapidly.	22.0	999.0
201606	1783	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But I would agree with you.	22.0	999.0
201606	1784	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We see this issue as well with the SPF.	22.0	999.0
201606	1785	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	We don’t have a very long series for the PCE-based SPF, but if we try to use the CPI-based SPF—we don’t really know how to do that particularly well, and how you do it can really influence the results you get and what the long-term inflation forecast would be from this kind of model.	22.0	999.0
201606	1786	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	And, again, I’d emphasize that I view these longer-term inflation expectations measures as just a noisy indicator of some kind of underlying trend, which we’re not really sure even from a theoretical standpoint how that’s tied down or how that’s determined.	22.0	999.0
201606	1787	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s just something that seems to work, and a lot of people who use these sorts of measures use them because they appear to have some utility for forecasting.	22.0	999.0
201606	1788	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I’m going to play “bad cop” just for a second to your “good cop.”	22.0	999.0
201606	1789	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	All these measurement challenges are well taken.	22.0	999.0
201606	1790	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	They’re not dramatically different today than they were a couple of years ago.	22.0	999.0
201606	1791	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	And if you look at Jeremy’s panel 3 on exhibit 4, the downward trend, I think, is pretty eye catching despite the fact that, predominantly, the measurement challenges today are substantially the same as they were in 2013.	22.0	999.0
201606	1792	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Point well taken.	22.0	81.0
201606	1793	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, though.	22.0	81.0
201606	1794	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	22.0	65.0
201606	1795	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I thought of the following argument.	22.0	108.0
201606	1796	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The reason I know these things is that I once worked with the contents of the Michigan survey long ago, when I was interested in expectations.	22.0	108.0
201606	1797	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’re individually ridiculous.	22.0	108.0
201606	1798	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They range from plus 100 percent to—I’m describing the situation in 1982.	22.0	108.0
201606	1799	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Maybe it hasn’t continued.	22.0	108.0
201606	1800	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	No, it’s substantially the same.	22.0	999.0
201606	1801	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	22.0	999.0
201606	1802	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So then you could say, “Well, it was this high, but we’re taking that out, and we’re just saying that the changes are okay.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1803	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But that assumes that the changes are affected only by prices.	22.0	108.0
201606	1804	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on, but I thought what you were going to say is, “Well, yes, it’s true that their expected inflation has come down because we’ve had low inflation for a long time.	22.0	108.0
201606	1805	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’re adaptive.	22.0	108.0
201606	1806	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got adaptive expectations.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1807	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	By the way, I think any person who was not trained in statistics would look at a series for a long time and say, “Gee, I’ve been saying that it’s 20 percent, but it hasn’t been 20 percent for a while, so maybe I should take it down to 19.”	22.0	108.0
201606	1808	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You could say that the mean is moving down, and that’s what we’re really interested in.	22.0	108.0
201606	1809	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s where I thought the—	22.0	108.0
201606	1810	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Well, that’s Jeremy’s green line.	22.0	999.0
201606	1811	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But the question is, what are they actually estimating?	22.0	108.0
201606	1812	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They’ve got some vague idea of inflation.	22.0	108.0
201606	1813	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	But one question as well is, why does this longer-run expectations line stay so stable even after, say, when the recession hit?	22.0	999.0
201606	1814	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	You would expect if expectations really did react adaptively that you would probably see more of a reaction to, say, the—	22.0	999.0
201606	1815	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I would have expected to see more of a reaction, but they knew we were in strange times, and when you said, “Think ahead five years and tell us what you think,” you’re going to get an answer.	22.0	108.0
201606	1816	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’re beginning to think that these are not strange times, this is the new normal.	22.0	108.0
201606	1817	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	They, therefore, are beginning as a group to change their expectations.	22.0	108.0
201606	1818	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that may be right.	22.0	108.0
201606	1819	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It may be a justification for using this, but heaven knows what the standard error is.	22.0	108.0
201606	1820	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Well, so that’s one reason that we use a host of different measures as well as purely statistical approaches to try to filter out what is really going on with inflation’s underlying trend.	22.0	999.0
201606	1821	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	That’s actually what table 4 is trying to do.	22.0	999.0
201606	1822	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	It’s using a host of different statistical methods and different proxies for survey expectations.	22.0	999.0
201606	1823	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	To be completely honest with you, we don’t even know why this should matter for price setting.	22.0	999.0
201606	1824	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	Why should your 10-year expectation matter for price setting?	22.0	999.0
201606	1825	2016-06-15	meeting	RUDD	The best I can tell you is it seems to be a reasonable proxy for some stochastic trend in inflation.	22.0	999.0
201606	1826	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Jeremy, you’re not going to get me to defend the use of that.	22.0	108.0
201606	1827	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	22.0	108.0
201606	1828	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	22.0	65.0
201606	1829	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22.0	94.0
201606	1830	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I just had one question about exhibit 1, panel 2, which was the Blue Chip projections for the federal funds rate.	22.0	94.0
201606	1831	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I understood you to say that these are what the projections were as of June of all these years, and then you said that what actually happened in terms of unemployment and inflation was not that different from what the Blue Chip projected.	22.0	94.0
201606	1832	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	And which year was that for?	22.0	94.0
201606	1833	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Was that for all four of these?	22.0	94.0
201606	1834	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	No.	22.0	999.0
201606	1835	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	I can tell you for sure that for June 2014—	22.0	999.0
201606	1836	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	June 2014?	22.0	94.0
201606	1837	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22.0	999.0
201606	1838	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	If you look at the June 2014 expectations, for example, for CPI inflation for 2015 and the Blue Chip reports’ for average unemployment rate over the course of the year—in terms of CPI inflation, they were pretty much spot-on, and in terms of the unemployment rate, they were off by a few tenths.	22.0	999.0
201606	1839	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is two years ahead.	22.0	94.0
201606	1840	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	The June 2014 expectation for the 2015 outcome.	22.0	999.0
201606	1841	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I just want to make sure I’m reading this right.	22.0	94.0
201606	1842	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So Blue Chip projected 200 basis points of normalization as of June 2014.	22.0	94.0
201606	1843	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment and inflation came in as expected, but they got only 25 basis points of normalization—175 basis points off.	22.0	94.0
201606	1844	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That’s what you’re saying?	22.0	94.0
201606	1845	2016-06-15	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s correct.	22.0	999.0
201606	1846	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	22.0	94.0
201606	1848	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	52.0	65.0
201606	1849	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	52.0	65.0
201606	1850	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	52.0	65.0
201606	1851	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We have a reception and a dinner across the street.	52.0	65.0
201606	1852	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We will resume tomorrow at 9:00 am June 15 Session .	52.0	65.0
201606	1853	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	50.0	65.0
201606	1854	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	50.0	65.0
201606	1855	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I want to first turn things over to Brian to make a short announcement.	50.0	65.0
201606	1856	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	50.0	999.0
201606	1857	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	I’d like to note that a corrected version of one of the exhibits from yesterday’s SEP briefing has been distributed and should be on the table in front of you.	50.0	999.0
201606	1858	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The version of exhibit 3 included in yesterday’s SEP briefing package incorrectly showed the median federal funds rate projected for the end of 2017, a red horizontal line, as 1½ percent.	50.0	999.0
201606	1859	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The correct value is 1⅝ percent.	50.0	999.0
201606	1860	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	The correct value was reflected in the initial projections package distributed to the Committee on Monday.	50.0	999.0
201606	1861	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you.	50.0	999.0
201606	1862	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	1863	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think we’re ready to begin our policy—	50.0	65.0
201606	1864	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Brian, I’m not sure that what I’ve got shows 1⅝ percent.	50.0	108.0
201606	1865	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	You’re talking about the top panel?	50.0	65.0
201606	1866	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	It’s in the top panel, the one for the June projections.	50.0	999.0
201606	1867	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Sorry, I should have made that clear.	50.0	999.0
201606	1868	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	50.0	65.0
201606	1869	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our policy go-round?	23.0	65.0
201606	1870	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start with President Williams.	23.0	65.0
201606	1871	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	102.0
201606	1872	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Before I turn directly to my views on policy, I did want to make a brief comment about the memo on the new policy rule for the staff economic and financial forecast.	23.0	102.0
201606	1873	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was planning on making this comment yesterday, but our conversation moved in a different direction, so I thought it was appropriate to make it today.	23.0	102.0
201606	1874	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, I think that the approach the staff is taking is very reasonable, and that it’s important for the staff—I’ve been in the Federal Reserve for over 20 years, and it’s an ongoing issue:  How does the staff write down an assumption about policy to build a baseline forecast?	23.0	102.0
201606	1875	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think the goal here is not to tell the Committee what it should be doing but to inform the Committee that, under a basic view on monetary policy, these are the consequences in terms of the outlook.	23.0	102.0
201606	1876	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the 20 years I’ve been here, this has evolved in different ways.	23.0	102.0
201606	1877	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think this approach—which, as I understand it, is to basically have an assumption about policy that seems to be close to the Committee’s median view or something—makes sense in that it provides some clarity for all of us to understand, “Well, here’s the view of policy, and then here’s what the outlook would look like.”	23.0	102.0
201606	1878	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So there aren’t these two different things we have to figure out— what’s the staff’s view on policy, and what’s the staff’s view on the economy?—and try to discern what the two drivers of the differences in forecasts are.	23.0	102.0
201606	1879	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	That said, the real point I want to make is that we do have to be cautious in interpreting what the staff assumption is about policy—in particular, that there is a “hall of mirrors” now going on.	23.0	102.0
201606	1880	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	They’ve given us a path for policy that they think represents our views, so we have to be careful not to look at this path and maybe get comfort out of the fact that the staff’s view on policy is the same as ours.	23.0	102.0
201606	1881	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, we have all of these alternative ways of thinking about policy, with the policy rules, the optimal control experiments, and things like that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1882	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Those are important checks for thinking about how to think about the path for policy and alternatives for that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1883	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the only point I really want to make is that often I will say things, like “My views on the forecast or policy are very similar to the staff’s,” and then that coherence is somehow reassuring.	23.0	102.0
201606	1884	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, you just don’t want to do that about policy, because the staff, of course, is giving us the policy rate path that they think we essentially have in our own minds.	23.0	102.0
201606	1885	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, again, this was a very valuable change in the approach, and I just think we have to be cautious about not getting comfort out of the fact that the staff seems to agree with our views about policy.	23.0	102.0
201606	1886	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to the outlook for policy, my baseline outlook for the dual-mandate goals has changed very little since April.	23.0	102.0
201606	1887	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re essentially at full employment, and, while we continue to fall short of our inflation goal, the recent news on that front has been consistent with my forecast of a gradual return to 2 percent inflation.	23.0	102.0
201606	1888	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, all else being equal, in light of where we are on our dual-mandate goals and in light of the progress I anticipate seeing over the next year or two, I think that’s an economic situation that would call for a continued gradual removal of accommodation being appropriate.	23.0	102.0
201606	1889	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, not all else is equal.	23.0	102.0
201606	1890	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There is Brexit, and then there’s the question that we discussed at length yesterday:  What signal should we take, if any, from the May employment report?	23.0	102.0
201606	1891	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	As these are acute uncertainties, which, especially in the case of Brexit, we should have better information about in a few weeks—we will get more data on the economic outlook in terms of the labor market and, more generally, economic indicators in the next month or so—as we heard from a number of people, there’s a good argument for waiting, based on the fact that these uncertainties should resolve in the next month or two.	23.0	102.0
201606	1892	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I would reiterate that we can’t always delay.	23.0	102.0
201606	1893	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	There’s always uncertainty in the economic outlook, and should the news between now and our next meeting in July be consistent with my forecast, I expect I will be arguing that it’s time to reengage on our announced policy of a gradual removal of accommodation.	23.0	102.0
201606	1894	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the meantime, I am concerned about the message that we’re sending with alternative B the way it’s written.	23.0	102.0
201606	1895	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	My modal projection, similar to the Tealbook’s, is one of gradual policy normalization later this year.	23.0	102.0
201606	1896	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our discussion here was consistent with that view.	23.0	102.0
201606	1897	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the current version of alt-B is more dovish, if you will, even than the April statement.	23.0	102.0
201606	1898	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if you remember what happened after the April statement, the public and market participants widely viewed this as indicating that we are on an extended hold.	23.0	102.0
201606	1899	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s only after the minutes for the April meeting were released and some other public pronouncements that market participants even allowed for the possibility that there would be a rate hike at the next meeting, and I think we’re poised for a repeat performance of that.	23.0	102.0
201606	1900	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, as I understand what alt-B means in the FOMC and that’s the likely outcome, I do think it’s important, Madam Chair, to reiterate the key messages, which I believe I heard you and others say—that the outlook remains positive in terms of our dual-mandate goals.	23.0	102.0
201606	1901	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our plan for gradual policy normalization remains in place, and our decision to sit tight today reflects a careful balancing of the costs, benefits, and risks but is not a sign of a shift in strategy or a fundamental reassessment of the outlook for our policy goals.	23.0	102.0
201606	1902	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201606	1903	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1904	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just assure you that I intend, or at least I hope, to send that message in my press conference statement—that our expectation is, we remain on a gradual path that’s not fixed.	23.0	65.0
201606	1905	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It’s data dependent, but our expectation still is, over time, that some further increases will be appropriate if we do see the labor market on a solid path.	23.0	65.0
201606	1906	2016-06-15	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23.0	102.0
201606	1907	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23.0	65.0
201606	1908	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1909	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23.0	65.0
201606	1910	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201606	1911	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23.0	90.0
201606	1912	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	It is appropriate to wait to see whether the employment report was anomalous.	23.0	90.0
201606	1913	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should the Brexit vote prove uneventful, which is my expectation, and the next labor market report shows improvement, I would like to keep an open mind on appropriate policy for July.	23.0	90.0
201606	1914	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	We are now at my estimate of full employment.	23.0	90.0
201606	1915	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	As corroborating evidence, wages are now showing more of an upward trend.	23.0	90.0
201606	1916	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I am less worried about undesirably high inflation than about an unemployment rate undershoot, still the lagged effect of oil prices will soon be pushing inflation up, not down.	23.0	90.0
201606	1917	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	In view of the uncertainty about how low the equilibrium interest rate might be, I would much prefer gradual increases in rates that allow us to gauge how far we have to go.	23.0	90.0
201606	1918	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I fear that we might be forced to make much quicker increases if we greatly overshoot full employment.	23.0	90.0
201606	1919	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I mentioned yesterday, our own election is viewed by many as far riskier than the Brexit vote.	23.0	90.0
201606	1920	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am concerned that we might come to have the same view, which might make us reluctant to move in September, particularly because market participants will point to the Brexit vote as a reason we’re not moving today.	23.0	90.0
201606	1921	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, if the data improve as I expect, I would want to seriously consider a modest further removal of accommodation in July.	23.0	90.0
201606	1922	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Assurances to move later this year seem less promising than taking appropriate action relatively soon.	23.0	90.0
201606	1923	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because we’re at full employment and nearing our inflation goal, and recognizing that we have a poor record of slowing the economy just a little bit when we have fallen well below full employment, it will likely be time to act fairly soon.	23.0	90.0
201606	1924	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I favor a gradual path to normalization, we should not risk falling “behind the curve” and having to move rapidly to catch up.	23.0	90.0
201606	1925	2016-06-15	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	90.0
201606	1926	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1927	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23.0	65.0
201606	1928	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201606	1929	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	A large component of actual monetary policy is expected future monetary policy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1930	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We represent this to the public and to global financial markets via the so-called dot plot, featuring the future value of the policy rate.	23.0	94.0
201606	1931	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The current policy rate dot plot appears to be too steep.	23.0	94.0
201606	1932	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The federal funds futures markets do not believe it.	23.0	94.0
201606	1933	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	They are priced for a much shallower path of rate increases than that shown by the median dots.	23.0	94.0
201606	1934	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Our own actual pace of rate increases has been much slower than what we mapped out in the past.	23.0	94.0
201606	1935	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We only moved once in 2015.	23.0	94.0
201606	1936	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It does not seem likely to me that we’ll even move more than once in 2016.	23.0	94.0
201606	1937	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	That’s once per year.	23.0	94.0
201606	1938	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	It would take 14 years to normalize 350 basis points at this pace.	23.0	94.0
201606	1939	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Yesterday Thomas Laubach provided an example of the mismatch between the policy rate dots and reality.	23.0	94.0
201606	1940	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The 2014 June Blue Chip forecast was very accurate.	23.0	94.0
201606	1941	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The economy has evolved almost exactly as expected by Blue Chip between June 2014 and today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1942	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The Blue Chip forecasters should have also been right concerning the path of the policy rate between June 2014 and today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1943	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	But, based in part on Committee guidance, they predicted a policy rate of around 200 basis points today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1944	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	They were off by more than 150 basis points, a huge miss in this game.	23.0	94.0
201606	1945	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This mismatch between what we are saying and what we are doing is arguably wreaking havoc in global market pricing, causing unnecessary confusion over future FOMC policy, and eroding the credibility of this Committee.	23.0	94.0
201606	1946	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Why are we doing this?	23.0	94.0
201606	1947	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	First, gaps are close to zero, implying that we should set the policy rate equal to the natural rate of interest.	23.0	94.0
201606	1948	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Second, we think in terms of a long-run steady state to which the economy must converge.	23.0	94.0
201606	1949	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	All variables must trend toward the steady-state values.	23.0	94.0
201606	1950	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This implies that the policy rate has a substantial upward trend.	23.0	94.0
201606	1951	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is, in fact, reflected in our policy-rate dot plot.	23.0	94.0
201606	1952	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Even if we argue that r* is low today, it would also have to trend back toward steady state, sending the policy rate higher in tandem.	23.0	94.0
201606	1953	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What are the Committee reactions to this situation?	23.0	94.0
201606	1954	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One Committee reaction is to lower gradually the steady-state values over time.	23.0	94.0
201606	1955	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	This is a perfectly fine thing to do, but it can send a pessimistic signal about the future of the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1956	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Another reaction is to stretch out the adjustment time.	23.0	94.0
201606	1957	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve often told a headwinds story, for instance, and some of the discussion yesterday—Vice Chairman Dudley brought this up—was that the headwinds story seems to be losing credibility, as we’ve been using it ever since the end of the recession seven years ago.	23.0	94.0
201606	1958	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	What can be done?	23.0	94.0
201606	1959	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The policy rate dot plot logic puts too much weight on the idea that we “know” the long-run steady state of the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1960	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In reality, we are uncertain about the medium- and long-run outcomes for the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1961	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We need a manageable way to express this uncertainty.	23.0	94.0
201606	1962	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	One way of doing this is to adopt a regime-based approach to the description of medium- and longer-term outcomes for the economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1963	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The regime-based approach arguably allows one to describe the current situation for policy more accurately.	23.0	94.0
201606	1964	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	In particular, in the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis forecast, we argue that r†, the real return on short-term government debt, is exceptionally low due to an abnormally large liquidity premium.	23.0	94.0
201606	1965	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We put this r† at minus 137 basis points.	23.0	94.0
201606	1966	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	We use the regime-based argument to say that this value is unlikely to change over the forecast horizon, as opposed to some kind of slow mean reversion.	23.0	94.0
201606	1967	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	So r† just stays where it is over the forecast horizon.	23.0	94.0
201606	1968	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Combined with other elements of our forecast, this means that the optimal regime- dependent policy rate is just 63 basis points through the forecast horizon—that is, through the end of 2018.	23.0	94.0
201606	1969	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	There are risks to this forecast that may imply a somewhat higher policy rate over the forecast horizon, but the baseline is for an essentially flat policy rate outlook.	23.0	94.0
201606	1970	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The regime- switching approach holds out some optimism for the future, as the economy can switch back to a high-growth and lower-liquidity-premium outcome.	23.0	94.0
201606	1971	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Under the SEP submission I’ve described yesterday and today, we need only one further rate increase to get to the correct level for the policy rate, under the regime that we’re in.	23.0	94.0
201606	1972	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	I prefer to make that move on the back of good news about the US economy.	23.0	94.0
201606	1973	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	The recent jobs report was not good news, so I do not think we should move today.	23.0	94.0
201606	1974	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Accordingly, today I’m supporting alternative B as written.	23.0	94.0
201606	1975	2016-06-15	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	94.0
201606	1976	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	1977	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23.0	65.0
201606	1978	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201606	1979	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I’m fine with alternative B as written.	23.0	97.0
201606	1980	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	This is a text that hasn’t changed a lot in the past several meetings other than the normal adjustments that are made to paragraphs 1 and 2, reflecting recent developments.	23.0	97.0
201606	1981	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And I’ve actually been in the camp that has favored minimal changes, certainly to the rest of the statement, because I thought the alternative was something that leaned more toward another rate increase, which is something I haven’t favored.	23.0	97.0
201606	1982	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think we’ve got some issues to address in connection with communication, which may counsel some nontrivial changes to the statement in the not-too-distant future, including in the action paragraphs lower in the statement.	23.0	97.0
201606	1983	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll return to this topic in a moment.	23.0	97.0
201606	1984	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	First, I wanted to explain a bit more the way I am thinking about the future course of policy, and I’ll note specifically what being data dependent means for me.	23.0	97.0
201606	1985	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Essentially, I begin from the language of the Federal Reserve Act, which instructs us to seek maximum employment consistent with price stability, not some extrapolated concept of full employment that is substantially disconnected from price inflation and thereby the second part of the mandate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1986	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Among other practical implications of pursuing this goal is that more progress in the labor market is more likely to benefit groups that are more on the margins of the labor market—blacks, Hispanics, and those generally with a weaker connection to the labor market.	23.0	97.0
201606	1987	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	As explained yesterday, a flattened Phillips curve—and, insofar as one has confidence in inflation expectations as a driving factor, well-anchored inflation expectations—makes it likely that there would be ample time for measured monetary policy reactions if the economy seemed to be overheating, rather than simply chugging along, or if inflation was demonstrably, and in a nontransitory fashion, moving not just in the direction of, but actually to, the target rate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1988	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The notion that there’s enough time to react, I think, is further supported by the low equilibrium real interest rate, meaning we don’t have that far to go to reach a neutral or even restrictive position, and by some of the factors mentioned by Bill Wascher in yesterday’s session that may account for this low rate.	23.0	97.0
201606	1989	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I might, in passing, add to yesterday’s list that the aggregated fiscal policies of the world’s major economies are hardly stimulative.	23.0	97.0
201606	1990	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think one can remain agnostic in the larger debate that was joined by Presidents Bullard and Williams during yesterday’s session but still take account of important nontransitory economic characteristics and conditions that shape the environment in which we’re making monetary policy.	23.0	97.0
201606	1991	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think those do shift from time to time and from business cycle to business cycle, and, arguably, the shifts have been even greater in the wake of the crisis.	23.0	97.0
201606	1992	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So, for me, being data dependent means, in essence, looking for data that demonstrate, as I mentioned a moment ago, that inflation will get all of the way to 2 percent and then stay around that level on the basis of appropriate monetary policy adjustments.	23.0	97.0
201606	1993	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, obviously, I’ve been going along with statements that don’t really reflect that view, and it hasn’t been articulated in the minutes or elsewhere.	23.0	97.0
201606	1994	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, in and of itself, that doesn’t suggest there’s a problem.	23.0	97.0
201606	1995	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	It’s somewhat inevitable in a collective process, and neither those of us somewhat less inclined to move nor those of us somewhat more inclined to move are going to be totally comfortable with any statement that tries to walk more down the middle of the positions of the members of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201606	1996	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	The fairly significant range of views around this table make it a little more challenging.	23.0	97.0
201606	1997	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, again, I don’t think that’s, in and of itself, a problem that needs to be corrected.	23.0	97.0
201606	1998	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think the greater problem may be that the Committee’s communications—taking together the statements, minutes, and rather plentiful public comments by Committee participants—may not accurately be reflecting the views of even those closest to the middle of the Committee.	23.0	97.0
201606	1999	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	What we’re projecting to the public, I think, at some points is that we’ll raise rates at some relatively near point in the future if the economy evolves as expected.	23.0	97.0
201606	2000	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	And, particularly when this projection is augmented by the frequent references to specific meetings made publicly by members of the Committee, I think the message becomes, or is at least heard by many as suggesting, that rates will rise soon unless something pretty dramatic happens.	23.0	97.0
201606	2001	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	That is, there’s an inference that the Committee is pretty confident that the economy will evolve as it expects, since we’re only a month or two away from the meetings being discussed.	23.0	97.0
201606	2002	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But we’ve now had several occasions when things have come along—China, Brexit, and the labor market report—that, in my view, sensibly lead a majority of the Committee to want to hold back.	23.0	97.0
201606	2003	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, as President Williams mentioned a couple of minutes ago, that message then becomes confusing, particularly as these instances add up, because at that point, I think, people are having more difficulty understanding exactly what the Committee’s reaction function is.	23.0	97.0
201606	2004	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I think the center of the Committee has, in fact, had a higher hurdle regarding another rate increase than has been perceived, although I don’t think it’s as high a hurdle as the one that I would fashion.	23.0	97.0
201606	2005	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I suspect this reflects some of the underlying uneasiness about the various factors that Bill and others were mentioning yesterday.	23.0	97.0
201606	2006	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	So the pauses conform well to an approach that wants a higher degree of confidence that growth is not going to be thrown off track, but our communication is not reflecting that.	23.0	97.0
201606	2007	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I certainly don’t have the formulation to suggest right now to adjust the communication strategy to be more accurate in communicating, certainly, where the critical mass of the center of the Committee is.	23.0	97.0
201606	2008	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But I do think we need to begin working on something, unless perhaps all of the stars align and the economy starts moving ahead vigorously in the coming months.	23.0	97.0
201606	2009	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Perhaps the preferable option would be a more precise statement of what the data on which our decisions are dependent are supposed to be showing.	23.0	97.0
201606	2010	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	I guess the fallback would simply be no real guidance or not making the pretense of actually offering any guidance, but instead having a statement that was really stripped of anything resembling forward intentionality, which would kind of reflect the fact that there was a lot of disagreement and everybody was data dependent in their own terms.	23.0	97.0
201606	2011	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	But, for obvious reasons, the first path would be preferable.	23.0	97.0
201606	2012	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Now, changing toward something different than reference to the path the Committee expects the economy to follow will very probably make it more difficult for one or the other end of the spectrum that has defined the working consensus to stay on board.	23.0	97.0
201606	2013	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Ideally, of course, we would be able to find a formulation that would accomplish that, but, at some point, the efficacy of communication and the credibility costs associated with not communicating effectively might make the tradeoff—meaning some more dissent—the better of a not entirely appealing set of options.	23.0	97.0
201606	2014	2016-06-15	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	97.0
201606	2015	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2016	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23.0	65.0
201606	2017	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	103.0
201606	2018	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I can support alternative B today, in light of the sharp slowdown in employment growth in May, along with uncertainties and potential risks to our economy associated with the looming UK referendum.	23.0	103.0
201606	2019	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	My own view has been that our policy actions have not kept pace with the strengthening of the economy and our outlook for inflation and unemployment.	23.0	103.0
201606	2020	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, steps to withdraw accommodation ought to be initiated before our goals are fully reached.	23.0	103.0
201606	2021	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In view of the current level of unemployment and actual and expected increases in inflation, we look to be approaching, if not close to achieving, our mandated goals.	23.0	103.0
201606	2022	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	For that reason, I believe that, as described in alternative C, “a modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months if incoming information confirms ... expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.”	23.0	103.0
201606	2023	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	While the May employment report was particularly disappointing, I believe it should be viewed in the context of a labor market that is at or near full employment, a secularly declining labor force participation rate, and a potential growth rate that has likely fallen below 2 percent.	23.0	103.0
201606	2024	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	I would not expect to continue seeing the kinds of increases in employment we saw in the first quarter, nor should we expect broad strengthening of labor market indicators, but rather, moderate job gains consistent with maintaining full employment.	23.0	103.0
201606	2025	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	If structural factors are restraining productivity and labor force growth, our monetary policy may be pushing against the economy’s productive capacity.	23.0	103.0
201606	2026	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	In this situation, it would be appropriate, in my view, to continue gradually removing accommodation even with a lower terminal rate in mind.	23.0	103.0
201606	2027	2016-06-15	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23.0	103.0
201606	2028	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2029	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23.0	65.0
201606	2030	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2031	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	In light of the recent disappointing employment report, I am supportive of no change in the funds rate at this meeting.	23.0	999.0
201606	2032	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Inflation is only gradually returning to target, and some patience is called for as more data allow us to better assess whether the falloff in employment is transitory or a signal of a more persistent decline in the demand for labor.	23.0	999.0
201606	2033	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	With many other labor market indicators still appearing healthy, my modal outlook is for employment growth to return to a pace greater than a mere replacement rate but not to return to the robust numbers that characterized its behavior over much of last year.	23.0	999.0
201606	2034	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	If that scenario was to unfold, I would favor a move in July, conditional on the Brexit vote and subsequent market reactions.	23.0	999.0
201606	2035	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Regarding alternative B, however, my impression is that the language does not adequately prepare the public for that possibility.	23.0	999.0
201606	2036	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Most significantly, substantial intermeeting communication would be required to make July a live meeting.	23.0	999.0
201606	2037	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	If others share my view of the economy and the language, then some modification of paragraph 1 would, I think, prove useful.	23.0	999.0
201606	2038	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Specifically, I suggest that the second sentence be changed to the following:  “Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	23.0	999.0
201606	2039	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Wage growth is improving, new claims remain at low levels, and my overall reading of the JOLTS report is that the labor market remains vibrant.	23.0	999.0
201606	2040	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Now, granted, the JOLTS data are for April, as mentioned yesterday.	23.0	999.0
201606	2041	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	But I think it is unlikely that we will see a game-changing shift in May.	23.0	999.0
201606	2042	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	At least, my contacts in my region largely leave me with the opposite impression.	23.0	999.0
201606	2043	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So I am skeptical that the language in alternative B adequately leaves July on the table, and I strongly believe that the appropriate policy will require every meeting to be viewed as live.	23.0	999.0
201606	2044	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	The language in alternative C is probably a bit too aggressive for my taste.	23.0	999.0
201606	2045	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	So, with that in mind, I would like to propose alternative language in paragraph 1 for alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201606	2046	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2047	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Could you say again your suggestion?	23.0	65.0
201606	2048	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	Sure.	23.0	999.0
201606	2049	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	“Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	23.0	999.0
201606	2050	2016-06-15	meeting	HARKER	I’m just arguing for a slightly more balanced view of the labor market.	23.0	999.0
201606	2051	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2052	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kaplan.	23.0	65.0
201606	2053	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201606	2054	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I do believe we are moving closer to achieving our dual-mandate objectives regarding unemployment and inflation, and I think I would be comfortable if paragraph 1 maybe reflected that to a greater, more balanced degree.	23.0	110.0
201606	2055	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Having said that, I’m also sensitive to the fact that sluggish, longer-term US growth prospects have combined with expanded worldwide demand for safe assets and a weak and uncertain economic and political outlook abroad to put downward pressure on the real federal funds rate.	23.0	110.0
201606	2056	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	The implication for me is that monetary policy is less accommodative at a given federal funds rate setting than might have been expected previously.	23.0	110.0
201606	2057	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Global financial integration means that financial market conditions are sensitive to increases in the level of US short-term rates relative to foreign rates.	23.0	110.0
201606	2058	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And as long as the foreign economic outlook remains subdued, I am supportive of a shallower path for US interest rates.	23.0	110.0
201606	2059	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	What does all of this mean for today’s decision?	23.0	110.0
201606	2060	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I was not, specifically, as much concerned by the weak May employment report as such.	23.0	110.0
201606	2061	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	But I am worried about the fact that it was, to me, the third consecutive month of a slowing in job growth, although, I think, within the context of a strong jobs market.	23.0	110.0
201606	2062	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Also, I note the falloff in the ISM nonmanufacturing survey, and I am struck by the fact that, although different than some of the anecdotes given around the room, the anecdotal reports I am getting from business contacts are more mixed.	23.0	110.0
201606	2063	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Obviously, when you overlay on that the potential fallout from the Brexit vote, I certainly agree with being patient before removing accommodation.	23.0	110.0
201606	2064	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And if current policy is only mildly accommodative, I think we can afford to exercise some patience.	23.0	110.0
201606	2065	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Beyond this meeting, I will be in a wait-and-see mode regarding upcoming economic data that would reaffirm my GDP forecast and give me confidence in continued improvement in the jobs market as well as continued progress in reaching our 2 percent medium-term inflation target.	23.0	110.0
201606	2066	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m very open that we may, in fact, get that confirming data in the near future.	23.0	110.0
201606	2067	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	More broadly, though, I would say my assessment of conditions reinforces my view that economic policy aside from monetary policy—that is, structural reforms and fiscal policy—is going to be necessary to address key secular trends we’ve been talking about:  aging demographics; high levels of debt to GDP, which, at a minimum, make fiscal policy more difficult; the impact of globalization; and the growing effects of disruption, which are increasingly creating dislocations across industries.	23.0	110.0
201606	2068	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Examples of actions outside monetary policy include appropriate immigration reform; infrastructure spending; investment in education, particularly with an emphasis on public-private partnerships for vocational training and retraining; and a thorough review and cost-benefit analysis of regulation at the state, local, and national levels.	23.0	110.0
201606	2069	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	All of these need to be considered.	23.0	110.0
201606	2070	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	While paralysis has been prevalent over the past eight years, I believe we are now entering a phase in which policy options must be broadened beyond monetary policy.	23.0	110.0
201606	2071	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	And if I take President Bullard’s approach, to break out of this regime, I think we’re going to need actions beyond just monetary policy.	23.0	110.0
201606	2072	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	We’re going to need to find ways to increase real GDP growth.	23.0	110.0
201606	2073	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	In the meantime, debt is growing faster than nominal GDP, and therefore we are becoming more leveraged in the United States, for sure, and across advanced economies.	23.0	110.0
201606	2074	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	This will ultimately have implications for the future.	23.0	110.0
201606	2075	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Actions beyond monetary policy are going to be necessary to fuel improved GDP growth, and I think it’ll be worth noting that increasingly in the future in our public comments.	23.0	110.0
201606	2076	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	110.0
201606	2077	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2078	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23.0	65.0
201606	2079	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201606	2080	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	For today, I support alternative B, but I have to say that my support is largely because the Committee has already so strongly signaled that conditions may seem to be about right for policy renormalization to continue.	23.0	91.0
201606	2081	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m far from confident that this signal is appropriate now, but reversing course would be a very big step.	23.0	91.0
201606	2082	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Still, if conditions deteriorate sufficiently to justify seriously reconsidering the conditions required to resume renormalization, then I’d find alternative A rather attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2083	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I have to say that I’m sympathetic to Governor Tarullo’s communications concerns, his emphasis on the maximum-employment mandate, and his emphasis on data dependence as it relates to inflation.	23.0	91.0
201606	2084	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	I’m also sympathetic to President Bullard’s concern over the effect that our communications risk sort of Delphic interpretations of what we’re doing, and that every time we delay, it indicates that maybe we have less confidence that the economy is recovering as strongly.	23.0	91.0
201606	2085	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Something different might help.	23.0	91.0
201606	2086	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In particular, I’m drawn to the forward guidance in alternative A that says “The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.”	23.0	91.0
201606	2087	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It’s that 2 percent that I find attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2088	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	It would be less Delphic.	23.0	91.0
201606	2089	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Let me explain why this seems attractive.	23.0	91.0
201606	2090	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The Committee has strongly communicated that the timing and size of future adjustments to the federal funds rate will be determined by our confidence in achieving our employment and inflation objectives.	23.0	91.0
201606	2091	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	This is an appropriate outcome-based policy commitment.	23.0	91.0
201606	2092	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	An important question is, how far ahead of actual inflation should we be increasing rates?	23.0	91.0
201606	2093	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Our experience from the 1970s suggests that “falling behind the curve” risks an unacceptable overshooting of our inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2094	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Lags in both the inflation process and the effects of monetary policy on the economy play strong roles in this assessment.	23.0	91.0
201606	2095	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The 1970s are clearly an important historical lesson we will always remember.	23.0	91.0
201606	2096	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But failing to account for these lags was probably less critical than was our lack of appreciation for the slowdown in potential output and for the role of expectations in the inflationary process.	23.0	91.0
201606	2097	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Changes in potential output and inflation expectations are key to our policy discussions today as well, but we’re in a much different place now.	23.0	91.0
201606	2098	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Humility is always wise, but we certainly seem well attuned to the likelihood that potential output growth, both in the United States and around the world, has been and will likely continue to be quite weak for some time to come.	23.0	91.0
201606	2099	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With regard to inflation expectations, instead of being elevated seven years into this business expansion, today we face a strong risk that expectations may persistently fall short of our 2 percent target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2100	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	There also is a sense in which today’s downside risks to inflation expectations are distinctly different than the upside risks in the 1970s.	23.0	91.0
201606	2101	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Back then, the risks probably came from the public’s doubt that we would do the right thing and bring inflation under control.	23.0	91.0
201606	2102	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	The public worried that we lacked the courage to stabilize inflation at a reasonable level.	23.0	91.0
201606	2103	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Today, with the lower bound still staring us in the face, the public may think we lack the ability to stabilize inflation at our target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2104	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That kind of possibility really worries me.	23.0	91.0
201606	2105	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	So, for me, the language in alternative A has a lot going for it.	23.0	91.0
201606	2106	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In order to have strong enough confidence that the United States will get to 2 percent inflation, it may be best to hold off raising interest rates until we are at 2 percent on a sustained basis.	23.0	91.0
201606	2107	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	First, the sluggish world economy argues that equilibrium rates are low and likely to rise only slowly.	23.0	91.0
201606	2108	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	With an unchanged federal funds rate target, sustained higher inflation would be one signal that the current low rate has become overly accommodative whenever r* is on the increase.	23.0	91.0
201606	2109	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	If r* increases markedly and inflation rises, policy rates should track these improvements to the degree appropriate.	23.0	91.0
201606	2110	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Second, such a commitment could be necessary to solidify currently low inflation expectations and allow expectations to increase and assert an upward pull on actual inflation.	23.0	91.0
201606	2111	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	As I noted yesterday, if this does not occur, I doubt the upward force from other factors will be adequate to bring inflation back to target over the forecast period.	23.0	91.0
201606	2112	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Third, with downside risks large, losing credibility on the downside would make it all that more difficult to reach our inflation target.	23.0	91.0
201606	2113	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	In view of how close we are to the lower bound, the most effective policy available to counter these risks is forward guidance that powerfully articulates our commitment to hitting our symmetric 2 percent inflation target sooner rather than later.	23.0	91.0
201606	2114	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Language in alt-A does that better.	23.0	91.0
201606	2115	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	As many have also said, on the other side of the ledger, the upside risks on inflation seem much smaller.	23.0	91.0
201606	2116	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Currently, financial market bets on core inflation rising above 2½ percent are minimal, and the odds on 3 or 4 percent are truly small.	23.0	91.0
201606	2117	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Would such upside risks increase substantially under alternative A?	23.0	91.0
201606	2118	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Golly, the purpose would be to move inflation expectations up, so I hope so.	23.0	91.0
201606	2119	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	That’s not currently likely, in view of the shallow path of market expectations today.	23.0	91.0
201606	2120	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	And when inflation does rise more sustainably to 2 percent, we know how to respond.	23.0	91.0
201606	2121	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Where does this leave us?	23.0	91.0
201606	2122	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Asymmetric risks, asymmetric policy tools, and risk management—to me, they all come down to being very patient in our normalization process.	23.0	91.0
201606	2123	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	My alt-B-consistent SEP submission has one 25 basis point increase in the funds rate this year, three next year, and four in 2018.	23.0	91.0
201606	2124	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Although I see the argument for altering my policy-rate assumption, notably along the lines of alternative A, I take this Committee’s previous communications very seriously.	23.0	91.0
201606	2125	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, since today I think a funds rate range of 50 to 75 basis points at the end of 2016 may be okay, I wouldn’t dissent over alternative B–like slow and gradual increases, which are not too much steeper than mine, as long as the relevant outcomes are close enough to both mandate responsibilities.	23.0	91.0
201606	2126	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	But if more adverse developments occur than we have assumed in the Tealbook, then I think it would be time to bring something like alternative A onto the table for discussion.	23.0	91.0
201606	2127	2016-06-15	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	91.0
201606	2128	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2129	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23.0	65.0
201606	2130	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201606	2131	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B as written.	23.0	104.0
201606	2132	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	As to President Harker’s proposed language, I’ll just say that I don’t think it’s unreasonable.	23.0	104.0
201606	2133	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	But to shift in the direction of taking positive signal from a decline in the unemployment rate that is driven entirely by a decline in participation is probably not the right thing.	23.0	104.0
201606	2134	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	I think I would see it as a healthier thing if participation had remained high rather than dropping significantly.	23.0	104.0
201606	2135	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	So I prefer the current language.	23.0	104.0
201606	2136	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	My baseline narrative is still for 2 percent growth and job creation continuing at a healthy pace.	23.0	104.0
201606	2137	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	But the recent weakening in job creation has materially increased uncertainty about the underlying state and momentum of the economy.	23.0	104.0
201606	2138	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To see a case for moving at the July meeting, I would need some confirming evidence that the April and May employment reports, taken together, are anomalous.	23.0	104.0
201606	2139	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	It would be particularly helpful to see upward revisions for those months as well as a strong labor report for June.	23.0	104.0
201606	2140	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In addition, polls suggest an increasing chance that the Brexit vote will be in favor of leaving the EU.	23.0	104.0
201606	2141	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	There could well be significant market reaction, and, although I don’t see this as anything like a systemic event, that outcome could be another factor calling for patience in July on the Committee’s part.	23.0	104.0
201606	2142	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	As of now, the market is currently pricing in about a 15 percent possibility of a move at the July meeting, and that feels about right to me.	23.0	104.0
201606	2143	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	To move ahead with a program of gradual tightening, I would want to be confident of continued labor market strength, with an increase in payroll jobs of at least 150,000 or 175,000.	23.0	104.0
201606	2144	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	In view of the uncertainty generated by the apparent break in the level of job creation, I’d be inclined to let the data clarify things for a while before raising the federal funds rate again.	23.0	104.0
201606	2145	2016-06-15	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	104.0
201606	2146	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2147	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23.0	65.0
201606	2148	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201606	2149	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to first make my policy round statement and then add a few comments on the discussion we’re also having about our overall strategy.	23.0	108.0
201606	2150	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our discussion yesterday made it clear that we need to take time to await both the Brexit decision on Thursday, June 23, and further evidence on the significance of the extremely low payroll data we received on June 3.	23.0	108.0
201606	2151	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The FOMC meeting after this one is on July 26 and 27.	23.0	108.0
201606	2152	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	By then, we’ll have had over a month to absorb and, if necessary, to react to the results of the Brexit vote.	23.0	108.0
201606	2153	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’ll have had two and a half weeks to absorb the payrolls data that will be published on Friday, July 8, as well as the other economic and financial information, including data on June retail and motor vehicle sales and data on May capital goods and trade, that we will receive over the intermeeting period.	23.0	108.0
201606	2154	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Although the odds are that we will not have enough evidence by the time of the July meeting to justify a decision to change the interest rate, we should be careful in our communications not to rule out a July decision until we’ve had time to discuss and analyze the incoming data and to make a well-based decision as to whether to move in July or to await additional information on the economic outlook.	23.0	108.0
201606	2155	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	On that score, I’d emphasize that we’re close to our full employment objective, that the underlying pace of inflation is not far from 2 percent, and that our best guess at the value of the equilibrium real federal funds rate is near but above zero.	23.0	108.0
201606	2156	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Depending on the data, it could be appropriate to take another cautious policy step in July.	23.0	108.0
201606	2157	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that’s the statement I prepared for this, and I think it is consistent with what most people have said.	23.0	108.0
201606	2158	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to take up for a few minutes the discussion that has been developing over the overall strategy, and let me start with the hall-of-mirrors phrase of President Williams, which, when I first heard about that problem, was described as the “monkey in the mirror” problem.	23.0	108.0
201606	2159	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And you described it very well as an interaction between what the staff says and what we say.	23.0	108.0
201606	2160	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The staff made, in my mind, one change that we really all noticed and which possibly nearly all took into account—namely, they lowered their r* estimate by ¼ percentage point.	23.0	108.0
201606	2161	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	The SEP median long-run federal funds rate number also went down by ¼ percentage point.	23.0	108.0
201606	2162	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure whether we could find out what the influence of the staff’s reduction was on what people wrote down in the SEP, but I suspect there was some influence.	23.0	108.0
201606	2163	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What I’d like to get to is the issue that we’re on:  What are we looking for?	23.0	108.0
201606	2164	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s a tradition in the United States that you get going on a long path that moves in one direction for a very long time.	23.0	108.0
201606	2165	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t engage in interest rates that go up, then sometimes go down on the path, and then go up on the path, although we may be in a situation today where, if that was the way we were thinking, we’d be more willing to reduce the rate to deal with a little local disturbance and to see where it takes us than in the mindset we all have.	23.0	108.0
201606	2166	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Are we for raising the rate to 3 percent, or are we for reducing it to the effective lower bound?	23.0	108.0
201606	2167	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s what we implicitly are thinking about when we’re discussing whether we want to raise the rate or whether we don’t.	23.0	108.0
201606	2168	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And I have some sympathy for what I’ve heard from Governor Tarullo, from President Bullard, and from almost everyone who spoke of the view that this is a situation where, if we were willing to go up and down from time to time along the path we’re taking, we’d possibly do better.	23.0	108.0
201606	2169	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that’s fine-tuning.	23.0	108.0
201606	2170	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, for those of us who grew up with radios before they had buttons, fine-tuning is actually something that’s desirable.	23.0	108.0
201606	2171	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	You really want to hit the station on the nose, not approximately.	23.0	108.0
201606	2172	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So let’s leave the emotional baggage that comes with fine-tuning: “These guys are always trying to get the economy precisely where they want it—terrible guys,” which is the sort of story we’re being told about fine-tuning.	23.0	108.0
201606	2173	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We know that we will get to the steady state with the feedback rules we’re using now.	23.0	108.0
201606	2174	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We won’t be doing it by reference to a path that leads in three and a quarter years, or however many years it is, to the steady state that we’re looking for.	23.0	108.0
201606	2175	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But the steady state of a model that has a monetary feedback rule of the sort we’re using will end up at the steady state that these steady paths take us to.	23.0	108.0
201606	2176	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I keep wondering whether we shouldn’t be a little more willing to go up and to go down.	23.0	108.0
201606	2177	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	There’s the same point, incidentally, just as a footnote to a footnote, that you should be willing to move when you’re near the lower bound.	23.0	108.0
201606	2178	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If you’re willing to go back down after you’ve moved up, then it’s no big deal moving up if that’s what looks like reasonably the right thing to do at the moment.	23.0	108.0
201606	2179	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	If you’re not willing to go down, then you’re in a whole other world in which you’ve got to look all of the way through to the end of the horizon, and I don’t think we need to take that viewpoint.	23.0	108.0
201606	2180	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, that would be a reasonably radical change in the way the FOMC has always behaved.	23.0	108.0
201606	2181	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So I’m talking about it not with the idea of asking anybody to accept that possibility tomorrow morning or at the next meeting, but to put it in people’s heads that we really need to think about whether what we’re doing each time we vote is deciding where we’re going over the next three years or deciding where we’re going over the next two months.	23.0	108.0
201606	2182	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I don’t think we need to decide where we’re going over the next three years.	23.0	108.0
201606	2183	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We’d have to keep the markets informed of what we’re doing—that we’re not going off on these long treks to the steady state—and ask ourselves whether there’s anything wrong with that approach as opposed to the one we’re doing.	23.0	108.0
201606	2184	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And this has now come back to the hall of mirrors.	23.0	108.0
201606	2185	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our thinking—well, I have to speak only for myself.	23.0	108.0
201606	2186	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not allowed to refer to what other people on the Committee think.	23.0	108.0
201606	2187	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Is that right, Madam Chair?	23.0	108.0
201606	2188	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	You can in here.	23.0	65.0
201606	2189	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	In here I can do it.	23.0	108.0
201606	2190	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Not outside.	23.0	65.0
201606	2191	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our thinking is heavily influenced by the nature of the forecast that we get from the staff in the SEP process.	23.0	108.0
201606	2192	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Those forecasts are monotonic approaches to the steady state, and I’m not sure that it’s the best strategy to operate in that way.	23.0	108.0
201606	2193	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What you’re doing with fine-tuning is a strategy that most of us know is called hill climbing.	23.0	108.0
201606	2194	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Hill climbing says that you change gears when you go up and you change gears when you go down, and what you do depends on what you encounter en route.	23.0	108.0
201606	2195	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Economies get buffeted around, and it doesn’t mean that when we see a—let’s suppose that Brexit was a bigger deal than it is now.	23.0	108.0
201606	2196	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It would have been rational in facing a big thing like Brexit to say, “Okay, we’re going to take the rate down for a while because we may have to deal with this problem, but we don’t intend to keep it down forever.	23.0	108.0
201606	2197	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s not a sign that we’re heading off in the direction of the effective lower bound.”	23.0	108.0
201606	2198	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	That’s footnote 1.	23.0	108.0
201606	2199	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Footnote 2 is, I had a discussion with Jeremy Rudd yesterday, in which I think I wasn’t accurate enough, and I just want to come back to it.	23.0	108.0
201606	2200	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	See, the trouble is, I took a shower between yesterday and today, and I tend to think in the shower but not elsewhere.	23.0	108.0
201606	2201	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So here we are.	23.0	108.0
201606	2203	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	This is what I really wanted to say about fixed long-term expectations of inflation and what’s happening in the Michigan survey.	23.0	108.0
201606	2204	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think that we put far too much emphasis on the fixity of long-run expectations, and that it is not stupid in a model with learning to have the expected inflation rate react to actual inflation.	23.0	108.0
201606	2205	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Now, you could call that adaptive expectations and get all upset because it’s not optimal, but there are models in which it is optimal.	23.0	108.0
201606	2206	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	My view is that people should, after several years, actually begin to pay attention to the environment and say, “My gosh, maybe we’re not actually going back to the target rate now, over the next three years, or over the next five years.”	23.0	108.0
201606	2207	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Furthermore, our world of inflation will not come to an end if the expected inflation rate starts moving.	23.0	108.0
201606	2208	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	We just have to deal with that, and we deal with it by probably making our policy a little more active and a little stronger in relation to what’s going on.	23.0	108.0
201606	2209	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But it’s not the end of the world.	23.0	108.0
201606	2210	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Models work when people’s expectations change, and we’ve got ourselves into a situation that I think is implausible.	23.0	108.0
201606	2211	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It requires the public to hold its expectation of the five-year inflation rate fixed.	23.0	108.0
201606	2212	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	I think that the expectation may stay fixed only because somebody’s put a number out there and, when asked the question “What is it going to be 10 years from now?” they say, “Well, I don’t know, but those guys say they’re going to keep it at 2 percent, so, well, I’ll write down 2 percent.	23.0	108.0
201606	2213	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Am I certain that the Congress is not going to change the Federal Reserve law?	23.0	108.0
201606	2214	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Well, I’d like to be,” et cetera.	23.0	108.0
201606	2215	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	So there are lots of reasons to think that the 2 percent we write down is not the only number that could be there if we asked people a whole series of other questions.	23.0	108.0
201606	2216	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	What I should have said yesterday was, we shouldn’t be so worried about a move in the expected inflation rate, because that’s how people ought to behave.	23.0	108.0
201606	2217	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	And it’s rational to base your expectations on what’s actually happening, particularly when it’s been going on for a very long time.	23.0	108.0
201606	2218	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Our models should possibly even include that, and we could deal with that.	23.0	108.0
201606	2219	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	It would have some implications for the optimal policies of the moment, and it might tie in with the first footnote I was talking about.	23.0	108.0
201606	2220	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	But I can see, Madam Chair, that I’ve used my spare time from my very short introductory statement to—	23.0	108.0
201606	2221	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, fortunately, we have lots of time.	23.0	65.0
201606	2222	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Very good comments.	23.0	65.0
201606	2223	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	23.0	108.0
201606	2224	2016-06-15	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	108.0
201606	2225	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	That gives us a lot to think about.	23.0	65.0
201606	2226	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23.0	65.0
201606	2227	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2228	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In light of my outlook and the risks, I believe a gradual upward path of interest rates over the forecast horizon remains appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2229	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In terms of the statement, I prefer alternative C.	23.0	999.0
201606	2230	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I believe its characterization of economic developments over the intermeeting period is more reflective of my views.	23.0	999.0
201606	2231	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	In my view, alternative B has a more negative tone that places too much weight on the disappointing May employment report.	23.0	999.0
201606	2232	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Also, unlike alternative C, alternative B doesn’t acknowledge the increase in inflation we’ve been seeing over time.	23.0	999.0
201606	2233	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I also prefer alternative C’s language in paragraph 3 about the anticipated path of the policy rate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2234	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The language does not lock the Committee in.	23.0	999.0
201606	2235	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	It still conveys the message that our policy actions are dependent on how the economy evolves, but it makes it clear that if the data remain consistent with the Committee’s expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, then the Committee will likely make another increase in the federal funds rate target in coming months.	23.0	999.0
201606	2236	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	And this seems to be consistent with the SEP median path.	23.0	999.0
201606	2237	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	More generally, I’m becoming increasingly concerned that the FOMC statements are not providing enough information to help the public understand the Committee’s reaction function— that is, its systematic reaction to incoming information that changes the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2238	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	As I’ve said at previous meetings, while the statement’s first paragraph delineates some of the changes in incoming information observed since the preceding meeting, it does little to suggest how that information has affected the outlook or how the Committee is translating that information into action or inaction.	23.0	999.0
201606	2239	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The danger of leaving the statement vague is that it gives the impression that the Committee is acting in a discretionary manner.	23.0	999.0
201606	2240	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Instead, I believe it’s crucial that we react to the data in a systematic and disciplined way, using our models and analytics to decipher incoming information and its implications for the outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2241	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	This systematic approach is critical to making the best policy decisions and to effectively communicating to the public our decisions and rationale for those decisions.	23.0	999.0
201606	2242	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Committee continues to indicate that it views a gradual upward path of rates as appropriate and consistent with our outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2243	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The SEP suggests that most participants continue to view such a path as appropriate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2244	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	The Committee has acknowledged there are uncertainties, but it has not suggested to the public that its outlook has materially changed.	23.0	999.0
201606	2245	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Yet we are very reluctant, in light of the uncertainties, to take another step on the gradual path.	23.0	999.0
201606	2246	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	How long can we keep the statement and policy in stasis without undermining our credibility?	23.0	999.0
201606	2247	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	If the Committee’s views have changed and the consensus view now is that policy is likely to be on hold for quite some time, then we need to communicate that to the public in a transparent way rather than relying on a vague statement like alternative B.	23.0	999.0
201606	2248	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	And if, as Governor Tarullo says, that delivers more dissent, so be it.	23.0	999.0
201606	2249	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Were it not for the upcoming Brexit vote, with its potential for increased volatility and disruption in financial markets, I would be advocating increasing the rate at this meeting, on the basis of the economic outlook.	23.0	999.0
201606	2250	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	I can go along with holding off at this meeting, but if the data continue to support the current outlook, I believe it will be appropriate to raise the funds rate very soon.	23.0	999.0
201606	2251	2016-06-15	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	999.0
201606	2252	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2253	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23.0	65.0
201606	2254	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201606	2255	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The discussion today occurs under the long shadow cast by the May employment report.	23.0	81.0
201606	2256	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	As I pointed out yesterday, how one interprets the apparent slowdown in employment growth has strong implications for policy and for how our statement should read.	23.0	81.0
201606	2257	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I argued yesterday that the evidence favored the view that job growth is being restrained increasingly by binding labor market constraints rather than an undesired slowdown in demand in the face of continued labor market slack.	23.0	81.0
201606	2258	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Accordingly, I think we should use the statement to communicate to the public that somewhat lower future employment growth is likely to be consistent with achieving our mandate for maximum sustainable employment and does not necessarily call for an easier policy rate path.	23.0	81.0
201606	2259	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	To the extent that lower employment growth reflects tighter resource constraints, then more rapid increases in the funds rate are going to be warranted.	23.0	81.0
201606	2260	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	With this in mind, I have some suggestions.	23.0	81.0
201606	2261	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	When our policy statement refers to improvement in labor market conditions, as it does in paragraphs 1 and 3 of alternative B, it implies that there is still a meaningful employment gap monetary policy can and should counteract.	23.0	81.0
201606	2262	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But that seems at odds with the SEP, as the median unemployment rate in the SEP is below the median longer-run normal level.	23.0	81.0
201606	2263	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I think it would have been appropriate to back away from this type of language even without the low May employment growth number.	23.0	81.0
201606	2264	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That number makes the issue more urgent, though, because it suggests that further improvement in labor market conditions may not be desirable or even attainable in the near term.	23.0	81.0
201606	2265	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Alternative C contains some constructive changes along these lines.	23.0	81.0
201606	2266	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Paragraph 2 drops the word “strengthen,” and it states that employment growth “will expand at moderate rates,” instead of “labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2267	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And paragraph 3 of alternative C states that “the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further strengthening in labor market conditions,” instead of “further improvement in labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2268	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The word “strengthening” is better than “improvement,” in my mind, but I think both words imply the existence of a gap relative to some normative benchmark.	23.0	81.0
201606	2269	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So, as an alternative to the second sentence in alt-B(3), I’d propose that we say “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a return to 2 percent inflation in the context of stable labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2270	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Or we could say “in the context of continued employment growth.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2271	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This formulation would convey that we no longer view ourselves as closing positive labor resource utilization gaps.	23.0	81.0
201606	2272	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	In light of the fact that, for the SEP, all but one participant wrote down longer-run unemployment rates greater than or equal to the current unemployment rate, I think this is a change that almost all of us should support—if not at this meeting, then very soon.	23.0	81.0
201606	2273	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, I think there’s a need to pay heed to our most recent intermeeting experience with communication.	23.0	81.0
201606	2274	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	My recollection of our April discussion was that our intention was for the April statement to signal that a June move was clearly on the table, and that it would be appropriate if the data flow was reasonably close to our expectations.	23.0	81.0
201606	2275	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Yet markets came out of that meeting placing very little probability on us moving in June, at least until the release of the April minutes, and my fear is that alternative B as written is likely to have as little effect on market expectations as the April statement and will still leave, again, a sizable gap between market views and the Committee’s expectations.	23.0	81.0
201606	2276	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I’d favor communicating more forcefully about our intention to raise rates, as in the language in paragraph 3 of alternative C, which says that “a modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2277	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Alternatively, President Harker’s suggestion is attractive to me.	23.0	81.0
201606	2278	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I recognize Governor Powell’s observation about the decline in the unemployment rate being attributable to a decline in the labor force participation rate.	23.0	81.0
201606	2279	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The other perspective on that confluence is that the upward move in labor force participation in recent months was anomalous itself and we’re back on trend with respect to labor force participation.	23.0	81.0
201606	2280	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	This unemployment rate of 4.7 percent is more consistent with that broad movement.	23.0	81.0
201606	2281	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I again want to follow up on something President Williams said, this time about the staff’s memo on the new policy rule.	23.0	81.0
201606	2282	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I take it that the economy affects policy via the reaction function, and that policy rules and reaction functions affect the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2283	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And outcomes are the joint product of the interaction of the two.	23.0	81.0
201606	2284	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I can understand the staff realigning their assumption about the reaction function and aligning theirs with the Committee’s more closely.	23.0	81.0
201606	2285	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That makes perfect sense.	23.0	81.0
201606	2286	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But the staff didn’t alter their forecast.	23.0	81.0
201606	2287	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	They made an offsetting change in their implied assessment of the effect of monetary policy on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2288	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I take as a supposition that they provide us with their own best independent assessment of the effects of alternative monetary policy strategies in the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2289	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I know the Committee members are smart, but we’re not that smart, and that’s why we need an outstanding professional staff like the one we have.	23.0	81.0
201606	2290	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	So I hope that they feel as if they can provide us with their own best judgment rather than adopting our implied assessment of the effects of policy on the economy.	23.0	81.0
201606	2291	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	23.0	81.0
201606	2292	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, would you read again your proposed change in paragraph 3?	23.0	65.0
201606	2293	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	“The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative”—what?	23.0	65.0
201606	2294	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I’d be delighted, Madam Chair.	23.0	81.0
201606	2295	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	“The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a return to 2 percent inflation in the context of stable labor market conditions.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2296	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	And I also offered a variant.	23.0	81.0
201606	2297	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	We could say “in the context of continued employment growth.”	23.0	81.0
201606	2298	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Madam Chair, may I clarify one aspect of the handling of the change in the policy rule and its role in the forecast?	23.0	999.0
201606	2299	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, please.	23.0	65.0
201606	2300	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	There were two components.	23.0	999.0
201606	2301	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	One was an adjustment to the long-run r*, and for that one, indeed, we took the long-run r* down by 25 basis points and didn’t allow that to show through in the form of greater strength in aggregate demand, because it was our assessment that that reflected a change in our view about what level of interest rates would be consistent with attainment and maintenance of the dual mandate.	23.0	999.0
201606	2302	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	We did allow the other one, the adjustment to the intercept in the near term, to show through to the forecast.	23.0	999.0
201606	2303	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it does so in line with FRB/US simulations, and those simulations indicate that the effect on the near-term outlook for economic activity and inflation is very modest.	23.0	999.0
201606	2304	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But it is there in principle, and I think that’s important to note.	23.0	999.0
201606	2305	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, we spent a great deal of time thinking as well about the hall of mirrors.	23.0	999.0
201606	2306	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	I think the fact that we have kept track of the influence of the change in the profile of the short rate and reflected that in the economic projection provides some reassurance, although I take the point very seriously that we need to be careful about engaging in sort of a hall of mirrors.	23.0	999.0
201606	2307	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	But if the policy that we use to construct the baseline would, in our judgment, drive economic activity away from attainment of the dual mandate, we’ll do our level best to show that.	23.0	999.0
201606	2308	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	The last point I’d like to make is that the policy rule—very deliberately, I think—has never been meant to have an element of optimality or staff recommendation.	23.0	999.0
201606	2309	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, we’ve shied away very much from that.	23.0	999.0
201606	2310	2016-06-15	meeting	WILCOX	It’s our view that you’re not looking to us in Tealbook A to recommend an optimal monetary policy but to give you a sensible vehicle to use as a foil for your discussion.	23.0	999.0
201606	2311	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much, David.	23.0	81.0
201606	2312	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That was a really helpful clarification.	23.0	81.0
201606	2313	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate it.	23.0	81.0
201606	2314	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Kashkari.	23.0	65.0
201606	2315	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201606	2316	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I am comfortable with alternative B, and, like many members of the Committee, I want to see how the labor market evolves—how much of what we recently saw was noise and how much was signal.	23.0	111.0
201606	2317	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	As I mentioned yesterday, I’m also thinking a lot about what we’re seeing in the global economy.	23.0	111.0
201606	2318	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	As others have noted, inflation can be global or it can be local.	23.0	111.0
201606	2319	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	In the 1970s, we saw high global inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2320	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Today we’re seeing low global inflation, with many major economies at or below the zero lower bound.	23.0	111.0
201606	2321	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I’m trying to understand what this global inflation and this global context mean for the risks that we face in our decisions, and I think about four different scenarios.	23.0	111.0
201606	2322	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	One scenario is that the whole world reverses and we see increasing inflation globally in the next few years.	23.0	111.0
201606	2323	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	This strikes me as quite unlikely, though not impossible.	23.0	111.0
201606	2324	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think it would be a positive development, and we all agree that central banks have the necessary tools to keep inflation in check.	23.0	111.0
201606	2325	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A second scenario, which also seems quite unlikely to me, is that the United States experiences increasing inflation while the rest of the world is stuck effectively at zero.	23.0	111.0
201606	2326	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Again, I would argue that this would be a positive development, and we have the tools and the will necessary to keep inflation in check.	23.0	111.0
201606	2327	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	A third scenario would be that the rest of the world experiences high inflation and we’re stuck with low inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2328	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	I think this is extremely unlikely.	23.0	111.0
201606	2329	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	But then the final and most likely scenario, in my mind, is that the world continues to experience low inflation globally.	23.0	111.0
201606	2330	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	We all acknowledge that central banks have fewer tools to address this than to address high inflation.	23.0	111.0
201606	2331	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	For me, in light of these scenarios and the asymmetric risks associated with them, I don’t see a compelling reason to “normalize” rates for the sake of normalizing them in the absence of sustained increases in inflation, inflation expectations, or financial-stability risks.	23.0	111.0
201606	2332	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	To me, unless something changes, raising rates in this context wouldn’t be normalizing them.	23.0	111.0
201606	2333	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	It would be “abnormalizing” them.	23.0	111.0
201606	2334	2016-06-15	meeting	KASHKARI	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	111.0
201606	2335	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2336	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23.0	65.0
201606	2337	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201606	2338	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B, and I’m comfortable with the statement as written.	23.0	88.0
201606	2339	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	While my outlook for the economy has not changed materially since the April meeting, the mixed and sometimes conflicting information received over the intermeeting period definitely leaves me questioning somewhat more the underlying strength of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201606	2340	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So I think it’s sensible to wait for more information over the coming weeks in hopes of arriving at greater clarity about the true health of the economy.	23.0	88.0
201606	2341	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Given that leaning, the uncertainty regarding the Brexit matter makes it easy for me to support alternative B.	23.0	88.0
201606	2342	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	If the domestic economy was unambiguous and positive—that is, if we had a less concerning May employment report—it would be a harder call, in my opinion, and I would probably support action today, as President Mester suggested.	23.0	88.0
201606	2343	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Looking ahead to the July meeting, I think Governor Tarullo described the situation very well.	23.0	88.0
201606	2344	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I could even call it something of a dilemma.	23.0	88.0
201606	2345	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I come out at a little different place, but I very much appreciate the description of the communication issues that we’re facing.	23.0	88.0
201606	2346	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	My starting point is a bias—call that a soft lean—in favor of moving at the July meeting, while I would indicate with that little about any subsequent rate increases.	23.0	88.0
201606	2347	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll be looking at the second-quarter GDP picture, which will firm up—that is, the confidence interval around the ultimate reading will narrow—as the meeting approaches.	23.0	88.0
201606	2348	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	And I’ll be looking closely at the June employment report, of course.	23.0	88.0
201606	2349	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	A number for the jobs report of 150,000 net of the Verizon effect was mentioned yesterday, and Governor Powell mentioned it a few moments ago, along with some other criteria.	23.0	88.0
201606	2350	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	That strikes me as reasonable.	23.0	88.0
201606	2351	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s above the number required to cover labor force growth.	23.0	88.0
201606	2352	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Since there will be, relatively speaking, a dearth of data before the July meeting, it appears that a lot is going to ride on the June employment report.	23.0	88.0
201606	2353	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	We collectively may have to work hard to position what an acceptable employment report will be.	23.0	88.0
201606	2354	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	How an acceptable employment report is framed in the context of other data, particularly the data that speak to growth momentum, may very well be the factor that swings our decision in July.	23.0	88.0
201606	2355	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	The approach I intend to apply is to look for evidence that invalidates my baseline assumptions about the path of the economy, as opposed to an approach that requires something like building the case for a move from a zero base.	23.0	88.0
201606	2356	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	This may be a somewhat lower bar than that applied by some of my colleagues around the table.	23.0	88.0
201606	2357	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’d like to express a broad concern.	23.0	88.0
201606	2358	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned that we’re dealing with economic conditions that will likely be ambiguous, and there will always be data that give some pause.	23.0	88.0
201606	2359	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	So my posture in the next few weeks will be a soft lean in favor of a rate increase in July while watching for evidence that disproves my assumption that the economy is on a steady path.	23.0	88.0
201606	2360	2016-06-15	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	88.0
201606	2361	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2362	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23.0	65.0
201606	2363	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201606	2364	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B with no changes.	23.0	107.0
201606	2365	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	The mixed data we have in hand to date could plausibly be consistent with very different scenarios for the outlook—one in which resource constraints are binding, one in which we’re seeing the beginning of a downshift in activity, and one in which we continue to make very slow progress.	23.0	107.0
201606	2366	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Each of these scenarios would call for a very different policy response.	23.0	107.0
201606	2367	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	I thus want to be sensitive to the consequences if the economy evolves in a way consistent with a different economic scenario than assumed, as well as the risks.	23.0	107.0
201606	2368	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In determining appropriate policy, we’re going to need to assess not just what scenario best describes the incoming data, but also what risks are associated with that particular path.	23.0	107.0
201606	2369	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	While there are upside risks to inflation in the scenario featuring binding resource constraints, I believe we’re relatively well positioned, relying solely on conventional policy, to deal with this eventuality.	23.0	107.0
201606	2370	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, I continue to see downside risks to both inflation and activity that would pose greater challenges to sole reliance on conventional policy, due to the asymmetry prevailing near the effective lower bound in the other two scenarios.	23.0	107.0
201606	2371	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me spend a moment on each of these.	23.0	107.0
201606	2372	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Suppose the outlook turns out to be best described as increasingly subject to binding resource constraints that imply that inflationary pressures in the period ahead are larger than we currently anticipate while labor market improvement slows notably.	23.0	107.0
201606	2373	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Arguably, we have ample room to adjust to such a contingency using conventional tools that are well calibrated, on the basis of ample historical experience.	23.0	107.0
201606	2374	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Especially in view of the depressed global environment, if markets came to expect a steeper policy rate path here than in other countries, this greater divergence in rates would be expected to have a strong effect on the dollar, which would reinforce our policy rate path.	23.0	107.0
201606	2375	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, the evidence the staff has presented suggests that, over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to those kinds of anticipated changes.	23.0	107.0
201606	2376	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, I would expect the policy shift needed to address greater-than-expected inflationary pressures to be relatively moderate.	23.0	107.0
201606	2377	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, a possible danger is that the path of policy needed to respond would be so steep and the policy change so abrupt that it would tip the economy into recession.	23.0	107.0
201606	2378	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	But such a scenario would likely occur only if inflation expectations became unanchored or if the rise in inflation was quite rapid.	23.0	107.0
201606	2379	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For a variety of reasons that people have spoken about around this table, that seems pretty unlikely.	23.0	107.0
201606	2380	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, if we think that additional data are likely to validate a downshift in activity or even continued slow progress, when the economy is hit by an adverse shock, such as financial turbulence in response to an unexpected Brexit vote outcome or a reemergence of financial stress associated with China’s exchange rate or financial imbalances, in responding to such events we might need to rely on unconventional policies, which are less tested and themselves likely to be subject to constraints.	23.0	107.0
201606	2381	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, fiscal policy is likely to be constrained.	23.0	107.0
201606	2382	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, the risk the economy faces from negative demand shocks is greater than that faced from positive shocks in the presence of steeply sloped supply curves.	23.0	107.0
201606	2383	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	My sense of the danger of downside risks is informed by the other side of the cautionary- tale spectrum that President Evans was referring to—in particular, the experience of two other major advanced economies, Japan and the euro area.	23.0	107.0
201606	2384	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Most observers would likely conclude in hindsight that monetary policy should have been more forceful earlier on in counteracting weak demand.	23.0	107.0
201606	2385	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	For a variety of reasons, it didn’t happen.	23.0	107.0
201606	2386	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	It could be that some policymakers thought that if the forces holding down demand and inflation were stronger and more persistent than expected, more accommodative policy could be pursued farther down the road.	23.0	107.0
201606	2387	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	But perhaps few anticipated how difficult it would be to move inflation back to target in such a contingency.	23.0	107.0
201606	2388	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Recently, policymakers in both economic areas have been both determined and creative in their efforts.	23.0	107.0
201606	2389	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Yet many observers, including Board staff, expect inflation in the euro area to fall short of its target throughout the medium term, and that inflation in Japan will not even come close to its target.	23.0	107.0
201606	2390	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Such persistent underperformance not only damages the credibility of inflation targets, but also leaves these economies very vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.	23.0	107.0
201606	2391	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, prudent risk management would argue for waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity and there’s greater certainty regarding the Brexit vote, especially because of the amplified feedback loop operating through exchange rate and financial market channels.	23.0	107.0
201606	2392	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, the appropriate path to return monetary policy to a neutral stance looks like it could be even more shallow and gradual in the medium term than we may previously have anticipated, because it increasingly appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate may be quite low.	23.0	107.0
201606	2393	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Earlier in the recovery, it seemed likely that the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors that we described as cyclical headwinds, such as tight credit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.	23.0	107.0
201606	2394	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	However, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is widely available, and consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.	23.0	107.0
201606	2395	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	As a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to prove quite persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.	23.0	107.0
201606	2396	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the medium-term neutral rate may be lower and today’s federal funds rate closer to neutral than we previously anticipated.	23.0	107.0
201606	2397	2016-06-15	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	107.0
201606	2398	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23.0	65.0
201606	2399	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23.0	65.0
201606	2400	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201606	2401	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23.0	96.0
201606	2402	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t see a good case for tightening monetary policy at this meeting.	23.0	96.0
201606	2403	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think the outlook supports it, in view of the uncertainties raised by the employment report.	23.0	96.0
201606	2404	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Even if the data there were a bit better, risk-management considerations would argue for deferring such a decision until after the Brexit vote next week.	23.0	96.0
201606	2405	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Looking forward, I don’t yet see a compelling narrative pushing for a July rate hike.	23.0	96.0
201606	2406	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, if the forthcoming data were very strong, then I might be willing to move in July.	23.0	96.0
201606	2407	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But it seems to me it will likely take longer to resolve some of the uncertainties about the outlook raised by the recent data.	23.0	96.0
201606	2408	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So what I’m thinking about the next rate hike, if there is going to be a next rate hike, is that September seems more likely, in my mind.	23.0	96.0
201606	2409	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The statement, along with the SEP, will probably be read that way.	23.0	96.0
201606	2410	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The probability of July probably will drop a little bit further with the statement and the SEP because the SEP revisions, I think, are going to be bigger downward revisions than what market participants are expecting.	23.0	96.0
201606	2411	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	More broadly, I worry that we may have become a bit biased in terms of how we think about monetary policy right now.	23.0	96.0
201606	2412	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The goal seems to be to normalize the federal funds rate, and that seems to be the default view.	23.0	96.0
201606	2413	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	By “normalizing,” it means pushing up the federal funds rate methodically in coming quarters to some long-run value that is well above where we are right now.	23.0	96.0
201606	2414	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t accept the notion that we should necessarily be committed to a project to push up the federal funds rate.	23.0	96.0
201606	2415	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we should only do it if it’s consistent with our dual-mandate objectives.	23.0	96.0
201606	2416	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s possible that the current federal funds rate setting is very close to the equilibrium real short-term interest rate, and it’s also possible that the headwinds keeping the equilibrium short- term rate low will not dissipate further.	23.0	96.0
201606	2417	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	We could find that the appropriate monetary policy would be to keep the federal funds rate at the current level for many quarters.	23.0	96.0
201606	2418	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that’s a depressing thought, perhaps, but maybe the normalization project has been largely completed, at least until Europe and Japan get closer to ending their extraordinary sets of policy.	23.0	96.0
201606	2419	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think our monetary policy is increasingly going to depend on what happens elsewhere in the world.	23.0	96.0
201606	2420	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	This is reinforcing things that Governor Brainard just said.	23.0	96.0
201606	2421	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think our focus on Taylor rule formulations push us maybe in the wrong direction.	23.0	96.0
201606	2422	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	They reinforce the notion that policy is very accommodative, and that interest rates need to move up in the near future.	23.0	96.0
201606	2423	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, maybe that guidance is right.	23.0	96.0
201606	2424	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But, as I’ve said for many meetings, I think it’s hard to square the Taylor-rule formulations with the data that we’re actually seeing.	23.0	96.0
201606	2425	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And I worry that using the Taylor rule as our guide to policy introduces a bias in terms of our monetary policy deliberations that could lead to policy error.	23.0	96.0
201606	2426	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I was pleased to see the staff do the realignment to the Taylor rule in the recent Tealbook.	23.0	96.0
201606	2427	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So that brings the staff forecast, I think, more in line with the Committee.	23.0	96.0
201606	2428	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I would argue, though, that the staff isn’t quite there yet, and I’ll just give you an example of this.	23.0	96.0
201606	2429	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In the Tealbook, there’s a scenario called “Disorderly Brexit,” and in the “Disorderly Brexit” scenario, the economy slows, the unemployment rate rises, and inflation falls.	23.0	96.0
201606	2430	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Yet, because of the inertial Taylor rule, policy continues to tighten.	23.0	96.0
201606	2431	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I would find it bizarre if that scenario unfolded and the Committee was actually tightening during that period.	23.0	96.0
201606	2432	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So there’s still a little bit of a gap, I think, between how the Committee would actually act and what an inertial Taylor rule describes, and we just need to be aware of those differences.	23.0	96.0
201606	2433	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the language that President Harker suggested, I thought his sentence, in my mind, understated the degree of weakness that we actually see in the labor market.	23.0	96.0
201606	2434	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	As I mentioned yesterday, the diffusion indexes are a good example.	23.0	96.0
201606	2435	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	The one- and three-month diffusion indexes for private industry are at the weakest level since early 2010.	23.0	96.0
201606	2436	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	And I also feel like the drop in the unemployment rate—I don’t take that much signal from it, because it was, as Governor Powell mentioned, due to a big drop in the participation rate.	23.0	96.0
201606	2437	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So I feel like it provides a little bit too much confidence in the labor market report weakness being temporary than I would be comfortable with.	23.0	96.0
201606	2438	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23.0	96.0
201606	2439	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you for very thoughtful comments on policy.	23.0	65.0
201606	2440	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Before I turn to the statement and go over the suggestions that have been made, I’d just like to comment briefly on an issue that many of you have raised.	23.0	65.0
201606	2441	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	That’s whether our communications are helpful or even accurate in emphasizing that the federal funds rate is likely to rise gradually over the next two or three years and by an appreciable amount, on the basis of the SEP numbers and our other public communications.	23.0	65.0
201606	2442	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you have noted, our pace of tightening this year is turning out, for a variety of reasons, to be notably slower than we anticipated back in December.	23.0	65.0
201606	2443	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Most likely, the public doesn’t fully appreciate the conditional and highly uncertain nature of the dot plot, and I think that’s a problem because—and President Bullard has emphasized this—we have only the vaguest notion about how much tightening will eventually be needed to stabilize the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation.	23.0	65.0
201606	2444	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	To my mind, in light of all of these considerations, there is a question of whether we should think about de-emphasizing expected movements in the federal funds rate over the medium term in our communications.	23.0	65.0
201606	2445	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you have suggested this, and let me say I really think that this is an issue that deserves serious thought in the near future.	23.0	65.0
201606	2446	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	It’s an issue that we will be giving thought to here at the Board, and I would urge others to do likewise.	23.0	65.0
201606	2447	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	If we wanted to revise our communications, how would we go about doing that?	23.0	65.0
201606	2448	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	With those comments, let me turn to the statement and briefly consider the two concrete suggestions that have been made.	24.0	65.0
201606	2449	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear a number of people weigh in with support for alt-B as written, but let’s just spend a moment on the two suggestions.	24.0	65.0
201606	2450	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	In paragraph 1, President Harker suggested a change in the statement about the labor market to “Job gains have diminished, but the unemployment rate has declined and other labor market indicators appear healthy.”	24.0	65.0
201606	2451	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard a number of suggestions.	24.0	65.0
201606	2452	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I myself am concerned about saying that a wide range of other labor market indicators appear healthy, because there are a number that show deterioration.	24.0	65.0
201606	2453	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Our labor market conditions index is actually declining because it is gearing off quite a number of things that are declining, including a Conference Board alternative measure of job openings, a help-wanted index that has really tailed off.	24.0	65.0
201606	2454	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	But let me just see.	24.0	65.0
201606	2455	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Does anybody want to support President Harker’s suggestion, or are you strongly in favor of it?	24.0	65.0
201606	2456	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	24.0	65.0
201606	2457	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201606	2458	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s go on now.	24.0	65.0
201606	2459	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The second suggestion, from President Lacker, concerns paragraph 3—that instead of constantly talking about further improvement in the labor market, now that we think we’re in the vicinity of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, we change that language.	24.0	65.0
201606	2460	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And let me see if there is anybody who would like to pursue that.	24.0	65.0
201606	2461	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	We could go over the—	24.0	65.0
201606	2462	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	Could I make one point?	24.0	96.0
201606	2463	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I can see doing that at some point.	24.0	96.0
201606	2464	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would just be a very odd time to do it after a very weak labor market report.	24.0	96.0
201606	2465	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be hard to square that with the labor market report we just saw.	24.0	96.0
201606	2466	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I certainly agree that, at some point, you can imagine that the Committee views that we’re basically where we want to be in terms of the labor market, and then a change like that would be appropriate.	24.0	96.0
201606	2467	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think it would be hard to square that with what we just saw.	24.0	96.0
201606	2468	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Can I comment?	24.0	81.0
201606	2469	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	The question I have for you is, how does employment gain fit into that?	24.0	81.0
201606	2470	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Can you imagine us getting to that point with lower employment gains if it looks like we’re in sort of a resource-constrained situation?	24.0	81.0
201606	2471	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That’s kind of the question.	24.0	81.0
201606	2472	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Are we going to hold out employment gains as something we need—150,000 or 200,000 a month?	24.0	81.0
201606	2473	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	No.	24.0	96.0
201606	2474	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	At some point, you would presumably get to full employment—or somewhat below full employment if you actually wanted to push inflation expectations up.	24.0	96.0
201606	2475	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	At that point, you wouldn’t want to see further improvement in labor market conditions.	24.0	96.0
201606	2476	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think people accept that.	24.0	96.0
201606	2477	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I think that after a very weak employment report, people would scratch their heads and say, “Well, wait a second.	24.0	96.0
201606	2478	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	So you’re really saying that you were at full employment a meeting ago?”	24.0	96.0
201606	2479	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think they would have trouble interpreting it.	24.0	96.0
201606	2480	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	I understand the timing, in view of the widespread interpretation of the employment report.	24.0	81.0
201606	2481	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	But imagine we’re 6 or 12 months down the road or a couple of meetings down the road, and we’ve gotten 100,000 a month for 6 months.	24.0	81.0
201606	2482	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I could see making the change at that time.	24.0	96.0
201606	2483	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	24.0	81.0
201606	2484	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	At some point, we’re going to have to tilt how people perceive low employment growth.	24.0	81.0
201606	2485	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	That’s the point.	24.0	81.0
201606	2486	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I accept the concept.	24.0	96.0
201606	2487	2016-06-15	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the Committee will have to come together and decide, are we actually at the place at which we think we could achieve—	24.0	96.0
201606	2488	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	No, I understand.	24.0	81.0
201606	2489	2016-06-15	meeting	LACKER	On the point about time, I’m totally good.	24.0	81.0
201606	2490	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I guess this is more of a question.	24.0	110.0
201606	2491	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I agree with not changing the statement.	24.0	110.0
201606	2492	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I’m just wondering:  In your press conference today, will you point out that, at this stage, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see a lower expected breakeven rate of job growth to keep the unemployment rate constant?	24.0	110.0
201606	2493	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Will you comment on that?	24.0	110.0
201606	2494	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	Just to restate, it seems to me the public is expecting job growth that is well above, I think, our own forecast and what we’re expecting for a breakeven.	24.0	110.0
201606	2495	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I wonder if, at some point—if not today, then maybe in one of the future press conferences—maybe that’s the appropriate place to point out that the breakeven level has declined.	24.0	110.0
201606	2496	2016-06-15	meeting	KAPLAN	I don’t know if you’re going to comment on that at all.	24.0	110.0
201606	2497	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think there’s nothing in my statement about it, but if it comes up in Q&A, I will try to make that point.	24.0	65.0
201606	2498	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	24.0	65.0
201606	2499	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	My suggestion, then, is that we vote on alternative B as distributed.	24.0	65.0
201606	2500	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Brian, maybe you can review.	24.0	65.0
201606	2501	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	24.0	999.0
201606	2502	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	As you said, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing package and also on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note shown on page 10 of that package.	24.0	999.0
201606	2503	2016-06-15	meeting	MADIGAN	Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Bullard   Yes Governor Fischer   Yes President George   Yes President Mester   Yes Governor Powell   Yes President Rosengren  Yes Governor Tarullo   Yes Thank you.	24.0	999.0
201606	2504	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	53.0	65.0
201606	2505	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thanks to everybody.	53.0	65.0
201606	2506	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	53.0	65.0
201606	2507	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I have a couple of things.	53.0	65.0
201606	2508	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	The date of the Committee’s next meeting is Tuesday and Wednesday, July 26 and 27.	53.0	65.0
201606	2509	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that, at this point—just about now or at 10:30—box lunches will be available in the anteroom, and you’re welcome to take them.	53.0	65.0
201606	2510	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	And if anybody is going to stay around and wants to watch me get beaten up at the press conference [laughter], there will be a TV set up in the Special Library.	53.0	65.0
201606	2511	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	I think that’s it for today.	53.0	65.0
201606	2512	2016-06-15	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	53.0	65.0
