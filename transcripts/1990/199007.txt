199007	4	CROSS	 The dollar has traded quite narrowly since your last meeting. Until last week, the dollar showed a slightly firm bias, as market participants felt that United States monetary policy would remain steady despite continued signs of weakness in the economy. However, over the past ten days, the dollar has softened a bit as evidence that the Administration might ease its opposition to a tax increase has been viewed as increasing the prospects of a near-term decline in dollar interest rates. But these dollar rate movements have all been very small, and the dollar has been quite stable, with current rates only marginally different from those in mid-May. In late-May, the dollar, after briefly dipping below the 150 level, received support from various developments. First, in light of comments by Federal Reserve officials about the importance of controlling price pressures, market participants concluded that while the United States economy was weak in certain areas, it was not weak enough to cause the Fed to ease its policy stance. Second, uncertainties about the outcome of the U.S.- Japan SII negotiations and periodic rumors of a new stock scandal in Japan involving an aide to the Prime Minister increased the market's nervousness about the yen, and the Japanese currency declined modestly against virtually all other major currencies. Third, concerns over economic and political stability in the Soviet Union and uncertainty over how West Germany would finance the costs of unification with East Germany caused the mark to move slightly lower against the dollar and to decline to a greater extent against the mark's European counterpart currencies. With this downward pressure on the mark within the ERM, the other European central banks intervened, at times heavily, to keep the DM from falling to the bottom of the band, and also reduced their interest rates to reduce the relative attractiveness of their currencies vis-a-vis the mark. In the past ten days or so there has been another modest mood shift, and the dollar has eased a bit, especially against the yen. One factor was the successful conclusion of the SII talks, which lessened fears of continuing United States pressure on the Japanese. Another factor was interest rates: the Bank of Japan has been signalling that monetary policy would be neutral to tighter and the expectation has been that monetary policy in Germany would be neutral to tighter, while in the United States the budget talks revived expectations of near-term declines in interest rates. But there has been little movement in dollar exchange rates, and investors seem to have had little desire to shift portfolios from one currency to another. Throughout the six-week period, there was no attempt to influence the dollar exchange rate through dollar intervention, either by ourselves, the Bank of Japan, or the Bundesbank. However, the Treasury decided that this period of relative dollar stability and market calm provided a good opportunity to rechannel some of the ESF mark reserves back into the market. After considerable review internally within the Treasury, and after our discussing the proposal with the Bundesbank, the Desk began on May 29 buying dollars against marks quietly and in modest amounts for the ESF's account. The plan is to sell up to $2 billion of DM by the end of July, and to use the dollar proceeds to reduce the amounts the Treasury holds under the warehousing agreements with the Federal Reserve. The unwinding of some of the warehousing addresses a Federal Reserve concern inasmuch as it would provide more headroom for currency backing. The foreign exchange transactions have been carried out in a manner intended to minimize any effect on dollar exchange rates and to avoid any mistaken signal of policy significance. We have operated in modest and irregular amounts, at various times during the day, through a wide range of banks, at times when the dollar was not under upward pressure and when there was substantial liquidity because of good two-way business or cross-trading going through the market. Since May 29, we have sold DM equal to a total of $572.6 million in the market, thus far without incident. I mentioned that we have discussed these operations with the Bundesbank. Initially, they were concerned about market sales by the United States, particularly at a time when, as noted above, there had been some pressures on the DM within the EMS. The Germans favored doing some or all of the transactions directly and off-market with the Bundesbank. The Treasury is considering a direct transaction, for up to $1 billion of the proposed $2 billion total, but both we and the Treasury wish to preserve the idea of doing some of this business in the market as long as market conditions permit. Mr. Chairman, during the period two warehousing agreements were renewed, for one year each--one on June 1 for $1 billion and the other on June 15 for $2 billion. If the Treasury's program to sell up to $2 billion of DM by end-July proceeds as we expect, the Treasury would plan to unwind part of the $9 billion of currency warehoused with the Federal Reserve in the period ahead. The current thinking is that the next warehousing agreement to mature, one for $1 billion coming up on July 20, might be repaid with dollars acquired in the market, perhaps topped up with cash balances. An additional amount of up to $1 billion that might come from the dollars bought directly from the Bundesbank could be used to repay a warehousing agreement coming due later in the year--perhaps the one maturing on September 11. With respect to other operations, I would like to note that on May 23 and June 1, Mexico made principal repayments to the United States authorities totalling $269.9 million, effectively lowering Mexico's outstanding commitments to the Federal Reserve and Treasury under the swaps to $369.5 million and $339.9 respectively. I should also mention that during the period, the ESF has participated in multilateral facilities to provide short-term financing to Costa Rico, Guyana, Honduras and Hungary. The facilities for Costa Rica, Guyana and Honduras were designed to facilitate the repayment of arrears to the IMF in order that those nations might qualify for new loans. The loan to Hungary was part of the $280 million bridge loan arranged by the BIS after that country's reserves fell precipitously. Mr. Chairman, there were no operations on behalf of the Federal Reserve during this period that require a formal action by the Committee. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

199007	12	LOVETT	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Desk operations since the last meeting of the Committee were aimed at maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserves. The borrowing allowance was raised further for technical reasons, keeping pace with the rise in seasonal use that occurs at this time of year. The increases totaled $150 million, bringing the allowance to $450 million. Federal funds were expected to remain in the area of 8 1/4 percent. The funds rate averaged a shade below 8 1/4 percent in the early part of the period and somewhat above it in recent days as the quarter-end drew near. Actual borrowing ran well above path levels in the first two maintenance periods as adjustment borrowing rose over the long Memorial Day weekend and then surged at the close of the June 13 period when reserves were left scarce. The funds rate slipped to 7 1/8 percent as that day progressed before spiking to 43 percent near the close. Borrowing returned to anticipated levels thereafter. For the intermeeting period thus far, the funds rate is averaging 8.26 percent. The Desk generally faced a need to add reserves over the period as currency and required reserves experienced seasonal increases. Consequently, a significant part of the need was met through outright purchases which came to about $5.1 billion, consisting of $3.2 billion of bills purchased in the market on May 30 and $1.9 billion purchased from foreign accounts over the interval. The balance of the need was met through temporary additions which were made when the funds rate was at or above expected levels so as not to inflame occasionally enthusiastic market sentiment. This was particularly the case in the June 13 period referred to earlier when weak retail sales data followed another weak employment report. Despite a large reserve need, the Desk fell behind as the money market was persistently comfortable. In these circumstances, the Desk decided to sit it out and let the need be met at the discount window. Market sentiment about near-term prospects for interest rates waxed and waned over the period but the undertone appeared increasingly constructive. Economic data were generally supportive of the view that the economy is slowly losing momentum, and periodic rallies were triggered by the release of reports that looked particularly sluggish. At the same time, participants were unsure about the degree of slowing, both absolutely and relative to Federal Reserve expectations, and assessments by Fed officials provided no reason to think the Fed felt it must act quickly to prevent slippage. May price reports, showing increases that were perceived as moderate, were not seen as low enough to prompt a near-term easing of policy while industrial production for the month looked surprisingly strong. Consequently, after moving down through mid-period, rates essentially backed and filled thereafter. Current and prospective supplies also weighed on the market at times. Consequently, sentiment was encouraged late in the period by President Bush's assertion that a responsible budget package would have to include ìtax revenue increasesî. While taken positively as a means of moving the budget negotiations forward, the market's response was somewhat muted pending more concrete information. In the Treasury market, yields on Treasury coupon issues due out to about three years were down, on balance, by about 25 basis points while yields on longer issues were down about 15 to 20 basis points. The Treasury raised a net of about $15 billion of new cash in the coupon market as new issue sizes were brought to record levels. Treasury financing needs to fund the deficit and raise RTC working capital were a constant focus, but supplies appeared to be relatively well distributed by the period's end. Meanwhile, room under the debt ceiling is getting low, and the Treasury has asked the Congress for an increase by early August. Tomorrow, REFCORP will be announcing the size of its new 30-year offering which has been indicated at $4 to $6 billion. Participants generally feel that a 30-year issue will prove more manageable so the announced maturity was a small plus for the market. Treasury bill rates were mixed--down in the longer maturities by about 15 basis points but up about 10 basis points in the shorter end as this sector absorbed more of the new supply. The Treasury raised a net of about $19 billion here during the period through CMB's and increases in the weekly auction sizes--to $17.6 billion at today's auction. Rates on new 3- and 6-month bills being sold today look likely to be about 7.73 and 7.60 percent, respectively, compared with 7.67 and 7.68 percent just prior to your last meeting. New supplies in the high-grade corporate and municipal markets were heavy as well but issues were placed with no apparent widening of spreads. The banking sector was subject to further downgrades during the interval but spreads on debt issues held in relatively well, having already widened earlier on. ìHigh-yieldî bonds continued to benefit from a general absence of new issues and spreads here actually contracted a bit. Activity remained very event specific. Short-term private rates showed small mixed changes. The commercial paper market was already experiencing some skittishness, and the downgrade of Chrysler debt heightened credit concerns already present in the market. We continue to hear reports that buyers of commercial paper are being more selective--either refraining from less-than-prime issuers or shortening maturities. However, while there are now more A2P2 names than before, issuers have not been actively seeking funds, limiting the impact on spreads. For Chrysler itself, whose finance company unit was downgraded to A3 on June 14 (Moody's downgraded Chrysler Financial to P3 on June 29), spreads were out about 5 to 10 basis points. Given investor reluctance, particularly with the approach of quarter-end, it turned to alternative resources to handle liquidity needs. At this juncture, outstandings are down nearly 50 percent since the initial downgrade. Most of the money market fund holdings have now run off but others have remained willing to take the paper so that, currently, about 35 percent of maturities are being rolled over, albeit for shorter maturities. As for the outlook ahead, the majority view is for some easing by the System over the summer if the economy weakens as expected. The employment report this Friday will be closely scrutinized for gauging the timing of such a move. The general perception is that Fed moves will be gradual, as has been its practice, and that it will seek to stay ìbehind the easing curveî. If inflation improves with the slowdown in the economy, there is scope for long rates to do better as well but most participants have difficulty envisioning the bond yield below 8 percent. Developments abroad are also seen as impinging, to some degree, on the scope for movements here. While the bias is toward lower rates, the market has been more tempered in pricing this into the current rate structure, perhaps recalling past experience. On a final matter, the Desk recently ceased its trading relationship with Westpac Pollock Government Securities, Inc. The firm announced its intention to disband the primary dealership after failing to find a buyer. William E. Pollock has been a dealer for some time, going back to the early 1950's. Westpac Banking Corp. acquired the entity in late 1986. Given profitability trends in the business, Westpac has since scaled back its plans in the fixed income markets and found that the primary dealer no longer fit into its overall strategy. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0

199007	14	HOSKINS	 I noticed in the New York Fed's [report on its] financial panel that there was a comment by Scott Pardee indicating that he felt the pegging of the funds rate was not allowing market forces to show through and was creating a situation whereby even moving the funds rate a little would be viewed as a very strong signal. Can you evaluate that? Do you sense the same thing? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	49.0
199007	15	LOVETT	 Well, in the six weeks since you met last, it has been the case that market forces have shown through by the time the maintenance period has come to an end. So, we ended up with federal funds either being quite comfortable on the settlement day or quite tight on the settlement day. Some of that has been reflected in banks' behavior, based on their expectations of what the funds rate was going to be. In the first couple of periods they were quite convinced it was going to be a soft settlement day, and so it was. As we got into the June 13th period they were so sure it was going to be comfortable that they waited until the very end even though there was a real need for reserves. Some market [participants] chance this; they put off [action] until there is no more room. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199007	21	PRELL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We'll be referring to the charts in the package with the bright red lettering, which you should be able to distinguish from the other materials before you. The first chart presents the key assumptions underlying the staff's projections. At the top of the list remains our interpretation of your current policy objective, which we take to be making progress over time toward lower inflation, in the context of sustained economic growth. We have also assumed that fiscal policy will be moderately restrictive throughout the projection period. The third point relates to the so-called ìcredit crunch.î This is a complex phenomenon that is difficult to describe, let alone to measure. Part of the story is changes in the regulatory environment. More generally, though, a lot of financial chickens have come home to roost, and the effectson lenders' ability to extend credit, and on their perceptions of risk, have caused a shift in credit supply conditions. Our judgment is that this shift is retarding aggregate spending, but probably to a much smaller degree than the noise level would suggest. In the abstract, a one time shift of this sort is something that would affect primarily the level of activity, not its growth rate, after a transition period. We also think it likely that the economic drag will diminish over the next year as truly creditworthy borrowers who have been displaced recently find new credit sources, and those lenders who may have over-reacted gradually begin to make calmer assessments of risks and returns. Against this backdrop, we have built a forecast that anticipates that interest rates remain near the levels we have observed in the past few months. Owing to the continuing effects of the restructuring of the thrift industry and bank capital constraints, the monetary aggregates are expected to grow relatively slowly: M2 at a rate of roughly 3-1/2 percent this year and 4-1/2 percent next; M3 only 1 percent this year and 1-1/2 percent in 1991. We're also expecting credit growth to remain moderate, with the nonfinancial debt aggregate expanding only 7 percent this year and 6-1/2 percent in 1991. And, finally, our forecast anticipates that the foreign exchange value of the dollar will be essentially stable. In developing our forecast, a critical initial question was how fast the economy can grow, consistent with your objective of slowing inflation. As we read the wage and price data in the top panel of chart 2, the trend of inflation is no better than flat, and it may be creeping upward. We continue to believe that, to bend these curves downward decisively, some increase in resource slack will be needed, and so we have assumed that aggregate demand will be restrained enough to bring about a rise in the unemployment rate. The issue addressed in the lower panels of the chart is whether it might take even slower real growth than we've projected to produce the rise in unemployment in the forecast. After all, the jobless rate has been essentially flat for some time now, with GNP growth no more rapid than we are projecting for the next six quarters. In this context, one might reasonably ask whether labor force or productivity trends have deteriorated, pulling down the rate of potential GNP growth. The short answer is that we don't think so. As indicated in the middle left panel, the growth of the working age population has been slowing gradually, and labor force growth has slowed even more noticeably of late. Reflecting these movements, the ratio of the two variables, the participation rate, has flattened out perceptibly in the past year. This is shown in the right-hand panel. Our assessment is that the flattening is mainly attributable to the slackening of labor demand, which has caused fewer persons to seek employment. To the extent that there is some residual surprise, we think it will prove to have been statistical noise, and we expect labor force participation to rise slowly in coming quarters. The other important ingredient in potential output growth is productivity, and the lower panel is intended to indicate that the recent deterioration in output per hour is consistent with a simple model in which employers adjust their labor inputs with a lag to changes in output. As we see it, then, we don't have grounds yet for concluding that we've entered a period in which the underlying trend of productivity growth has shifted down from the 1-1/3 percent per year pace we observed in the 1980s. All this suggests that GNP growth of less than 2-1/2 percent or so is likely to be accompanied by gradually rising unemployment. Which leads me to the next chart, where you will find a summary of the economic forecasts you've submitted, along with those of the staff and the Administration. As you can see, almost all of you have placed real GNP growth this year in a 1-1/2 to 2 percent range, encompassing the staff's 1.6 percent projection, but falling a little short of the Administration's most recent economic assumptions. Most of you, like the staff, expect that inflation, as measured by the CPI, will be somewhere in the range of 4-1/2 to 5 percent over the four quarters of this year. Looking to 1991, the central tendency of your forecasts of real GNP is 2 to 2-1/2 percent growth, but you generally expect inflation to slow to 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent; the staff is projecting 2-1/4 percent growth with 4-1/2 percent inflation. The Administration, with an assumption that potential GNP growth is around 3 percent per annum, is projecting a stronger expansion of activity, while inflation moves down to 4-1/4 percent. With that general overview, let me turn now to the sectoral specifics of the staff's forecast, starting with the consumption outlook in chart 4. As the upper left panel shows, spending on services has remained robust, but there has been a decided plunge in purchases of goods. Frankly, we find it hard to believe that the demand for goods has contracted as sharply as the May retail sales data indicate, and we are expecting some combination of revisions and bounceback in the near term. But we have carried through a portion of the recent weakness in our forecast, and we've cut second-half growth of real PCE, shown at the right, to less than 2 percent. Consumer spending accelerates only mildly during 1991 and falls short of growth in GNP, in part because, given our price and tax projections, real disposable income grows relatively slowly. The reason we haven't translated the recent spending data into a more pessimistic forecast is that we can't find in other data an explanation for so sudden and so marked a retrenchment. It is true that indexes of consumer sentiment have declined of late. In the Michigan survey, shown in the middle left panel, that decline has occurred in the ìexpectedî components, and it reflects less optimistic views about the outlook for business conditions--a not very surprising finding, given all of the negative news that households have been hearing. But the indexes still are far above recession levels. At the right, I've noted how geographically concentrated the deterioration in consumer sentiment has been, with the Northeast having experienced a major swing in the past two years. Another reason for scepticism about indications of a big slump in consumer spending is the high level of aggregate household assets relative to income, charted in the bottom panel. This ratio is at an historically high level, exceeded in any appreciable way only briefly in 1987, before the stock market crash. If you deduct indebtedness and look at net worth, you get the same picture. This, we think, provides some support for our expectation that there will be a reversal of the recent run-up in the personal saving rate in coming months. The chart does highlight one of the potential wild cards in the present situation, however, namely home prices and the perception thereof. Houses represent a significant share of personal wealth, and there is a considerable subjectivity in owners' views of their values. All of the talk of falling home prices in the media could make people feel less secure, even if their local markets are doing OK. And there is no doubt that market conditions do vary widely by locale. The top panel of chart 5 is illustrative. You can see that, while the median prices of existing homes sold continued to rise in the Midwest and South over the past year, they fell slightly in the Northeast and the West, where many local markets had boomed earlier. Apart from what this may have done to consumption through wealth or confidence effects, these movements in prices probably have weakened the investment motive for home buying. As indicated in the middle left panel, real mortgage rates look very high, even if one proxies price expectations by recent national median sales results, let alone the worst cases in the top chart. Moreover, for people who are willing to buy at present, in some locales the softness of the market raises concerns about the ability to sell their current homes at acceptable prices. The panel at the right is intended to underscore the point that the contraction of the thrift industry probably has not contributed much, in a direct way, to the recent slump in home sales. As you can see, the spread between rates on fixed rate mortgages and those on Treasuries actually has narrowed since FIRREA was enacted last summer. If the S&L contraction has had a significant effect on building activity this year, it probably has been through the tightening of construction credit. We expect that those builders with plans for economically viable projects will be able in time to find financing, and this is one reason why, as indicated in the bottom panel, we expect there to be some pickup in housing starts next year. Prospects for a recovery in nonresidential construction look less favorable. As indicated in the top panel of chart 6, we think business investment in structures, after a first-quarter spurt, probably turned down in the second quarter and will decline through next year. We're projecting moderate growth in the larger equipment component of BFI, however, and thus, as the right-hand table indicates, we have slow growth in total capital spending. For the near term, the orders data for domestic manufacturers of business equipment look consistent with our forecast. The trend in orders (excluding aircraft) plotted in the middle left panel is far from impressive, but computers have been a relatively strong component of late, and their declining deflator magnifies the real gains. As for structures, at the right, contracts for office buildings have declined almost a quarter since 1988, and other segments have begun to weaken as well. We expect these trends to be extended in the months ahead. Apart from the effects of slower output growth and declining capacity utilization, the outlook for business spending is clouded by a negative corporate financial position. Profit margins and internal cash flows are projected to remain under pressure, as shown in the bottom panel. These trends are reflected in the deterioration of corporate credit quality. The bond rating changes plotted in the top left panel of chart 7 document this deterioration, and the projected movement in interest payments relative to cash flow, at the right, suggest that the picture is unlikely to improve soon. Such strains provide further encouragement to businesses not to tie up capital in inventories. Thus, although the aggregate inventory-sales ratios plotted through April in the middle panel don't suggest any appreciable overhangs, we are expecting businesses to keep a tight rein on stocks. Indeed, the projected low rate in non-auto inventory accumulation indicated in the lower chart for the second half of this year implies a slight further decline in stocks relative to final sales. Turning now from the private to the public sector, in chart 8, budgetary problems likely will be restraining growth in overall government purchases through 1991, and probably beyond. In the state and local sector, there was a big surge in construction spending in the first quarter, likely reflecting a combination of disaster recovery and good weather. But we expect growth in construction to be down for this year as a whole and again in 1991, along with growth in other spending. We recognize that there is strong demand for infrastructure investment and for a variety of state and local services, but budgets are significantly out of kilter, as suggested by the deficit figures at the right. Even to achieve the reduction in the budget gap we've forecast for 1991, spending curtailments will have to be coupled with tax increases. In the federal sector, the middle panels, real defense spending is headed down, and should outweigh growth in domestic programs. Embedded in this forecast of federal purchases is, of course, our assumption about the deficit-reduction effort for fiscal 1991. As the bottom left table indicates, we are projecting a $157 billion deficit in the current year, excluding RTC spending, falling to $116 billion next year. The reduction in the deficit projected for FY91 hinges on the $35 billion package of tax and spending actions outlined at the right. That package is $5 billion more than in our prior forecasts, and it is considerably larger than any enacted in the deficit-reduction efforts of recent years. And our package contains none of the smoke and mirrors devices that played significant roles in those earlier attempts. That said, in light of the President's statement last Tuesday, the odds of still more substantial action look higher than they did before. We already had been planning to explore the implications of tighter fiscal policy in this briefing, but under the new circumstances, this may be of greater interest than we had anticipated. Your next chart presents the results of some model simulations, based on deficit reduction packages of $70 billion in FY91 and '92, twice the size of those in the Greenbook forecast. The added reduction in '91 includes a 15 cent per gallon hike in the gasoline tax and $19 billion in expenditure cuts. The extra 1992 package includes $16 billion in personal income tax increases, plus a variety of outlay cuts. The first box shows what these budgetary actions would do to the economy if interest rates were held to a baseline path. As you can see, the model predicts sizable output losses. If you take the Greenbook forecast as the baseline--and extend it into 1992 as in the simulations reported in the Bluebook--the implication is that holding interest rates at recent levels would eliminate almost all of the growth projected for 1991 and 1992. The unemployment rate would reach 7 percent next year and approach 8 percent in 1992, with the result that inflation would be around 3 percent in 1992 and moving lower at a good clip. The bottom box examines the question of what would happen if monetary policy were adjusted to offset the output effects of the sharper fiscal contraction. It is here that we introduce the notion of ìcredibility.î In our econometric model, long-term interest rates adjust over time to movements in short-term rates. Although we tend to think of bond yields as being determined in a forward-looking process, this model actually has proven quite serviceable over the years. Nonetheless, we ought to consider the possibility that a budget agreement that offers real assurance that the deficit finally will be eliminated would be a surprise to a sceptical bond market and that investors' anticipations of reduced future federal credit demands would accelerate the adjustment of bond yields relative to what the model indicates. The two alternative views of expectations formation are represented by the results labeled ìwithout 'credibility'ì and ìwith 'credibility'.î In the without-credibility case--that is, the straight model run--short-term rates initially must fall sharply below the baseline path, to pull down long rates enough to stimulate activity, which in the model is more responsive to long rates than to short rates. The short rates then can move back toward the baseline, while the lagged effects on long rates carry over for a while, growing from 30 basis points in the fourth quarter of this year to 80 basis points in 1992. Relative to the Greenbook path, the federal funds rate would have to go down to just over 6 percent on average in the fourth quarter of this year. As for the with-credibility case, the model doesn't provide much guidance as to what sort of bond market reaction it would be reasonable to expect. We've somewhat arbitrarily assumed that the bulk of the longer-range adjustment in bond rates would occur almost immediately, producing a 65 basis point decline relative to baseline in the fourth quarter. In this case, the federal funds rate would have to decline only 90 basis points in the fourth quarter relative to the baseline. One other result of these simulations is noted in the bottom rows of the table. The assumption of a gas tax increase, coupled with the depreciation of the dollar that is likely to accompany the decline in interest rates, implies a somewhat higher inflation rate if output is held to the baseline path. Such inflationary effects could be minimized if workers don't attempt to recoup the loss of purchasing power through higher wages, but in our model they do, setting off further price increases, and so on. These exercises obviously should be taken with at least a grain of salt. Among other things, the interest rate profiles could be varied considerably by making different assumptions about the timing of the monetary policy adjustment. But I think the simulations do provide some indications of orders of magnitude and they do highlight some of the considerations that would come into play if there were a major budget accord. In assessing what is appropriate for the Fed to do, one would need to think about the underlying trends in the economy, the size and the composition of the budget package, and the likely response of the financial markets. That response involves not only the market's view of the fiscal outlook, but also its view of what the Fed's reaction implies about our longer-run objectives. In short, there is no simple prescription that can be supplied in advance. Ted will now continue our presentation. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	22	TRUMAN	 On the international side, our basic outlook is for more of the same: the foreign exchange value of the dollar is projected to be stable, and growth abroad should sustain moderate progress toward external adjustment while also helping to support domestic output. Therefore, in considering prospective international developments in the current economic context, the principal issue is whether unforeseen external developments are likely to pose significant risks to the basic staff forecast -- risks that might disrupt the smooth pattern of internal adjustment that Mike has laid out. My sense is that such risks are somewhat smaller than they have been on balance over most of the past decade, but they are not negligible. The dollar has been weak recently and could well decline substantially; alternatively, the dollar may appreciate. Growth and inflation in Western Europe could be more rapid than expected, and this would spill over into the United States economy; however, there is some down-side risk in this area as well. Oil prices could rise, or fall, sharply because of political or economic developments in the Middle East. The first international chart, in the upper left panel, provides a perspective on the dollar's movements on average over the past five and a half years. Essentially the dollar, in nominal or price adjusted terms, is trading in the lower half of the range that has prevailed since the Louvre Accord in February 1987. However, the dollar in nominal terms is down 11 percent from its peaks of a year ago, and is about 4 percent lower than it was last December. As can be seen from the data in the box at the right, the dollar has depreciated in nominal terms over the past six months against sterling and the Deutschemark, while remaining unchanged against the Canadian dollar and appreciating against the yen. It has also appreciated against the currencies of South Korea and Taiwan. In our forecast, the dollar on average is essentially unchanged in both real and nominal terms against the currencies of the other G-10 countries. We also expect that the dollar will appreciate somewhat further this year in real terms against the currencies of our major trading partners among the developing countries, and retrace part of that appreciation in 1991. As is shown in the lower panel, we estimate that United States real long-term interest rates have risen together with the average of foreign rates by almost 75 basis points on balance this year. As is shown in the box at the right, the rise in nominal long-term rates in the United States has been about the same as the estimated rise in real rates, but nominal rates have risen about 150 basis points in Germany and somewhat more in Japan, suggesting a relative rise in expected inflation in those two countries. So far this year, the rise in nominal short-term interest rates has been about 70 basis points in Japan, and negligible in Germany and the United States. In our forecast, we have incorporated a policy-induced rise in nominal short-term interest rates in Germany on the order of 100 basis points by the end of 1991, about in line with the expected pick-up in German inflation over the next 18 months; in other words, we have assumed that the Bundesbank will follow a moderately accommodative policy. In Japan, we assume that short-term rates will remain at their recently achieved higher levels through the end of the year before edging off in 1991 as Japan's inflation abates somewhat. The upper left panel of the next chart illustrates the slowing in the growth of industrial production on average in the six major foreign industrial countries over the past two years. Although industrial production has been expanding less rapidly in all of these countries, the deceleration has been most pronounced in the United Kingdom and Canada -- Canada has had an actual year-over-year decline. As you know, these two countries have been trying to bring down their high inflation rates for some time now. To date, Canada has been more successful than the United Kingdom, and it contributes along with France and Italy to the mild downtrend in the average rate of consumer price inflation shown in the panel at the right. The middle panel shows the rise until recently in commodity prices (excluding oil) measured in dollars and foreign currencies. Trends in the prices of these commodities incorporate a number of supply and demand influences, but on balance they suggest relatively high levels of capacity utilization and associated inflation pressures. As stated in the box at the bottom, although inflation has slowed somewhat, policymakers abroad remain concerned about underlying wage and capacity pressures. Monetary policies are expected to be cautious with, perhaps, a decline in interest rates in some countries next year as inflation eases. Meanwhile, we anticipate that fiscal policies will be essentially neutral in most countries, with the important exception of Germany where we anticipate a substantial further expansion. Indeed, my impression is that the direct and indirect economic and financial costs of German economic and monetary union are universally viewed outside of Germany as being higher than the Germans are saying they will be. As I noted earlier, one of the potential risks to our forecast is significantly higher inflation in Germany and Europe as a whole. Turning to our forecast, the upper left panel of Chart 12 shows that consumer price inflation in the major foreign industrial countries has moved up close to the United States rate and is projected to stay in that range throughout the forecast period. As can be seen in the box at the right, both Germany and Japan contributed to the pick-up in inflation abroad last year and are expected to do so again this year. However, we are projecting some deceleration of inflation in Japan next year as the effects of a tighter monetary policy take hold, while inflation moves up another 1/2 point in Germany. On the real side -- the middle left panel -- growth on average in the major foreign industrial countries should slow somewhat in the second half of 1990 from the rapid pace in the first half that appears to have been boosted by special factors. However, growth in these countries will continue to be faster than in the United States. The pick-up abroad in 1991 is largely attributable to more rapid growth in Germany and recovery in Canada and the United Kingdom. The box at the right compares our current outlook for all the other G-10 countries as a group with our outlook in January. You will note that growth abroad is now projected to be about 1/3 percent higher both this year and next, while our outlook for inflation has moved up by one-half to three-quarters of a percentage point in both years. Developments in Germany were a major, but not the only, factor contributing to the changes in our forecast; underlying inflation rates also have been higher than we estimated five months ago. The bottom panel provides a perspective on growth for all of our trading partners. Growth in the developing countries has pulled down the average over the past two years. While we expect to see little change this year, we are looking for a modest acceleration in 1991 based, in part, on a recovery of growth in Latin America. Against this background, the next chart presents our outlook for exports. The quantity and dollar value of our agricultural exports, shown in the top left panel, surged in the first quarter because of a bunching of wheat shipments to the USSR. After a lull in the second and third quarters, we expect to see a further moderate expansion in agricultural exports late this year and in 1991. The middle left panel shows the up-tick in computer exports that also occurred in the first quarter. After a pause in the second quarter, strong growth should resume and contribute, as is shown in the box at the right, to a sustained increase in such exports in 1982 dollars, but to only a modest increase in their value after adjustment for the continuing decline in prices. Other non-agricultural exports, the bottom panels, are projected to continue to expand rapidly over the forecast period. In the first quarter, these exports were boosted by the catch-up in aircraft shipments, but exports of capital goods, automotive products to destinations other than Canada, and consumer goods were also strong. As can be seen in the box at the right, we are expecting growth in the quantity of these exports to be sustained at nearly a double-digit rate, helped along by the economic expansion abroad and moderate price increases for our exports. According to the BLS series, the average price of all non-agricultural exports increased only 6/10ths of a percent over the 12 months through May. On the import side, the next chart, the average price of non-oil imports showed no increase over the four quarters to the first quarter of this year -- the left box at the top. This moderation in prices contributed to the acceleration in quantities shown in the box at the right. However, the growth in total non-oil imports was more than accounted for by computers, which are not particularly price sensitive, line 3, and capital goods, line 4. As is shown in the middle panels, imports of computers are projected to continue to expand rapidly this year and next, though not at quite so rapid a pace as was recorded in 1989. Meanwhile, the quantity of other non-oil imports, shown in the lower panels, is expected to show little or no expansion for the second year in a row, under the influence of the dollar's decline over the past year, only moderate economic growth, and a continuing decline in imports of automotive products. In 1991, we expect a moderate increase as the pace of United States economic activity quickens and the effects of the dollar's decline wear off. Imports of petroleum and products, Chart 15, in recent quarters again have been affected by gyrations in prices and quantities. As is shown in the top panel, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate has been on a downward trend since its peak in January, and the average United States import price has followed right along, with a slight lag. The main influences on prices, shown in the middle panels, have been the rise of OPEC production of crude petroleum and natural gas liquids to a new higher plateau of about 25 million barrels a day and the effects on demand of relatively warm winter weather, both here and abroad, which together contributed to a surge in petroleum stocks on land in the OECD countries in the first quarter. We expect that this overhang will be eliminated over the next two quarters and that oil prices will resume a gradual upward trend in the fourth quarter of this year, reaching $18.25 per barrel by the fourth quarter of next year, as is shown in the box at the lower left. Our near-term outlook, for the balance of 1990, is broadly in line with market expectations. For 1991, our assumption is motivated by our longer-term assessment that tightening supply-demand conditions will place oil prices under moderate upward pressure in real terms in the 1990s. The right panel shows our forecast for the quantity and value of oil imports. After the bulge in the first quarter, the quantity of our oil imports should begin to rise again later this year under the influence of declining domestic production and rising demand. We are projecting imports at the rate of 9 million barrels a day by the second half of next year, and the value of those imports will be around $60 billion at an annual rate. The last chart provides an overview of our outlook for the United States external accounts. As is shown in the top panel, in the mid-1980s exports of both goods and services and goods alone -- the grey and black bars -- expanded more rapidly in real terms than overall GNP (the open bar), providing an impetus to domestic production. However, with the strong dollar, imports surged -- the pink and red bars. After the dollar's decline began to take hold, exports expanded even more rapidly from 1987 to 1989, and the rate of increase of imports slowed markedly. This year, exports will continue to contribute substantially to overall demand for United States production, while slower United States demand and the dollar's depreciation over the past year hold down the growth of imports. Next year, exports should strengthen further because of the lagged effects of the lower dollar this year and stronger foreign growth, but as domestic demand increases, imports will also rise more rapidly. These trends translate into a continued net positive contribution to the growth of GNP from net exports of goods and services (the red line in the lower panel) and a moderate further narrowing in our current account deficit to slightly more than $80 billion late this year and less than $80 billion in 1991 -- about 1-1/4 percent of GNP. These current account deficits projected for both this year and next would be the lowest since 1984. Mr. Chairman, that concludes our presentation.  	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	23	GREENSPAN	 Questions for either gentleman? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	24	FORRESTAL	 Ted, that 3.9 percent inflation rate for Germany [for 1991] looks awfully high by historical standards. Why do you think the Bundesbank won't resist that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
199007	25	TRUMAN	 Politics. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	26	FORRESTAL	 Politics still? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	39.0
199007	27	TRUMAN	 Our sense is that they would resist something above 4 percent but that for a period of time they will tolerate something in the high 3s. That's part of the forecast. And. as I said, they may [unintelligible] more, in which case the forecast [unintelligible]. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	28	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	29	PARRY	 I'd like to ask a question of Mike on the basic assumption that a shift in credit supply conditions has occurred. Throughout the Greenbook and the Bluebook there was certainly discussion of these events. Could you give me some idea as to how important those conditions are in terms of the forecast? Did they represent some percentage of GNP that did not occur as a result? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	30	PRELL	 Well, we don't have a quantification. It is woven into the forecast and, as I suggested, is not a big effect. If I had to quantify it, I'd say it's a fraction of a percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	31	PARRY	 A quarter of a percent, then? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	32	PRELL	 It's just very hard to trace this through. My guess would be maybe a little more than that. Part of the problem is the semantic difficulty of identifying what is the credit crunch. If you build in the recognition of all the declining investment opportunities in real estate and so on and call that a part of the credit crunch you have a bigger effect than if you are thinking simply ﻿ of the shift in credit terms offered to people of a given level. Congress is-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	33	PARRY	 Well, I was thinking of risks of changes in supply, which could originate from both of those factors. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	34	PRELL	 Right. Well, I think it's a fraction of a percent. Implicitly, given the changes we've made over time as we thought we recognized this, I'd say it's considerably less than a percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	35	GREENSPAN	 Well, there's one way of coming at that in a slightly different manner. The data that have just come in from the survey on lending terms suggest that the combination of increased collateral requirements and increased spreads on loans over open market rates has a [unintelligible] of something like 25 basis points. So another way to look at this is to think of it in terms of how we would view the real rates if we had tightened the funds rate by, say, 25 basis points. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	36	PRELL	 I think the difficulty with that, Mr. Chairman, is that those effects seem to have been greatest for relatively small businesses. And as best we can assess it, the role of smaller businesses in total investment, for example, is not overwhelming. But then there are these secondary effects. Looking at corporate bonds, if you took the-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	37	GREENSPAN	 Well, Mike, I think Bob was raising an interesting question about something we're all aware of. I can see the [unintelligible] and the point at issue is that it's crucial for us to get a feel for what the order of magnitude is. It's clearly not a percentage point, but how do we know [how much it is]? If the real interpretation of what I said is correct, it's less than 25 basis points. But there are a lot of other forces going on and this really gets down to a very tricky issue of what the definition is. What in the world does a term mean? We are looking at such complex forces here. How does one get a feel for how to separate them? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	38	PARRY	 Well, did you make any adjustments in the model to reflect the kinds of things that typically would not be captured by a model? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	39	PRELL	 [Unintelligible.] 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	40	PARRY	 So, what you had in there are the typical types of changes in the supply of credit due to diminished prospects with regard to growth of income, employment, etc. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	41	PRELL	 Well, if this forecast were spit out by a model, then yes, I'd have a better basis. But, of course, we always are adjusting for various surprises, and to isolate this one would be very difficult. But I think one needs to lay on top of those direct interest rate effects whatever allowance one makes for collateral requirements. I suggested that perhaps the decline in consumer sentiment might have been affected to some degree by all of the press discussion of shortages of credit and the possibly bad effects on business. That might be why consumers are less confident than they were before. So I think it gets to be very, very difficult. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	42	GREENSPAN	 Well, I think Bob is saying that in a very structural sense consumer confidence is an element in the model and interest rates are an element in the model but the credit crunch is not. And the issue here is how you embody that [in your forecast], other than, say, through consumer confidence or some other variable-- or in this particular case, I would assume, add-factor adjustments. How do you capture that? That's the issue he is raising. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	43	PRELL	 I don't have an answer. I'd like to, but it's very hard because there are too many things going on at once. We would have to settle on exactly what categories these things would fall in. The land price story, if it is significant, is another thing that affects people's thinking on a number of decisions, and that isn't obviously related to the credit crunch. So, though I'd like to, I just don't have a good answer. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	44	PARRY	 Don't get me wrong; I don't think you're understating these events. I just wondered how you did it, that's all. I think the effects are probably on the low side of what you're saying. It is difficult to know how to deal with it. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	45	MELZER	 Mike, on Chart 9, the alternative fiscal scenarios, I wanted to ask you just what happens in your model for the longer-term growth rates of money where interest rates are adjusted to keep output close to the baseline path? Is there a change in the model in the longer-term growth rates of money yet? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
199007	46	PRELL	 We have to have substantially higher money growth in order to accomplish this. Let me see, I must have those numbers here. Let me check and give you some idea. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	47	KOHN	 The rule of thumb we have been using is that [a decrease of] about 2 percentage points on the funds rate for the year will give you about 2 more percentage points in M2 growth on the standard M2 demand [function]. Now, whether that still pertains is another question. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	48	PRELL	 I don't have the corresponding money numbers but, clearly, having a little higher nominal GNP level here and substantially lower interest rates implies through the money demand function much more rapid money growth over the period. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	49	MELZER	 My point in asking and my general concern about this is that, basically, I would view a dramatic shift in fiscal policy as some sort of a short-run shock, and we can use monetary policy to try to offset it. But we're going to be giving up something in the long run to do it and I guess the model would incorporate that in a sense with higher longer-term growth rates in money. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
199007	50	PRELL	 Well, longer term, perhaps one begins to look at things differently. But it's a matter of many years before these fiscal effects presumably would die out. We need to make some assumptions about what would happen to fiscal policy beyond this period. But in this period, obviously, we have to have that accommodation. And in this period, because of the balancing fiscal contraction, aggregate demand isn't growing much more rapidly and we don't have that inflation effect. If you maintain consistently higher ﻿ money growth throughout the future--sort of along the lines of the Bluebook simulations--then you do begin to see these effects mount. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	51	KOHN	 I would view this more as a shift in the level of the money supply as interest rates fell or rose--fell, in this case-- and then growth would be along whatever you thought the old equilibrium was relative to whatever inflation rate you want it to be. I don't see why this would result in a permanent increase in the growth rate of money; rather, I think it's a level adjustment. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	52	MELZER	 One other question I had with respect to rates: What occasioned the dramatic change in your assumption on the path of interest rates between this meeting and the prior meeting? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
199007	53	PRELL	 Several things were involved. One was the fact that in the near term the economy seems to be weaker in an underlying sense than we had anticipated previously. A second factor was our decision to make fiscal policy a bit more restrictive in 1991. On top of that, we already had brought our interest rate bulge down; we had thought rates would be going up and spiking in the first part of 1991 and then coming off. Those first two things moderated that considerably. Then we decided that it would be sensible, as a baseline for the discussion here, not to assume any significant change in rates because it still appears that we would have some mild disinflationary trajectory going into 1992. We felt this kind of scenario was in line with what we perceived to be the general policy objectives of the Committee, consistent with the symmetric directives recently and so on. This seemed a sensible baseline for the discussion. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	54	MELZER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	42.0
199007	55	CORRIGAN	 Mike, again in the area of the budget, but leaving aside RTC-type things, could you give me some sense as to the sensitivity of the [1991] budget deficit estimate to economic assumptions? What is [the effect of a difference of] 1 percentage point of GNP or 1 percent on the unemployment [rate] or something like that on the actual budget deficit excluding-- 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	56	PRELL	 I can give you, for example, the CBO's rule of thumb. A one percent change in real growth starting at the beginning of a year yields--if you take the lower growth scenario--$7 billion in the first year. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	57	CORRIGAN	 How much? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	58	PRELL	 It's $7 billion in the first year and $26 billion in the second year. Was it real output that was your primary focus? 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	59	CORRIGAN	 What I was trying to ask was this: Looking at your earlier charts on page 3 for the differences in 1991 between the staff numbers and the Administration numbers for GNP, unemployment, etc., if you had to make a very rough ballpark guess, what does all that translate to in terms of the budget deficit? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	60	PRELL	 For 1991, I would take it to be a fairly sizable difference once one builds in the difference in interest rate assumptions. For example, their Treasury bill rate in 1991--these are ﻿ not published numbers yet--is an average of 6.8 percent. So that's a little lower than our forecast entails. Looking across the board that's probably worth somewhere between $5 and $10 billion; I don't know the particular phasing. If you add on the output path difference, I would think we're running a difference of something in the $10 to $20 billion area in terms of the economic assumptions. Inflation differences are very small; the projections aren't very sensitive to inflation differences. Clearly, this is small potatoes relative to all the other aspects of [unintelligible] deliberations. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	61	CORRIGAN	 Yes, that was what I thought. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	62	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	63	SEGER	 Somewhat related to Jerry's question: How likely is it, if Congress goes for expenditure cuts on the budget and higher taxes, that that actually would produce a larger deficit because the impact of that fiscal restraint would be to slow growth even further? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	64	PRELL	 Well, our simulation suggests that it's within the powers of monetary policy to offset any [expected] drag. It might take aggressive action, if you believe these models, but it's doable. I guess that's the most-- 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	65	SEGER	 And you think the timing would work out and all that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	66	PRELL	 Mechanically, the models say you can do this. I guess I should say, to follow up on the earlier question about 1991 budget deficits, that I wasn't really building in the differences in the 1990 forecast, which would start things off a little worse and widen that gap. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	67	GREENSPAN	 The growth in output I think [depends on] a judgment as to when, for example, any tax increases that occur are effective. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	68	PRELL	 Sure. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	69	GREENSPAN	 We will know what that date is well in advance. We won't know the expenditure numbers that easily. I think we'll have some judgment as to the fiscal tax results. Now, if you want to think in terms of appropriations and forward orders, current contract awards and that sort of thing, we can track those things fairly well and they're not going to fall on their face overnight. In other words, it's going to be a very extensive lag so that a lot of the initial effect would be anticipatory. You can get a good deal of anticipatory effect from monetary policy because people expect interest rates to change and reduce some of this. But unless a change in orders arrives at somebody's desk, he is not going to change [inventory policy]. I have been reading in the newspapers that there has been a contraction in the budget and there's nothing we can do [unintelligible] change inventory policy or any policy. But when you get something it sure will. And I think it's that sort of timing that we have to be sensitive to. My impression is that it's very difficult to write the budget deal without some significant [unintelligible] in their fiscal impact. And it should be of a nature that we have more ﻿ than adequate lead time to respond, if in fact our decision is to do so. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	70	SEGER	 My second question relates to what I thought I heard you say when you were talking about housing starts. I believe you said that you thought the credit availability problems for builders were a one-shot phenomenon. I hope that's true, but I'm not sure. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	71	PRELL	 Well, I tried to say two conceptually separate things. One is that to the extent that it lowers activity, that's a one-time effect. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	72	SEGER	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	73	PRELL	 That's a one-time effect, and then a growth path can be pursued as determined by subsequent interest rate and income movements as well. The other thing is that to the extent that some builders have been displaced--for example, by their friendly S&L having been shut down or the loan-to-one-borrower restrictions having made their S&L less able to provide credit--we think that in time they will find alternative funding if they have viable projects. There will be people who want to make those loans. On a technical side, we think that institutions will find ways, such as participating loans and so on, to deal with the loan-to-one-borrower limitations. So in that sense we think that the level problem will diminish over time. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	74	SEGER	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	75	GREENSPAN	 We were too focused on bidding Manley Johnson farewell and we forgot that we have a new member who now has the floor. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	76	MULLINS	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My [question relates to] either the prospect or reality of higher state and local taxes in a number of populous regions. How is that included in the model? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	52.0
199007	77	PRELL	 Clearly, that has happened already. I heard a news story that something like 10 or 11 states had tax increases going into effect yesterday. And in our forecast we expect, among the actions taken to close the budget gaps in a number of states, more tax increases. We have in the forecast a significant increase in the average indirect business tax rate of state and local governments. That tends to give a little boost to inflation as we go out through 1991 in this forecast. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	78	MULLINS	 Okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	52.0
199007	79	PARRY	 I have a question about timing in terms of monetary policy reactions to a change in fiscal policy. If greater fiscal tightness were imposed and one wanted, say, to keep output close to the baseline path, what do the different lag structures associated with monetary and fiscal policy tell you in terms of the timing requirements for monetary policy? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	80	PRELL	 Well, unless we go to extreme cases, there is no timing requirement. If you act later, you have to act with greater force. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	81	PARRY	 Do more. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	82	PRELL	 Just to give you some sense, though, of the sensitivity of these numbers: We did another simulation where instead of waiting until the fourth quarter, as we've assumed in this, we adjusted the federal funds rate by 150 basis points in the third quarter of this year and then let the rate drift up very gradually, pretty much back to the path seen here. And that has essentially the same output effect. So. it took 50 basis points less if you moved one quarter earlier. That gives you some sense that there is considerable [room] to maneuver, if you're willing to move in rather gross ways in your policy adjustments --and if you believe the model. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	83	SPEAKER	" That's one big ""if."" "	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	84	GREENSPAN	 I'm trying to remember a comparable fiscal action that has taken place, and the only thing that comes to mind is the Johnson Administration's surtax and subsequent, or concurrent, monetary ease. What actually happened then in this context? Do you remember offhand? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	85	PRELL	 Well, that was before my time. However, when I arrived at the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank in 1970 it was legend. There were a lot of economists in the System who were still feeling that that was one of the biggest mistakes they had ever made. They had neglected to take a sort of permanent income view of a one-time tax surcharge. I think it was expected to have significant effects on expenditures and in retrospect it didn't seem to have that. Now, in this case, the presumption would be that we're talking about something more permanent and one wouldn't have that kind of surprise. But I think that was the analysis. There may be people around the table who have a direct recollection of what went on within the System. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	86	GREENSPAN	 That was a temporary surcharge? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	87	PRELL	 Right. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	88	GREENSPAN	 So, basically, the model would take some marginal propensity to [consume]--0.7 or whatever the number would be--out of GNP when in effect it was probably 0.1. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	89	PARRY	 Well, it warmed Milton Friedman's heart because the permanent income hypothesis explained it pretty well. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	90	PRELL	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	91	GREENSPAN	 The real issue is that there is a difference here, and we have to be careful that there's not another problem we haven't captured. The complexity of this issue is rather mind-boggling. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	92	PRELL	 We recognize that this [presentation] makes it all look more pat than it is. I hope I threw in enough cautionary words on that part. But as I said, I think it gives one some sense of the orders of magnitude that conceivably could be involved. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	93	CORRIGAN	 I don't know if my memory is very good this evening but I think there was another element in that ﻿ surcharge in 1968. And that is that for a long time prior to the point when the surcharge was supposed to come into play, there were a number of senior Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman Martin, who were pushing publicly and privately very, very hard to get some kind of a tax to finance the war. I certainly wasn't around or close enough to the situation to know whether or not all of their pushing put them in a position where there might have been some understanding of a [quid pro quo]. Certainly, the visible case was the one that Mike cited: that it was treated--whether because it was misunderstood or for other reasons--as if it were a permanent large tax increase [unintelligible]. But I suspect there was a little more to it than that. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	94	GREENSPAN	 To be sure. Any more questions? David. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	95	MULLINS	 I have one question on the bottom panel of Chart 4. Since we talked about Friedman some, we can talk about Modigliani some. Your model, I guess, is meant to suggest a rebound in consumer spending because household wealth is relatively high. How has that notion worked as a predictor in the past? For example, one can't help but notice the little dip in October of 1987 in total wealth. Can you trace out the consumption impact of that? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	52.0
199007	96	PRELL	 Yes, in a rough way. The fact is that after that period the personal saving rate did rise. There was not a recession, as some people expected, because there were some strong interest- income generating sectors--stronger than most people had realized at the time. The net export increase was sizable; the investment gains were sizable. That seemed to generate the income. And even if consumers wanted to spend less of it, they still increased their expenditures, and thus we glided through that period. But the index of the wealth effect would be the personal saving rate. So there's nothing in the data superficially, given everything else that was going on, to suggest that there wasn't the predicted effect. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	97	HOSKINS	 Just one question for Mike. It really is not a fair one because he probably hasn't looked at it. But, if the average error in the forecast one quarter out is plus or minus 2 percentage points when we have normal times--that is, no fiscal policy change-- what would you [estimate] the error is going to be with a fiscal policy change? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	49.0
199007	98	PRELL	 Well, I don't know. If I knew what the fiscal policy change was, we'd be able to [unintelligible]. I'm not sure the error would be any larger, but given that I don't know the [fiscal policy change] or the underlying strength of the economy, I'd say there is a very wide range of possibilities. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199007	99	GREENSPAN	 If there are no further questions, can we proceed to our usual roundtable discussion? Who would like to start off? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	100	BOEHNE	 In the Philadelphia District, my sense is that both business sentiment and economic activity have deteriorated since the last meeting and that the outlook is more bearish now than even a month ago. Real estate is the weakest spot, with increasing reports of builders in trouble. The number of bankrupt properties is rising. One of our major firms that is closely tied to capital spending ﻿ reports that new capital spending authorizations have moderated appreciably during the second quarter. The only major exception is for environmentally related projects. Spending commitments are off for steel, chemicals especially, pharmaceuticals, electric power generation, and oil and gas. And the prospect for continued weakness in capital spending authorizations is there. Retailers report essentially flat sales, and I would say that merchants are more cautious about the outlook than a couple of months ago. Manufacturing generally appears to have flattened out but at fairly low levels. And except for autos, I think most of the manufacturers in the District do not expect further slippage from these low levels. In general, bankers are increasingly gloomy; they are worried about loan quality, profit margins, and the next examination. Lending for real estate projects has been curtailed sharply and lending to small business-- often collateralized with real estate assets--is under much more scrutiny. My sense is that against the background of a generally slowing economy and a general tightening of credit standards, most companies are falling short in terms of their targets and plans for sales and profits. I think all of those are ingredients for a period when business confidence is quite vulnerable and is susceptible to some significant deterioration in the months ahead. Now, translating that into the national economic outlook, I continue to think that the modest growth forecast, as outlined in the Greenbook, is most likely. But in my judgment, there has been a significant increase in the amount of downside risk to the economy in the last few weeks. So, while I would say that modest growth is the most likely outcome, I'm much more concerned now about it coming to pass than I was in May. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0
199007	101	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	102	SYRON	 Well, I guess this is a Northeast economic story. In New England our situation continues to worsen, and I'd have to say with some signs of cumulation. But I don't think this is largely because of national factors. Our own expectation for the region, given an economic performance nationally something like that in the Greenbook, is that the region will continue to decline well into 1992 and then level off but be slow coming back. Retail sales are now quite weak with aggressive pricing; there are some bankruptcies, and inventories are becoming a problem. There are some questions about weather influences because we have had a cool, rainy spring and purchases of things like gas grills and that sort of thing--once it gets past the fourth of July--may tend to be put off for another year unless they are priced very aggressively. Contributing to all this is the banking situation, which I think we'd have to say continues to deteriorate. We now have people actually becoming somewhat blase, about banking, which I guess could be either good or bad. We have had a bank failure about every two weeks for the last two months. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199007	103	SEGER	 The people are blase or the outside-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	104	SYRON	 As these things happen successively, I suppose it is human nature that they draw less attention in the press. It's really noticeable that they draw much less attention in the electronic media and on the radio than one might have thought. Now, these are [mostly] small institutions. With the exception of one $2-1/2 billion thrift institution, these are institutions of less than $1/2 billion ﻿ in size, so the impact is not enormously great. But to cite one example: A story that a $1/2 billion institution was going to be closing was in a gossip column in one of the newspapers two days before and it ended up having some problems but no severe runs or anything like that. Interestingly, consumer confidence--and the decline we have had is pointed out in Mike's chart 4--is remaining about the same. It's no longer falling in the region, which is a little hard to figure out, but it is at a quite low level. Looking at sectors, construction is obviously at dead center, particularly in southern New Hampshire where it was very big. And that is going to be a drag on the New England economy. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199007	105	GREENSPAN	 Seasonally adjusted, it will soon turn negative! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	106	SYRON	" It's almost conceivable! Interestingly, employment in services has been falling as well, particularly in finance, insurance and real estate, and also in wholesale and retail trade. You just notice the availability of labor where there really had been a problem with availability in the services sector. It is now much less of an issue at the wholesale and retail stores; the stores are actually tightening up and have not put as many salespeople on the floor as they had before because of the concern that they have. Interestingly, the credit crunch question, although I'm not sure quantitatively or qualitatively that it has gotten any less pressing one way or the other, is becoming much less newsworthy and is drawing much less attention. We took some loan data and adjusted for sales of loans and items that were changed to writeoffs and things like that, and we found that loan data pretty flat except for real estate, and there was some decline in consumer loans. Manufacturing was really one bright spot, believe it or not. Sales were mixed for our manufacturers--from 0 to 15 percent. The two [unintelligible] see an increase [unintelligible] holding up relatively decently but a lot of these things are special factors. For manufacturers, exports are more and more becoming an important source of sales. Also, a lot of these things are in areas you might expect--in aerospace, as it has gone nationally, some types of electronics and defense-related products. Our computer sector is still quite weak. For the longer term there is quite a lot of concern about what defense means, and regionally I think we will see a substantial drag from state and local fiscal changes. The Massachusetts budget deficit is about $1.4 billion for the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year is forecast to be about another $1.4 billion. They are trying to arrange for some sort of [financing], part of that out 30-40 years. Connecticut has a substantial problem, so there is going to have to be very significant [unintelligible] . As far as the national economy goes, given the policy assumptions last time, our view is that the Greenbook seemed a little optimistic; and given the policy assumptions this time, it seems to us slightly pessimistic. I'd emphasize the ""slightly,"" particularly on the unemployment rate. As has been noted, it does seem to put a lot of weight on this credit crunch issue. I think that is so; at least it's discussed frequently--let me put it that way. And it's very, very hard to know what that means. There are lots and lots of unknowns out there; things are definitely softening but it's hard to see whether this is a pause or a trend. In terms of policy, we need to see something on whether this will continue or not. There are a ﻿ lot of weather-related issues in the retail sales data, particularly in fuels and personal consumption expenditures and in some of the GNP accounts. I'm also skeptical of the month-to-month retail sales numbers. So, I don't know that we can think at this point that the consumer sector is really going to weaken. The export sector looks relatively healthy; residential construction look weak. On the other hand, the purchasing managers survey this morning looked reasonably good. The indicators of a recession don't suggest a [high] probability of that. Unemployment hasn't risen; claims aren't rising, even though we've seen poor employment performance. We just have an awful lot of unknowns out there, not the least of which is what is going to happen with fiscal policy. We'll get into a discussion about this later today or tomorrow, but I think it's a very difficult period to make a decision to change [policy]. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199007	107	GREENSPAN	 What is new in this whole process is that I don't think any of us has sat through this type of unraveling of an accelerated financial expansion. If you look at the flow-of-funds table, we go from double-digit [rates] to squeezing down, and that effect, I think, is really what we're hearing about. The question is: How does one read that? I think it explains the type of phenomenon that we see in New England at the extreme. But the rest of country is definitely [unintelligible]. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	108	SYRON	 Well, on this business of a credit crunch--and I think we have had some severe problems along that line--in looking at these figures it's interesting that, once you've adjusted them, a lot of the fall-off is in areas you wouldn't expect to be price-driven-- i.e. in consumer lending. There is just no avoiding it; that's what's going on. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	51.0
199007	109	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	110	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, the Twelfth District economy continues to grow, but the pace of growth has slowed recently. Employment grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate from January through May. That compares favorably to the United States rate of growth of employment of 1.8 percent, but it does represent a slowdown. From May of 1989 until January of 1990 employment in the District was growing at rate of about 3-1/2 percent. Conditions remain good in the trade and services sectors. Retailers report healthy sales, confirming moderate employment growth in recent months. In most parts of the West, home sales are still strong and median prices are rising but at a much slower rate. Reports of particularly robust activity come from Seattle, Sacramento, Oregon, and parts of Utah and Idaho. However, in the coastal areas of California, which are primarily Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco, sales volumes and median prices have fallen from the high levels of a year ago. Although sales of more affordable homes continue to be robust, construction activity has fallen from the high levels of a few months ago. Nevertheless, the level of activity remains high with construction employment still registering solid gains over year-earlier levels. Manufacturing activity continues mixed. Production of commercial aircraft, aluminum, and some construction-related products is reported to be strong. However, employment gains in commercial aircraft are limited by both capacity constraints and also by improvements in labor productivity. It's interesting to note that Boeing has actually laid off some people and apparently has done that, as they explain it, as a result of increased ﻿ labor productivity. High-technology-related industries are relatively flat overall with wide variations among firms and product lines. And layoffs and plant closures associated with defense cutbacks continue. If I may turn to the national economy, we're in general agreement with the outlook in the Greenbook for this year, but we do have a few differences. Adopting the Greenbook assumption of no change in the current level of short-term interest rates, our forecast would be about a quarter of a percentage point stronger, at least in 1990 and continuing into the first part of 1991. I'm not sure exactly what the causes of these differences are, but I have a feeling that they might be accounted for to some extent by differences in the impacts of credit availability effects. Even in the absence of credit availability effects, we expect real GNP growth to be less than that of the growth of potential, putting some modest upward pressures on the unemployment rate and containing inflationary pressures, at least underlying inflationary pressures. Therefore, we anticipate inflation in the GNP fixed-weight price index to average about 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent over the next 18 months, which I believe is slightly higher than that in the Greenbook. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199007	111	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	112	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, the economy has not changed appreciably in the Southeast since the last meeting. Growth is continuing along the slow path that we've been experiencing for some time now. We are seeing a fairly healthy expansion, I think, in services and in our export industries. Offshore energy exploration is also moving up higher and we continue to receive reports of severe labor shortages in the energy sector in Louisiana. Other manufacturing areas are quite weak, mainly due to the conditions at the national level for the automobile and construction-related industries. I don't have to go out and ask people any more what they think about the economic situation; I'm inundated with advice about what we should do. But I must say that people are expressing increasingly their concerns about current conditions and the outlook. Now, that certainly has been true for some time in the real estate and housing areas, but increasingly we're hearing it from others as well and particularly from bankers. In recent weeks they seem to be a lot less concerned about regulatory pressures than they were and much more concerned about loan demand that has weakened across the board. That is one very notable change from the views a few weeks ago. And I would echo what Dick said: that the publicity about regulatory pressures seems to have waned quite a bit. Looking at the national economy, our staff has somewhat faster real growth, especially in the early part of the forecast period, in comparison to the Greenbook forecast. The differences are basically because we have a small reduction in Federal spending and we have in fact [unintelligible] as much of an impact from the tighter credit conditions. We are also a bit more optimistic about the price outlook even though the forecast shows a somewhat tighter labor market. But as we go into 1991, our forecast does converge a little more on the inflation side. As I try to look at the outlook, like everybody else, I'm beset by a number of these uncertainties. I must say that one thing weighing heavily on my mind is that our bank ﻿ directors, who have been very steadfast in supporting our anti- inflationary policies, are now leaning to the view that some reduction in restraint is needed right now. What is significant about that, I think, is that it is not only the business directors who are saying this but also the bank directors who have typically favored a relatively tight policy in comparison to the other directors. The business and financial contacts that I have spoken to in recent weeks are much more blunt in this regard--virtually without exception urging a reduction in rates. My take on this is that the negative sentiments really reflect the pressures, the temporary pressures I hope, to slow inflation after a period of pretty comfortable business conditions. Businesses seem to be having trouble, at least in the Southeast, raising final prices as much as they had expected to, and now they have to find ways to cut costs to preserve their margins. It seems to me that this is the pressure and the ultimate adjustment that we've been trying to achieve for a long time. But having said that, I still find myself now feeling--and even more so--that the risk is on the down side and that there is a greater chance of growth falling short of rather than exceeding our expectations. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0
199007	113	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	114	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, on balance the economy in the District is largely unchanged from the last meeting: mixed to just stable, at least at a moderate level. Clearly, there are some sectors that are weaker. Retail sales are down and I must say anecdotally I am hearing that June sales really have been very soft as compared to last June. Construction activity is down, both residential and nonresidential; yet our numbers I think are still running ahead of the national numbers. The Chicago purchasing managers report came out the other day; for June it was down a bit from May. Production, new orders, and order backlogs were lower. The manufacturing sector is generally unchanged, but there are some areas that are better. In the steel business, for example, as the year is moving along, the shipments level is being increased. They started the year off thinking it would be an 80 million ton year. Now, the numbers are up to as high as 84 million tons--a little lower than last year, but still a comparatively good year. Operating levels, at least at the company I talked to, are at about 89 percent. The electronic communications business is strong; the order rate is moving up and is now back up into the double-digit area. The paper industry is flat but at a high level, operating at about 98 percent. But having said that, an awful lot of capacity has come on in the paper business and, therefore, pricing is very, very intense. Liner board, for example, has gone down from $410 a ton to $370 a ton. In the manufacturing sector, not surprisingly, agricultural equipment is very strong; production levels are about 5 percent higher this year than last year. Sales of agricultural equipment at retailers are moving at a very good pace. Construction machinery, though, is weak; and in response to the decrease in construction activity, that category is down. The auto sector continues to be very, very uncertain; the sales level in May and early June certainly was weak and as a consequence the forecast for the year is beginning to be pulled down a bit. One company's forecast is down to a little under 14-1/2 million units for the year and that's depending on 14-1/2 million for the second half. Even those levels, of course, are dependent on tremendous incentives. The incentives continue to be over $1,000 per ﻿ car in order to maintain these even weaker numbers of sales. Auto inventories at retail continue to be at reasonable levels; dealers just aren't buying and, as a consequence, many of them are losing money. GM is quoted as saying that 35 to 40 percent of its dealers are currently losing money. The auto production levels in the third quarter will be significantly higher than last year but there is a comparative issue involved because the third quarter of last year was pretty weak. In the agricultural sector, what started off a couple of months ago as being a near perfect growing season looks not quite as positive as a consequence of the heavy amount of rain we've had in the Midwest. We are having, to quote a new term, ""ponding"" in some areas and severe erosion. And as a consequence, the corn planting has been delayed and some of it has been shifted into soybeans, which can be planted a bit later. Depending on how things work from this point forward, I think we're still going to have a good production year, but it just isn't going to be quite as strong as it might otherwise have been. On the pricing side, our outlook is more positive than the staff forecast. I am continuing to hear awfully good reports. The raw materials prices are stable to down. One large manufacturer I talked to says that his firm's raw materials costs for all of this year will be 1/2 percent lower than last year. In other respects I hear very good news on the raw materials side. Finally, with regard to the credit crunch, the banks that I talk to are saying that they certainly are being more careful in their approach to credit lending. They are lending very, very carefully, but everybody says that there is more than enough credit for good credits. And, of course, they would emphasize the word ""good."" Just briefly, in a national context--and I think our view is reflective of our District outlook--we have been a little more positive than has the Board staff in the past and we continue to be so. Our outlook for this year particularly is stronger than the staff's and for next year we are a bit stronger. The difference really is in personal consumption, to some extent in nondurables but to a greater extent in the durables category and [more specifically] in household durables. Our outlook for home starts is a little higher than 1.3 million, whereas the Board staff's is a little under 1.3 million, and that works its way through in the household durables category. With regard to inflation, our outlook is a bit different from the Board staff's also. We think as we get into next year that the numbers will begin to show some improvement. And our outlook for inflation by the end of next year is certainly lower than the Board staff's. Thank you. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
199007	115	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	116	MELZER	 In terms of our long-run outlook, we're right near the central tendencies in both years; we tend to be at the lower end in terms of nominal GNP. real GNP, and the CPI, and a bit at the higher end on unemployment. The one comment I would make is that in 1991 we're looking for somewhat lower inflation, just a quarter of a percentage point from the lower end of the central tendency. I would say that's based on the progress in the trend growth in money and the decline from double-digit rates in the 1986-to-1987 period to less ﻿ than 4 percent now. Essentially, I think that kept us from overreacting earlier this year to the temporary runup in prices. And it also influences us now in the sense that we have built such a good base here that I think there's some reluctance to trade away a lot of that. Now, there's concern about the recent slowdown in money, but in general where I come out--and not everybody would agree with this--is that I'd need to see more before I reacted to that, particularly in the context of trading away some of this longer-term progress. As far as the District goes, the situation still looks pretty good right now. We have had growth in nonagricultural employment in the most recent three-month period that's right in line with the national numbers and over the last year almost right on top of them. Our manufacturing component is actually a bit stronger; it's growing sluggishly but that compares to declines nationally in the most recent three months and over the last year. On the horizon, however, there are clearly some problems. We have a lot of auto industry exposure in Missouri--in St. Louis and Kansas City. Chrysler has a shift that is scheduled to go out this fall and as I recall it involves about 1,900 workers. And recently McDonnell Douglas has talked about layoffs; they have not made any specific announcements but the rumors are that 4,000 jobs In St. Louis will be eliminated, and that would be 0.3 to 0.4 of a percentage point in terms of our metropolitan area unemployment rate. The Interesting thing about that is that I would attribute those layoffs solely to current inefficiencies. That is, it may put them in a better position as contract cuts come a couple of years down the road, but basically this is dealing with current problems. And I think it caught people a bit by surprise in that they weren't really looking for any winding down until 1992 or some time around then. On the banking side, asset quality continues to improve in our District. Nonperforming loans are going down; real estate problems have gone up a little but they are still well below national averages. In St. Louis, for example, nonperforming real estate loans are less than 2 percent, compared to much higher numbers in some other metropolitan areas. On the agricultural side, the weather has affected the wheat crop. We have had, of course, very wet weather. It also has affected planting but I think corn is the only crop that would possibly be affected by that; soybeans and cotton are in pretty good shape. I wanted to comment on one other thing quickly. We had a series of meetings a week ago with our pension fund managers. I think it's dangerous to draw conclusions from a relatively small sample of managers, even though they're very professional, but what struck me was that I did not pick up from any of them a great deal of anxiety about the outlook. Basically they are assuming a soft-landing type of scenario. In other words--or I guess to put words in their mouths--they are assuming continued sluggish growth, a continued unwinding of inflationary pressures, and a gradual decline in interest rates. I would say that, in effect, what most of them were doing was looking through current [profit] margin pressures, which are very evident, and the effect that will have on earnings. They feel that a gradual decline in interest rates will offset that and that from a valuation point of view they will be okay. The flip side of that--and we didn't ask this across the board but we talked to one group--is to ask what they would worry more about. And I think in general they would be much more worried in a longer-term context about a resumption of inflationary pressures as opposed to some shallow recession. Of ﻿ course, they were quick to add that once a recession started who knows whether it would be shallow. So, that was kind of a soft question. Generally, in the bond part of the portfolio there is usually not much of an interest rate bet; in fact some of them won't make any at all. They just stick right around the Shearson-Lehman index in terms of their duration. But there were two standouts, one on either side. One manager is betting on declining rates and another on rising rates. So, overall, there's a pretty neutral view there. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0

199007	120	STERN	 With regard first to the District economy, for some time I have reported that it was doing better than the nation as a whole. We just had some data revisions; the series we follow most closely are nonfarm employment and income, and the data revisions confirm those reports. Both for 1989 and early in 1990 at least, the District has outperformed the nation. I think essentially what is going on is that the natural resource industries in the District, which sometimes act as a drag, have actually been pulling things up. In that regard, I'm referring to mining and forest products and paper and, of course more recently, agriculture. In fact, the farmers in our District have just about run out of things to complain about and that almost never happens. We too have had a lot of rain but it was much needed. So, people's spirits are up and that has positive implications not only for morale and farm output but for implement spending and so forth. On top of what has happened to natural resources, as I have reported before, the diversified economies in the Twin Cities and some of the other mid-size metropolitan areas have done pretty well throughout most of this expansion. We recently had meetings not just with our directors but also with our advisory council on small business, agriculture, and labor. And, based on those meetings, I would say the general tenor is positive. It is not ebullient; there certainly is not a great deal of confidence going forward, but in general they are relatively satisfied with what is happening at the moment. There are a couple of exceptions, both of which are obvious: anybody whose business is related to defense is concerned as are those in construction--although they are not concerned about new home sales, I must add, which continue to run above year-ago levels in many places in the District. Generally, I don't think the District is going to continue to outperform the national economy much longer. It is likely to perform much like the national economy; that is, I think things are going to become a bit more sluggish as we go ahead. Commenting very briefly on the national situation, I have a [unintelligible] sense that, as Tom Melzer and a couple of others suggested, we may be poised for some progress on inflation in terms of disinflation here. I say that in part because of the slow growth in money that we've had over an extended series of years now, but also because in terms of anecdotes from people in the District I really haven't had any reports of growing inflation pressures in at least a year. Of course, the latest aggregate price statistics look a bit better. Now, the obvious kickers are the services sector and some of ﻿ the things that Mike pointed out in his report about the [unintelligible] and so forth. Nevertheless, I think we may be close to a point where we finally start to see some progress there. As far as real growth is concerned, I'm pretty comfortable with the Greenbook forecast or maybe even something a bit better. I think most of the fundamentals are in place for some acceleration of growth. But having said that, I must say that the statistics for the last few months on employment and consumer spending, and my impression of what is happening with home prices, raise the yellow flag. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
199007	121	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	122	BLACK	" Mr. Chairman, our projections for GNP are pretty close to the staff's; they are almost right on the button for this year, but they are a little lower next year than the staff is projecting. As we see it, this seems to be pretty compatible with the kind of growth we've had in the aggregates recently and the Greenbook's assumption that we'll have the same degree of restraint over the forecast period. We would guess that the risk of error would be on the down side and perhaps very much on the down side for the next six months or so. I say that partly because there doesn't seem to be a real thrust in the economy anywhere right now, with the exception perhaps of exports, and also because of the sharp deceleration in the aggregates. The staff memo did a good job of eliminating a lot of the worries I had about the slowing in the aggregates, but as the staff admits--and, of course, we all know--this could be reflecting to some degree a slower growth in the economy than would be healthy. And we, like Bob Forrestal, Si Keehn, Tom Melzer, Gary Stern, and maybe some others, are more optimistic than the staff about the degree of inflation that we will have, and we have felt that way for some time. We think the staff is about right for this year because of what is already in place for the first quarter, and that puts us at 4-3/4 percent on the CPI for the year. But we're expecting a deceleration in 1991, down to the neighborhood of 3-3/4 percent maybe, because of the drop in M2 growth in the second quarter and also the projection on the part of the staff that we will have a constant federal funds rate over the forecast period. And. finally, we think the credibility we will get on our anti-inflation policy, if in fact we do hold the federal funds rate steady over the next 18 months in the face of rather sluggish real growth, really ought to have at least a moderate [salutary] effect on the rate of inflation that we actually achieve. I was intrigued by Si Keehn's comments about ""ponding"" in his District; we've had a little dry spell, Si, and I think we would be happy with a little ""puddling."" "	13	13	1.0	1.0	7.0
199007	123	GREENSPAN	 President Boykin. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	124	BOYKIN	 Mr. Chairman, on the national picture our view is not very different from the staff's forecast. We see slightly more strength for the rest of the year and about the same for 1991. I don't quite share my friend Bob Black's and others' optimism on inflation. I continue to remain a little pessimistic there. With respect to the District, the economic recovery continues but its strength seems to have diminished in the last two months. At the May meeting I spoke about how, for the first time in three years, the recovery in the Eleventh District had time finally to spread across all sectors and all geographic regions in the District. A ﻿ definite slowdown has occurred recently, probably in response to the slower growth nationally. Our manufacturing industries are still out¬ performing the nation. We actually have slow-to-modest employment growth, but the gains have been concentrated in chemicals and energy- related manufacturing. Electronic equipment, apparel, paper and several other sectors that had held up manufacturing strength have slipped recently. Defense contractors, of course, have been cutting back heavily. In spite of lower energy prices, drilling activity has continued to increase significantly and all the leading indicators suggest that this should continue for several months to come. Retail sales have softened and construction contracts have declined. Most disturbing, however, is the noticeable slowdown in the service-related sectors. This has been an area of persistently strong growth, but the most recent three-month period marks the weakest growth this group of industries has exhibited since a recovery began three years ago. In spite of what I've been saying, for some strange reason business sentiment seems to have improved a little lately, perhaps because steady slow growth in a stable, predictable environment has finally come to be viewed as preferable to an uncertain stop-and-go environment. Nonetheless, the talk of credit shortages--and I'm not just talking here about real estate nor just for the smallest firms-- is becoming more widespread down our way. To keep [my report] balanced, I guess I should say that our directors are probably not quite as optimistic as I am. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	34.0
199007	125	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	126	GUFFEY	" Mr. Chairman, the good news is that the drought is over as far as our District is concerned. We had ""ponding"" and ""puddling"" but the fact of the matter is that the farm sector still remains the primary source of the strength in this rather slow-growing District economy. With respect to the agricultural sector, the wheat crop, which has been mentioned here already today, is in a sense [unintelligible]. Mother Nature plays tricks on the farmers as she does annually, I guess. But overall the wheat crop is projected to be at or near a record level. As a matter of fact, earlier today I received a report that wheat in western Kansas had yielded 10 percent more than it ever had before. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
199007	127	GREENSPAN	 Better subtract the fraction of a bushel that Wayne brought back and we lost! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	128	GUFFEY	 The fact of the matter is that some of the wheat crop, which 30 days ago looked outstanding throughout most of our District, has been lost because of high winds and wet weather. But overall it apparently will come out very well. In addition, there has been a delay in planting corn and the corn acreage will be down this year, but that is [offset] by the soybean crop because of the later planting date for that crop. Red meat prices for the farmers still are very good and as a result the agricultural economy looks very strong. With respect to the credit crunch that has been mentioned, with some diligence [in our search] we simply don't see it in our area of the country. As a matter of fact, the complaint is that there is very little loan demand and liquidity is very high in most of the small agricultural banks particularly, as well as in some of the bigger banks. Employment continues to grow throughout the District; ﻿ in fact, in each of the metropolitan areas the unemployment rate is lower than the national rate, and there is some strain on skilled labor in the District. The District automobile manufacturing sector remains in the doldrums. There is some continued modest improvement in the general aviation manufacturing area. As for construction, home building is at a low level and there is very little commercial construction taking place because of the overhang that still exists in the energy areas such as Denver, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa. Although there is some [construction] in Kansas City and a little in Omaha, by and large it does not measure up to year-ago levels. In the energy sector, the OPEC overproduction has driven down prices, as noted earlier today. However, the rig count in the District still remains fairly stable and in fact is higher than a year ago. Overall, I would characterize the District as being in fairly good shape in most areas. I hear very few comments from people that I or my staff have been in contact with concerning the economy itself. People are pretty well satisfied, but one has to lay that against the fact that some of them suffered rather dramatically in the 1980s, so they think current conditions are pretty good. On the national level, we have no real divergence from what was presented in the Greenbook with the exception that in 1990 we're about 1/4 percentage point stronger [on GNP] than the Greenbook and inflation is roughly 1/4 percentage point more. We're back together in 1991, however. So, over the total horizon our forecast is not greatly different than the one the Greenbook portrays. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	20.0
199007	129	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	130	CORRIGAN	" Mr. Chairman, to start with, our own forecast continues to be very, very similar to Mike's forecast both in terms of GNP and inflation. There are some minor differences around the edges but they are really quite small. But insofar as the kind of bias [unintelligible] around the forecast is concerned, I associate myself with the comments that Mr. Boehne made at the opening of this discussion. And that is, if somebody put a gun to my head and said ""You have to put a forecast down,"" that's the forecast I would put down. But I don't think I'd have quite the same confidence in that forecast that I would have had three or four months ago--again, for some of the reasons that Ed Boehne mentioned. Anecdotally, there are some aspects of the consensus forecast that look pretty good. Certainly, the impression I get is that the export sector still is quite strong, quite similar to Ted's forecast if not even a bit stronger in volume terms. Again from what people say, the capital goods sector seems to be hanging in there but it is not robust by any stretch of the imagination. One interesting thing that someone mentioned to me just the other day--I don't know, Bob Parry, if you picked this up--was that this was the first instance that this individual could remember of a domestic airline failing to exercise options on Boeing 737s that they had had for three years. I get the sense that the capital goods sector is okay, but certainly not robust. The real estate sector is a tough call. Two or three things strike me there: one is that I do get the sense that the second- and third-level effects of the contraction of real estate are beginning to show up a little more directly for derivative products. That's not by any means confined to the Northeast. On the other hand, having spent a lot of time over the past several weeks with both bankers and with ﻿ my own examiners, some of whom I think are pretty darn good at this real estate stuff, the feeling I get is that while there is more bad news in the pipeline there isn't a sense of any kind of rout yet to come. There may be pockets geographically or otherwise in which that is true. But even in terms of what my own examiners tell me. drawing from the credit files and so forth, they see some things out there that still worry them, but they do not see a collapse in real estate markets generally. On the other hand, for what it's worth, those same examiners are more concerned today than they were 6 or 12 months ago about another round of LBO-related problems. This is stuff that they don't feel they know enough or are sure enough about to be able to significantly downgrade some of these [unintelligible] credits, but based on their experience their comfort zone is lower. [They cannot] justify substantial changes in classifications but they do tell me that they are more concerned about some of the LBO-related loans that are in there right now. So, there are some good aspects in that they don't see, nor do I sense from the major banks, a further black hole with regard to the real estate situation, although in the case of some of the small banks and some of the regional banks in the Northeast I don't think they would be quite as confident because those institutions have a much higher concentration in real estate loans than big banks. In the minds of everybody I talk to who has a broad- based business concern or lending concern, the big question is the consumer and what the consumer is thinking and going to do. I come away with an impression, not unlike what Gary Stern was saying, of so far so good. But I have this nagging feeling that any kind of a shock could knock consumer spending off in the wrong direction. Now, on the credit crunch issue more generally, I think we all have problems trying to rationalize [or to] quantify what we seem to see. I think that's partly because it is a financial shrinkage that has many different aspects to it. Much of it is demand-side oriented; some of it is supply-side oriented. But a lot of it is a reaction of both supply and demand to excesses of the past. When you try to put that all together, it's very hard to quantify; but I continue to think that there is something of consequence going on. Take the example that Joan Lovett referred to in her remarks about the Chrysler matter a couple of weeks ago, where it was announced that Chrysler was being put on a credit watch list for its commercial paper ratings and, just on the basis of the announcement alone, within three or four business days Chrysler had drawn down its bank lines by almost $3-1/2 billion to replace commercial paper that it couldn't roll over. That was just on the basis of an announcement! Now, one of the interesting things about that is that Chrysler had fully paid backup lines throughout the banking system. The bankers are saying to me point blank that if somebody comes in looking to draw on their lines and they don't have fully paid lines, forget it--the loans simply aren't going to be made. I think that is symptomatic of this very, very cautious, and ultimately healthy, process of shrinkage and consolidation that's going on. But any way you cut it, I think there is clearly something there. Again, I go back to Mr. Boehne's comment. On the inflation front, my sense of the situation at the moment is that the so-called core inflation rate hasn't changed. Maybe it is poised to go down, but when I read articles like I read in ﻿ this morning's paper about automobile price increases I have to wonder. In that sector everything is-- "	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	131	GREENSPAN	 [Unintelligible] your core inflation is psychiatric-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	132	CORRIGAN	 --identified with responding to problems [by raising] prices. I don't think that quite tells me we're out of the woods yet on the inflation side. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	133	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	134	HOSKINS	 Well, the Fourth District is a little more like Si Keehn's District than it is Ed Boehne's. There is not much of a change from the last time I reported. In terms of the manufacturing side, I would say we're more upbeat than the national counterpart, perhaps because we focused on capital spending and it turns out that in real terms capital spending plans for most firms are running increases of between 5 and 10 percent, whereas the Commerce Department's [number] is running at 3-1/2 percent. Again, like Si's District, steel is relatively strong. I don't have a really good explanation for that. In carbon, they are looking for a pretty good second half. And in stainless, a major firm in our area has very close to a record year in terms of its order book in the next two months. Also, a good portion of this is driven by a very strong export sector in the District. The weakness, as you might suspect, is in retail sales and construction. In terms of the credit crunch issue, we have talked to our small bank advisory council and, of course, to all of the major banks. Small bankers report no change in their standards; they are worried about the regulators coming in. And these small banks are seeing more deals come across now from S&Ls that have been closed; developers are moving over and searching the banks. So, there are plenty of deals in front of them, but most of them aren't very good. In terms of larger banks, we see rather flat to modest growth in loan demand--nothing spectacular. The one thing that I do sense in talking to my directors, who have been and remain very concerned about inflation-- and it's very apparent more recently--is that there is some concern about the economy. When I press them on their own firms, all of them are doing all right--some robust and some flat, but nobody's going over the cliff. Their perception is that somebody else is going over the cliff, but they don't know who at this point in time. So, there is a greater degree of caution in the minds of the business community in the District, it seems to me, than there was just last month. As far as the national outlook goes, we're a little stronger in terms of real growth than the Greenbook and a little less optimistic about reductions in inflation. I think the difficult times, looking at what has happened to money, are making some sort of sense out of that. Staff [unintelligible] but the confidence level around the forecast of velocity leaves me a little cold as well. The problem with retail sales is also a bit of a concern. I don't like to be much of a fine tuner; it has been going on for a time so I'm comfortable watching things for a while. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	49.0
199007	135	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	136	ANGELL	 I was a little struck. Jerry, when you said that we could knock consumer spending off in the wrong direction; I was rather startled by that. That's a new worry, because I presume you meant it might be knocked down. And, of course, if it is knocked down that means the saving rate is higher, and it means we would be getting this long-awaited adjustment in household behavior. I think it's an adjustment that comes quite naturally, given what has been showing up in the housing sector. It's quite clear that during most of the post-World War II economy, American households one-by-one went from better to worse [unintelligible]. The last old word was that the more money you borrowed to buy a house, the more money you made; and the only sad thing was that you didn't buy a bigger house. Of course, farmers learned that if you borrowed money to buy land or machinery, you made more money; and the oil people learned that if you borrowed more money to drill holes in the ground, you made more money. One-by-one all of these notions have bit the dust; housing in a sense is the last one. So, I'm somewhat optimistic that the United States saving rate will stay at the 6 percent level, whereas the staff is forecasting that it will fall back to 5-1/4 percent. So in this new environment of opportunity, we get just what we've been asking for for a long time. It does appear that what everybody said--that real interest rates do not determine savings rates--was wrong, like most everything else we were taught. And it does appear that we're making some real progress. Now, my forecast is somewhat weaker on nominal and real GNP than the staff's, but not as much as you would think, given my 6 percent saving rate, because I do anticipate that the export sector is going to continue [to support domestic output]. I have a great deal [unintelligible] and if we have more capacity opportunities and we have rather low profit margins in the domestic sector I think our economy is responding in rather an amazing way. I just note that hardly anyone talks about the fact that the trade deficit and the current account deficit now are projected to be less than half of what they were at the highest point. And it does seem quite likely now, from my perspective of course, that we're going to move into a balance-of-trade surplus position before my term is over. So it just looks to me as if-- 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199007	137	CORRIGAN	 When is your term over? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	31.0
199007	138	ANGELL	 It's a secret! I know this sounds too optimistic for most of you but I'll add to it by joining in with Si Keehn, Tom Melzer, Gary Stern, and Bob Black. I also believe that 1991 is the year that we will get the rather dramatic move on inflation numbers. The way the numbers are set I think the year-over- year CPI is not going to change much from the present 4.2 to 4.4 percent level until about next January. And then all of a sudden I think we're going to be seeing 3 percent numbers. But you better discount that, because I've been saying that the last two years! 	13	13	1.0	1.0	43.0
199007	139	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	140	LAWARE	" Well, I'm also in general agreement with the Greenbook except that for 1991 I'm not quite as optimistic about the rate of growth, given the interest rate assumptions. I don't think we have much room to maneuver. I think we're walking along a path that's rather close to the edge--if not the edge of the cliff, at least the ﻿ edge of the ditch. And I believe that the downside risk is greater than the upside risk, maybe significantly greater. I sense that this real estate malaise is spreading. It's not contained; it's creeping down the East Coast; we have it right here on the Potomac. And I think that's a matter of serious concern. The loan demand that has been cited as being relatively soft is a reflection of attitudes and confidence--not only individual confidence but business confidence as well. I think the publicity about taxes and the savings and loan [bail-out] costs and the debt problems of Trump and RJR and the whole junk bond story and all the other stories that are out there in the press can further depress the markets. Personal consumption expenditures are not exuberant by any means, and in a consumer-driven economy that doesn't spell much of an increase in growth to me. The saving rate is more likely to stay at 6 percent or even go higher because I think consumers are far more cautious than the Greenbook forecast would indicate. So, I think these psychological factors, if we did happen to slip into a recession for a couple of months, would accelerate the downhill slide. The watch words ought to be ""be alert and be cautious."" "	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199007	141	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	142	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, in the brief time that I've been on this Committee I can't remember an intermeeting period where it seems to me that less has changed. I almost have the sense that since May 15th we've been in a kind of suspended animation, with no startling new strengths or weaknesses showing up. Maybe the most important news is what didn't happen. Inflation was scary in the first quarter; we all expected and hoped that it would slow, and fortunately it has done that. So far the credit crunch hasn't eaten us alive. It still could, I suppose, but usually these things have a way of either gaining momentum or losing momentum. My sense is--and I hope it's correct --that it is not gaining momentum. Short term, I have some of the same concerns that Governor LaWare noted in the sense that a couple of things that are going on are unavoidable. One is in the area of construction. Commercial construction, housing--real estate generally--has probably not seen the bottom yet; and I worry about whether it could drag other things along with it excessively. The automobile industry has been borrowing from the future for some time and that's going to catch up with them sooner or later. And I must say that the notion of answering slow demand with rising prices strikes me as bizarre, and that's what they have just done. It's clear that things are going to change if we have been in a period of suspended animation; maybe no one will agree that we have. But shortly we will know much more than we know so far about the fiscal outlook. For better or worse, that's going to become clear quite soon. And perhaps as the next year develops, we're going to know much more about the impact of foreign events on our economy. They promise to be profound, perhaps more so than they have been in the past. But it seems to me that, for now at least, we can feel pretty good about the fact that our strategy continues to look like it's working and that we are on track: that we largely have the conditions that we had hoped to get, and that there is a reasonable prospect that the results flowing from that will be the ones that we had hoped for. So for the moment, I feel that the thing to do is to sit tight and watch closely. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
199007	143	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. ﻿ 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	144	MULLINS	 I really don't have much to add to the extensive review given by the presidents and my fellow governors. When I look at the data, it's clear to me that the economy is weaker than was projected earlier, but there are no compelling signs that we are headed for a recession. There are some positive signs, perhaps, on the inflation front but mostly in terms of breathing a sigh of relief that the early numbers for the year were transitory. I think one would have to look really hard to see strong evidence of any breakout on the down side. I would argue that there is greater risk on the down side. The consumer risk has been talked about. It is true that the retail sales numbers were only for one month, but they were accompanied by downward revisions for March and April, and the breadth of that retail sales report was not too encouraging since all categories fell except one. Pretty soon we will know whether we will get the bounceback we are hoping for or not. I tend to agree with Governor LaWare, though, that there are a lot of bad vibes coming across to consumers through the tube and through their home prices. And the confidence survey shows confidence to be a little low, although there doesn't seem to be any hard evidence that there's any kind of dive. I also worry a little about the services sector. We have had no real growth in employment in that sector, at least recently. And it seems to me that sooner or later they're going to have to deal with their cost structure. Inventories, the way I look at the data, show no real evidence of impending recession; the same is true for capital goods. Construction is obviously not in great shape. Exports have been really helpful. I wonder about the buoyancy of western Europe. The industrial production numbers of Germany have not seemed to me to be all that encouraging. On the inflation side, again, I don't see any major changes. I just went back and looked at a whole series of commodity prices a year ago versus now and it looks like there's nothing to be upset about there on the up side, and there may be some encouragement on the down side. Lumber is way up due to the spotted owl [unintelligible]. Scrap steel was higher than I expected, perhaps having to do with the auto companies thinking about strikes coming up and so forth. The one factor, which has been discussed here a little, that I find puzzling and concerning is the slow growth in monetary aggregates--not only M2 and M3, but also demand deposits, which presumably are mostly corporate demand deposits. When you look at a period in which all the aggregates have been growing more slowly than projected and add to that the notion of some sort of credit crunch going on, it's conceivable that monetary conditions are implicitly tighter than intended or projected. Over time that's going to be helpful on inflation but perhaps [adds] some risk to growth in the economy. So, I wonder about the implications of that. And while I generally would not disagree with the Greenbook, I guess that's what makes me believe that if there is a risk, it tends to be more on the down side than the up side. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	52.0
199007	145	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199007	146	SEGER	" I have a couple of comments. First of all, I do agree with Mike and the Greenbook that the economy is sluggish. In fact, I would even use the word ""weak"" to describe some sectors. I'm pleased to see some of the estimates getting down more in my neighborhood, which is a very low number for economic growth this year ﻿ and no growth next year. Maybe I'll have some company for next year as well. I will note just a couple of concerns that I have. Autos have been mentioned quite a bit, and I too was surprised by the announcement in today's Wall Street Journal about price hikes. I checked with two friends of mine, including one who is and his explanation was that they added on to the sticker so they can give bigger incentives. I'm not a marketing person, so you can explain to me later whether that makes sense. It still has a negative impact as far as the public is concerned. And I don't think it's too bright, especially when some of these same people have been telling me for some time that there has been a problem with sticker shock, particularly in parts of the country where income levels are a lot lower than they are around Washington. So. that's a problem. Also, the consumer debt load is a growing problem and the auto companies have been having trouble getting some of the would-be buyers qualified to get loans even by their own captive finance companies. You would think that they would bend over backwards to get the sale made, but I think that says something. On the credit availability side, I picked up some comments that some of the dealers themselves have been kicked out of commercial banks for their floor planning. So, credit availability is entering into autos in that way rather than on the individual consumer side. I talked with people at has been expected to fill this void by providing funds for floor planning; but because of their own problems, they're not always able to do that. And a growing number of car dealers are having financial difficulties. to the point of going bankrupt. The number of dealers going bankrupt in the first 6 months of this year is equal to the number that went into bankruptcy in 1987 and 1988 combined and is 50 percent above the number that went bankrupt in all of 1989. So, I think this is getting to be a serious problem and it [unintelligible] in a couple of ways. One is that they are not going to be around to make sales; the second is that they're unwilling to come up with a good order stream because they're just so stretched themselves that they cannot afford to carry decent-sized inventories. Everything I heard I don't view as a temporary phenomenon--something that's going to go away in the next couple of months, unfortunately. Then, of course, the auto makers have the UAW to negotiate with. I can't get anybody to admit, by the way, that they're adding to production in order to stockpile; that just does not seem to come through. In fact, what I hear more is that they're having a hard time getting enough orders from dealers to do their build out just so they can handle the production for which they already had ordered parts and supplies. Another area I want to say a few words about is housing. I probably deal with less-than-spectacular builders, but I don't think the problems are all going to be resolved in a hurry--particularly in smaller towns. I don't believe that it is easy just to walk out and find alternative sources of funds. Even though it would be nice to assume that, that doesn't seem to be the case. A person just called me this morning from California with another whole raft of stories about small and medium-size builders who are having problems getting financing. In some cases they are builders of single-family homes; others are builders of small apartments--10 to 12 unit apartments, not the big ones by developers who have been engaging in all sorts of wild extremes. I would like to think that housing ﻿ starts have bottomed out, Mike, but I'm not necessarily convinced that that's the case. Finally, on inventories, even though the aggregate numbers may look pretty good, there are growing examples of firms in the retailing industry, and to some extent in manufacturing, whose inventories are creeping up above where they would like to have them. So, these are the areas that I'm most concerned about at the moment. In looking ahead for 1991, my problem is that I can't see what's going to give this rather sad-sack situation a boost and turn it around, particularly with the talk about the tax hike. I had the TV on yesterday and it seemed to me that every program--every one of these ""Face the Nation"" kinds of shows--was going into this subject of the tax hike and President Bush breaking his pledge of no new taxes. You would have to be deaf and a low-grade moron to have missed this. And I think that is going to have a real impact going forward. On inflation psychology, I talked to the head of a big paper company and I'll just tell you what he said because I remember a year or year and a half ago paper was one of the industries that we worried about having shortages of capacity and that were passing out price hikes with abandon. Anyway, he said that they have ample to excess capacity at the moment and that there's nothing in the way of price increases either in the works now or on the horizon. Many prices of this particular producer are actually well below where they were a year ago and at the moment some prices are still declining. He thinks the rest of 1990 and 1991 should be [a period] of price stability for their whole industry, not just for his company. There has been new capacity added in the last year, year and a half, and there is going to be more coming on all the way through 1991 which, of course, will make it still tougher just to pass through any higher costs. From his point of view inflation is not a big problem, and he doesn't hear other business people that he speaks with mentioning inflation as a big problem either. He thinks the so-called inflation psychology is much more evident in the financial community than in the manufacturing arena. And I think he's probably right. Thank you. "	13	13	1.0	1.0	40.0
199007	147	GREENSPAN	 Well, that concludes the go-around, but I think we have time, as the last item on this evening's agenda, for Don Kohn to at least discuss the longer-term ranges for monetary policy. Then we will call it an evening. Remember, we're invited to the British Embassy for cocktails, I believe at 7:30 p.m., and dinner thereafter. Don. 	LR1	LR1	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	148	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be referring to tables in the Bluebook as I go along. At this meeting, the FOMC is required to reconsider its monetary and debt ranges for 1990 and to set ranges for 1991 on a provisional basis. One objective of this exercise is to give the Federal Reserve an opportunity to communicate to the Congress and the public something more about its longer-run strategy and objectives than is found in the regular directive and policy record. Unfortunately, the massive restructuring of credit flows and accompanying displacement of deposits has made it more difficult than usual to use the specified variables in the Humphrey Hawkins Act--money and credit--to signal the Committee's intentions, as well as to add an element of discipline to the conduct of policy. Nonetheless decisions about the ranges and the accompanying explanation can not be entirely divorced from strategic considerations. To assist the Committee in considering its choices, the bluebook on page 9 presented three alternative longer-run paths for monetary policy. In a fundamental sense, the underlying situation facing monetary policy has not changed for a couple of years, though the risks may have shifted over time. The economy has been operating at levels of resource utilization that, at the least, appear inconsistent with moderating inflation, and that may hold the potential for gradually intensifying pressures on costs and prices. Given this starting point, as can be seen in the baseline simulation, growth of the economy below the rate of increase of its potential probably will be an inevitable aspect of a policy that makes even modest progress in bringing down the rate of inflation. Absent a marked improvement in the credibility of our pursuit of a price stability objective, substantial progress against inflation, as under the tighter strategy II, would in turn require an appreciable shortfall in growth; an easier policy that keeps the unemployment rate from rising significantly, strategy III, implies no lower inflation and some tendency for it to rise. These strategies are indexed by differences in money growth, but they can be thought of more generally as different approaches to policy choices. The Committee has stated its intention to avoid both recession and accelerating inflation over the intermediate term--while seeking price stability over the long haul. In the context of executing policy under uncertainty, the baseline strategy, in effect, describes the results of putting about equal weights on the intermediate-term output and inflation objectives. The tighter strategy II can be seen as a policy in which the Committee puts more weight on insuring attainment of its inflation objective than avoiding a temporary shortfall in the economy, so that over the simulation period it tends to get both less inflation and less output. Strategy III is more consistent with a policy that tends to resist promptly tendencies for the economy to weaken appreciably, with the result that output is kept higher for a time, but so is inflation. From this perspective, the difficulty of executing something like strategy II may have increased in recent years, because the room for maneuver between higher inflation and recession has shrunk. This is partly a consequence of the starting point around the economy's potential, and partly owing to this year's slowing of labor force growth, which, if sustained, would lower potential growth of output itself. In these circumstances a policy that tends to lean against inflation will more likely end up with recession. And one that leans away from recession will more likely end up with higher inflation. The policy actions in terms of interest rates and money growth to implement any of these strategies depend on the strength of the underlying demands on the economy. The paths for money, interest rates and exchange rates behind the strategies in the bluebook are derived from the the assessment of these forces behind the greenbook forecast, which comprises the first few years of the baseline strategy. As Mike and Ted noted, that forecast now encompasses essentially no change in interest or exchange rates over the next few years. Thus strategy II implies some rise in interest and exchange rates over the near term-- with the federal funds rate about a half percent higher in the first quarter of 1991 and the weighted average exchange rate 1 percent higher-- while strategy III implies a similar drop in interest and exchange rates. The monetary growth rates consistent with each strategy are particularly uncertain at this time. To the usual questions concerning underlying conditions in the economy, the effects of the thrift restructuring and other disturbances to depository intermediaries are adding a larger-than-usual dollop of doubt about the relationship between money and spending and prices. As discussed in the memo sent to the Committee, growth in M2 as well as in M3 in the second quarter was substantially slower than we had expected just a few months ago. To some extent the shortfall in money growth reflected weaker growth in spending than had been anticipated. But most seemed to stem from the sharp pickup in thrift restructuring associated with a much more active RTC, transferring deposits to banks and taking assets onto its own balance sheet. The deposit transfers themselves do not affect M2, but in the context of moderate expansion of bank assets--despite picking up substantial volumes of cash and assets from RTC--and virtually no net asset growth at solvent thrifts, the potential flow of M2 deposits was more than was needed. In these circumstances, depositories saw a chance to enhance their profitability while retaining a sufficient deposit base by maintaining unusually low deposit rates relative to Treasury yields. A portion of the M2 shortfall cannot be accounted for in our M2 models in terms of nominal income and average deposit rates. But it may reflect the large volume of so-called hot money in thrifts that neither banks nor thrifts wanted and could be dislodged from M2 by a very marginal fall in offering rates. With heavy RTC activity expected to continue, and a large volume of brokered funds remaining at thrifts, we have carried the shortfall forward, and also the behavior pattern that produced it, so we see continued, though diminishing, upward shifts in M2 velocity through the end of 1992. Given this analysis, we are anticipating M2 growth of only 3-1/2 percent in 1990 and 4-1/2 percent in 1991 consistent with the greenbook forecast. The level of RTC activity and continued pressure on marginally solvent S&Ls are expected to produce substantial declines in thrift balance sheets through 1991. Banks also are anticipated to be under continuing pressures on their capital positions, and are poorly positioned to take up the slack. Consequently, we are projecting a very modest increase in depository assets and very little growth in M3--on the order of 1 and 1-1/2 percent in 1990 and 1991, respectively. In light of the apparent shift in the quantity of M2 associated with a given path for market interest rates and income, the Committee could consider a downward adjustment of the M2 range for 1990. One such alternative--a range of 2 to 6 percent--is shown on p.17 of the bluebook. Although we are not predicting it, M2 could well fall short of its current range for reasons unrelated to a weak economy, and the FOMC might not want to foster expectations that such a shortfall would trigger easing actions. A shift in the M2 range could be explained as a technical adjustment, and would not be without precedent: in 1983 and 1985 the M1 range was adjusted at mid-year to take account of what was perceived to be aberrant velocity behavior. On the other hand, there are strong arguments for leaving the range alone. M2 is still within its range, and is expected to remain there under the staff forecast. The 4-point range already should allow, to some extent, for the sort of unusual behavior we may be witnessing. Moreover, as noted earlier, some of the weakness is related to the economy and to reduced credit supplies holding down offering rates, and if there were thought to be significant downside risks to the outlook, the Committee might want to operate under the presumption that M2 growth below 3 percent would warrant a policy response, unless the further velocity shift clearly was even larger than anticipated. In the context of current concerns about the pace of economic, expansion, lowering the range on technical grounds might be misunderstood, and retaining it might provide at least symbolic assurance that the Federal Reserve did stand ready to counter cumulative economic weakness. M3 is not expected to come in within the range. This aggregate is now at the lower bound of its parallel band, and, barring a sudden cessation of RTC activity or burst of bank lending, is highly unlikely to grow at the 4-1/2 percent rate needed to put it within its cone by the fourth quarter. For this aggregate, much more than for M2, some action would seem to be needed, if only an announcement that we expected M3 to fall short of the range. A downward adjustment to the range, such as to the 0 to 4 percent alternative on p.17, could be explained as a technical adjustment made in response to the effects of thrift resolutions-- which the Committee had flagged, but did not anticipate to the full extent. The adjustment can be explained as technical, because the M3 shortfall, for the most part, does not seem to indicate a meaningful change in credit availability. Most of the assets sold or removed from thrifts wind up on the balance sheet of the government or are easily securitized and sold to non-depository lenders with little effect on the terms of residential mortgage credit and spending. As a consequence, smaller volumes of M3 can support a given level of spending--the upward shift in M3 velocity. The same reasons could be advanced for M3 falling short of its existing range should the Committee decide to retain the range and explain the shortfall. Not moving the range would avoid misinterpretation that the Federal Reserve was tightening. It would also avoid any sense that the Committee had enough confidence in its understanding of the forces at work to draw a new range that might have some weight in policy. But, accepting an unspecified shortfall from the range risks giving the impression that the Committee was indifferent to developments in credit flows. That issue could be dealt with in the discussion of the debt aggregate, assuming the Committee would not alter its range for 1990. Consideration might be given to paying a little more attention to this aggregate and its range, given the concerns about conditions in credit markets and the availability of sufficient credit at terms that will permit continued economic expansion. With regard to 1991, the bluebook on p. 19 gives two possible alternatives. Last July, the Committee simply carried forward its ranges for 1989 into 1990 on a provisional basis, on the grounds that the uncertainties in the financial system and economy were too large to permit judgment in July of appropriate ranges for the upcoming year. Then last February, when the picture for the current year was a little clearer, the Committee made substantial adjustments to its tentative ranges. That course of action would seem to be at least as warranted in mid-1990 as it was a year ago, given the uncertainties about fiscal policy as well as about developments in financial markets and their effects on money velocity. The drawback to this approach is that it might not be viewed as within the spirit of the Humphrey-Hawkins exercise, which called for monetary ranges for the coming year in July so that Congress could get a clearer view of the Federal Reserve's intention over a slightly longer time horizon. Before 1989 the Committee had announced different ranges for the upcoming year than were in force for the existing year in 8 out of 10 years. But retaining the 1990 range--assuming it is unchanged--for 1991 might be justified on policy as well as uncertainty grounds. If fiscal policy were to tighten substantially, growth in the upper portion of the current M2 range might be needed to foster the Committee's objectives for the economy and prices. Monetary policy also might have to ease interest rates appreciably if it appeared that credit availability problems were exerting a greater degree of restraint on spending than consistent with the Committee's objectives. In these latter circumstances, however, the lower interest rates might not boost M2 growth as much as suggested by historical relations, because banks--not wanting additional funds to make more loans--could drop offering rates quickly in response to lower market rates, keeping opportunity costs high. Still, if the credit crunch were a major concern, not reducing the range might more accurately convey the impression that the Federal Reserve was prepared to combat its effects with a more accommodative monetary policy. A potential difficulty with not reducing the M2 range is how it would be read relative to the Federal Reserve's price stability objective. The current range would be consistent with the easier 5-year strategy in that it provides more scope to lean promptly against any tendencies for the economy to soften appreciably, leading to a tendency for inflation to accelerate. A set of more rapid money growth ranges was not included among the alternatives for 1991 because the current ranges would encompass the easier strategy, even in the absence of a significant further velocity shift. A downward adjustment of the M2 range for 1991 could be seen as more consistent with some restraint on spending and prices. A half point reduction to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent would center this range around the staff outlook consistent with the greenbook forecast; a full point reduction might be considered consistent with even more emphasis on bringing down inflation, as under the tighter strategy II. Absent a continuing velocity shift however, M2 growth would be expected to be around 6 percent under the baseline, about in line with the growth in income, since no change in interest rates is projected. Thus any downward adjustment to the M2 range depends more on the velocity shift than it does on the restraint implied. In these circumstances, the odds are even greater that at some point in the future the M2 range would have to be increased, to deal with the return to more normal changes in velocity as well as the surge in money demand as nominal interest rates drop with disinflation. With regard to the M3 range, the Committee faces essentially the same problems and choices for 1991 as were discussed for 1990. If the range were left unchanged in 1990, it could be carried over to 1991 with the same sorts of explanations about the possibility of shortfalls depending on the course of thrift restructuring next year. The range could also be reduced, as in the suggested alternative of 0 to 4 percent, to more closely encompass the Committee's best guess about an outcome for next year consistent with its policy intentions. This would seem especially appropriate if the Committee also lowered the 1990 range. An unchanged debt range from 1990 to 1991 would be consistent with leaving other ranges unchanged, if the Committee chose to do so, and in addition might convey the Committee's concerns about the adequacy of credit flows. On the other hand, even reducing the range to 4 to 8 percent allows for very high debt growth. The center of that lower range, at 6 percent, is about in line with nominal income. Growth of debt at this rate might be viewed as a welcome development, implying more sensible leverage and more stable debt burdens, which the System might want to endorse.  	LR1	LR1	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	149	GREENSPAN	 We left off yesterday with the completion of Don Kohn's presentation on the long-term ranges and we are now open to questions. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	150	PARRY	 The growth rates for M2 and M3 in 1990 and 1991, particularly 1991, assume that the special factors that impacted 1990 will persist in 1991. Is that correct, particularly with regard to M3? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
199007	151	KOHN	 Yes, especially with regard to M3. We are assuming that the thrifts continue to shrink in 1991 and shrink at close to the rate that they did in 1990, or a little less. The marginally solvent ones will remain under pressure and there are enough assets and liabilities out there in the conservator thrifts to keep the RTC going at a pretty good clip for the next six quarters at least. So, we built in a continuing shrinkage of the thrift industry and [continuing] activity of the RTC. We built in moderate growth in bank credit--about 6-1/2 to 7 percent --which would be a slight pickup from now. So, we have diminishing effects relative to the second quarter when we had no growth in M2 and M3. We don't have that built in; we have that moving down or decreasing over time. But there are still some effects, yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	152	GREENSPAN	 If there are no other questions, I would like the members now to address the issue of the 1990 ranges--whether they should be the current ones or perhaps the alternate ranges--and I also would appreciate having the members' views on the 1991 ranges with respect to M2, M3, and debt. We will have to vote separately on the two sets of ranges, but I think it would be useful in this discussion around the table for the members to combine both years. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	153	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, first of all, I would like to compliment the staff on the excellent Bluebook. It's always good, of course, but the provision of the extensive longer-term alternatives was very helpful. Before I turn to the longer-term ranges, let me say a few words about the alternative [strategies] that were set out in the Bluebook. As I look at those, the first two scenarios are the only ones that seem consistent with our policy of trying to push down inflation; the third does not really accomplish our objective. The first scenario seems to me to be representative of the policy of gradualism that we have been following. I certainly endorse that policy; it is a policy that we ought to continue. It is a policy that is very frustrating in the sense that it does not produce very quick results, but I think we need to accept that anyway. It seems to me that a more aggressive policy at this time really would jeopardize the achievement of our long-term goal of price stability. One could argue about the credibility associated with a more aggressive stance, but I'm not convinced that that's a practical solution. I think we ought to be very pleased essentially with where we are with respect to policy. We obviously would like to have had [better] results in terms of the inflation numbers, but that will come if we exercise patience. I think we've done very well considering the posture of fiscal policy over this time. With that as a preamble on where I'm coming from, let me turn to the ranges. I would favor keeping the range for M2 at its present ﻿ level of 3 to 7 percent for 1990. Tampering with it six months into the year would reflect a degree of precision that we don't really have. There's a lot of uncertainty surrounding M2, and I think that any potential shortfall for 1990 can be explained when you testify. Now, with respect to M2 for 1991, I realize that as a signal effect we've had a tradition of generally lowering the range to indicate our continued attention to inflation. But with all of the uncertainty surrounding velocity and the state of M2, I would leave that range alone. Also, we have projections from the staff that it may grow more quickly anyway. So, I don't think it would be good to change the M2 range either for this year or for 1991; I would keep it at 3 to 7 percent. I would keep the M3 range the same in 1990 as well. An argument can be made to reduce that range for 1991; but again, given all of the uncertainty surrounding the S&L situation and velocity and all the things that Don indicated, I think the argument is stronger for keeping the range for M3 the same. So, I would not change the ranges either in 1990 or 1991 for either M2 or M3; nor would I change debt. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	39.0
199007	154	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	155	BLACK	 I concur, Mr. Chairman, with Bob Forrestal's statement about how useful these longer-run [Bluebook] simulations are because I like to look at monetary policy from a particularly long-run viewpoint. As I studied these, I found myself thinking about the Neal Resolution. If we can assume hypothetically--1'm sure it's purely hypothetical--that the Neal Resolution would pass Congress this year, we would be mandated to bring inflation down to zero by the year 1995, the last year shown in the simulations. Since we supported this resolution publicly in part of the testimony [presented by] many of us, the deceleration shown in the simulations in strategy II would seem to be the very least that we ought to be aiming for over the long run. Two percent is certainly not zero, but it's considerably closer than the 3-1/4 percent that we would have in the baseline simulation. And the simulations for strategy II do suggest that GNP growth would be very modest over this extended period of time in order to get inflation down to the 2 percent level over the five-year period. But as we are well aware, there are various kinds of models and the Board's model is not a particularly forward-looking model. I think one that took more consideration of the rational expectations [theory] might show that there would be a [higher] rate of real growth consistent with the progress against inflation that is shown in strategy II. In any case, the inflation rate in strategy II seems to me to be the minimum progress that would be consistent with our stated objectives. To help achieve this minimum progress--and I would hope we could do even better although I'm doubtful about that--I think we ought to reduce the ranges for M2 steadily over this entire period of time, with the goal of eventually bringing them down to 2-1/2 or 3 percent no later than 1995 . I had this sort of thinking in mind when I argued--I felt very persuasively but later found out very unconvincingly--in February that we ought to go to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for 1990. So, I would like to see us do that, and we can explain it on the basis of its behavior. There is some risk, I suppose, that some might think that was a tightening move, which I would not consider it to be. In any event, I do feel very strongly, whatever we do with the 1990 ranges, that we ought to cut them for 1991--in the case of M2, to 2 to 6 percent. I think the adoption of such a range would send the public a pretty clear signal that we have ﻿ a continued firm commitment to our anti-inflationary strategy. And it may be especially helpful to send this signal right now because of the recent fiscal developments and the likelihood that we're going to get added political pressure to ease policy aggressively if anything significant comes out of this. Now, if we did reduce the M2 ranges, it obviously makes sense to lower the M3 ranges too, although I really don't think that does a lot for us operationally. I'm pretty sympathetic to Governor Angell's suggestion that we eliminate M3. But I do think the staff produced a good memo that suggests that there is some marginal value in maintaining it. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	7.0
199007	156	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	157	ANGELL	 Yes. Even though I proposed eliminating M3, and I hold that position as the proper policy, I do not believe this is the right time to make that move. I think it would signal something we don't want to signal or to deal with at this time. In regard to the 1990 ranges, I wish to reaffirm the ranges adopted previously. I believe it's better for us to look at the target ranges as targets that we're planning to hit, based upon the assumptions we had at the beginning of the year, and then explain why we didn't hit them than it is for us to move the targets to hit the growth path. So, I am not-- and never have been before--very open to changing at mid-year. On the 1991 ranges, I agree with Bob Black that strategy II is the only alternative that's consistent with our stated objectives. Frankly, I wonder why I wasn't able to see a year ago that M2 growth might not be larger. But I really anticipated a somewhat weaker economy this year than we really ended up with, and my guess was that we might need the 3 to 7 percent for this year. But it seems to me that the behavior of households has changed and that many households, for example, find that they probably want to hold smaller balances and hold less non¬ tax-exempt interest-rate debt. And as the consumer saving rate has risen, that in a way brings with it a desire to hold a lower balance largely because of consumers' intolerance for debt, which I think finally has caught up. It does seem to me also that there may be other behavioral changes in people's willingness to hold M2. So I believe it's quite consistent to choose alternative I and alternative II and to choose for 1991 2 to 6 percent for M2. Now, I would also choose 2 to 6 percent for M3 on the basis that I have a commitment to only lower these ranges and never to raise them. And even though we may think that 0 to 4 percent makes sense for M3 for alternative II for 1991, I would hate to see us chase it down to that aberration and then end up moving it back. So, I prefer to leave the consistency of 2 to 6 percent for both M2 and M3. I recognize that there could be a scenario developed in which M2's growth path in 1991 might push the upper boundary of that 2 to 6 percent; that kind of risk is there. I'm very, very pleased, Mr. Chairman, that we've been able to get M2 growth down from those 9-1/2 percent [rates] that we had in 1985 and 1986 and to squeeze that M2 growth down without ever having the monetary shock that all of our critics thought we were producing. We're looking at four-year average growth of M2 of 5 percent, three- year average growth of M2 of 4-1/2 percent, two-year growth of M2 of about 4.2 percent, and one-year growth, I suppose, of less than 5 percent right now. So, we have the one-year, two-year, three-year, and four-year all there together and we're going to be able to get it to the 2 to 6 percent range without a monetary shock. It's just almost an ideal situation. On the debt, I'd use 5 to 9 percent. ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
199007	158	GREENSPAN	 President Syron. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	159	SYRON	 Well, I agree with everything that President Forrestal, President Black, and Governor Angell have said. I think that we are just about where we want to be, perhaps in the aggregates as well as in the real economy. There is just an awful large number of unknowns out there with respect to the real economy, the behavior of velocity, and what is going on in financial markets. From a policy perspective. I come out with a somewhat different result, but it's largely a matter of how one presents these things. I agree that strategies I and II are the only relevant choices, given what we need to accomplish. This really is a matter of velocity. In terms of how one presents this in testimony to the [Congressional] Committees and how it's read in the broader financial public community, there is some value to indicating that we're willing to change targets as velocity changes and to indicating that these [ranges] do not have [the certainty] of a physical science by a long shot. It makes it easier when we do have a problem to have indicated beforehand that we made these adjustments because of changes in velocity. Generally I also think that we should try to have targets that are somewhere in the middle of the range that we adopt rather than going up [to Congress] and extensively explaining that we're not going to be in the range but that's because of all of these [reasons]. I can see arguments on both sides of that, but that would be my preference. Given that and given the slight change in or flat velocity between 1990 and 1991, I would be in favor of the staff's alternative shown on page 17 [of the Bluebook] for both 1990 and 1991. Because we would be making a substantial change this year, I think that would require a change next year given that we expect a more normal pattern of economic growth in relation to velocity. Having said that, I would not be uncomfortable with--but I'm very worried about how to fine tune this image for 1990--changing, say, to an M2 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and whatever corresponding M3 range would be involved and then going to these ranges for 1991. But just as a matter of presentation, I'd prefer that we go up [to Congress] now and explain that there have been these changes and explain what our longer-term expectations are and how the monetary targets have to be adjusted for changes in velocity. So, that's the direction I would take. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	51.0

199007	163	PARRY	 Mr. Chairman, according to our projections, the present 3 to 7 percent range seems likely to accommodate the uncertainty about M2 over the remainder of this year, although it's likely to end up toward the bottom part of that range. Therefore, I recommend that we reaffirm our M2 target for 1990. For 1991, at least based upon our projections, I would recommend a 1/2 point reduction in the M2 target, but I certainly wouldn't have any problem if we reduced it a full point to 2 to 6 percent. On the basis of our projections a [reduction of] 1/2 point would accommodate the growth of M2 that we would see and put M2 exactly in the middle [of that lower range]. With regard to M3, the special factors that we've seen probably will continue to depress M3 in the second half of the year. And, of course, that's going to place the aggregate well below the current ﻿ range in December. But I prefer to retain the present M3 range for 1990 and just explain to the [Congressional] Committee that there are some very special factors--and uncertainty as to how long they're going to last as well--that may cause it to end up below the lower end. For 1991, I would suggest a reduction of 1 percentage point in the M3 range. Again, that would be consistent with the forecast of M3 that we have for 1991. I must admit, though, that the uncertainties associated with M3 are so great that my confidence in that range or the range that is in the alternative in the Bluebook is not very high. With regard to debt, 5 to 9 percent in 1990 and 4 to 8 percent in 1991 would be appropriate in my view. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	45.0
199007	164	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	165	STERN	" Where I start on all this, Mr. Chairman, is with the M2 growth rates that Governor Angell enumerated. We are well into our fourth year of moderate growth in that aggregate and I think it's important that we sustain that kind of performance. It's important principally because that's what is going to get us to our long-run objectives and to the kind of overall economic performance that we want to achieve in the long run. So having said that, I think we should lower the ranges for 1991, consistent with the alternatives specified here. I would apply that to all the variables although, as I said before, M2 is the one that I at least focus on principally. I think it's important that we consolidate what we have accomplished over the past several years, and in my judgment that's the kind of range that will help us do that. With regard to 1990, the current year, I feel a little less strongly about what we ought to do with the ranges. Despite some of the mysteries surrounding what has happened to M2 [and M3] recently, it seems to me that we have enough information with regard to the thrift contraction and so forth that it probably does make sense to lower the ranges for 1990 as well. That's where I would come out with regard to that issue. As I think Don mentioned yesterday, and certainly we're all aware of it. if we were to get some meaningful budget package and a meaningful shift in fiscal policy--and that's a big ""if""--we might want to reexamine all this. I certainly wouldn't prejudge where we would come out were that to happen; that's going to depend on an awful lot of things, including progress toward our objective and what's happening to market rates and bank offering rates, and the list goes on and on. So, at this point I think we just have to put that issue aside and be prepared to deal with it if and when it becomes appropriate. "	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0

199007	173	STERN	 Yes. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
199007	174	GREENSPAN	 I'd like to backtrack just a minute and re-ask the question that [Don Kohn] raised relative to this issue. Whether or not we can forecast quarter-by-quarter what the level of RTC resolutions will be, I feel uncomfortable arguing that the [anticipated trends of] the thrift changes alter our ranges. If in fact we knew about it and were able to make that judgment at the beginning of the year, then it can't be the thrift [developments] per se that create the [deviations from] our target. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	175	STERN	 Well, I have two reactions. One is that I don't think we felt that we knew the magnitude of the thrift [effects] with any precision. But I don't think it's just the question of the thrifts. The year is half over, so in some sense we have the 3-1/2 percent or so growth of M2 behind us for six months. We're looking at relatively modest projections for M2 growth for the third quarter as well. Those may turn out to be wrong, admittedly; but if they are in the ballpark, we have pretty modest growth for about 3/4 of the year and that's a fair amount of information it seems to me. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
199007	176	GREENSPAN	 Well, let me tell you the argument we would get up on the Hill. We're supposed to run monetary policy, at least in theory, on the basis of the targets that we set. If we set targets on the basis of the monetary policy that we run, they will argue that we have it backwards. Adjusting [the ranges] because of the fact that the money supply is veering off our targets is not an acceptable view up there. That's the reason I feel uncomfortable with this form of explanation. If there's a proved [or] partly anticipated structural change, then that's a valid statement. But I don't know how we can argue that because, in fact, the degree of [thrift] resolutions going on is not all that different from what we were telling the Congress they were going to be. It's just that the RTC didn't even do it for a while and finally they are trying to catch up at this particular stage. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	177	STERN	 Well, I guess I can't judge the degree of precision with which Congress views this [target - setting] . I've always viewed it as clearly having a wide range of uncertainty. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	41.0
199007	178	GREENSPAN	 Well, we can also raise some serious questions about the targets themselves; but I'm just talking about the issue of what's in the law and how we handle it. I hate to interrupt at this stage, but I need to ask the question of Don: How do we handle this? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	179	KOHN	 Well, I can't tell you exactly what we were assuming for thrift resolutions in the face of the decline in thrift assets last February. I'm sure that the staff was not assuming as much as we got in the second quarter. But I think maybe the more fundamental point here is that, whatever our assumptions were, we have never tried to set monetary targets in a period in which the depository institutions system was shrinking the way it is now. This is unprecedented. I agree with your point and Governor Mullins' point that we knew something was going on; we knew things were going to happen. I hope I'm not being too defensive if I say that in this ﻿ situation it's very difficult to judge how the whole thing is going to play out. One can easily get surprised and have it then seen as more of a velocity shift or a structural shift rather than a violation of the underlying policy. But there is some of the other too because we've had very weak bank credit growth; some of that may be a restraint on the economy, and one can't excuse that altogether. So, there is a mixture, I think, and it's not easy to sort out. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	180	PRELL	 Mr. Chairman, if I can follow-up: In thinking back to where we were when putting together the flow-of-funds projection at the beginning of the year, our focus was very much on our view that the thrift industry was going to contract and that that would result in some disruption of the mortgage market. We were very much concerned about who would pick up the mortgages. We anticipated that banks would pick up many of the liabilities the thrifts were giving up. I think we were sort of right in our analysis of the mortgage market effects of the thrift institution change, but we didn't anticipate the weakening in bank credit. And at that time we didn't anticipate all of the hits on bank capital that would arise as real estate loans were recognized to be less valuable and as these other events occurred, especially in New England, that affected bank capital and the growth of bank assets. That was another surprise. So we've had some significant surprises relative to what we were thinking on the supply side of the credit market and at depository institutions in particular.

199007	184	GREENSPAN	 You're right. The argument will be made that that is precisely what the targets are for. In the event that the economy is weakening and money supply slows, the expectation up on the Hill is that the Fed would then ease to push them back [on track]. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	185	PRELL	 But the economy is roughly on the track that we charted at the beginning of the year. The central tendency of the forecasts at this point looks very similar to what we had, except that the inflation rate is a little higher. Debt is on target, around the middle of its range, and I think that's what we indicated. In a sense it's this depository element, which is so important for the monetary aggregates, that has been disturbed. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	186	GREENSPAN	 What you're saying is that it was mis¬ estimated with respect to things on which we had no historical experience? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	187	PRELL	 Right, so I think there's a rationale-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	188	GREENSPAN	 Oh! Now. that's more like it. It's got to be something on which there was a judgment about how markets would behave under certain structural changes--not economic changes, not the business cycle. We took a shot at it; we didn't quite hit it; and we are readjusting. That's a credible argument. ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	189	PRELL	 Also, the Committee should have to decide what it is trying to communicate [via] the monetary aggregates. Are they closer to ultimate objectives for your purpose in policymaking or are they just instruments? In a sense it's as if you were shooting at the moon; you set your direction initially and then found you were off target. It seems to me completely reasonable to say you adjusted your instruments rather than shoot past the moon and then explain later why you missed. That may be an exaggeration of the differences here in the way one can view it, but I think you have to decide just how important the monetary aggregates are per se as a representation of your policy.

199007	191	KOHN	 Well, I think they were both Ml adjustments; the Ml ranges were increased [because] we had velocity surprises. They happened to be in the direction of increases rather than decreases. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0

199007	194	BOEHNE	 For 1990, I would keep M2 and debt the same, but I would make a technical adjustment on M3. The rationale for keeping M2 and debt the same is that we are fundamentally on target, that there are uncertainties, but the ranges that we have, with a 4-point spread, are wide enough to accommodate that. I think that conveys a message that we are fundamentally happy with the basic thrust of policy. M3 I would adjust technically, largely for the argument that was just given. We have a target for M3 that we almost surely cannot hit because we mis-estimated what it ought to be at the beginning of the year. We mis-estimated these deposit flows and I think we ought simply to face up to it and make that adjustment. So, I would go with a 0 to 4 percent range for M3 in 1990. For 1991, I think it is important to continue on this longer- run track of lowering the aggregates, conveying the notion that we are serious about working inflation down. I would lower the ranges for M2 and debt by 1/2 percentage point so that we would end up with 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for debt. I would keep M3 the same, 0 to 4 percent, on grounds that we made a technical adjustment now and we ought to wait and see whether that's accurate. If we have to adjust it again, we have to adjust it again. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	33.0

199007	196	GUFFEY	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'd like to join those who start from the premise that strategy II on the long run--the one labeled ""tighter"" [in the Bluebook]--is consistent with our objective. I also would join those who have indicated that where we are today is about where we want to be and about where we had projected in the past. I think it's rather remarkable. With that background. I would prefer to take the opportunity that I think is now available to ratchet down M2. simply because over the long term 6 percent growth in M2 is the maximum growth that we can sustain and still achieve the ﻿ objectives that we're looking for. As a result, I would ratchet down M2 by 1 percentage point on both the top and the bottom for both 1990 and 1991, simply taking advantage of the window that seems to me to be available. With regard to M3, there's some debate as to whether or not we should keep M3. There are those who have spoken on that in the past --particularly Governor Angell, who says that he would not pursue his feeling about doing away with M3. I would want to keep M3. But as has been indicated in the discussions before by the staff and others, it seems that M3 needs to be adjusted because of the uncertainties that have occurred. I don't like the proposal by the staff of a 0 to 4 percent range; I don't like the 0. As a result, I would like to see an adjustment to a 1 to 5 percent range for M3 and I would maintain debt at 5 to 9 percent. I would do both of those adjustments, to M2 and M3, now rather than later.

199007	202	LAWARE	 Mr. Chairman. I'm persuaded that to go to strategy II may accelerate us a little toward that ditch I was talking about yesterday. So, I would rather stay with strategy I. Consistent with that. I would like to keep the range of 3 to 7 percent for M2 for 1990 but reduce it to 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for 1991. I agree with President Boehne that we can make a rational and credible argument for a reduction in the M3 range and we should do it now. I don't get so disturbed by 0 because I don't consider it nothing; I just consider it [another] point on a range. So far as debt is concerned, the 5 to 9 percent for 1990 is acceptable, but I would move it down to 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for 1991. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	50.0

199007	205	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	206	MELZER	 I have a couple of general thoughts on this. I would say first of all, in terms of long-run strategies, that I would be in favor of strategy II. Generally, I think there is a lot more informational value in the ranges if we gear them to what we believe long-term trends are. In other words, I get very concerned about [moving around] these ranges over time. Given where we are and where we're headed, there is very much the prospect of ratcheting these ranges down at some point to accommodate some short-term velocity development and then having to bump them back up. And I think that becomes very confusing. Personally, I like to think of these ranges much as Bob Black does--in terms of where we want them to be in a long-term sense--and I'd move them gradually toward that. I guess that view leads to two points: (1) with respect to problems in the current year, I would [allow actual growth outside] the ranges and explain that and not reset them; and (2) as to the future year, ﻿ particularly with something like M3 which I think has limited value anyway, I would set a range that's reasonable in the context of what we think the long-term trends are, knowing full well that actual growth probably will miss it. I'd telegraph that right up front and indicate that we are going to be putting less weight on it for that reason. The other point I would make is that while I'm in favor of strategy II, I don't think we have all that far to go. If you take the number Bob Black threw out--around 3 percent--as what we might want to get in terms of M2 growth, that would assume roughly 3 percent potential growth in the economy, with roughly 0 percent velocity. Taking that as the center point of the range, that means we have the potential of eventually getting down to 1 to 5 percent on the range. Therefore, we'd be taking a pretty big bite out of what we have left if we ratchet the ranges down a full percentage point right now. So, all of that put together would lead me simply to reaffirm the 1990 ranges. And in 1991, I would ratchet M2 down by 1/2 percentage point and, if it is in a longer-term sense consistent with that, do the same with M3 and debt. I look to the staff for guidance on that, but that's essentially where I am. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	42.0
199007	207	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	208	KELLEY	 Mr. Chairman, Bob Forrestal summed it up well for me when he started us off this morning. I think our strategy is on track. There are good prospects that it will work acceptably and I think we have reason to be fairly pleased so far. And I would like to give that strategy every chance to work. I think that strategy definitely calls for an inflation result on the strategy II matrix, but I'm not quite sure what necessarily is going to be required in the way of aggregates growth to achieve that. As far as 1990 goes, I am definitely of the school of targeting and budgeting that would say we shouldn't shift in the middle of the game. If we are missing the targets, then we should explain why we are missing them but not shift the target at that point in time. So for that reason, I would reaffirm all the ranges for 1990 and, if we miss on M3, explain the technical reasons why that happened. For 1991 I would stay with 3 to 7 percent for M2 because, given where it is now and where it looks like it is going to be in the rest of 1990, I would not be comfortable with the prospect of having an even lower number, 2 percent, be in the range of acceptability. So, I would leave the target for M2 in 1991 at the 3 to 7 percent we presently have. I have been convinced by Don and others that the M3 realities have changed. As a consequence, for 1991 I would go to the 0 to 4 percent range because of those technical realities. On the debt side, I could be comfortable with either 4 to 8 or 5 to 9 percent. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
199007	209	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	210	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, for reasons that I think are clear from the discussion, we are going through a period where the uncertainties are particularly high with regard to the aggregates. While it's clear we will be low in the range for M2 and below the range for M3, I think changing at this point implies a [degree of certainty] that we just don't have. Therefore, I'd be inclined to maintain the 1990 ranges as they are. In your testimony you can explain it. It does seem to me that the exchange that you had with ﻿ Mike and Don a moment ago begins to provide a good basis for reducing the ranges. First, Don's model and our models are not perfect; they certainly give as good an educated guess as we can come up with as to how things are going to work out. So, I do think there's a basis for lowering [the ranges]. Secondly, Don used the word ""symbolism"" in his text and I think that is. important. In effect, it's why we should continue the program of lowering the ranges. So, I would lower the 1991 ranges. Specifically, for M2"" I'd be a bit more comfortable with 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. I don't feel strongly about it, but I have a minor preference there. I think we definitely should continue targeting M3. In a period of uncertainty, the more alternatives we have the better off we are; therefore, I'd continue M3. Somehow reducing it to 0 to 4 percent seems like a big drop; I have a minor preference for 1 to 5 percent. I don't feel very strongly about debt, but it does seem to me that the economy may begin to pick up next year as the forecast suggests that it might; therefore, I'd prefer to keep the debt range at 5 to 9 percent for next year.

I think we ought to be comfortable, as many people around this table have already indicated, that we have made good progress toward that [objective], probably more than I thought we would early on. I agree with Tom Melzer's point that it is important not to bounce the ranges around. I would not want to see them have to be moved up because of suspected shifts in velocity. But that doesn't pose a particular problem for me since I wanted a 2 to 6 percent range [for M2] anyway. I have some concerns about the aggregates and about the point that Dave Mullins made--that they all are sending us the same signal and they are slowing rather dramatically. But since I was comfortable in February with 2 to 6 percent, I think we ought to go to 2 to 6 percent. There is a rationale to explain that: It is our best estimate of where we are at this point in time and I think Congress ought to have that information.

199007	227	HOSKINS	 I want the staff's alternatives both for 1990 and 1991. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
199007	228	GREENSPAN	 Okay. It's 2 to 6, 0 to 4. and 5 to 9 percent for both 1990 and 1991. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	229	HOSKINS	 No, it's 4 to 8 percent [for debt] for 1991. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	49.0
199007	230	GREENSPAN	 Well, something I'm looking at has a mistake on it. Governor Seger. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	231	SEGER	 Well, like everybody else here, I think it's great to be a long-range thinker and strategist. I'm also looking backward 6 years to the first Humphrey-Hawkins meeting I attended in 1984. Just to remind you folks, we had an M2 range of 6 to 9 percent and we have brought it down to 3 to 7 percent, which is quite a significant change. The actual M2 growth ran 7.7 percent for 1984 and we are estimating it at around 3-1/2 percent this year. I think that's very significant. Also, these ranges have been moved down very consistently; we haven't had them popping around like popcorn, and I think that's good also. On M3 we went from a 6 to 9 percent range down to where we are now, 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent, and the actual growth went from 10-1/2 percent down to an estimated 1.1 percent this year. I'm just mentioning this because there has been a very significant amount of squeezing out of liquidity in the economy over that period. So, having pointed that out and looking ahead with respect to the strategies, I'm a baseline strategy supporter. With all due respect to the forecasters, I'm just not convinced, looking out 5 years at the additional inflation relief we would get from going the tighter route, that it's worth taking a chance on. I realize that's a value judgment; but it's the way I feel. I'm also not convinced that tightening policy will generate greater growth out in 1995. So, I would go with strategy I. In terms of the ranges for 1990, I've never supported changing the ranges in the middle of the year; I just don't think it's ﻿ a good idea. I believe that these ought to be set with some idea of stability and [we should] just keep moving them downward; we can pause [in implementing the] decline, but I just think it's very disruptive to have too much volatility in the ranges themselves. So, I would be for keeping the ranges where there are, including the M3 range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent. And instead of just dismissing this [shortfall] as a technicality because of RTC activities, I think a big part of the credit crunch story is in here. Maybe we ought to look at this and ask ourselves whether we should be satisfied with a 1 percent increase in M3 for 1990. If many people up on the Hill are continuing to get letters from their unhappy constituents, they might be asking that same question or a similar one. So, I would support keeping the same ranges for this year that we established earlier. And for 1991, I also would keep the same ranges for the main reason that we have another crack at these in February. There are a lot of uncertainties about velocity and the economy in general--the RTC activities and a whole lot of other things. Therefore, there's something to be said for hanging in there with the existing ranges and then, with six months' additional information and knowledge, if we're off we can adjust them at the next Humphrey-Hawkins meeting. Thank you. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	40.0
199007	232	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	233	CORRIGAN	 Let me make a general comment first. and that is that I cannot quite shake the feeling that there may be something going on here that's a little more real. Even all the discussion about the RTC represents something very real; and what it represents is that in the prior period there was a heck of a lot of bad debt created in the financial system. So, it's not just a kind of accounting change. What I keep toying with in my mind is that there is perhaps a small possibility that we are going through a phase here where this retrenchment of the financial system, as symbolized by the RTC and the slow growth of bank credit and the slowdown of overall debt, is something quite real and something that need not even be transitory. If you look at the great bulk of experience over recent years, we have had this very substantial disconnection, for example, between the growth of debt in the economy and the growth of GNP. And it turns out that a lot of that disconnection reflects the fact that a lot of that debt was bad debt. It's now showing up as RTC and bank write-offs and junk bond write-offs, etc. So, there may be something here that goes beyond the so-called transitory factors. I tend to take a rather eclectic view of all these Ms, but I am struck that even Mr. Kohn can't explain, no matter how hard he tries, a sizable part of the shortfall in M2 in the second quarter. So. again, I'm not quite sure that we fully grasp, or at least that I fully grasp, all that's going on here in these relationships. For that reason I think we do have to be a bit more cautious about the interpretations'that we put on these things. Now, with that general point in mind, Mr. Chairman, for 1990 I would keep M2 where it is at 3 to 7 percent and keep debt where it is at 5 to 9 percent. For 1991, I'd be thinking in terms of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for debt. For M3, I'm quite prepared to let you do whatever you feel most comfortable doing. But even in the framework of letting you do whatever you feel most comfortable doing, it's possible that a compromise--in the interest of cohesion in the Committee--might be to put it at 1 to 5 percent for ﻿ both years. But I have no strong feeling on that at all; I'm quite prepared to let you explain it because basically you've got to explain it one way or another. Either you have to explain why we changed it or you have to explain why we didn't change it. And I would leave that to you. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	31.0
199007	234	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Governor Mullins. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	235	MULLINS	 My preference would be to leave the 1990 ranges essentially the same. I don't like the perception of moving the targets to fit the data; I think monetary aggregates are pretty important and not just instruments. It also bothers me--the point that the Vice Chairman made--that there's an unexplained component of this. If we really could explain it as just a portfolio shift from one part to another part, I'd feel a little more comfortable with it. I think we ought to have the burden of explaining what's going on, and I generally agree with Tom's point that we ought to set ranges based upon long-term factors and have the discipline put on us of explaining aberrations rather than shift the ranges to try to fit the aberrations. So, for 1990, I would keep the same ranges. On 1991, again, I don't like the idea of moving the targets around. I am concerned with lowering the tentative targets for 1991 in the current environment of fiscal uncertainty as well as the uncertainty of what really is happening to the monetary aggregates. The way I would view the [appropriate] stance for monetary policy, I would hate for us to come back and tentatively have to move the ranges in the opposite direction. Also, I agree with Governor Kelly on M2; I'm not entirely comfortable with the notion that 2 percent would be acceptable. So, I would prefer that the M2 range for 1991 be kept at 3 to 7 percent, although to be honest with you--maybe because I'm new on the Board and I have less courage than the old warriors--I wouldn't be uncomfortable moving it down 1/2 percentage point. On M3, I still would prefer to try to have a range that is more consistent with what we expect it to be over the longer term. I think the RTC is going to go in fits and starts. When the new guy gets in there, I wouldn't be surprised to see a period of time in which there is not a lot of action--a period in which they gear up and change strategies. So, I would prefer not moving that range to 0 to 4 percent, but keeping it at more the long-term average range. I wouldn't fight keeping it where it is, but I would feel comfortable with 2 to 6 percent, which would require the Chairman to explain the deviations in 1991 as well. For debt I think 5 to 9 percent would be fine and I could [accept] a 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent range as well. So, my general stance is that we ought to stick with the targets, especially as long as there is uncertainty. If there were no unexplained component, then I would feel much better about shifting the targets. I guess I'm a little more cautious about 1991, given the current stance. If we move the ranges down, [we might] then find ourselves in a position of having to consider a move back. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	52.0
199007	236	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. I have here in front of me a set of numbers [on the members' preferences], which led me to ask whether the coffee was ready. But frankly, whether it is or not, we will have a short recess. [Coffee break] ﻿ 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	237	GREENSPAN	 Our abacuses evolved the following results, which I will eventually put to an official vote: There is for 1990 an overwhelming balance [of preferences] for no change for the M2 range; a marginal [preference to] shift toward 0 to 4 percent for M3; and overwhelming, if not unanimous, support for keeping debt unchanged. For 1991, it's not that we're all over the place; we are close. I inferred with great insight, because that's what it required, that the mode or mean was something resembling 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent for M2. The predominance of 0 to 4 percent for M3 in 1991 was rather large, and for debt it looks to be 4-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent. So, what I shall do is to call for two votes, one for 1990 and one for 1991. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	238	KOHN	 Mr. Chairman, there is language in the Bluebook suggested, if the Committee did decide to reduce the 1990 range for M3 and wanted to consider special language. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	239	GREENSPAN	 Well, Norm, why don't you read it? 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	240	BERNARD	" I'm reading from page 4 starting with line 72 if you're using the draft directive; if you're using the Bluebook it's page 27, paragraph 29. ""In furtherance of these objectives the Committee reaffirmed at this meeting the range it had established in February for M2 growth of 3 to 7 percent, measured from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990. The Committee also retained the monitoring range of 5 to 9 percent for the year that it had set for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt. With regard to M3, the Committee recognized that the ongoing restructuring of thrift depository institutions had depressed its growth relative to spending and total credit, though to an uncertain extent. Taking account of the outlook for unusually strong M3 velocity, the Committee decided to reduce the 1990 range to 0 to 4 percent."" "	LR2	LR2	0.0	0.0	999.0
199007	241	ANGELL	 Mr. Chairman, since the other items seem to be compromises, I wonder why there isn't room for a compromise on M3, as the Vice Chairman of the Committee suggested. That is, the 1 to 5 percent range does accommodate what we expect to happen in 1990, I think, and it increases the odds for those of us who do not want to vote for an increase in the range to have a better chance of not having to do so. You did not have a majority vote, as I counted, on the 0 to 4 percent. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
199007	242	GREENSPAN	 That's correct; it was a very close showing. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0
199007	243	ANGELL	 So, I'm just wondering why we couldn't take the compromise between those of us who are for 2 to 6 percent and those who are for 0 to 4 percent and come out with 1 to 5 percent. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
199007	244	KELLEY	 If that is a substitute motion, I will second it. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	48.0
199007	245	GREENSPAN	" I was about to suggest that we do this officially. I will read it as 0 to 4 percent; you propose an amendment to raise it to 1 to 5 percent and we'll vote on that particular amendment. You may well be right that there is support for that. I was puzzled a little about the reasons that we had discussed earlier about the restructuring of the thrift depository institutions. ﻿ [I'd suggest adding] ""more than anticipated"" to the phrase ""depressed its growth relative to spending and total credit.""

199007	246	ANGELL	 Well, getting into this is a kind of trap. I just think that this will pose a problem for you when you start using that language up on the Hill. I think your suggestion is a great idea. 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	43.0
199007	247	GREENSPAN	 Unless the Committee votes for no change, we have to use some language and this is the least-- 	LR2	LR2	0.0	1.0	47.0

199007	294	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The issue facing the Committee as it views its near-term policy options seems to be whether conditions warrant staying with the current stance of no action, going to an immediate easing, or to something in between in the form of a strong predilection toward ease over the intermeeting period. Financial market indicators are giving mixed signals as to the outlook for the economy and policy. Most prices in financial and closely related markets do not suggest that policy is obviously too tight. Real interest rates in both long and short-term markets, though above lows of last year, are well below earlier peaks. Our measure of the real corporate bond rate is close to estimates of the average level of the equilibrium real rate over the last decade or so. The equilibrium real rate undoubtedly varies somewhat over time, but actual real rates close to the current equilibrium would imply an economy with fairly stable inflation rates and also one in which weakness--or strength--in activity was unlikely to cumulate for very long, absent a push from another source. Perhaps reflecting this sanguine outlook, stock prices are near record levels and price-earnings ratios are relatively high. The foreign exchange value of the dollar is in the lower portion of the post-Louvre trading range, which does not suggest monetary stringency, at least relative to conditions abroad, and commodity prices outside of gold and oil are up on balance this year. Of course, real interest rates in markets may be understating the degree of restraint on spending from credit market conditions if part of that restraint is coming from increases in administered lending rates, tighter nonprice terms and simple unavailability of credit for borrowers without access to open credit markets. Monetary restraint from this source would not necessarily be inconsistent with the behavior of the stock market or dollar if these markets saw the restraint as appropriate--or they anticipated a timely easing by the Federal Reserve. However, expectations of such a policy move are not built into the yield curve. While markets seem to think there's a greater chance that policy will ease before it tightens, they have not built a significant relaxation of policy into their expectations. For the near-term future, expectations of little change in policy could reflect a reading of the Federal Reserve's predilections from the lack of recent policy actions and press reports. But this would not explain the relatively flat slope of the yield curve further out, which suggests a market outlook for interest rates remarkably close to that of the staff. Information on credit conditions and the behavior of assets and liabilities at depository institutions, however, may be giving cautionary signals about the effect of financial conditions on the economy, though they need to be interpreted especially carefully. Monetary aggregates have been much weaker than expected, as we have already discussed. A great deal of this weakness in M2 and M3 we believe to have few implications for the economy and spending. For M2, perhaps the more puzzling of the aggregates, the runoff of high-yield, interest sensitive money from thrifts as they were resolved or cut back most likely has little significance for economic activity. And, to the extent the weakness in M2 owed to unattractive offering rates spurred by a drop in depository assets of the sort easily securitized, the public's liquidity on the one side, and the terms on which it borrowed on the other, would be affected only a little. But some of the weakness in M2 apparently has reflected a shortfall in spending relative to projections, and some could portend future softness in the economy if it resulted from a constriction on credit to some borrowers who lacked easy access to market credit directly or through securitization of their loans. Some of this clearly is going on, even outside the real estate and LBO areas. Many small businesses apparently are facing tighter nonprice terms and a small rise in loan rates relative to the federal funds rate. The rate increases aren't much--perhaps 25 basis points--and the spread of the loan rate relative to the funds rate is within historical standards. Still, the wider spread does tend to confirm some pulling back of credit by bank lenders. The quantitative significance of this is hard to evaluate. Business borrowing from banks has been weak for well over a year, abstracting from merger-related lending. Data for June suggest a modest strengthening of C&I loans at banks--though further weakness in real estate and consumer loans. For the second quarter, we are estimating some strengthening of business debt growth, as investmentgrade borrowers step up bond issuance. Of course, restraint on credit may be evident only with a lag. As Mike noted, some such restraint is built into the greenbook forecast. In that forecast, we are expecting a modest pickup in M2 growth over the third quarter, but only sufficient to keep this aggregate in the lower half of its range, as the RTC remains active and banks keep credit growth moderate. Week-to-week changes in M2 are particularly difficult to predict and interpret, since they depend in part on the pattern of RTC activity and the reaction of the depositors and purchasing institutions. We have built into our path some near-term weakness of M2, owing to the burst of RTC spending in the days just before quarter-end, and as a consequence this aggregate could approach the lower end of its 3 to 7 percent growth cone before strengthening somewhat. With thrifts continuing to shrink, M3 growth is expected to be especially weak-- perhaps around 1 percent over the third quarter. Alternative A, or some lesser easing of policy, would seem to connote a judgment that effective restraint on the economy, signalled in part through the aggregates and the shrinkage of depository intermediation, was creating too big a risk of an unacceptable slowing of output or even a recession. An easing now could be viewed as a form of insurance, reducing the odds on recession if the credit situation is worse than now seems apparent. Unless upcoming data show some bounce in economic activity, it seems likely that policy easing would reduce long-term as well as short-term interest rates, and the dollar exchange rate as well. It may be that, in light of the situation at depository intermediaries, the price or availability of credit extended and held by those institutions would not change as much as usual when policy was eased--the so-called pushing on a string syndrome. As a consequence, the extent of the economy's response to an easing might be muted to a degree. But that degree should be small. As the role of depositories as holders of credit diminishes in financial markets, so too does the importance of their particular response to lower or higher interest rates in the channels of policy influence on the economy. At the same time, the increasing proportion of borrowers having direct or indirect access to open credit markets--including household mortgage and credit card borrowers--and the growing proportions of spending and production in foreign trade, suggest no decrease and perhaps some increase in the power of lower interest and exchange rates and higher asset values from easier policy to stimulate spending. Alternative B might be considered a holding action to await more definitive indications of the underlying state of the economy and financial markets. Not only the employment data of this Friday, but the PPI and retail sales of next Friday might be of special interest at this time, along with the weekly money and credit data. If there were particular concerns about down-side risks, a tilt in the intermeeting language of the directive would signal the Manager to be especially alert to the possibility the policy should be eased in response to indications in the data that the economy was soft or financial conditions tightening. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
199007	295	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Don? If not, why don't I get started then on the Committee's [unintelligible]. The same forces that I discussed at the last meeting are still operative but, as best I can judge, they turned up a notch. I think we are observing the unwinding from several years of excess credit expansion relative to the economy. One can see that in virtually all the aggregates for the money supply, obviously, and just as importantly in a wide variety of other sub-elements within the flow-of-funds [accounts]. As you may recall, they exhibited some fairly significant credit acceleration, in part as a result of real estate appreciation, mergers and acquisitions, LBOs, and some overall degree of exuberance in the middle 1980s, which I think carried forward and is now gradually ﻿ unwinding. I think what we are looking at is a credit slowing in which in large measure we're going back to historical relationships. And the only question that we really have to focus upon is whether in the process the contraction is overdone, which of course is what one normally would expect whenever one gets these types of adjustments. In any event, I think we're seeing the credit slowing interacting with the hard asset balance sheet items--that is, the stock adjustment processes--which I believe I mentioned at the last meeting. Motor vehicles--which had a long run with the number of cars on the road [increasing] as the number of two- and three-car families [rose]--and a variety of other elements all were above trend and then ran into a stone wall in 1989. We're looking at that sort of adjustment. We're obviously seeing the same problem in a more extravagant way in the commercial real estate markets with the vacancies involved; we're also getting some of the problems in residential real estate, though it's obviously far less of a problem than in commercial real estate. There is some slowing in the rate of increase in equipment stock as well. As I indicated last time and would reiterate today, I think the reason why that process, which I believe historically would almost always have dumped us into a recession, failed to do so was because the inventory management change has created a much less volatile inventory investment pattern and essentially removed a major factor that tends to tilt the economy over into recession. In the very near term there's little evidence that I can see to suggest that in fact the economy is tilting over. The motor vehicle assemblies and the extraordinary electric utility output because of weather clearly suggest that there is some temporary uptick--perhaps a small one--in the June industrial production index. But from what everyone can see in there, one must conclude that it is probably temporary because there's really no other evidence of an acceleration taking place. While orders are holding up--or perhaps stated more appropriately they have stabilized [after] their decline--and we have some positive signs from the NAPM survey the other day, backlogs are stagnant; and some surveys suggest they may even be softening slightly. On top of all this, there's at least a better case to be made at this point that inflationary pressures are cresting. The wage data are no longer carrying through with evidence of an acceleration. An experimental unit cost analysis of manufacturing, which the staff has been working on. had earlier indicated underlying cyclically adjusted unit costs actually rising. In effect, one way of looking at it was that with price inflation steady while profit margins were going down more than cyclically, the adjusted cost elements clearly were rising. That too now seems to have stabilized; but I would not want to put too much emphasis on those data because they do kick around a good deal. But at least they are no longer signalling a firmer inflationary tone. In any event, in this particular economic context I would say that it would be inappropriate for the money markets to be tightening either on their own or through Federal Reserve action. While the evidence here is clearly difficult to come by, it strikes me that it is becoming increasingly evident both from fragmentary data and anecdotal reports, as well as history I guess, that the money markets at the current funds rate are actually tightening. We are seeing up through May, the last survey period, some marginal evidence of an increase in some loan rates and an opening up of the spread of loan rates against the funds rate. My suspicion, however, is that when the ﻿ data come out for the current period--I don't know when that will be but it's a number of weeks away--what we are picking up anecdotally has to show through in some evidence that there has been some pulling back. By pulling back, I mean essentially that commercial banks are concerned about their capital positions and are doing some form of marginal credit rationing. I think the anecdotal evidence has reached a point at this stage that it is extremely unlikely to be without any basis whatever. To be sure, when one goes from excess credit extension to normal, it feels as though it's a tightening; and that, I would expect, is unquestionably the vast majority of what this credit crunch is all about. But I would suspect that there is a little more to this. The particular statistic that bothers me the most as a consequence of all this is the unexplained part of M2, which has clearly sneaked down into a no change range. According to what Don was saying, it's holding--I would say has settled-- several percentage points under where all the other factors that we're looking at would suggest is likely. So, this is obviously not a definitive case where one would say that there's clear evidence that this credit rationing is going on. I don't think we ever get that evidence except six years after the fact. But from what I can gather and from the contacts I have I would say that at this stage the odds that we are not seeing some actual money market tightening are very slim indeed. Put another way. the funds market is trying to ease and we are essentially holding it in check. Our job is really not so much to focus on trying to fine tune the economy; we can't do it. All that we can do is get ourselves involved with money supply, credit, and financial systems; and as I read the data at this particular stage I would say that we probably have been sitting here with an inadvertent minor tightening, which I think would be appropriate if the economy were showing some significant signs of firming. But at the moment the evidence of that is really quite remote. As a consequence, I would be inclined to go with an unchanged directive, asymmetrical toward ease, but with the expectation that unless a firmer tone in the financial aggregates--and indirectly in the economy--began to exhibit itself fairly soon that it would call for a small, 25 basis point, decline in the funds rate. So, I would like to put that somewhat complex issue on the table and would be most interested in the responses I get to it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	296	SYRON	 A technical question, Mr. Chairman. Are you suggesting a 25 basis point cut anticipating we will have a conference call or are we voting for that now essentially unless there's a-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199007	297	GREENSPAN	 I would say voting now. My view is that a conference call shouldn't be necessary. In other words, we've discussed at great length the types of things we're looking at. and unless something unusual happens of a nature that always indicates the need for a conference call, I don't think that I could convey very much more. Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	298	LAWARE	" I'm encouraged that my economic education seems to be going along in pretty good style because you have expressed exactly the thoughts that I had intended to express. I strongly endorse ""B"" with an asymmetric tilt toward ease. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
199007	299	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0

199007	301	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	302	CORRIGAN	 Well, I'm basically in the same place. I came to the meeting thinking that there were three choices available to the Committee. One was an asymmetric plain vanilla kind of directive; the second was a strongly asymmetric directive, which is what I think your suggestion amounts to; and the third was even the possibility of easing right now. My own strong position was the second of those choices, the strongly asymmetric directive, so I support completely your proposition. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199007	303	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	304	FORRESTAL	 I support your proposition, Mr. Chairman. I have a technical question: I'm not quite clear in my mind what data you would be looking at to trigger the 25 basis point cut. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199007	305	GREENSPAN	 Basically the data that are coming out at the end of this week--including average hourly earnings, which is not a minor player as far as I'm concerned. Also, the money supply data early next week and-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	306	FORRESTAL	 The employment number. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199007	307	GREENSPAN	 --the employment figure on Friday. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	308	FORRESTAL	 So, you're looking at a fairly near-term adjustment? 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199007	309	GREENSPAN	 Yes, I would say within the next week to 10 days. President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	310	PARRY	" Mr. Chairman, I would favor alternative ""B."" However, since I think there is a good chance that economic growth will be faster in the second half than In the first half. I would prefer symmetrical language. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199007	311	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	312	STERN	 Where I stumble a bit with y.our suggestion is with the automaticity of the move. I too have a great deal of interest not only in the upcoming data but in how the economy is likely to perform over the next several months given the situation as it has changed with regard to consumer spending and whatever wealth effects we may get out of housing. I must admit to a lot of uncertainty as to how that's all going to play out. I'm a little concerned by the asymmetric directive with the automaticity of moving on the basis of another week or two weeks' worth of data; that gives me some pause. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199007	313	GREENSPAN	 Obviously, if there is evidence of firmness in the data, that would suggest to us that the money supply data are not as terribly [weak] as we think. I would say the money supply data are really the crucial data as far as I'm concerned, because we're getting to the point where what we affect essentially is the credit system. And to the extent that the credit system is ﻿ contracting--and it is showing as far as I can see no. signs of stabilizing--it means that the process is still going on. And if it is, what I'm arguing for is not an easing. I'm arguing for [unintelligible] holding. The question, therefore, is basically: Do we want to be tightening in this particular context? I would say only if there is evidence that the economy is picking up, and I must tell you that at the moment I don't see a single statistic out there suggestive of such an acceleration. That's [unintelligible] basically. Obviously, we could wait for three weeks, two months, whatever. It may-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	314	STERN	 I don't disagree with your interpretation of the latest data at all. It's just that I've watched these data bounce around an awful lot. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199007	315	GREENSPAN	 Well, so have I. And this is the first time in six months that I have nudged off the middle because I was unconvinced by all of this evidence until now. And it's not economic weakness; it's credit. I'm sorry, I interrupted you. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	316	STERN	" No, actually, I had concluded what I was going to say. You've elaborated your views on how you see this. And, as I said before, my concern was with the automaticity of the move not with the asymmetric language on ""B"". "	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199007	317	GREENSPAN	 Well, there's no such thing as an automatic move. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	318	STERN	 No, I would say I'm somewhat comforted by your comments. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199007	319	CORRIGAN	 It's an asymmetric comfort then. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	31.0
199007	320	GREENSPAN	 Governor Angell. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	321	ANGELL	" Well, I appreciate what President Stern has said. It really is a very important difference for me, Mr. Chairman, because I do want to vote with you on this. I would admit that I'm not able to discern so accurately the need to stay symmetric versus the possibility that incoming data will tell us that we need to ease. I would prefer symmetric language but I can compromise away from that if we are going to be looking at the data and, if the data coming in say that we ought to subsequently make a decision to ease. I can go with that. But I cannot go with the notion here that we really are going to ease, because if we really are going to ease, we might as well do it now and then those of us who are going to vote ""no"" can vote ""no."" And I will just vote ""no."" "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	322	GREENSPAN	 I think that's a correct [interpretation of the] difference. It's [essentially] why we raise the issue of automatic; if it's automatic, then it can't be asymmetric. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	323	ANGELL	" So, I suggest that we not put into ""Fedspeak"" all this new language that the Vice Chairman is about to introduce in regard to super ease. I really don't think we need to fine tune our language. My understanding, based upon what you said, is that we're going to be recommending that we have no change in policy, alternative ""B,"" which I can support with the ""mights"" tilted [toward ease]. I ﻿ can go with that. I don't want to make too much over little differences, but I do believe strongly that we have reached a point where we're just about to succeed in something that we've been trying to get done. You put it so well last year when you talked about the view that we have to err on the side of restraint. All of us know that there is risk in doing that. I want to continue to err on the side of restraint, but I definitely do not want to get this economy into recession. I want us to reap the fruits of what we're about to [achieve], and I think the sooner we move the more likely the bond markets are to misinterpret and say that the Fed really gave up before we were there. I think the whole [issue] is that attitudes concerning inflation are at a very delicate point. I noted in the staff's laying out of strategy II on the long-run model, that in 1995 that results in the highest real GNP growth of any of the alternatives. Now, I just think it happens faster. I think the whole monetary world works faster than it ever worked before. And if we really stand here and are prepared to do what needs to be done, I believe we'll get lower long-term interest rates. Frankly, one reason that we got into slow money growth is because we lowered the fed funds rate in December, ran the long bond rates up 70-80 basis points, and the opportunity cost [of] the M2 balances has [risen] so that the shortfall of our aggregates is due entirely to our premature ease in December. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	324	GREENSPAN	 I don't think that's correct. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	325	ANGELL	 Well, I do. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	326	GREENSPAN	 Well, that's your evaluation. I think-- 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	327	ANGELL	 Well, you see, what has happened is that the opportunity cost on the M2 balances has changed and then you get the lagged effect of that change from March and you get low growth of M2 in May. My view is that we need the lowest long-term interest rates we can get for the second half of 1990. And I happen to think that being patient here for a [while] will get us lower rates than we will get if we jump the gun on easing. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	328	GREENSPAN	 The difference, Wayne, is that I think we're closer to having success here than you think. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	329	ANGELL	 Well, I think we're closer in that respect too. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	330	GREENSPAN	 I think we're very close. If I believed otherwise, I wouldn't be arguing for the type of asymmetry that we're talking about. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	331	ANGELL	 I'm somewhat impatient for patience. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	43.0
199007	332	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	333	KEEHN	" Mr. Chairman, I'd be in favor of alternative ""B"" with the current asymmetric language, and I'm entirely comfortable with the explanation that you gave Bob Forrestal on what would trip using the asymmetric language. Perhaps I have a slightly more positive outlook on the economy than some, and perhaps more so than you, but I think it's awfully important that we provide an environment in which we can continue to have these kinds of results. It does seem to me that the move that you suggest will give us that. ﻿ "	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199007	334	GREENSPAN	 Governor Seger. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	335	SEGER	 Obviously, you know that I'm in favor of easing. I'm just sitting here trying to decide what we gain by doing it in a couple of weeks rather than now. I'm thinking about the lags that I thought I had been taught about by Don Kohn and his pals. Whatever we do today or in two weeks or three weeks is going to impact the economy some time in the future, not immediately. The way I read the economy, I'm not sure we have until Christmas Eve or New Year's Eve to have some stimulus actually being felt. The employment numbers are not my favorite numbers, but I do read them. As I remember, in the April and May statistics the whole show was the hiring of temporary workers by the Census Department. And from what I've seen previewed, those folks are leaving; a lot of them--something like 160,000--left in June. That number came from Barbara Bryant who heads the Census; it isn't something I just threw out. That's going to have an impact on the employment numbers again and not a very good impact. Some more of these folks are going to be turned out on the street in July. So, I think we're going to get some weaker employment numbers as we go along here. Also. I read the retail sales numbers as weak. I don't think we have had three months in a row [of weak data] that have been flukes or aberrations; I think there's something going on there. I hate to repeat myself unnecessarily, but I believe that this so-called credit crunch has had a big impact on construction in many parts of the country; it's worse certainly in some parts than in others, but it's not confined to New England or Arizona. And I don't think that is over as an influence. I also believe that lower interest rates amazingly would help the strength of the financial system; it would provide some of the marginal institutions a better chance to make it because it would allow them to get a lower cost of funds rather promptly and improve their margins. And I think we need to do that very swiftly. I would argue that lower interest rates would help even on the liquidation of the S&Ls by the RTC. So, I certainly agree with your notion of some ease, but if I wanted to split hairs--which I won't do; I will support your position--I would feel more comfortable doing it sooner rather than later. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	40.0
199007	336	GREENSPAN	 President Black. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	337	BLACK	 Mr. Chairman. I think the last several years of monetary policy have been some of our very finest; I wouldn't go back and change any vote that I've cast during that time. It has been many years since I went through an entire session without dissenting in favor of tighter money. I started off thinking about the short-run objectives with exactly what you had in mind: an asymmetrical directive because of this apparent softness in the economy and the slow growth in the aggregates. Then I started looking at the economy a little more closely and I read Don's and his associates' memo. And when I looked at the economy, I couldn't see what it was that was going to make us turn down; and his memo on the behavior of the aggregates gave me a good deal of comfort. So, I became somewhat uncomfortable with the asymmetrical part of it, since I think our objective is price stability and we're going to have to take some responsible risks on the side of restraint if we're going to get there. I came out with alternative B, but I favor symmetry. I certainly wouldn't dissent on this, but I do think that in general it's better to have a symmetrical directive because that suggests we are able to go either way. I think that would give sufficient leeway ﻿ to do exactly what you have in mind. I don't have any great problem with asymmetry, but I have a slight preference, as I think Governor Angell has also, for symmetrical language. But I think you're very close to where we ought to be on this. You made a good statement; I found particularly helpful your analysis of the current conditions, and I take some comfort in your view of inventories. I share that feeling. I don't know what's going to make us turn down. So, if I voted. I would go with symmetrical but not dissent on asymmetrical. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	7.0
199007	338	GREENSPAN	 President Guffey. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	339	GUFFEY	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This may be hair¬ splitting a bit, but my preference would be ""B"" with a symmetric directive. I don't see that there is accumulating evidence of a tightening of credit markets. As a result, a symmetric directive--to the extent that it will be read six weeks from now as a sort of ""steady-as-you-go"" policy--seems to me to be a reasonable outcome [of our meeting]. On the other hand, if I have understood the discussions around this table in the past, particularly as articulated by Don, with a symmetric directive you have the ability to take one cut--if you will, a quarter point [on the funds rate], which is what we are talking about--without the necessity of a conference call or consultation. As a result, it seems to me that ""B"" with a symmetric directive gives you what you want and I wouldn't object to that. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	20.0

199007	345	SYRON	" ""B."" I have a marginal preference for symmetric but I can certainly accept asymmetric. I do have some of the concerns that Gary Stern expressed on the automaticity of the approach, but I am comforted by your explanation. I think it's important to have in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony an indication that we are not trying to lead the market down, but that we are not effectively trying to ease policy--that there has been some tightening in policy not at our volition and that we see this as bringing policy back more to where we get the [unintelligible] rather than the other way around. I think that's actually quite an important distinction. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	51.0
199007	346	GREENSPAN	 Governor Mullins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	347	MULLINS	" In my view, the economy has been weaker than [the staff has] projected and I haven't felt especially comfortable with the low growth in the aggregates. I have been concerned, given the notion of the low growth and the credit crunch, that we might be implicitly tighter than what the Committee had committed to earlier. To believe differently is to put a lot of faith in adjustments and still accept an unexplained error. I don't believe that a tighter stance at this time is warranted. And I wonder whether a marginally lower funds rate wouldn't be consistent with maintaining the stance of ﻿ monetary policy voted on earlier this year. The advantage of this approach is more discretion, more time to adjust to the new data; and it has less automaticity than the approach of easing directly. I think Dick's point is extremely important because that's exactly the way I view it--that we essentially are maintaining the intended moderately restrictive monetary conditions and, when there's unintended tightening out there, we're simply not easing but moving back to that position. So, I would wholeheartedly support ""B"" with asymmetry toward easing or returning to the [degree of] restraint that we intended earlier. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	52.0

199007	349	BOYKIN	" Mr. Chairman, I would favor alternative ""B."" Coming into the meeting I had felt that symmetric language would be preferable. However, the explanation that you gave would cause me to accept asymmetric language. But I do want to say that I agree with about 85 percent of what you said, Governor Angell. I share a lot of sympathy for not letting go prematurely just as we're about there. I don't know what the next week or week and a half is going to show, but I have a slight uneasiness in the sense that it's almost preordained that there's going to be a downward move shortly. That may be necessary and it may be what's called for; I just can't read that. But I would accept asymmetry. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	34.0
199007	350	GREENSPAN	 President Hoskins. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199007	351	HOSKINS	" Mr. Chairman, as someone who has worried consistently about the growth rates in the aggregates, I find myself in one sense pleasantly surprised that the aggregates are at about the growth rates that I thought were appropriate for the year. Unfortunately, I'm uncomfortable with how we got there. I think your explanation may well have some merit for pegging the funds rate [when] the economy is weak. We're not running monetary policy by supplying reserves; we're running it through interest rates. Having said all that, and given the staff's forecast of where we're likely to be. I'm equally uncomfortable with the velocity projections. So, that leaves me in a position of great uncertainty. And in that position, I'd be more comfortable with ""B"" symmetric.

199007	353	BERNARD	" The operational paragraph would read: ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. Taking account of progress toward price stability, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets, slightly greater reserve restraint might or somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 over the period from June through September at annual rates of about 3 and 1 percent respectively. The Chairman may call for Committee consultation if it appears to the Manager for Domestic Operations that reserve conditions during the period before the next meeting are likely to be associated with a federal funds rate persistently outside a range of 6 to 10 percent."" ﻿ "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
