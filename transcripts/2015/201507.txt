201507	0	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everyone.	5	5
201507	1	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s get started.	5	5
201507	2	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to once again welcome First Vice President Holcomb, who will be representing the Dallas District, as well as Michael Strine, who is back for his second meeting, but this time as first vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and is an alternate on this Committee.	5	5
201507	3	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d also like to welcome Patrick Harker to his first FOMC meeting.	5	5
201507	4	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think everybody knows that earlier this month, Pat became president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.	5	5
201507	5	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	He brings with him a distinguished record in academic research, many years of experience leading large and important institutions, and a long history of service on a wide range of corporate and nonprofit boards, including the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia starting in 2012.	5	5
201507	6	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say, on behalf of everyone here, we’re all looking forward to working with you in the years ahead.	5	5
201507	7	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	5	5
201507	8	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, turning to our agenda, the first two items today are going to be considered in a joint meeting of the Board of Governors and the FOMC.	5	5
201507	9	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	A Board vote is going to be needed to close the meeting.	5	5
201507	10	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So do I have a motion to close the Board meeting?	5	5
201507	11	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201507	12	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201507	13	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	5	5
201507	14	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our first item on the agenda is financial developments and open market operations, and Simon is going to begin.	61	6
201507	15	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201507	16	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will again be splitting the Desk briefing in two parts: I will first discuss financial market developments, and Lorie will then discuss Desk operations and balance sheet developments.	61	6
201507	17	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The intermeeting period was characterized by pronounced shifts in risk sentiment and bouts of volatility in some overseas markets largely driven by events in Greece and China.	61	6
201507	18	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	However, volatility in domestic financial markets was not unusually large.	61	6
201507	19	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your first exhibit shows important events over the intermeeting period, marked with dashed lines.	61	6
201507	20	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The June FOMC statement and SEP release, line 1, resulted in a slight decline in Treasury yields and was largely overshadowed by developments in Greece and China, lines 2 through 5.	61	6
201507	21	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	On net, both equity prices and longer-dated Treasury yields were relatively little changed over the period.	61	6
201507	22	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Treasury yields generally fell on days featuring FOMC communications or top- tier domestic economic data releases, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201507	23	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants highlighted the downward shift in the June SEP “dots” and below- expectations inflation, employment, and retail sales data as main factors driving the declines.	61	6
201507	24	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	In contrast, yields increased, on net, other than in these days, as captured by the “other” category.	61	6
201507	25	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	This category includes days when developments abroad were the main focus.	61	6
201507	26	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Domestic monetary policy communications and data, along with overseas developments, shifted the perceived balance of risks toward a slightly later liftoff.	61	6
201507	27	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	While, on average, respondents to the Desk’s dealer and buy-side surveys attach the highest odds to liftoff occurring in September, as shown in the middle-left panel, the average probability assigned to this outcome declined slightly from the June surveys.	61	6
201507	28	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The associated increase in the odds placed on a later liftoff was spread roughly evenly across future meetings, and the average probability of liftoff is now more than 20 percent for both the December meeting and for meetings thereafter.	61	6
201507	29	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	A small number of Desk survey respondents noted that the potential for strained year-end liquidity conditions might make the Committee reluctant to lift off in December.	61	6
201507	30	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The survey probability of a September liftoff is generally in line with probabilities implied by market prices, shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201507	31	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	These probabilities, derived from federal funds futures contracts, declined following the June FOMC events and were then, on net, little changed over the remainder of the period.	61	6
201507	32	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Of course, backing out physical probabilities from market prices is a highly imperfect endeavor and requires numerous assumptions.	61	6
201507	33	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition, one now needs to make an assumption about where market participants believe the effective federal funds rate will trade in the target range.	61	6
201507	34	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The dark blue line in the panel uses the median expectation of 10 basis points above the bottom of the range from a question in the Desk surveys, while the light blue lines use the interquartile range of these expectations.	61	6
201507	35	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The shaded region is based on the full set of responses to the Desk surveys, reflecting a possible range of probabilities that may be drawn from market prices.	61	6
201507	36	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants generally continue to believe the pace of tightening will be gradual, in line with recent communications from Federal Reserve officials.	61	6
201507	37	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Thomas will discuss this more in his briefing.	61	6
201507	38	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	One factor contributing to the gradual expected pace of tightening has been subdued readings of realized inflation.	61	6
201507	39	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Market-based measures of forward inflation remain notably below longer-run historical averages, as shown in the bottom-left panel, though they have increased somewhat since the start of the year as energy prices bottomed out and inflation readings stabilized.	61	6
201507	40	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Over this intermeeting period, forward inflation measures remained relatively steady despite a decline of 14 percent in front-month Brent crude oil futures, in contrast to the highly correlated moves seen over the past year.	61	6
201507	41	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Longer-dated oil futures also declined.	61	6
201507	42	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The recent drop in oil prices appears to have been partly driven both by higher-than-expected supply from Saudi Arabia and Iraq and by expectations for increased supply from Iran over the longer run after an agreement with major international powers cleared the way for sanctions to be lifted.	61	6
201507	43	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The decline in oil prices caused high-yield corporate credit spreads for energy-related firms to increase over the period.	61	6
201507	44	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Credit spreads outside the high-yield energy sector also widened somewhat.	61	6
201507	45	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Yields on benchmark Puerto Rico general obligation bonds also rose sharply, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201507	46	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	This occurred after the Puerto Rican government indicated that its public debt burden was unsustainable and that significant concessions from its creditors would be necessary.	61	6
201507	47	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The panel also shows that spillover to other municipal markets has thus far been limited.	61	6
201507	48	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	As discussed in one of your boxes in Tealbook A, risks associated with Puerto Rico at present appear manageable but warrant continued monitoring.	61	6
201507	49	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Turning to your next exhibit, the top-left panel shows that the DXY dollar index increased 2 percent during the period.	61	6
201507	50	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The dollar initially appreciated as investors focused on risks from the euro area and China and, more recently, from the ongoing backdrop of monetary policy divergence across major economies.	61	6
201507	51	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Dollar strength and concerns over Chinese economic growth reportedly contributed to declines in industrial metals prices and commodity-linked currencies over the period.	61	6
201507	52	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The Bloomberg industrial metals index fell nearly 8 percent and developed economy commodity-sensitive currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollars as well as the Norwegian krone, depreciated an average of 6 percent against the dollar.	61	6
201507	53	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants suggested that commodity price declines for industrial metals were exacerbated by the sharp fall in Chinese equity prices through a financing linkage.	61	6
201507	54	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	These commodities had reportedly been used by some as collateral to obtain margin financing and were subsequently sold to meet margin calls amid the equity market declines.	61	6
201507	55	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The Shanghai Composite index declined roughly 17 percent over the period, as shown in the top-right panel, and, after taking into account the past two days, is down almost 30 percent from its peak.	61	6
201507	56	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	This peak represented a 150 percent increase since last July.	61	6
201507	57	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	As I discussed at the June meeting, conventional easing measures by the PBOC against a backdrop of slowing mainland economic growth were cited as the primary driver behind the equity market increase over the past 12 months.	61	6
201507	58	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Such easing measures, denoted by the gold diamonds in the chart, included cuts to benchmark interest rates and targeted required reserve ratios.	61	6
201507	59	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	These measures supported the already prevalent use of margin and increase in equity market valuations.	61	6
201507	60	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	However, this dynamic appeared to reverse, and substantial additional conventional easing measures by the PBOC failed to arrest a rapid decline in stock prices in late June.	61	6
201507	61	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	In response, Chinese officials implemented an unprecedented array of measures to halt the sharp correction over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201507	62	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Authorities announced new targeted initiatives on a nearly daily basis, including easing margin trading and collateral requirements, establishing an official stabilization fund to support the equity market, and suspending IPOs.	61	6
201507	63	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition, many firms requested that trading in their shares be halted as a result of the volatility.	61	6
201507	64	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants noted these measures increased “moral hazard” and suggested they may undermine previous market reform efforts.	61	6
201507	65	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Because it is only a  small subset of the Chinese population that invests in mainland equities, market participants believe the correction is unlikely to have a material direct effect on the Chinese economic growth outlook or on asset prices outside China.	61	6
201507	66	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	However, there were a few days over the intermeeting period when negative risk sentiment from Chinese equity price declines spilled over into major global financial markets, especially to other Asian markets.	61	6
201507	67	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants speculated that this spillover may have reflected concern about a broader loss of control in other parts of the Chinese economy or financial system, in view of the difficulty mainland authorities had stabilizing their equity markets.	61	6
201507	68	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The effects of the Chinese equity market declines were also evident in offshore renminbi currency markets, as some suggested policymakers could also weaken the currency to support domestic export-oriented firms.	61	6
201507	69	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Recall that the renminbi has been appreciating, along with the dollar, against most other currencies for around one year.	61	6
201507	70	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Offshore forward prices and currency option-implied skew reflected increased demand to protect against renminbi depreciation after the peak in Chinese equity prices, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201507	71	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	However, these moves were small compared with the changes seen in late 2014 and early 2015, when Chinese officials unexpectedly cut benchmark interest rates and reportedly intervened to stem the extent of the currency depreciation.	61	6
201507	72	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Despite the recent moves in the offshore market and large stock market fluctuations, the onshore renminbi remained remarkably stable.	61	6
201507	73	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The sharp Chinese equity market moves resulted in an average intraday trading range that was more than 4 standard deviations above its typical level since 2000, as shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201507	74	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Overall, the recent movements in Chinese equity prices refocused market attention toward risks emanating from the mainland.	61	6
201507	75	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Many participants suggested that the risk of a sharp slowdown in China was of much greater concern than risks stemming from the situation in Greece.	61	6
201507	76	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Steve Kamin will discuss developments in both China and Greece in his briefing.	61	6
201507	77	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Greek developments contributed to elevated realized volatility in euro-area markets, with the intraday trading range of the Italian 10-year yield increasing to its highest level since mid-2013, also shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201507	78	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Volatility early in the period was due to uncertainty about the implications of an unraveling of Greek debt negotiations and the “no” vote on the Greek referendum.	61	6
201507	79	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The uncertainty reduced substantially as Greece and its creditors agreed to a temporary bailout package.	61	6
201507	80	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Despite the drama, the knock-on effects across European and global financial markets were relatively contained.	61	6
201507	81	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, Greek 10-year debt spreads to Germany widened out substantially, but other peripheral spreads were comparatively little changed, especially relative to their widening in 2011 and 2012.	61	6
201507	82	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Contacts attributed the relatively limited contagion to strengthened financial backstops for other peripheral economies and reduced exposure of core euro-area banks to Greece.	61	6
201507	83	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition, market participants cited expectations that the ECB would use its purchase programs to lean against any significant widening in euro-area peripheral debt spreads or tightening in euro-area financial conditions should the Greek situation deteriorate.	61	6
201507	84	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Increased uncertainty in the euro area also had a very limited effect on domestic bank asset prices, whose behavior Nellie will discuss in her briefing.	61	6
201507	85	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Consistent with the relatively muted response in broader asset prices, the euro has only modestly depreciated 2 percent since the Greek referendum was called.	61	6
201507	86	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Other asset prices sensitive to the macro outlook in Europe, such as the five-year, five-year forward inflation swap rate, were also little influenced by Greek developments, as shown in the bottom-right panel, and remain higher since ECB asset purchases were announced.	61	6
201507	87	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The passage of significant Greek event risks has shifted market attention back to underlying European economic fundamentals, including the fact that forward inflation compensation measures still remain below the ECB’s 2 percent objective.	61	6
201507	88	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	This has caused many to refocus on the theme of the policy divergence consisting of the ECB’s continued easing and the Federal Reserve’s approaching normalization.	61	6
201507	89	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Lorie will now continue the Desk briefing.	61	6
201507	90	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Simon.	61	6
201507	91	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	I will start on exhibit 3 with an update on the swap lines, as we have seen a modest rise in demand from the ECB related to the Greek risk events that Simon discussed.	61	6
201507	92	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel, demand at the ECB’s seven-day dollar auctions reached about $660 million in mid-July.	61	6
201507	93	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Market pricing indicators, however, show no evidence of broad disruption in offshore dollar funding markets.	61	6
201507	94	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	And even if a resurgence of the Greek crisis were to generate more pronounced spillovers in euro- area markets, demand is not likely to return to the much higher levels seen in earlier phases of stress.	61	6
201507	95	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This is in part due to the financial backstops that now exist in the euro area, but also because euro-area banks have reduced their balance sheets and the associated need for dollar funding compared with previous years.	61	6
201507	96	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In terms of demand from the BOJ, take-up at the BOJ dollar auctions has been minimal, with the exception of some draws in the seven-day auctions that span quarter-end dates, when market pricing for US dollar funding via one-week FX swaps has notably exceeded the BOJ’s auction rate.	61	6
201507	97	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, we also continue to see quarter-end volatility in US money market rates, mainly reflecting banks shrinking their balance sheets or requiring a higher return for intermediation in response to incentives arising from regulation.	61	6
201507	98	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	At the June quarter-end, the upward pressure on interdealer repo rates and downward pressure on unsecured rates were broadly consistent with expectations.	61	6
201507	99	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Outside quarter-end, secured and unsecured rates were generally stable over the period, with the ON RRPs continuing to form a soft floor beneath money market rates.	61	6
201507	100	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Reverse repo operations conducted by the Desk proceeded smoothly over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201507	101	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to its overnight operation, the Desk conducted two term operations over the June quarter-end, the results of which are detailed in your middle-left panel.	61	6
201507	102	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The results were generally as expected, with each of the two offerings modestly oversubscribed.	61	6
201507	103	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The maximum offering rate for the June quarter- end term operations—at 3 basis points above the ON RRP rate—was lower than the 5 basis points over the ON RRP rate that was offered in March.	61	6
201507	104	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, the tenors of the term operations were shorter, and the attractiveness of the shorter tenors appeared to offset any effect of the lower rate.	61	6
201507	105	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	These results could suggest that quarter-end term RRP participation was primarily driven by counterparties’ desire to secure investment over the quarter-end, with the desire for incremental yield playing a secondary role.	61	6
201507	106	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	While the Desk’s term operations were fully subscribed, ample capacity remained in the overnight operation over the June quarter-end date.	61	6
201507	107	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that our communication at the time of the June quarter-end term operations took a different approach than in prior quarter-ends in that it separated the announcement of the term RRP offering size and tenor, which was released following the April minutes, from information on the offering rate and other details, which were released following the June FOMC meeting.	61	6
201507	108	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This strategy allowed us to retain some flexibility to adjust the specific parameters of the operations in case the Committee decided to lift off at the June meeting.	61	6
201507	109	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This communications change caused little market reaction, and we propose continuing with this practice for the September quarter-end.	61	6
201507	110	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As summarized in the middle-right panel, we intend to release a statement shortly after the July minutes announcing a plan to offer at least $200 billion in term RRPs at tenors of seven and two days in addition to the $300 billion in ON RRP capacity over the September quarter-end.	61	6
201507	111	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Further, the statement would note that the Desk will release the remaining details of the term RRP operations after the September FOMC event and shortly ahead of quarter-end.	61	6
201507	112	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We would then come back to the Committee at or shortly after the September meeting with a recommendation for the exact size and maximum offering rate for each operation.	61	6
201507	113	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Looking ahead to other upcoming operational testing, the staff recommends that a series of TDF test operations be held in August.	61	6
201507	114	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The parameters would mirror those of the May series, which included one 14-day and one 7-day operation priced at 1 basis point above IOER.	61	6
201507	115	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that in the spring, the Federal Reserve announced plans to continue TDF testing periodically in order to maintain operational readiness.	61	6
201507	116	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Outside the June quarter-end, daily ON RRP take-up was generally consistent with levels prevailing over prior periods, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201507	117	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Federal Reserve repurchase agreements with foreign official institutions—the foreign RP pool—also remained steady at around $150 billion.	61	6
201507	118	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that the foreign RP pool is an overnight investment facility that since the mid-1970s has provided foreign official institution account holders at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with access to a safe and liquid dollar instrument.	61	6
201507	119	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The investments in the foreign RP pool drain reserves from the System on an overnight basis.	61	6
201507	120	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The size of the foreign RP pool remains notably above its pre-crisis levels, in part reflecting central banks’ desire to hold greater dollar liquidity buffers and a tightening of their counterparty risk- management frameworks following the crisis.	61	6
201507	121	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	It is against this backdrop that I would like to highlight ongoing work to update the foreign RP pool framework, as described in the staff memo circulated in advance of the meeting and summarized in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201507	122	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Historically, we have relied on individual account targets to manage the pool’s aggregate size and daily volatility.	61	6
201507	123	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, reflecting the current high-reserve environment, we have informally relaxed account-level targets over the past few years.	61	6
201507	124	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Awareness of this shift among account holders has been uneven because it has not been reflected in their terms of service.	61	6
201507	125	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	To formalize the change in practice and provide clearer communication to customers, the staff intends to revise customer terms of service to remove both individual targets and the requirement to notify the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ahead of balance changes in excess of $100 million.	61	6
201507	126	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We would establish an internal process for processing individual customer balances above $30 billion, partly for operational reasons and partly to understand the source of the demand.	61	6
201507	127	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the benefits associated with improving our communications to customers, these changes would likely increase customer access to high-quality short-term dollar investments at a time when the availability or attractiveness of alternative options in the open market—namely, Treasury bills and commercial bank deposits—may be more limited.	61	6
201507	128	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As the outlook for excess reserves is not expected to change significantly in the near term, the staff does not expect this to have a material effect on monetary policy implementation.	61	6
201507	129	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In the event that the size or volatility of the foreign RP pool begins to exert an unwanted influence on money markets, the staff could reintroduce individual targets or caps, or an overall cap.	61	6
201507	130	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The revised terms of service will continue to provide the Federal Reserve with full discretion to make such changes at any time.	61	6
201507	131	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Although take-up in ON RRP operations and usage of the foreign RP pool have remained relatively steady, demand could increase in the near term because of shifts in Treasury bill supply.	61	6
201507	132	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, the risk of the debt ceiling binding later this year may lead the Treasury to reduce the supply of bills.	61	6
201507	133	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Indeed, according to Board staff projections, bill supply is expected to decline roughly $90 billion (or 6 percent of total bills outstanding) from current levels through the end of November, around which time the debt ceiling is assumed to be lifted and bill issuance resumed.	61	6
201507	134	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Nonetheless, such a decline in bill supply could lead to lower short-term interest rates and an increase in demand for Federal Reserve RRPs later this year, which is also the time when many market participants expect the FOMC to begin policy firming.	61	6
201507	135	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Turning to other SOMA-related developments, the Desk is planning to initiate CUSIP aggregation of agency MBS beginning next month, as highlighted in the top-right panel.	61	6
201507	136	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Recall that in early 2011, the Desk performed a similar operation that resulted in cost savings to the SOMA portfolio and significant portfolio management benefits.	61	6
201507	137	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We have similar goals now and believe this measure would also make it easier to sell SOMA’s MBS holdings, should the Committee direct the Desk to do so in the future.	61	6
201507	138	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk plans to aggregate roughly 60,000 individual Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities into approximately 350 new pools, representing a combined face value of $1.27 trillion.	61	6
201507	139	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As described in a memo circulated prior to the meeting, the Desk intends to release a statement as well as FAQs this Friday and to start aggregation in mid-August.	61	6
201507	140	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Once we begin the aggregation process, we expect that the associated costs will be recovered through custodial cost savings within two to four years.	61	6
201507	141	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Should the Committee decide to commence policy firming at this meeting, we would plan to postpone the start of CUSIP aggregation to avoid complicating the communications associated with liftoff.	61	6
201507	142	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As a final administrative update, I would like to make you aware that a summary of the daily planning call between Desk and Monetary Affairs staff is now being posted each day on the Class II FOMC–Restricted (FR) section of MarketSource.	61	6
201507	143	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk would be happy to assist you in receiving this information, if interested.	61	6
201507	144	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	That concludes our prepared remarks.	61	6
201507	145	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We would be happy to take questions.	61	6
201507	146	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for either Simon or Lorie?	62	6
201507	147	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201507	148	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201507	149	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s go back to exhibit 1, panel 3, which shows the survey-implied probability distribution of the timing of liftoff.	62	6
201507	150	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I just have a simple question about this.	62	6
201507	151	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	When was this survey taken relative to events in Greece and to Chair Yellen’s testimony?	62	6
201507	152	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	It was taken after most of those events.	62	6
201507	153	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	We got the results on Monday and Tuesday of last week, and that would fully take those into account.	62	6
201507	154	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The only recent event of large significance would be the drop in the Chinese stock market yesterday.	62	6
201507	155	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Okay.	62	6
201507	156	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201507	157	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62	6
201507	158	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	62	6
201507	159	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Simon, during the comments on the dealer survey, I think you mentioned that they must have made some comments about the expected strained liquidity conditions at year-end.	62	6
201507	160	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	We received that more directly from market contacts.	62	6
201507	161	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	In those comments, are they talking about historical strains during that time period, a new liquidity environment affecting that period, or uncertainty about the liftoff environment?	62	6
201507	162	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I think part of it is just the classic, “The Fed won’t do things in December because there’s Christmas and the New Year and people aren’t there,” which we heard frequently.	62	6
201507	163	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	We heard that in 2013.	62	6
201507	164	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Why would they say that?	62	6
201507	165	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	We raised rates in 2004 and 2005 in December.	62	6
201507	166	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I’m just reporting what they said.	62	6
201507	167	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I’m not going to assess whether it’s got any merit.	62	6
201507	168	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	All right, that is the rule.	62	6
201507	169	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	On 2013, I think I belittled their views a little bit about whether they’d actually be there when the FOMC made its statement.	62	6
201507	170	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I think they will be.	62	6
201507	171	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The slightly different variation—Vice Chairman Dudley talked about this at the June meeting—is that they’re aware there’s a lot of movement in money markets as you come up to quarter-end, and there’s a belief that those could be more intense around year-end.	62	6
201507	172	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So there are some market participants who believe that the FOMC would be wary of lifting off around year-end because of the ability to show interest rate control.	62	6
201507	173	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s not a view that I share in terms of the tools that we have, but definitely some of the people we speak to have that perception.	62	6
201507	174	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Okay, so that’s along the lines of the latter point that I was suggesting and that Vice Chairman Dudley has mentioned before.	62	6
201507	175	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	62	6
201507	176	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	But I think that most of what we hear is just that market liquidity in general is not as robust at the end of the year.	62	6
201507	177	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So if there’s some noise around liftoff, then that could be exaggerated by that lack of liquidity.	62	6
201507	178	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	62	6
201507	179	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	All right.	62	6
201507	180	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201507	181	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201507	182	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Simon, I have a question about panel 5 in exhibit 1.	62	6
201507	183	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My question is, what are the Desk’s perspectives on why we now see deviations between the price of oil and five-year, five-year breakevens?	62	6
201507	184	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	There’s definitely—from some market technical reasons—some seasonals in TIPS trading that could account for that.	62	6
201507	185	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	We didn’t have a good explanation for the high correlation you can see in that chart earlier.	62	6
201507	186	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	We looked for some explanations.	62	6
201507	187	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Some of those explanations should still be in play, so that would make us perhaps doubt those explanations that we came up with before, because we were clutching at straws a lot.	62	6
201507	188	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right.	62	6
201507	189	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The only thing I’d note is that, in the past few days, the five-five forward has come down, and that does seem to be in response to further falls in the prices of oil and metals.	62	6
201507	190	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So even though it’s hard to see on this scale, the five-year-five-year forward over the intermeeting period has been relatively stable, but it still ended low.	62	6
201507	191	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s correct.	62	6
201507	192	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	62	6
201507	193	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	62	6
201507	194	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, we need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	62	6
201507	195	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any objection?	62	6
201507	196	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201507	197	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no objection, consider that done.	62	6
201507	198	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our next agenda item has to do with normalization planning, and I’m going to call on Lorie to begin.	96	9
201507	199	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	200	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	I will be referring to “Material for Briefing on Normalization.”	96	9
201507	201	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Jim Clouse and I will summarize the state of preparations related to the approach the Committee has said it intends to take to normalize the stance of monetary policy.	96	9
201507	202	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Having conducted nearly two years of daily test operations, the Desk is prepared to implement an ON RRP facility to support IOER in moving the effective federal funds rate into the target range when the FOMC commences policy firming.	96	9
201507	203	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	At that time, the domestic policy directive that governs the Desk’s conduct of open market operations will need to incorporate instructions for the ON RRP facility and term RRPs.	96	9
201507	204	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The ON RRP test operations that have been conducted under the resolution passed by the Committee last December will then cease.	96	9
201507	205	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The draft policy implementation note associated with alternative C in this meeting’s Tealbook B presents a revised proposal for the Desk directive at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201507	206	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This takes into account your feedback on the draft directive that Thomas presented at the June meeting.	96	9
201507	207	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	I would like to highlight three key elements of the draft directive, which are summarized in your first panel.	96	9
201507	208	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	First, we have added an effective date to the directive.	96	9
201507	209	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The staff recommends that changes in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate as well as changes to all overnight administered rates—namely, the IOER and IORR rates, the ON RRP rate, and the primary credit rate—be effective the day following the announcement of the Committee’s policy decision.	96	9
201507	210	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This marks a departure from the Federal Reserve’s past practice.	96	9
201507	211	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, it will allow changes in the full set of overnight administered rates to be introduced concurrently in support of an FOMC decision to change the target range, increasing the likelihood of the effective federal funds rate trading within the target range each day.	96	9
201507	212	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your second panel, this new convention would be consistent with the practices of several other major central banks.	96	9
201507	213	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	It would also maximize the public’s understanding of the Committee’s policy framework.	96	9
201507	214	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	From an operating perspective, this approach is consistent with the staff’s recommendation that any intermeeting changes in administered rates be announced at 4:30 pm when most markets are closed and are therefore only able to take effect the next day.	96	9
201507	215	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Should the Committee support this approach, the staff recommends communicating the decision about the effective date for the other administered rates prior to liftoff, such as in the July minutes, as we have started to receive questions by the public on the expected timing of changes in the overnight administered rates when the Committee commences policy firming.	96	9
201507	216	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The second element of the draft directive to highlight is the clarification of the description of capacity for the ON RRP facility.	96	9
201507	217	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Your third panel illustrates the language in the draft directive that could apply if the cap was temporarily suspended, indicating that the Desk could conduct ON RRPs in amounts “limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA that are available for such operations.”	96	9
201507	218	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We believe this language is consistent with the spirit of a suspended cap while at the same time highlighting the practical limitations that preclude unlimited provision of ON RRPs.	96	9
201507	219	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s operating policy statement, which would be posted following the publication of the FOMC’s policy decision and implementation note, would explain how the staff would derive the operational limit and note that the value of Treasury securities in the SOMA available for RRP operations would be about $2 trillion.	96	9
201507	220	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, as summarized in your fourth panel, the draft directive strikes the sentence in the current directive that states it “seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with” the federal funds rate trading in the FOMC’s target  range, as the language would no longer be as reflective of policy implementation in the post-liftoff framework.	96	9
201507	221	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The draft, however, retains the directive’s broad instruction to the Desk to undertake open market operations “as necessary” to keep the federal funds rate in its target range.	96	9
201507	222	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This language is followed by specific instructions to undertake overnight and term reverse repurchase agreements according to parameters approved by the Committee.	96	9
201507	223	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The baseline expectation is that reverse repos will be the only open market operations needed to support IOER to keep the effective federal funds rate in the FOMC’s target range.	96	9
201507	224	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Nonetheless, a directive that authorizes the Desk to conduct other types of open market operations, if necessary—such as repos if the effective federal funds rate was expected to print too high—could signal to the public that the Committee has given the Desk some latitude to respond quickly to unexpected circumstances.	96	9
201507	225	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Any use of such authority would be limited and aimed at addressing transitory factors, such as in response to a major payments system disruption.	96	9
201507	226	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In the event of more persistent issues, the FOMC may choose to revise its guidance to the Desk.	96	9
201507	227	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk would consult with the Chair and inform the FOMC of any plans to conduct open market operations other than the reverse repos specified in the directive.	96	9
201507	228	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	In addition to the revisions I have highlighted, other changes as shown in the draft directive for alternative C in Tealbook B, are generally consistent with the housekeeping-type changes that Thomas presented to the Committee in June.	96	9
201507	229	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	To summarize, at the June meeting you unanimously supported a proposal for the Federal Reserve to issue an implementation note that would communicate separately from the Committee’s postmeeting policy statement the specific measures the Federal Reserve was employing to implement the FOMC’s decision.	96	9
201507	230	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	This note will include the policy directive to the Desk that you ultimately adopt.	96	9
201507	231	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	We highlighted a few key elements of the draft directive for consideration, and the staff recommends the Committee communicate about the intended effective date of changes in the target range and administered rates in the upcoming minutes.	96	9
201507	232	2015-07-29	meeting	LOGAN	Jim will now discuss other elements of the implementation note.	96	9
201507	233	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Thanks, Lorie.	96	9
201507	234	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	As shown in the second exhibit, the implementation note will include information on the key administered rates that will support policy normalization.	96	9
201507	235	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Assuming that the FOMC initiates policy firming by raising the target range from 0 to 25 basis points to 25 to 50 basis points, the ON RRP rate would be set at 25 basis points, and the interest rates on required and excess reserves would both be set at 50 basis points.	96	9
201507	236	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	In discussing changes in discount rates at the April FOMC meeting, participants generally seemed to favor maintaining the primary credit rate at the current spread of 50 basis points above the top of the target range for the federal funds rate for some time after liftoff.	96	9
201507	237	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in the last bulleted item in the implementation note, that would imply a primary credit rate of 100 basis points immediately after liftoff.	96	9
201507	238	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	As Lorie noted, the staff is recommending that all of these changes in administered rates take effect on the day following the FOMC announcement.	96	9
201507	239	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	As noted in previous discussions, changes in some of the administered rates require Board approval.	96	9
201507	240	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Changes in the interest rates on reserves, required and excess, could be approved through a Board vote on the same day as the FOMC meeting.	96	9
201507	241	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Approval for changes in the primary credit rate are somewhat more involved in light of the role of the Boards of Directors of Reserve Banks in the discount rate-setting process.	96	9
201507	242	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	On the day of any meeting in which the FOMC changes the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board could approve any existing requests by Reserve Banks for discount rate changes to the new rate to be effective on the next business day.	96	9
201507	243	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	In addition, any requests for discount rate changes from Reserve Banks received in the afternoon following the conclusion of the FOMC meeting or on the subsequent business day would be approved by the Board Secretary under delegated authority with the same effective date.	96	9
201507	244	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	These procedures are the same as those that have been in place for many years, except for the effective date.	96	9
201507	245	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	For completeness, it is worth noting that the rates for two other forms of discount window lending—secondary credit and seasonal credit—are set by formulas routinely proposed by the Reserve Banks and approved by the Board.	96	9
201507	246	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	The secondary credit rate is set at 50 basis points above the primary credit rate.	96	9
201507	247	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	The seasonal credit rate is established every two weeks based on the average effective federal funds rate and the 90-day CD rate over the previous reserve maintenance period.	96	9
201507	248	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	These rates are not included in the proposed implementation note because they have no significant implications for the process of policy normalization.	96	9
201507	249	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	If policymakers wished to employ term draining tools—the term deposit facility or term RRP—the implementation note could include the important details of those operations.	96	9
201507	250	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Turning to two other items related to normalization, as discussed in memos prepared for the June FOMC meeting, the Desk will be expanding its coverage of money market developments in the morning calls in the period immediately after liftoff.	96	9
201507	251	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Moreover, the staff will brief policymakers each day at 2 pm in the days immediately after liftoff to review market developments and the effectiveness of policy implementation.	96	9
201507	252	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Those afternoon briefings can be readily converted to formal FOMC and Board meetings as necessary should policymakers wish to discuss and implement any changes in the approach to policy normalization.	96	9
201507	253	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	Finally, as discussed in previous FOMC meetings, the staff proposed a change to the methodology for the calculation of interest payments on reserves.	96	9
201507	254	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	After a public- comment period, the Board approved that change, and it became effective in the maintenance period that began last Thursday.	96	9
201507	255	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	The change in methodology should support the role of IOER as a policy normalization tool by ensuring that increases in the IOER rate are immediately reflected in higher interest payments to depository institutions.	96	9
201507	256	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	In particular, interest payments are now based primarily on the level of balances that a depository institution maintains each day and the level of the IOER rate in effect that day.	96	9
201507	257	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	That structure should help to ensure that an increase in the IOER rate immediately provides incentives for depository institutions to bid at higher rates in overnight funding markets and to require a rate of return at least as high as IOER on their investments in assets other than reserve balances.	96	9
201507	258	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	That concludes our prepared remarks.	96	9
201507	259	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone have questions for Lorie or for Jim?	96	9
201507	260	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201507	261	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	262	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Jim and Lorie, understandably, the implementation directive would not refer to the expectation that the increase in the ON RRP would be temporary, and alternative C doesn’t refer to it either.	96	9
201507	263	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Would there be some other document that would be current and released around the time of liftoff and that would restate the expectations of the Committee as articulated in the set of normalization principles we agreed to some time ago?	96	9
201507	264	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	There could be.	96	9
201507	265	2015-07-29	meeting	CLOUSE	We haven’t discussed that among the staff, but, certainly, it’s already in the public domain, as you say.	96	9
201507	266	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I think your question is, can we reiterate that at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201507	267	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	96	9
201507	268	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Somewhere.	96	9
201507	269	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I think there’s space to do that in the Desk statement, which is a very low-key way of doing it.	96	9
201507	270	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s probably not the ideal way, because that’s a policymaker statement.	96	9
201507	271	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	But we could reiterate the language used in the March minutes associated with that, which were basically added to the Principles and Plans document.	96	9
201507	272	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	One approach could be to rerelease the Principles and Plans in the minutes.	96	9
201507	273	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	96	9
201507	274	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	If there’s some way of doing it that’s not awkward, I think it would be good to reiterate that.	96	9
201507	275	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Or it could be in the press conference.	96	9
201507	276	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	It could be in the press conference.	96	9
201507	277	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me think about that.	96	9
201507	278	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s certainly a possibility.	96	9
201507	279	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Okay.	96	9
201507	280	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	96	9
201507	281	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	96	9
201507	282	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201507	283	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	284	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to build on what Governor Tarullo was talking about.	96	9
201507	285	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be useful for the Committee to have in mind exactly what kind of conditionality would be driving the changes of the cap on RRP.	96	9
201507	286	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s clear there’s a lot of support for not having a cap at liftoff, but at what point in time and under what conditions would it be adjusted?	96	9
201507	287	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we have talked about that some in the past, but perhaps I’m not just not remembering what kinds of conclusions we had reached about that.	96	9
201507	288	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think it would be useful for us to have, at least, a refresher on that.	96	9
201507	289	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	My memory is that we used some language that was trying to get at the notion it was temporary, but gave some flexibility.	96	9
201507	290	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	For example, there might be requirements for flexibility in the fall if there are complications associated with the debt limit.	96	9
201507	291	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	And even though under other conditions you might want to introduce the cap, you might not feel comfortable at that point, but the language was “expects when it’s appropriate.”	96	9
201507	292	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We said “fairly soon,”	96	9
201507	293	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think.	96	9
201507	294	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	“Fairly soon,” but there was something about expectations.	96	9
201507	295	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	But there was wiggle room because we would learn a lot perhaps in the first few weeks.	96	9
201507	296	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, that language seems appropriate to me.	96	9
201507	297	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My comment or question, though, is about having some common understanding on the Committee about what kinds of conditions will lead us to actually start to impose a cap.	96	9
201507	298	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In fact, the idea is that, once we gained experience with the overnight RRP and what the take-up was going to be, we would then set a cap with a reasonable amount of head room so the cap would not be binding.	96	9
201507	299	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But it would take time to generate some experience.	96	9
201507	300	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Right, and if necessary you adjust the rates or the spread in order to manage that.	96	9
201507	301	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I was just highlighting for you that the fall has the conflating factor in terms of understanding.	96	9
201507	302	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, the debt limit is a wild card.	96	9
201507	303	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, I imagine year-end will be another conflating factor.	96	9
201507	304	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Year-end is something that we understand better than the debt limit.	96	9
201507	305	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201507	306	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Further comments or questions?	96	9
201507	307	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201507	308	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In their presentations, both Lorie and Jim said that the staff recommends that all of the policy rate changes become effective the next day.	96	9
201507	309	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I didn’t hear any questions about that.	96	9
201507	310	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me ask: Would there be any objections to reporting in the minutes of this meeting that the plan was to make these rate changes effective the next day?	96	9
201507	311	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201507	312	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201507	313	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no objection, let’s do that.	96	9
201507	314	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The Board meeting has ended.	2	2
201507	315	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now we’re ready to move along to our next topic, which is reinvestment policy.	96	9
201507	316	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to call on Beth Klee to start us off.	96	9
201507	317	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	318	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Julie Remache and I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on SOMA Reinvestment Policy.”	96	9
201507	319	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	As you know, the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans state that the Committee expects to cease, or commence phasing out, reinvestments of principal on securities held in the SOMA after it begins increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, and that timing will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.	96	9
201507	320	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	As background for the Committee’s discussion on reinvestments, the staff prepared the memo titled “Reinvestments Considerations.”	96	9
201507	321	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The memo described several strategies that you could take and reviewed a range of issues associated with each strategy.	96	9
201507	322	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	We also suggested questions to help structure your discussion of this topic.	96	9
201507	323	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The top two panels of your first exhibit summarize the strategies as well as some pros and cons of each.	96	9
201507	324	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the top panel, the first set of strategies are calendar dependent—reinvestments would cease at a set date or after a specified interval following the initial firming of the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	325	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The Committee could follow a strictly calendar-dependent strategy or make the date conditional on macroeconomic conditions.	96	9
201507	326	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Of note, a conditional calendar-based strategy is similar to that employed in the forward guidance for the federal funds rate from 2011 to 2012.	96	9
201507	327	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	You may want to use a date for communicating the anticipated end of reinvestments if you are reasonably confident that a reversal of the decision to cease reinvestments will not be necessary or because you view it as a parsimonious and effective approach to communicate economic conditionality.	96	9
201507	328	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	As noted to the right, a calendar-based strategy would be relatively straightforward to communicate to the public.	96	9
201507	329	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	In addition, it would offer some certainty regarding the timing of the ceasing of reinvestments, and by implication, the path of the SOMA portfolio.	96	9
201507	330	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	These features could also be considered drawbacks in some circumstances, as this strategy could be seen as inflexible.	96	9
201507	331	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	In particular, the Committee could feel that, perhaps even with some conditionality, it could be difficult to deviate from the announced schedule even if the economy behaves much differently than expected.	96	9
201507	332	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Under those scenarios, the Federal Reserve’s action, or lack thereof, could send a confusing signal.	96	9
201507	333	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	As shown in the middle panel, the second set of strategies are state-dependent; reinvestments would cease based on specified economic conditions.	96	9
201507	334	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The Committee could follow a quantitative state-dependent strategy wherein redemptions would commence based on a particular macroeconomic threshold.	96	9
201507	335	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	A quantitative state- dependent threshold strategy was used to provide forward guidance about the federal funds rate from 2012 to 2014.	96	9
201507	336	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Another variation of a state-dependent strategy would be one that offered qualitative guidance regarding the conditions under which the Committee expects to cease reinvestments—not unlike the current guidance for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	337	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	You may want to employ a state-dependent strategy if you believe doing so provides clear communications or if it enhances the “automatic stabilizer function” of monetary policy.	96	9
201507	338	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	That is, if the economy improves less rapidly than expected, the cessation of reinvestments would occur later; they would also cease sooner if the economy improves more rapidly.	96	9
201507	339	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Consequently, a state-dependent strategy might also reduce the possibility of returning to the effective lower bound.	96	9
201507	340	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Important challenges would be determining the appropriate threshold or trigger under a quantitative approach or being sufficiently clear about your reaction function under a qualitative approach.	96	9
201507	341	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	A state-dependent approach provides less certainty about the path of SOMA assets, but that consideration might be seen as offset by the improved economic responsiveness of this strategy.	96	9
201507	342	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The details of either a calendar-dependent or state-dependent strategy would, of course, affect the path of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet over time.	96	9
201507	343	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	To illustrate how the details matter, the bottom-left panel presents scenarios under the modal outlook in which reinvestments end fairly soon after liftoff or much later.	96	9
201507	344	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The Tealbook baseline, the black line, is based on the assumption that reinvestments cease six months after initial policy firming, and that the federal funds rate will be around 60 basis points at that time.	96	9
201507	345	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	The dashed blue line illustrates a scenario where reinvestments cease nearly two years after liftoff, when the funds rate reaches 2 percent.	96	9
201507	346	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Even though reinvestments continue for 16 months longer than in the baseline, normalization of the size of the balance sheet is delayed only about 9 months, in part because large amounts of securities are expected to mature around the time of normalization of the size of the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	347	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	However, as shown in the bottom-right panel, the funds rate would be at a higher level when reinvestments end, incorporating some insurance against possible zero lower bound scenarios.	96	9
201507	348	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Still, the difference between the two funds rate paths is small, and this suggests that the benefit of extending reinvestments could potentially be modest.	96	9
201507	349	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	Of course, it is possible that there are effects of continuing or ceasing reinvestment beyond those captured in our models.	96	9
201507	350	2015-07-29	meeting	KLEE	To that end, Julie will now discuss market-specific considerations and expectations associated with ceasing reinvestments.	96	9
201507	351	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Beth.	96	9
201507	352	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In thinking about the strategy to end reinvestments, there are some market-specific issues which the Committee may wish to consider.	96	9
201507	353	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In the Treasury market, the Federal Reserve’s redemption of maturing securities will require the Treasury to auction more securities to the public than if the SOMA continues to roll over its Treasury holdings.	96	9
201507	354	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	As shown in the top panel of exhibit 2, maturing securities from the SOMA—shown in blue—would add, on average, 40 percent to the projected increase in public holdings from 2016 through 2020 relative to the increase arising from the budget deficit—shown in red.	96	9
201507	355	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	While these total increases are large, they are less than those recorded during the recession that followed the financial crisis.	96	9
201507	356	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	That said, 2008 to 2009 was a period in which demand for Treasury securities was elevated, and it remains to be seen how the market would adjust without this boost to demand.	96	9
201507	357	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	While the market response to ending reinvestments will depend on the level and dispersion of market expectations for the path of the portfolio—which I will discuss in just a moment—in the case of Treasury securities, the effect will also be determined by the Treasury’s decisions about the maturity profile of the additional securities it issues.	96	9
201507	358	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The Treasury might initially respond to the onset of SOMA redemptions by issuing more bills.	96	9
201507	359	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Over time, however, the Treasury would likely shift this financing toward longer-maturity coupon securities.	96	9
201507	360	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In the MBS market, participants have expressed more concern about potential market strains.	96	9
201507	361	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	During the period where the Federal Reserve continues to reinvest the principal it receives from its MBS holdings, it will be purchasing approximately 30 percent of gross TBA-eligible issuance, a proportionately larger amount than in the Treasury market.	96	9
201507	362	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In addition, the inherent difficulties in accurately predicting prepayment activity implies considerable uncertainty about the dollar amount of reinvestments, limiting the extent to which markets can fully anticipate the effect of a decision to cease reinvestments.	96	9
201507	363	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The bottom panel of your exhibit shows net changes in the Federal Reserve’s MBS activity over time.	96	9
201507	364	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Focusing on the black line, it highlights that in March 2010, following the completion of the first round of asset purchases, the shift in Federal Reserve participation in the mortgage market was larger than what is projected based on the current forecast, shown by the dotted portion of the line in early 2016.	96	9
201507	365	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Overall, the market withstood that change without significant disruption.	96	9
201507	366	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	That said, the underlying structure of the market has shifted since then, with greater concentration among dealers and more constrained balance sheets due to the changing regulatory environment.	96	9
201507	367	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	These concerns may support a decision to phase out reinvestments over time rather than ceasing them all at once.	96	9
201507	368	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	On the one hand, while a well-telegraphed end to reinvestments is not likely to lead to significant disruptions, phasing out reinvestments may provide insurance against this possibility and, if executed over a few quarters, would likely not have significantly different macroeconomic effects compared with a case in which cessation occurred all at once.	96	9
201507	369	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	On the other hand, it would lead to a slower decline in the portfolio, though the change would only extend the timing of the normalization of the size of the portfolio by a few months.	96	9
201507	370	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The Committee may also wish to consider phasing out reinvestments in order to address the uneven pattern of redemptions.	96	9
201507	371	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	As shown in the top panel of exhibit 3, the amount of maturing Treasury securities held by the SOMA—shown by the red bars—will vary between $2 billion and $39 billion per month in 2016.	96	9
201507	372	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Although the projection of MBS principal payments—shown by the blue bars—appears smooth and steady, actual prepayments will vary over time as a function of prepayment behavior.	96	9
201507	373	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Smoothing redemptions may, on the margin, help the market absorb the new supply without a noticeable effect on the overall trajectory of the balance sheet or the associated withdrawal of accommodation.	96	9
201507	374	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	An incidental benefit of phasing out Treasury reinvestments over time would be to add Treasury benchmark securities to the SOMA portfolio during the reinvestment period, which could then be made available to lend.	96	9
201507	375	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The SOMA has not held benchmark securities for some time because of the sales under the System’s maturity extension program, but making securities available to lend from the SOMA is helpful when there is tightness in the specials repo market.	96	9
201507	376	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	If the Committee wished to phase reinvestments out over time, it could do so in a number of ways.	96	9
201507	377	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	A straightforward approach would be to reinvest a decreasing proportion of Treasury maturities or MBS principal payments over time.	96	9
201507	378	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	This would result in a slower reduction in the portfolio and would smooth the pattern of maturities and principal payments to some extent.	96	9
201507	379	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Another approach could involve setting a maximum dollar amount of securities that would be allowed to mature or prepay without reinvestment in each month and to increase the dollar amount over time.	96	9
201507	380	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	This would have a similar effect of slowing the reduction in the portfolio and would smooth the pattern of reductions more directly.	96	9
201507	381	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	As with the strategy to begin to cease reinvestments that Beth discussed, these strategies could be executed based on a set schedule, or they could be contingent on continued improvement in the economy.	96	9
201507	382	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Further staff work could be completed to evaluate these and other options should the Committee decide to phase out reinvestments.	96	9
201507	383	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Turning now to market expectations, as shown in the bottom-left panel of your exhibit, the median respondents to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers and its Survey of Market Participants expected both Treasury security and MBS reinvestments to cease approximately seven months after liftoff, but there was a wide range around this figure, with some respondents expecting reinvestments to cease at liftoff and others expecting reinvestments to continue for more than a year.	96	9
201507	384	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	As shown in the bottom-right panel, respondents generally place the highest probability on reinvestments being gradually phased out over time.	96	9
201507	385	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The median expectation is that, should reinvestments be phased out gradually, this would be done over a period of about 11 months for both Treasury securities and MBS, though again, expectations for this are dispersed.	96	9
201507	386	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Overall, respondents generally expect the reinvestment policies for Treasuries and MBS to be similar.	96	9
201507	387	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	While market participants are generally not focused on whether a decision about reinvestments would be specifically calendar or state dependent, many note that they expect the Committee to be attentive to economic and financial conditions and to take account of potential disruptions to market functioning and liquidity in determining the pace at which reinvestments could occur.	96	9
201507	388	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In supporting this view, many cite the Committee’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans statement and other communications emphasizing a gradual approach to normalization.	96	9
201507	389	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Some policymakers’ recent communications have reinforced these ideas, including the notion that a change in the reinvestment policy could be tied to the level of the federal funds target range.	96	9
201507	390	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	We should note that survey respondents and market participants indicate that they do not hold firm views about reinvestment, in light of the limited information available to them about the FOMC’s thinking on this topic.	96	9
201507	391	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The final page of your handout provides the questions circulated to you previously.	96	9
201507	392	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	393	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	That concludes our prepared remarks.	96	9
201507	394	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	Beth and I would be happy to take questions.	96	9
201507	395	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	396	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Were there questions or comments?	96	9
201507	397	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201507	398	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, I just have a question about the phaseout.	96	9
201507	399	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Julie, you listed a whole bunch of arguments in favor of a phaseout.	96	9
201507	400	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In weighing these, would you describe them primarily in terms of market dislocations, disruptions, and other aspects of it, or is there really much of an economic argument in terms of macroeconomic goals here?	96	9
201507	401	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just hoping to clarify what is the advantage of a phaseout over, say, 6 to 12 months.	96	9
201507	402	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	I think the main advantage to considering a phaseout would be to address the potential risks related to market functioning.	96	9
201507	403	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	When we run the scenarios, we don’t see very significant changes in the macroeconomic outcomes, whether you use a phaseout or not.	96	9
201507	404	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	So I think the arguments would probably fall primarily in the market-functioning state.	96	9
201507	405	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because I always wanted to be a lawyer, I’m going to do a follow-up question.	96	9
201507	406	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When you say “not significant,” you mean indecipherable in looking at a picture of inflation and unemployment?	96	9
201507	407	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	I would say, basically, yes.	96	9
201507	408	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	96	9
201507	409	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	With the one caveat that in 2013, talking about what we might do in the future with a portfolio, in terms of the taper, had very big effects.	96	9
201507	410	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And the model would say that it would have no effects.	96	9
201507	411	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The model would say that it would have no effects.	96	9
201507	412	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s the only caveat to that.	96	9
201507	413	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	So it’s important to recognize, in terms of the market response, that it will depend on where market expectations are at the time and how dispersed they are.	96	9
201507	414	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In thinking about the communications, that communication can clarify a range of expectations, and that could cause a change in market rates relative to before the announcement.	96	9
201507	415	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201507	416	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	When you say “market rates,” and you talk about the taper, I guess the one market rate that seems most important is the mortgage rate.	96	9
201507	417	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Can you imagine that mortgage rates would have some type of outsized effect?	96	9
201507	418	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Is that what you’re talking about?	96	9
201507	419	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	I think the effect could be both in the Treasury rate as well as the mortgage rate, but it would likely be more pronounced on the MBS side.	96	9
201507	420	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	But I think it’s also important to draw a distinction between the effects of the programs in terms of the changes in levels.	96	9
201507	421	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	As the portfolios unwound, you would expect—and, in fact, it’s incorporated into the model—that rates should rise over time.	96	9
201507	422	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	In addition to those effects, there could be other, more temporary or transitory effects where you could see some more widening.	96	9
201507	423	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	We are hearing relatively more discussion about it in the MBS market than in the Treasury securities market.	96	9
201507	424	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	96	9
201507	425	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions?	96	9
201507	426	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	96	9
201507	427	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round.	96	9
201507	428	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo is going to start us off.	96	9
201507	429	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	430	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I begin from the premise that the issue of when to cease reinvestments of the SOMA portfolio needs discussion among policymakers not only because of some of the considerations that Beth and Julie have just raised, but also because, while the funds rate and portfolio adjustments are both available monetary policy tools, we don’t regard them as perfect substitutes for one another.	96	9
201507	431	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Before answering the questions that were put to us in the staff memo, I want to start by specifying what I think are the salient differences between them, for our purposes.	96	9
201507	432	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, in our previous discussions of normalization policy, several participants have expressed the view that we should use only federal funds rate increases in the early stages of tightening so as to return as quickly as we can to a point where material federal funds rate reductions would be available as a response to a downturn in the economy.	96	9
201507	433	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The preference for federal funds rate reductions over additional SOMA purchases presumably arises from some combination of our sense of the relative efficacy of the two instruments in the contemplated deteriorating conditions and of concerns about institutional or external reactions to another LSAP program.	96	9
201507	434	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	This view seems quite sensible, though I might note in passing that the caution inherent in this view would also seem to argue, at least at the margin, for a delay in a start to tightening in order to reduce the chances of a downturn that would require a policy reversal.	96	9
201507	435	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	A second difference is the possibility that through some combination of direct and signaling effects, cessation of reinvestments in Treasury securities would more directly affect the longer end of the yield curve.	96	9
201507	436	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Right now, the average duration of Treasury securities in our portfolio is around seven years.	96	9
201507	437	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Reinvestments would probably have a duration of five to six years.	96	9
201507	438	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So stopping reinvestments would increase the supply of longer-duration bonds in the market.	96	9
201507	439	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	This possibility would become significant if, as some observers have speculated, our initial increases in the federal funds rate do not yield proportionate increases further out on the curve, an outcome presumably of some importance if the Committee’s efforts to tighten financial conditions are to be effective in the real economy.	96	9
201507	440	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, if the shape of the curve were determined overwhelmingly by market expectations of future short-term rates plus a term premium, then theoretically an anticipated reduction in our balance sheet size shouldn’t affect longer-term yields.	96	9
201507	441	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I think we’ve seen in recent years that actual changes in the supply of securities can have some effects that are not altogether driven by rational expectations of future conditions.	96	9
201507	442	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Third, if the ON RRP program becomes and remains larger because of the quantity of reserves associated with our large balance sheet, then the concerns I’ve previously expressed with respect to financial stability might be mitigated through earlier measures to reduce its size.	96	9
201507	443	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Of course, the size of the ON RRP after liftoff will depend on many factors, including the Treasury’s decisions on bill issuance and the speed with which banks begin to raise the rates they pay on deposits.	96	9
201507	444	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And depending on when we began roll-offs, the mitigating effect might be pretty modest and more about signaling than direct effects.	96	9
201507	445	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But the possibility raised in the recent memo to Reserve Bank research directors—that the demand for ON RRP might increase over time, rather than stabilize or decline—is another reminder of why we should keep the financial-stability and market-structure issues in mind.	96	9
201507	446	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Fourth, and finally, the fact that we hold a lot of MBS means that portfolio adjustment might have a disproportionate effect on mortgage markets relative to federal funds rate increases.	96	9
201507	447	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Our decisions on reinvestment policy will be usefully informed by considering which of these differences are very likely to be important for our policies and which would be important only if less probable contingencies were to arise.	96	9
201507	448	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The fact that we don’t know at the outset of normalization whether we will need to react to a near- or medium-term downturn argues for pursuing initial tightening solely through federal funds rate increases so as to reacquire as quickly as possible the less controversial—and arguably more effective—tool of funds rate decreases.	96	9
201507	449	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I wouldn’t want to adopt a policy that ruled out an earlier cessation of rollovers in the event that developments affecting the yield curve or the ON RRP program made such a step advisable.	96	9
201507	450	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	In short, my current thinking is that our presumption should be that we will raise rates several times before ending reinvestments, but that we might move more quickly if we observe post-liftoff difficulties in these other areas.	96	9
201507	451	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Looking at things this way, I’d be disinclined to get very specific in an ex-ante communication strategy.	96	9
201507	452	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Calendar guidance, even conditional, would almost surely be read as a near commitment.	96	9
201507	453	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t see how to sensibly use economic indicators such as unemployment or inflation as triggers because those kinds of indicators are relevant to the overall pace of tightening through both instruments.	96	9
201507	454	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The reasons for maintaining some optionality concerning portfolio practices pertain to financial conditions, which would be particularly difficult to capture in quantitative terms, especially because there are some quite distinct considerations.	96	9
201507	455	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think this argues for only a modest change in the policy we announced in our normalization principles last fall—namely, that the timing of the cessation of reinvestment will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve.	96	9
201507	456	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The modest change would be to add something to reflect that aim of reacquiring interest rate reductions as a policy tool.	96	9
201507	457	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	One possible formulation—although I’m sure there are others that would capture the thought, and I think Vice Chairman Dudley has got one—would be to echo the Bank of England, which in various communications has indicated that the Monetary Policy Committee is not likely to change the size of the Bank’s balance sheet until the Bank rate has reached a level from which it could be cut materially if needed.	96	9
201507	458	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s worth noting that the Bank of England has kept this position pretty general and has not incorporated it into formal statements of monetary policy.	96	9
201507	459	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s been mentioned in some FAQs, referred to in its quarterly Inflation Reports, and, in even more general terms, mentioned by Governor Carney in testimony to a parliamentary committee.	96	9
201507	460	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me very sensible for us to emulate the Bank of England and not make too big a deal of all this so as to avoid creating specific expectations that might be taken as near commitments or used as benchmarks to evaluate how normalization is going.	96	9
201507	461	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	That suggests to me that we should communicate this modest elaboration of our intentions through the minutes or through an answer by the Chair to a question at a press conference.	96	9
201507	462	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Next, I’d note that the bunching of maturing Treasuries in our portfolio would happily coincide with the approach I’ve just suggested, assuming our first funds rate increase happens later this year.	96	9
201507	463	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Right now, relatively small amounts are maturing each month.	96	9
201507	464	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But in the period from February to May 2016, as one of the charts that they distributed shows, we have a substantial jump in maturing Treasuries to $128 billion over those four months.	96	9
201507	465	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Then there’s a pattern of a few low months followed by one higher month until early 2018, when the amounts for both higher- and lower-maturity months increase substantially.	96	9
201507	466	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	If we thought in terms of ceasing reinvestments in the second half of next year, we would have given ourselves time to make a few federal funds rate increases, assuming the central tendency of the Committee holds, and yet still have a period of relatively low amounts maturing monthly so as not to tighten financial conditions very much via portfolio runoff, at least for a while.	96	9
201507	467	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, with respect to the issue of full cessation or phaseout of reinvestments, I feel differently about Treasury securities and MBS.	96	9
201507	468	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	For Treasury securities, I’d probably favor ceasing most reinvestments immediately or soon after we make the decision to move ahead, particularly if that is in a period when relatively small amounts were maturing.	96	9
201507	469	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	However, in light of the fact that the pattern of maturation is quite uneven, I’d be interested in Simon Potter’s views as to whether it would be a good idea to smooth out the reduction in our Treasury portfolio as well as whether there are other reasons to continue to roll over a modest amount for some period of time, which I think Julie Remache alluded to.	96	9
201507	470	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	As to MBS, because our portfolio accounts for a substantially greater share of that market, it’s probably better to phase out reinvestment of agency MBS, though as to precisely how, I would again want to be guided by advice from the Desk.	96	9
201507	471	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	472	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	473	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	96	9
201507	474	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	96	9
201507	475	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As posed in the staff memo, there are two essential issues.	96	9
201507	476	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, should the process of ending reinvestments be based on calendar time or just state dependent?	96	9
201507	477	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, when we end the process of reinvestment, should we do this by tapering or instead by “cold turkey,” and should the process be the same for Treasury securities and agency MBS?	96	9
201507	478	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning to the first point, I come out pretty close to what Governor Tarullo said.	96	9
201507	479	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m on the side of qualitative state-dependent guidance.	96	9
201507	480	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	State-dependent guidance has a number of advantages over calendar-based guidance.	96	9
201507	481	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, working through the expectations channel, state dependency would automatically add or subtract support to the economy as incoming data pushes back or pulls in expectations about the end of the timing of reinvestments.	96	9
201507	482	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, this is not a particularly strong effect in most states of the world, but it might be very helpful if the draw on the outlook was particularly negative.	96	9
201507	483	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, it seems prudent to avoid prematurely committing to end reinvestments, in view of the asymmetry of the policy options should the economy prove weaker than expected.	96	9
201507	484	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If the economy were weaker than expected, our tools to provide support are limited in that direction.	96	9
201507	485	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Reversing course and stopping the balance sheet from shrinking once the process has begun—we have that option—would be difficult to do in practice, and the scope for policy accommodation by reducing short-term interest rates would be quite limited for some time by the proximity of the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	486	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I prefer qualitative state-dependent guidance rather than defining particular variables as triggers for action.	96	9
201507	487	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This is motivated by my view that the end of reinvestments should be driven by the likelihood that we’ll be forced to return to the effective lower bound sometime in the relatively near future, and that likelihood simply cannot be summed up by a single parameter.	96	9
201507	488	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, I could imagine ending reinvestments at a relatively low federal funds rate if the economy had considerable forward momentum or waiting a bit longer if the momentum were less strong or if there were greater risks that it might not be sustained in the future.	96	9
201507	489	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The qualitative standard that I have in mind would read something like this, which I think tracks the Bank of England approach:  “reasonable confidence that the economic outlook will not warrant a return to the zero lower bound in the next few years”—or something similar.	96	9
201507	490	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In my mind, this probably would not imply ending reinvestments until the federal funds rate was at least 1 percent, but probably even higher, depending on the economy’s forward momentum and the risks to the outlook that were in place at that time.	96	9
201507	491	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the major downside to qualitative state-dependent guidance is it makes it a much bigger deal when we finally actually do decide to shrink the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	492	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thus, there is a greater risk, in this approach, of a bigger market reaction.	96	9
201507	493	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	However, I think this risk can be lessened by good communications.	96	9
201507	494	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As long as we’re clear about what’s driving our thinking, then market participants should be able to think along with us and anticipate our decision.	96	9
201507	495	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We could also reduce the risk of surprise by communicating our thinking in the FOMC minutes or in the Chair’s press conference.	96	9
201507	496	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My point is that the risk of surprising and destabilizing the markets is under our control to a large extent, so that we can minimize the risk of an outsized market reaction.	96	9
201507	497	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, for calendar-based guidance, it strikes me that the major benefit is that it damps any effect from the decision to begin to end the reinvestment process.	96	9
201507	498	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s no signal from the decision in terms of timing—it’s already been folded in mechanically with the liftoff decision.	96	9
201507	499	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This means that when redemption and wind-down begin, not much should happen because there’s not a strong signal of any change in view on the part of the Federal Reserve.	96	9
201507	500	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But this is offset by two significant negatives.	96	9
201507	501	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, as the start of ending the reinvestment process will represent a tightening of policy, it contradicts what we’ve been saying—namely, that monetary policy decisions are data dependent.	96	9
201507	502	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If the timing of liftoff, which is a move to less accommodation, is data dependent, logic would imply that other means of tightening policy should also be data dependent.	96	9
201507	503	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, it seems to me that we want to be careful about ending reinvestments prematurely.	96	9
201507	504	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That is because once we begin on that path, it may be hard to reverse course—that is, to start reinvesting, and even harder to expand the balance sheet again.	96	9
201507	505	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I, for one, want to be highly confident that we are unlikely to have to return to the zero lower bound in the near future before ending reinvestments.	96	9
201507	506	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure how to reconcile that with calendar- based guidance unless I push the calendar-based guidance very far off into the future, an option that I don’t think is reasonably on the table.	96	9
201507	507	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning next to the issue of how to end reinvestments, I would favor tapering, and I would not distinguish between Treasury securities and agency MBS.	96	9
201507	508	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I favor tapering because it reduces the risk of any damage to market function.	96	9
201507	509	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We just don’t know what those risks are, and I don’t see why you’d want to take a chance when you are not really sure how big those risks are.	96	9
201507	510	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Doing it this way also would be generally consistent with current market expectations.	96	9
201507	511	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The cost in terms of delaying the normalization of the balance sheet are low as long as the taper is not stretched over a long period—that is, as long as it’s not stretched out for more than a year or so.	96	9
201507	512	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t distinguish between Treasury securities and agency MBS because I’m not convinced that we really have a strong compelling reason to do so.	96	9
201507	513	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you weren’t tapering, you might want to differentiate, because the risk to market functioning might differ.	96	9
201507	514	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But because tapering addresses that market-functioning risk directly, then there no longer seems to be a case for differentiation once you’ve made the decision to taper.	96	9
201507	515	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, assuming that tapering is the way the Committee ultimately wants to go, the next question would be the length and the form of taper.	96	9
201507	516	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I assume you don’t need to stretch out the taper very long, but I’d be interested in hearing from the staff about the pros and cons of a shorter versus longer taper.	96	9
201507	517	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the form of the taper, as Julie said, there are a number of ways to go.	96	9
201507	518	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You can reduce the amount of reinvestment by a fixed percentage each month, or you can reduce it by a fixed dollar amount.	96	9
201507	519	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	These have different characteristics in terms of the risk to market function and the trajectory of the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	520	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure which of these has better properties, frankly, so I would encourage the staff to come back with some proposals.	96	9
201507	521	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If we decide that tapering is the way to go, what is the best way to do it and why, because it’s not obvious?	96	9
201507	522	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Do you want to have more predictability on the amount of reinvestment being reduced each month, or do you want to have more predictability in terms of the path of the balance sheet each month?	96	9
201507	523	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not obvious to me which is right.	96	9
201507	524	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s really important that we do clarify what we think about reinvestments, because when we lift off, the Chair is going to go to the press conference and one of the first questions is going to be, “Okay, now that you have lifted off, what are you going to do about reinvestments?”	96	9
201507	525	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the more we can clarify that matter before we get to that point, I think that would be a good place for the Committee to be.	96	9
201507	526	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	96	9
201507	527	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Agreed.	96	9
201507	528	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	529	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201507	530	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	531	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, this especially is timely.	96	9
201507	532	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m increasingly being asked about our balance sheet normalization plans, and prudent planning and good communication argue for settling on a strategy and tactics in advance of liftoff.	96	9
201507	533	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like Governor Tarullo, I kind of stepped back when I got the memo and the questions.	96	9
201507	534	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recall something that President Evans said when I first became president.	96	9
201507	535	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I answered the questions in the memo, he said, “That’s a rookie mistake.”	96	9
201507	536	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	96	9
201507	537	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ve been in the job now roughly four and a quarter years, so I’m not making the same rookie mistakes anymore.	96	9
201507	538	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like Government Tarullo, I looked back and said, “What are we trying to accomplish here?	96	9
201507	539	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Under what conditions would certain approaches work better than others?”	96	9
201507	540	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And that led me to think again about the issue of what the strategy is, and from that perspective consider the tactics or some of the questions more in the context of thinking about it in terms of what’s our strategy with regard to this.	96	9
201507	541	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One possible strategy would treat the balance sheet—and I actually was struck by the fact that the memo was kind of pushing this way—as an active policy tool on par with the funds rate.	96	9
201507	542	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re looking at economic conditions, looking at the forecast, deciding whether it’s time to end reinvestment or to pare back on reinvestment.	96	9
201507	543	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I didn’t think anyone would use the word “taper” again—I’m surprised by that.	96	9
201507	544	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But really, you’re thinking the balance sheet would be adjusted based on economic conditions, and our policy communications would highlight the intentions about both the balance sheet and the funds rate.	96	9
201507	545	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The other strategy is to put management of the balance sheet into the background, and instead focus policy actions and communications squarely on the funds rate.	96	9
201507	546	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In this case, the balance sheet reductions are aligned with the overall thrust of policy, obviously driven by our macroeconomic goals.	96	9
201507	547	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But they wouldn’t be actively managed in the same way as the policy lever.	96	9
201507	548	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I strongly prefer the latter strategy.	96	9
201507	549	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The Committee and financial market participants have a much better understanding of and more confidence in using the federal funds rate to conduct and communicate monetary policy.	96	9
201507	550	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the past—notably during the taper tantrum—markets have viewed our balance sheet communications as signals about our intentions regarding the future path of the funds rate.	96	9
201507	551	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	A clear subordination of the balance sheet management to the funds rate would help avoid such confusion in the future.	96	9
201507	552	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, the primacy of the funds rate is consistent with our treatment of other supporting tools in our normalization plans, such as the IOER and the overnight reverse repo facilities.	96	9
201507	553	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, finally, keeping the balance sheet actions in the background would be consistent with our earlier statement on policy normalization—that is, it indicated that reductions in the size of the balance sheet would be gradual and predictable.	96	9
201507	554	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the context of these strategic considerations, I think our recent experience with funds rate forward guidance and with expanding the balance sheet through QE provides a couple of important lessons for the future.	96	9
201507	555	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To begin with, date-based forward-looking policy statements boxed us in at times in arbitrary ways.	96	9
201507	556	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Similarly, setting policy thresholds based on economic variables proved problematic.	96	9
201507	557	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thus, I would prefer not to use any date-based guidance—I’m thinking about “six months” or some phrase like that—or economic variable thresholds for communicating the conditions to start reducing the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	558	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	With regard to using a specific level of the funds rate—say, 1 percent—as a threshold, I do see merits in that approach.	96	9
201507	559	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, it’s linking our policy decisions and our tools together.	96	9
201507	560	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I do think it could place undue attention and public speculation on what should be a relatively under-the-radar balance sheet action.	96	9
201507	561	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	What I would prefer is something qualitative.	96	9
201507	562	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There have been a couple of suggestions about this, but I personally prefer the Chair’s eloquent public comments—namely, that we would begin the process of ceasing reinvestment after the Committee was comfortable that the normalization process was successfully under way.	96	9
201507	563	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I actually think that covers the comments that we’ve already heard about having the interest rate high enough that we’re in a comfortable place, taking into account the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	564	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, let me respond to the Vice Chairman’s comment.	96	9
201507	565	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that this reasonable confidence that we won’t return to the zero lower bound just opens a whole box of issues about what does that mean and how do we measure it.	96	9
201507	566	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This reasonable confidence is something that’s hard to define, as we’ve learned.	96	9
201507	567	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should also keep in mind that the projected timeline for normalizing the balance sheet, absent asset sales, is already quite long.	96	9
201507	568	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The baseline Board staff projection says that our balance sheet will still be putting downward pressure on term premiums for another 10 years.	96	9
201507	569	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In order to normalize the balance sheet before our retirements—all of our retirements—without resorting to asset sales, we shouldn’t wait too long to halt reinvestments.	96	9
201507	570	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d also prefer to end reinvestments without any kind of taper or phaseout period.	96	9
201507	571	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m still struggling with the argument for the phaseout.	96	9
201507	572	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Obviously, if it’s a phaseout over six months or something, I wouldn’t be opposed to that, but I still don’t quite see the strong argument for this.	96	9
201507	573	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Every time we’ve ended one of our QE programs or we’ve done the taper, we haven’t actually seen these market disruptions and dislocations that we’ve been so worried about.	96	9
201507	574	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I understood being worried about them the first few times, but I’m not sure why we’re still quite so worried about it.	96	9
201507	575	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, Julie, you said things have changed.	96	9
201507	576	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, again, maybe that’s prudent insurance against the possibility that this could be more of a problem.	96	9
201507	577	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think it gets us back into the game of, if we do 50 percent of reinvestments the first time, or whatever we’re thinking about, it’s going to lead to the question, “Under what conditions are you going to do the next step-down or step-up?,” or however you want to phrase that.	96	9
201507	578	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so if we do a phaseout, I would argue that it should be somewhat mechanical, like we did the taper—obviously, with language describing it, depending on economic conditions, but really be more on autopilot.	96	9
201507	579	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would argue that markets do seem to be sufficiently deep, that the flow considerations—again, a major concern associated with this—just don’t seem to be that important.	96	9
201507	580	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I would handle MBS and Treasury securities in the same way in terms of ending the reinvestments.	96	9
201507	581	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you very much.	96	9
201507	582	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	583	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	May I ask a clarifying question?	96	9
201507	584	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You said that downward pressure of the balance sheet on term premiums would last 10 years?	96	9
201507	585	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes.	96	9
201507	586	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	The size of the portfolio would be normalized in 2021, but because of the composition of the portfolio, it would still have a lot of MBS and some longer-duration securities.	96	9
201507	587	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So it would be a longer duration portfolio.	96	9
201507	588	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	It would be another several years before the composition of the portfolio is also normalized.	96	9
201507	589	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I see.	96	9
201507	590	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	96	9
201507	591	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wanted to understand that.	96	9
201507	592	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	96	9
201507	593	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201507	594	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Could I just ask a question about the presentation?	96	9
201507	595	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	In exhibit 3, you’ve got the sum of maturities and it has this certain Manhattan-skyline-peak aspect to it, which is getting my attention.	96	9
201507	596	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	That made me go look at a part of Tealbook B I don’t look at very often.	96	9
201507	597	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But I tried to dig up what the SOMA balance sheet holdings would actually look like, and the chart there is consistent with these peaks in maturities, right?	96	9
201507	598	2015-07-29	meeting	REMACHE	That’s right.	96	9
201507	599	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So you might look at those peaks and expect choppiness.	96	9
201507	600	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Maybe it’s the aspect ratio here, but it doesn’t look quite as jagged as I might have expected.	96	9
201507	601	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	96	9
201507	602	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	96	9
201507	603	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201507	604	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	605	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In thinking about the normalization of the balance sheet, I have several principles that I would follow.	96	9
201507	606	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, balance sheet normalization should be implemented in a way that minimizes the likelihood of returning short- term rates to the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	607	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	These are things highlighted by both Governor Tarullo and Vice Chairman Dudley.	96	9
201507	608	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, balance sheet normalization should be conducted to reduce the likelihood of taper tantrum-type disruptions by avoiding large, discrete changes.	96	9
201507	609	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our models didn’t anticipate the taper tantrum, and I don’t think our models will anticipate any effect now.	96	9
201507	610	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But I don’t have a lot of confidence in our ability to predict things that haven’t happened in the historical data.	96	9
201507	611	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that historical period, we hadn’t been at the zero lower bound and we hadn’t had a large balance sheet.	96	9
201507	612	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I don’t think we should have too much certainty about what the effect might be.	96	9
201507	613	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, we should select and communicate a consistent, understandable redemption path, not necessarily tied to the somewhat arbitrary schedule of roll-offs and prepayments, but sized and timed to allow a smooth reduction in the size of the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	614	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fourth, the plan should be to reduce the balance sheet at a fairly steady and predictable pace, but a pace that produces monetary tightening consistent with our macroeconomic forecasts.	96	9
201507	615	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Then we could use the federal funds target as the primary tool to respond to economic surprises that affect the forecast.	96	9
201507	616	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The federal funds rate channel is better understood than the balance sheet channel and the federal funds rate seems the more appropriate tool for making modest changes to the normalization process resulting from surprises in the incoming data.	96	9
201507	617	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is very similar to President Williams’s point on this.	96	9
201507	618	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Fifth, shrinking the balance sheet is tightening.	96	9
201507	619	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We generally move the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments.	96	9
201507	620	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would prefer the cumulative effect of redemptions over a one-year period to be sized to approximate a 25 basis point change in the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	621	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In general, I envision a combination of funds rate policy and balance sheet reductions that follows the path outlined in the most recent Tealbooks, although with a somewhat more gradual start to the redemption program.	96	9
201507	622	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	That is, we would choose a liftoff date, raise the federal funds rate a couple of times, and, if things go according to plan, begin a tapered reduction in reinvestments after those initial increases.	96	9
201507	623	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But it’s important to retain the sense of data dependence and flexibility as we anticipate this next phase of our normalization.	96	9
201507	624	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The logic of sequencing our exit so that liftoff precedes redemptions is to ensure the balance sheet actions would not delay liftoff from the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	625	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Using that same logic, I suggest raising the federal funds rate target twice before beginning redemption tapering to ensure that we are well off the zero lower bound and that we have dealt with any complications in keeping the funds rate within our target range.	96	9
201507	626	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, the delay would provide time to assess the degree to which the increases in the federal funds rate are being transmitted to longer-term interest rates and whether our first set of actions has unexpectedly slowed the economy.	96	9
201507	627	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would then select and announce a path for redemptions that would reduce the chance of the announcement of balance sheet normalization creating a taper tantrum.	96	9
201507	628	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I consider the announcement of the tapering process as the third action in our tightening sequence.	96	9
201507	629	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	After we set the conditional path for redemptions, the criteria for additional tightening of the federal funds rate would be the same criteria I would use for beginning the balance sheet normalization process.	96	9
201507	630	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would not tie the announcement to calendar dates.	96	9
201507	631	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because earlier estimates of the effect of our balance sheet suggest that $500 billion of purchases was roughly equivalent to a 75 basis point decrease in the federal funds rate, a constant redemption flow of $15 billion a month for a year would translate to roughly a 25 basis point federal funds tightening over the course of a year.	96	9
201507	632	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	When a third tightening appears appropriate, I would announce the beginning of tapering of our balance sheet of $15 billion a month in redemptions.	96	9
201507	633	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If additional tightening of financial conditions was required, we could raise the federal funds rate at the same time as beginning the tapering process.	96	9
201507	634	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the forecast unfolded as in the Tealbook, a gradual approach to tightening would be appropriate and the tapering process would be an alternative to raising the federal funds rate at that meeting.	96	9
201507	635	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of the composition of the redemptions, I would start with $5 billion of MBS redemptions and $10 billion in Treasury redemptions.	96	9
201507	636	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This would minimize the chance that the announcement would cause a spike in mortgage rates.	96	9
201507	637	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If the housing market was becoming too ebullient, we could increase the proportion of MBS redemptions with or without subsequent increases in the flow of total redemptions.	96	9
201507	638	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	There is a financial-stability element in determining the size and composition of our redemptions.	96	9
201507	639	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Do we want to slow the housing sector or steepen the yield curve?	96	9
201507	640	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We should increase the redemption size or increase the MBS share of redemptions.	96	9
201507	641	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In fact, the financial- stability tabletop conducted by the COP Financial Stability Committee included a scenario in which two of the presidents involved felt that the redemption or selling of longer-term assets might be one of the potential reactions to an overheating in the real estate market.	96	9
201507	642	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	For this reason, I would maintain some longer-term Treasury securities and MBS in our portfolio to preserve the option of a yield-curve tightening strategy should financial conditions in the future make that a desirable response to financial-stability concerns.	96	9
201507	643	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Because our securities redemptions initially would be less than the balance sheet rollover, we also should discuss how the excess rollover funds should be reinvested.	96	9
201507	644	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If duration is one of the important factors in the effectiveness of the balance sheet as a monetary policy tool, reinvestment should be done to keep the proportion of MBS and the duration of the SOMA account unchanged other than for securities being redeemed.	96	9
201507	645	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, reinvesting in Treasury bills would tend to offset some of the tightening effects we are trying to accomplish through raising short-term rates.	96	9
201507	646	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	These concerns imply that the reinvesting should be concentrated in somewhat longer duration securities, which would pose complications down the road as it may alter the timing of roll-offs.	96	9
201507	647	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, this is something we could perhaps delegate to the Desk.	96	9
201507	648	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	649	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	650	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201507	651	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a two-hander, which actually is more a question for President Williams or Vice Chairman Dudley, and maybe Governor Tarullo, too.	96	9
201507	652	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There seems to be an implicit notion that reducing the balance sheet will increase the probability of our hitting the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	653	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I couldn’t follow that logic.	96	9
201507	654	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Is it because—maybe I should go with what the Vice Chairman said—we think it would be very costly for us to ever increase the balance sheet again?	96	9
201507	655	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because if, when conditions are bad, we just go back up to $4 trillion, then I don’t see the argument.	96	9
201507	656	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In my judgment, there’s not a huge appetite for that.	96	9
201507	657	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay, if that’s the implicit thinking.	96	9
201507	658	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The federal funds rate tool is considered a better tool than the balance sheet tool, and so we would prefer using the federal funds rate tool over the balance sheet tool.	96	9
201507	659	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Governor Tarullo said that explicitly.	96	9
201507	660	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the notion is that once we start reducing the balance sheet, we’re going to be very averse to reversing that.	96	9
201507	661	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s just say that we prefer the federal fund rate tool to the balance sheet tool.	96	9
201507	662	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t mean the balance sheet tool isn’t present, but we prefer the funds rate tool.	96	9
201507	663	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s fine, but even that doesn’t quite get you there, because if you were willing to reverse course and get yourself back up to the amount of the balance sheet we have in place now, whenever you’re faced with a shock, then you’re in the same place, essentially.	96	9
201507	664	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	96	9
201507	665	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s true, but I think what all of us are saying in different ways is, our expectation is that future Committees will be reluctant to use LSAP purchases as a routine instrument of monetary policy, as opposed to in the middle of the worst financial crisis in 75 years.	96	9
201507	666	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And there’s also a little bit of questioning of the relative efficacy of it, too.	96	9
201507	667	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	96	9
201507	668	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	96	9
201507	669	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s helpful for me.	96	9
201507	670	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201507	671	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201507	672	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	What you say suggests that we don’t couch it in terms of when we feel that we’ve reached a sufficient level of confidence that we don’t go back down to zero, but rather when we feel we can comfortably, politically, market-wise, whatever, start engaging in purchases of assets again.	96	9
201507	673	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Simon?	96	9
201507	674	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Can I just add one thing?	96	9
201507	675	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	I guess you’ve done three asset purchase programs.	96	9
201507	676	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	And one of the ways asset purchases work is that you have to hold them for a while.	96	9
201507	677	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So how you deal with the holdings of asset purchases will be important next time you want to buy assets in terms of the effect they can have.	96	9
201507	678	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a good point.	96	9
201507	679	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201507	680	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201507	681	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the other way to think about these two tools is simply that we have much greater empirical evidence over a much longer period of time connecting changes in the federal funds rate to macroeconomic conditions.	96	9
201507	682	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And so, ideally, one would be back in a framework in which one had the ability to use that, and so I think that would be a very strong rationale for preferring it.	96	9
201507	683	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201507	684	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	685	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Much of the staff memo on reinvestment combines discussion of our reinvestment strategy with discussion of how we communicate about our strategy, especially what forward guidance we might provide.	96	9
201507	686	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In fact, I think it’s fair to say the memo is virtually all about the forward guidance regarding our reinvestment strategy, rather than the strategy itself.	96	9
201507	687	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And I found this a little bit surprising, because just earlier this year we ended the practice of providing forward guidance on our interest rate policy and went instead to a meeting-by-meeting basis for setting policy.	96	9
201507	688	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And in our normalization plan document last September, we promised to give advance notice about asset sales, but we didn’t give any similar promise about reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201507	689	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So, like President Williams, I found it useful to think first about what strategy we want to follow about our balance sheet and then to think about how we want to communicate about it.	96	9
201507	690	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, something stood out to me in the memo.	96	9
201507	691	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The memo provides two scenarios regarding macroeconomic variables—one under an assumption of an early end to reinvestment and the other under an assumption of a later end to reinvestment.	96	9
201507	692	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The early scenario is taken from the June Tealbook, and so that involves a particular interest rate path, presumably chosen appropriately—or the staff’s view of what’s appropriate, I’m not going to quibble with that.	96	9
201507	693	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In the late scenario, the interest rate policy follows an inertial Taylor rule.	96	9
201507	694	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, because a later end to reinvestment by itself entails more accommodative policy, the funds rate is somewhat steeper in the later reinvestment path.	96	9
201507	695	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But it only partially offsets the effect of a later end to reinvestment.	96	9
201507	696	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The unemployment path is, accordingly, lower, and inflation, marginally higher.	96	9
201507	697	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, the staff points out that a funds rate path could be chosen that in the model would completely insulate our goal variables from the balance sheet effects of our reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201507	698	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I’ve argued in the past that these balance sheet effects could be quite small, but let’s set that aside and just take these effects as given.	96	9
201507	699	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I think it makes more sense to compare scenarios in which we are under the sort of complete-offset assumption.	96	9
201507	700	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In other words, under the baseline, we’re assuming we’re setting interest rate policy appropriately.	96	9
201507	701	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If we’re looking at a different timing for reinvestment, I think the sensible thing is to assume that if we adopted that, we would also set interest rate policy appropriately, and essentially that means projections regarding our goal variables would be invariant under the two scenarios.	96	9
201507	702	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So the main effect of the choice of reinvestment is on the path of our balance sheet.	96	9
201507	703	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We can sort of set aside unemployment and inflation.	96	9
201507	704	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, framed this way, that seems to a first approximation—of course, there are second-order issues, too—the useful way to think about it.	96	9
201507	705	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	To me, the choice seems pretty easy.	96	9
201507	706	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I think an array of political economy considerations make it attractive for us to normalize the size of our balance sheet as soon as possible—sooner rather than later.	96	9
201507	707	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I think we’d prefer as small a financial-system footprint as possible while maintaining the ability to accomplish our objectives and live up to our promise not to sell assets.	96	9
201507	708	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I conclude that we should end reinvestment all at once, and soon.	96	9
201507	709	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Ideally, a meeting or two after we start raising rates seems reasonable.	96	9
201507	710	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Under that strategy, the interval between liftoff and ending reinvestment is relatively short, so forward guidance isn’t really that important a question.	96	9
201507	711	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, it strikes me that we could easily make this decision about reinvestment on a meeting-by-meeting basis and, at the appropriate time, simply announce that we’ve decided to stop reinvestment effective immediately in the same way we announced the beginnings of our quantitative easing programs and the beginning of tapering and the like.	96	9
201507	712	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	That would be consistent with our decision earlier this year to back away from forward guidance on interest rate policy, to go instead to a meeting-by-meeting basis.	96	9
201507	713	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And I don’t see why we need forward guidance on ending reinvestment.	96	9
201507	714	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Let me just comment on the discussion about phaseout and market functioning.	96	9
201507	715	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I have a history of questioning the staff on what they mean by market disruption.	96	9
201507	716	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I think if we’re going to take some step like slowing down the end of reinvestments or delaying on the basis of the staff’s conjectures about market disruption, the Committee really ought to have a pretty concrete handle on what in the world that means.	96	9
201507	717	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If prices move, if they get volatile on a couple of days, if something like that happens, I’m not sure why we should care, and I’m not sure what that should mean to us.	96	9
201507	718	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If there’s something more fundamental, like some computers breaking down, I’d want to know about that—maybe that’s worth taking onboard.	96	9
201507	719	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But I think we need a more concrete account of what “market disruption” means before we actually act on it.	96	9
201507	720	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	721	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201507	722	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	96	9
201507	723	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	President Lacker, just for clarification, the baseline scenario is constructed as we always do using mechanically the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	96	9
201507	724	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So that does not start with a specific notion of appropriate policy but, instead, just mechanically applies Taylor (1999).	96	9
201507	725	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	We did basically the same in the alternative where the reinvestments continue until the federal funds rate hits 2 percent.	96	9
201507	726	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook, we are applying the inertial Taylor (1999) rule to the deviations from the baseline.	96	9
201507	727	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the point that you highlighted—that, in principle, of course, the funds rate path could be adjusted to completely insulate the macroeconomy from the changes in reinvestment policy—is entirely correct.	96	9
201507	728	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	It would just be more complex to run that scenario.	96	9
201507	729	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So we simply let the policymakers respond to the deviations from baseline according to the inertial Taylor (1999) rule.	96	9
201507	730	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Right.	96	9
201507	731	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So I stand corrected in my characterization of the baseline funds rate path.	96	9
201507	732	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The basic point is true, though.	96	9
201507	733	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If you’re setting policy in one scenario, you can insulate them.	96	9
201507	734	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, if you took an optimal policy calculation in the baseline path and then did the same with a different reinvestment policy, you’d get the same outcome, right?	96	9
201507	735	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	This is basically an application of the envelope theory, right?	96	9
201507	736	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Mostly correct, particularly as long as you are away from the zero bound.	96	9
201507	737	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Right.	96	9
201507	738	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Again, as a first-order approximation.	96	9
201507	739	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201507	740	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	96	9
201507	741	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just to follow up on that.	96	9
201507	742	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we were to stop the reinvestments very quickly, we might still be very close to the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	743	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So the ability to offset seems a little bit inconsistent with starting the timing almost immediately.	96	9
201507	744	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	You’d be right if there’s enough room, but if there’s not much room, the ability to offset using the federal funds rate seems quite limited, so I think you’d have to pick one of those two.	96	9
201507	745	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If you really want an offset, you need enough room to be very confident you’re not going to hit the zero lower bound again.	96	9
201507	746	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	This is worth thinking about.	96	9
201507	747	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In the macroeconomic literature, the standard treatment is that policy is sort of lexicographic, in that you only have the assets you need when interest rates are above zero.	96	9
201507	748	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	When you get to zero, then the balance sheet is what you use.	96	9
201507	749	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And the presumption in a lot of models and a lot of discussions is last in, first out.	96	9
201507	750	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	On the way up, you’re running off the balance sheet and then raising rates.	96	9
201507	751	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But we’re doing something different—for various reasons, we’re doing something different.	96	9
201507	752	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We’re raising rates before we’re running off the balance sheet, and so we’re getting away from that lexicographic corner solution.	96	9
201507	753	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And I think we need to be clear on why that is and what’s constraining us.	96	9
201507	754	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If interest rates get to 2 percent and we’ve got a big balance sheet, well, why didn’t we buy a lot of assets when we cut rates to 2 percent in 2008?	96	9
201507	755	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We ought to think about that, I guess.	96	9
201507	756	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201507	757	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201507	758	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up on President Lacker’s attempt to build a theorem of invariants.	96	9
201507	759	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be valid except for the concerns we just heard about being willing to raise the size of our balance sheet when we get to the effective lower bound.	96	9
201507	760	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So if we’ve cut the size of the balance sheet, whenever we hit the effective lower bound, we’re going to have less accommodation because of that cut.	96	9
201507	761	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So whenever we hit the effective lower bound at any time in the future, because we’ve reduced the balance sheet—assuming we’re unwilling to raise the size of the balance sheet—we’re going to have less accommodation.	96	9
201507	762	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	763	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201507	764	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Will that argument ever not apply?	96	9
201507	765	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that’s an interesting question—which I will touch on later.	96	9
201507	766	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Should we have $4 trillion for the rest of time?	96	9
201507	767	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201507	768	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Madam Chair, the other lever here in the situation that we’re talking about, without regard to increasing the balance sheet, would be once you go up two funds rate increases, you have a little more latitude to indicate we won’t necessarily raise rates as quickly as the baseline would, and that would impart more accommodation as well.	96	9
201507	769	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But that’s the environment that you’d be dealing with, one that would not be nearly as strong as we expect when we say we’re reasonably confident we’re going to get inflation up to our 2 percent target, it seems to me.	96	9
201507	770	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201507	771	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	96	9
201507	772	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	773	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In preparing for this round, I, too, tried to ground my thinking in guiding principles.	96	9
201507	774	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	They’re not the same as President Rosengren’s.	96	9
201507	775	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I came up with three.	96	9
201507	776	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	First, consistency with the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans document that we published in June 2011 and updated last September.	96	9
201507	777	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As I read it, the September 2014 document established that reductions in SOMA holdings will be done gradually and predictably, that the timing of ceasing reinvestment after liftoff will be state dependent—that is, on the economic and financial conditions and the outlook—and that it is the Committee’s desire to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities, implying that runoff of MBS will be part of normalization from the outset.	96	9
201507	778	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The document also said we do not anticipate selling MBS.	96	9
201507	779	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Everybody is familiar with all of those principles.	96	9
201507	780	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My second guideline is that our reinvestment policy should, broadly speaking, work in support of interest rate policy in pursuit of our dual-mandate objectives.	96	9
201507	781	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	This could be turned around to mean that reinvestment policy should not work counter to interest rate policy.	96	9
201507	782	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My third principle is, the approach should be simple, uncomplicated, and clear in the substance of policy and its communication.	96	9
201507	783	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In other words, I don’t think our reinvestment approach should risk being too cute.	96	9
201507	784	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In the spirit of this go-round, my thinking on the questions is preliminary, not as developed as many of the people who went ahead of me.	96	9
201507	785	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I lean in favor of what I consider a simple approach with these elements:  First, make the decision on the timing of ceasing reinvestments once the mechanics of ongoing interest rate policy implementation have been operationalized and are running smoothly.	96	9
201507	786	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Second, I do prefer a qualitative, state-dependent guidance approach.	96	9
201507	787	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Set the timing of starting cessation of reinvestment in light of economic conditions once we’re reasonably confident the economy can handle any additional tightening that might come from balance sheet reductions.	96	9
201507	788	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Third, allow full passive runoff.	96	9
201507	789	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Even though reductions will vary over time, a published maturity schedule should satisfy the predictability criterion.	96	9
201507	790	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And review the approach periodically in an attempt to assess considerations such as coherence with the expected path of interest rate policy, the extent the variable schedule of reductions is affecting the potency of interest rate policy, and any effect on market functioning.	96	9
201507	791	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The Committee does have other options, as already discussed, of course.	96	9
201507	792	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	For example, monthly reduction could be set as a straight line of equal monthly increments.	96	9
201507	793	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The mix between Treasuries and MBS could be altered.	96	9
201507	794	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ve discussed the pros and cons of this idea before.	96	9
201507	795	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And it’s possible to imagine a scheme of tight coordination between interest rate and balance sheet normalization, trying to integrate these two tools into a dynamically set, data-dependent overall policy stance.	96	9
201507	796	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not warm to these ideas.	96	9
201507	797	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	At present, I’m concerned that over-engineering might produce communication and other issues.	96	9
201507	798	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So, at this point, I prefer keeping it simple.	96	9
201507	799	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	800	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	801	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	96	9
201507	802	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	803	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I welcome this initial discussion on how to deal with reinvestments in our SOMA portfolio.	96	9
201507	804	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And I want to thank the staff for the memo that lays out some of the issues.	96	9
201507	805	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I found it quite helpful.	96	9
201507	806	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I, like President Lockhart, start with our normalization principles.	96	9
201507	807	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Our September 2014 principles provide some guidance on how the Committee will handle its portfolio, including reducing its size and returning its composition to primarily Treasury securities.	96	9
201507	808	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We stated in the principles that we plan to reduce the balance sheet in a gradual and predictable manner, primarily by ending reinvestments, that reinvestments will end sometime after we begin raising the federal funds rate, and that the precise timing will depend on how the economy and outlook evolve.	96	9
201507	809	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Whatever plan we choose should be consistent with these principles.	96	9
201507	810	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	My preference is also to adopt a simple approach, because at this point I don’t see any clear benefits to adopting a more complicated one.	96	9
201507	811	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think the main issues are determining the starting point for ending reinvestments and determining when to communicate our strategy.	96	9
201507	812	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	While I would like the balance sheet to return to a more normal size and composition, I don’t see a compelling reason to begin this in the very early stages of liftoff.	96	9
201507	813	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I’d rather the balance sheet remain passive for a time after liftoff, so that we don’t encourage the idea that the balance sheet, in addition to interest rates, is a regular or active tool of monetary policy.	96	9
201507	814	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We’ve stated that we’ll time the end of reinvestments based on the economy.	96	9
201507	815	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So the further in advance we want to communicate something more concrete about our reinvestment strategy, the less reasonable a calendar-based strategy is, because we don’t know precisely how the economy will evolve.	96	9
201507	816	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	That leaves a state-dependent strategy.	96	9
201507	817	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Now, one reason I don’t think the balance sheet should be viewed as a regular tool of monetary policy is that I don’t believe we have estimates of its effect on risk premiums and the real economy that are precise enough to be able to use it in that way.	96	9
201507	818	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	This argues for not setting separate economic conditions for ending reinvestments.	96	9
201507	819	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	My preference would be, for at least around this table, to think about ending reinvestments tied to the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	820	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Essentially, this means that the economic conditions for ending reinvestments are the same ones we’ll be using to determine the appropriate target for the funds rate.	96	9
201507	821	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Participants who’ve said today that they would be comfortable beginning reinvestments after a couple of federal funds rate increases are essentially doing this.	96	9
201507	822	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The staff memo illustrates a scenario in which reinvestments stop when the federal funds rate hits 2 percent.	96	9
201507	823	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Under the Tealbook baseline, this means full reinvestments continue for almost two years after liftoff.	96	9
201507	824	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	That’s too long.	96	9
201507	825	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I’d be much more comfortable ending reinvestments sooner—say, when the fund rate is up to 1 percent.	96	9
201507	826	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	If the balance sheet effects are larger than we thought, then we could adjust the subsequent path of the funds rate after the end of reinvestments to take account of that.	96	9
201507	827	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	If an adverse shock were to hit the economy so that the federal funds rate needs to move back down, we could begin reinvestments again if need be.	96	9
201507	828	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	One issue that was not raised in the memo is when to convey information to the public about our reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201507	829	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	While market participants are likely to turn attention to reinvestments once we lift off—indeed, there’s already some discussion of this by market participants and Fed watchers—I’m not convinced that at liftoff or shortly thereafter we need to say much more about our reinvestment strategy than we’ve already said in the normalization principles and what will be conveyed in the minutes of this meeting.	96	9
201507	830	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	It would be useful to get the Desk’s view on how much advance notice market participants really need in order to prepare for the end of reinvestment.	96	9
201507	831	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	At some point after we’ve had experience with raising the federal funds rate, we would announce our reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201507	832	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	If the market doesn’t need much advance notice to prepare, then the Committee could introduce statement language saying that if the economy evolves as expected, then we plan to end reinvestments at the next meeting, or at the time of the next federal funds rate increase.	96	9
201507	833	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We could presage this intention a meeting or two beforehand, similar to what we did when we began reducing our third LSAP program in December 2013.	96	9
201507	834	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	You may recall that at the September 2013 meeting, the Committee introduced language saying that the economic improvement since the start of the purchase program was consistent with underlying strength in the economy, but that the Committee decided to wait for more evidence that the progress was sustainable before adjusting the pace of purchases.	96	9
201507	835	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	It repeated this language in October, and then tapering commenced in December.	96	9
201507	836	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So we could use a similar approach here if we thought that it was important to give some advance notice.	96	9
201507	837	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Finally, with regard to whether to end reinvestments completely or phase them out over time, and whether to treat Treasuries or MBS differently, my initial thought is to keep it simple, like President Lockhart, by ending reinvestments all at once and treating Treasury securities and MBS in the same way.	96	9
201507	838	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The pattern of redemptions already has some phaseout built in.	96	9
201507	839	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The macroeconomic effects will be the same whether we announce reinvestments are ending completely or whether we announce a path of gradual phaseout.	96	9
201507	840	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And as the staff memo indicated, market functioning was not adversely affected by the end of our first LSAP program in March 2010, when the SOMA net purchases of MBS fell more than $40 billion.	96	9
201507	841	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Indeed, ending reinvestments might aid market functioning because it will mean there will be more safe assets available for collateral and repo in the hands of the public.	96	9
201507	842	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In addition, market participants know the CUSIPs in our SOMA portfolio.	96	9
201507	843	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So once we announce when reinvestments will end, they’ll know the path of Treasury redemptions, and they’ll be able to estimate the path of MBS redemptions.	96	9
201507	844	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	That said, the MBS market has changed over time, and the Desk estimates that MBS prepayments are expected to be about 30 percent of TBA gross issuance in 2016, requiring the private sector to absorb a large portion of the market.	96	9
201507	845	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Further analysis by the Desk of the risks of ending reinvestments all at once, rather than phasing them out, would be helpful.	96	9
201507	846	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	847	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	848	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201507	849	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	850	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	When I first started thinking about when to cease reinvestments, my instinct was that we should decide based on current and expected economic conditions.	96	9
201507	851	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	After all, the size of the balance sheet is a monetary policy tool, and so it should be chosen in the same deliberate and comprehensive way in which we make federal funds rate decisions, or that we used to purchase the assets in the first place through our various QE programs.	96	9
201507	852	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So I was fundamentally in the state-based camp, and I wanted not to tie us down too much before it was necessary.	96	9
201507	853	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that a lot depends on how powerful the effects of announcing the dates and conditions for the end of reinvestments will be.	96	9
201507	854	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	To a first approximation—maybe a bad one, but it’s an approximation—one can say that announcing the schedule for sales, when it comes, will be equivalent to a given basis point increase or decrease—I’ll explain that in a minute—in the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	855	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But that isn’t quite right.	96	9
201507	856	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The markets have an expectation of how large the balance sheet will be at each future date.	96	9
201507	857	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If our announcement is that we’re going to go early relative to those dates, we’ll be tightening.	96	9
201507	858	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If we go late relative to those dates, we’ll be easing.	96	9
201507	859	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Further, if the markets have reasonable foresight, we get most of the reaction with the announcement, and then carrying it out doesn’t have as much effect as one thinks.	96	9
201507	860	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The less foresight people have, the more one has to take into account all of the effects that President Rosengren indicated a few minutes ago.	96	9
201507	861	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think, at the very general level, our principle is that we should go late with the announcement and with the beginning of the running off the portfolio.	96	9
201507	862	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I say that because I think that the main thing we’ve got to avoid is getting back to the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	863	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	One of you said that we want to go up using the two tools so we get to an interest rate that will make us feel comfortable about not going back.	96	9
201507	864	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, let’s go to the key point.	96	9
201507	865	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	How big will these effects be?	96	9
201507	866	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I was surprised to hear President Rosengren talk about a 75 basis point effect, measured in terms of an equivalent move in the federal funds rate, of some aspect of phasing.	96	9
201507	867	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve seen no evidence that we’ll be anywhere near as powerful as that in the timing of selling off different parts of the portfolio.	96	9
201507	868	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not quite sure of the empirical significance of the lower right-hand chart in exhibit 1 of the handout that we got on SOMA reinvestment policy, but it does suggest that waiting a year doesn’t make much of a difference to interest rates at any time.	96	9
201507	869	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I also think I’ve read a paper or heard a statement indicating that the effect of the running off the portfolio will be in the direction we all believe—namely, that a larger portfolio is more expansionary, but that the size of the effects will be relatively small.	96	9
201507	870	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I think we have to ask the staff to tell us how powerful this is.	96	9
201507	871	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If the whole thing is worth the equivalent of 25 basis points in running down from $4 billion to $1 billion, that’s not huge.	96	9
201507	872	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	One is tempted to say, “Well, we should just reverse the results of our empirical work on the effect of quantitative easing—unless there’s quantitative lack of easing—and then we’ll get the right answer.”	96	9
201507	873	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But there’s so much expectation in these things regarding what you’re saying about future policy that I’m really not sure that you could just do that reversal and say, “That’s what’s going to happen.”	96	9
201507	874	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And the question is, what message are we sending now?	96	9
201507	875	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d announce the beginning of the nonreinvestments relatively late to give us a safety cushion with regard to going back to zero, which I think for a variety of reasons is a problem.	96	9
201507	876	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I agree with those people who’ve said we really don’t want to go there.	96	9
201507	877	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And the reason I reached that conclusion even before this discussion was, I’ve hardly heard anybody say around this table when bad news comes in, “Okay, guys, let’s do another QE.”	96	9
201507	878	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In fact, it seems to have just fallen off the table, and I assume that reflects the conclusions we’ve all arrived at.	96	9
201507	879	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If these effects are powerful, we’re going to have to have some more work by the staff telling us how to coordinate these two instruments.	96	9
201507	880	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	What do we expect when we sell off at a given rate?	96	9
201507	881	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If we expect very little effect, we don’t have to worry very much, and we can just fix it.	96	9
201507	882	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If it’s powerful, then we’re going to have to think about what we’re doing at each stage.	96	9
201507	883	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In the end, because I believe the effects are relatively small, I’ll end up with quite a few of you.	96	9
201507	884	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d give President Lockhart the prize for the most apt analogy in this FOMC meeting.	96	9
201507	885	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve never thought of programs for reinvestment as being cute, but I’m very pleased to think about it.	96	9
201507	886	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We don’t want to be too cute if it isn’t that important.	96	9
201507	887	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If it is that important, we’ll have to be a little cuter, and then go into all of the elements that President Rosengren—and, I think to some extent, Governor Tarullo—mentioned.	96	9
201507	888	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Again, whether that very sophisticated analysis you gave, Governor Tarullo, is going to be the essence of what we do, or an aspect of what we do, depends on just how powerful this tool is that we’re going to be using.	96	9
201507	889	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So what I’d like to ask for is that the staff come back with some quantitative stories about what will happen, or what they expect will happen, or the range of things that could happen, depending on the strategies.	96	9
201507	890	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If you can say this doesn’t matter at all, then we could do it on other grounds.	96	9
201507	891	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If you say this really matters, then we’ll have to do a lot more thinking.	96	9
201507	892	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	893	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	894	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201507	895	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	896	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I prefer the qualitative state-dependent approach to initiating changes to our reinvestment policies.	96	9
201507	897	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	However, once we start, I think there should be a high hurdle for making changes in the pace of our balance sheet reductions.	96	9
201507	898	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Before we being altering our reinvestments, I think we should be well under way in the funds rate normalization process, and I think this is the biggest issue.	96	9
201507	899	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I think a lot of what we’re talking about comes down to this:  We don’t know the effect of the balance sheet adjustments and how they are going to affect longer-term rates, and that translates into some equivalent increase in the funds rate.	96	9
201507	900	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	If we get to a point at which the funds rate is high enough, there’s some offset that can be done with the funds rate itself or the funds rate path trajectory— somebody said this earlier as well.	96	9
201507	901	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So once we get to the point when the funds rate is a viable separate tool, I think it takes care of a lot of these issues.	96	9
201507	902	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	By that time, I expect everything should be working smoothly, with a strong economic outlook and inflation rising toward 2 percent.	96	9
201507	903	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I thought Governor Tarullo’s comments on the Bank of England guidance along these lines of the policy rate being high enough were particularly appropriate and helpful.	96	9
201507	904	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	At that point, we should follow through on our stated goal of returning to a traditional policy environment in which adjusting the funds rate is our primary tool for monetary policy.	96	9
201507	905	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This would mean putting our balance sheet reductions on “cruise control” as much as possible.	96	9
201507	906	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	We should do this in accordance with our exit-principles statement that we will reduce security holdings in a gradual and predictable manner.	96	9
201507	907	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I hope we won’t need to adjust our reinvestment policies regularly, and certainly not as another policy lever, if things are going well.	96	9
201507	908	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This means that before we begin to cease reinvestments, we ought to be reasonably confident that we will be able to adequately respond to future shocks through adjustments in the funds rate.	96	9
201507	909	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This judgment regarding how high the funds rate needs to be before we alter our reinvestments is going to depend on the evolution of the economic environment and undoubtedly will have an aspect of “we’ll know it when we see it.”	96	9
201507	910	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This leads me to think that the best starting rule for ending reinvestments is one that is qualitative and state dependent.	96	9
201507	911	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	On the other questions, I defer judgment to the Desk on how best to engineer the gradual and predictable reduction in the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	912	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	From the memo, I infer that the Desk would prefer to taper reinvestments, at least for a while, to insure against market disruption.	96	9
201507	913	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m fine with this at the start and understand that we may have to treat MBS differently from Treasury securities.	96	9
201507	914	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But we should communicate that any decisions regarding the tapering process are dictated by market-microstructure and potential market dislocation considerations and not by macroeconomic monetary policy concerns.	96	9
201507	915	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	We don’t want markets to confuse technical adjustments with changes in the stance of monetary policy.	96	9
201507	916	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	917	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	918	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thomas.	96	9
201507	919	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Perhaps just as a brief clarification, because there have been some questions about our estimate of the size of the macroeconomic effects of these changes in reinvestment strategies.	96	9
201507	920	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Beth’s handout was only showing the comparison of the path for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	921	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	For those of you who have the memo, on the third-to-last page, page 15, there is exhibit 2.	96	9
201507	922	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That shows you that, using the staff’s methodology, the difference between the two examples shown in the memo is effectively governed by the integral of the area between the two lines under the alternative paths for the SOMA holdings.	96	9
201507	923	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	When you then go to page 15 of the memo, you see roughly what the effect of that is.	96	9
201507	924	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, on the unemployment rate, it’s roughly on the order of 0.1 percentage point at its peak.	96	9
201507	925	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So after a couple of years, the unemployment rate is about 0.1 percentage point lower.	96	9
201507	926	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Now, again, the point applies that President Lacker made beforehand—namely, in principle, of course, you could adjust the federal funds rate so as to completely insulate.	96	9
201507	927	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So if you started off with some path of the unemployment rate that you had previously determined to be optimal, you could, away from the zero lower bound, adjust the funds rate so as to insulate the economy completely from any changes in reinvestment strategy.	96	9
201507	928	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But just to provide an order of magnitude, if you chose the differences in the path of the SOMA holdings and funds rate as shown in the memo, then that would be the resulting maximum effect on the unemployment rate.	96	9
201507	929	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So that’s in FRB/US?	96	9
201507	930	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That is in FRB/US.	96	9
201507	931	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	There are a lot of caveats concerning this, obviously.	96	9
201507	932	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, of course, it relies on the staff’s methodology that the effects result primarily from the stock of our holdings, and are being transmitted through term premiums as we estimate them.	96	9
201507	933	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I will readily admit that there is a lot of uncertainty about that.	96	9
201507	934	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But those are our ballpark estimates.	96	9
201507	935	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And you have to also think of all the alternative paths that are foreclosed once you start to end your investments.	96	9
201507	936	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You sort of feel the ending reinvestments decision is not easily reversed.	96	9
201507	937	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You’re then forestalling all those paths where you would’ve kept the balance sheet higher for a much longer period of time, and that’s not really captured completely in the model because the model is based on creating one path.	96	9
201507	938	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s not based on creating multiple potential outcomes.	96	9
201507	939	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s true.	96	9
201507	940	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, if I could follow up, just back to the deterministic path— there’s some offset in here.	96	9
201507	941	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So you were describing the combined effect of the balance sheet difference and being partially offset by a funds rate path.	96	9
201507	942	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s correct.	96	9
201507	943	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So this isn’t pure balance sheet.	96	9
201507	944	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As you can tell, under the path with the later end of reinvestments, the federal funds rate does rise a little bit above the baseline.	96	9
201507	945	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Virtually opposite.	96	9
201507	946	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	96	9
201507	947	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	And that has primarily to do with the inertial nature of the rule that we’re using.	96	9
201507	948	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201507	949	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just so I understand the calculation—so there were some estimates when we were going into the quantitative easing.	96	9
201507	950	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Are you assuming going out is symmetric so that it’s primarily a balance sheet effect, not a flow?	96	9
201507	951	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Correct.	96	9
201507	952	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And that the sizes that were relevant going into QE—the estimates that you’re basing this on—are basically the same, roughly approximate size that you would have if you do it in reverse, is that right?	96	9
201507	953	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Correct.	96	9
201507	954	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	955	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	And I don’t remember the chronology exactly, but the estimates of efficacy that we started out with at QE1—I don’t know what it was called back then—those were scaled back twice, is my recollection.	96	9
201507	956	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	It is symmetric now, albeit smaller than what we told the Committee at the dawn of large-scale asset purchases.	96	9
201507	957	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s the same modeling approach, David.	96	9
201507	958	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The MBS is sort of put into that framework, and one of the uncertainties is on the MBS side because it’s been harder for us to model that.	96	9
201507	959	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, but I think initially we were more optimistic about portfolio effects.	96	9
201507	960	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	Oh, completely.	96	9
201507	961	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	David, is that an adjustment you’ve made before thinking about the reverse operation?	96	9
201507	962	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	No.	96	9
201507	963	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	You’re maintaining symmetry.	96	9
201507	964	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Correct.	96	9
201507	965	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Much of that adjustment had to do with the difficulty of estimating how asset prices other than, for example, 10-year term premiums respond.	96	9
201507	966	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In particular, in response to the first asset purchase program, those responses seemed to be very large.	96	9
201507	967	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Subsequently, we thought we observed somewhat smaller asset price responses like the stock market and, therefore, scaled back.	96	9
201507	968	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	So one thing we could do is calibrate under those different responses so you could see that.	96	9
201507	969	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201507	970	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to suggest we take a break at this point and eat [laughter] to fortify ourselves for this afternoon.	96	9
201507	971	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take until 1:15 and return to continue the go-round.	96	9
201507	972	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I believe lunch is available next door, as usual.	96	9
201507	973	2015-07-29	meeting		[Lunch recess]	96	9
201507	974	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201507	975	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s continue our go-round with President Harker.	96	9
201507	976	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	977	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	As others have said, I believe that once we’ve achieved a degree of comfort regarding our ability to control short-term market rates, we should begin to reduce the size of our balance sheet.	96	9
201507	978	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	I see little reason to decide today when that will be.	96	9
201507	979	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	In my view, the process that governs the shrinking of the balance sheet should be simple, straightforward, and kept, as President Mester said, distinct from direct adjustments to monetary policy accomplished through changes in the federal funds rate target.	96	9
201507	980	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	It should be calendar based, I believe, but at a date announced after liftoff when we are confident that we are well away from the lower bound.	96	9
201507	981	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	It should be independent of economic conditions, and reductions in the balance sheet should proceed at a fairly constant pace.	96	9
201507	982	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	To avoid the volatility associated with simply ceasing reinvestments, we can, for example—and as others have mentioned—choose a pace that reduces the amount of longer-term Treasury securities and MBS at somewhat less than the average value of anticipated monthly reinvestments.	96	9
201507	983	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Doing so would involve outright sales in some months and reinvestments in other months in order to hit the preset target.	96	9
201507	984	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Proceeding in this manner would make the evolution of our portfolio transparent and avoid the complications that would accompany treating portfolio adjustments as a complementary tool of policy.	96	9
201507	985	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	There’s too much uncertainty surrounding the effects of balance sheet manipulation to treat the normalization of the balance sheet in a way that mimics the normalization of our primary policy instrument, in my opinion.	96	9
201507	986	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	This ends my attempt to answer the questions posed to us.	96	9
201507	987	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	President Williams, consider this my rookie mistake.	96	9
201507	988	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	[Laughter]	96	9
201507	989	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	990	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	991	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201507	992	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	993	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, I support a qualitative state- dependent approach to ceasing or phasing out reinvestments so we preserve optionality and managing decisions about the funds rate and the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	994	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	To convey the likely timing of the start of balance sheet normalization, I would be open to having the minutes convey views, to having the Chair speak to this at future press conferences, or to considering whether the SEP could be a possible communications vehicle.	96	9
201507	995	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	The table reporting the appropriate timing of policy firming in figure 2 could be replaced with a table reporting participants’ judgments about the appropriate time at which to begin to cease or phase out reinvestments once liftoff occurs.	96	9
201507	996	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the policy itself, I would prefer not to distinguish between Treasury securities and MBS.	96	9
201507	997	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the longer run, I view a Treasury securities-only portfolio as most appropriate.	96	9
201507	998	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	For that reason, I would not want to further concentrate our holdings of MBS.	96	9
201507	999	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	And in light of uncertainty about how the market will respond to any adjustments in our reinvestment policy, I support gradually phasing out reinvestments over time.	96	9
201507	1000	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	After we announce the beginning of balance sheet normalization, I continue to support the approach in the normalization principles that reductions in our securities holdings will proceed in a gradual and predictable manner.	96	9
201507	1001	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	If possible, I would prefer to have adjustments to the pace of the phasing out of reinvestments being perceived as predictable rather than as subject to deliberations on a meeting-by-meeting basis.	96	9
201507	1002	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	The approach during the taper of asset purchases, where the process was put essentially on autopilot, barring any major surprise in the data, is relevant here.	96	9
201507	1003	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1004	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1005	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	96	9
201507	1006	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1007	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I share perspectives that several others have expressed already today.	96	9
201507	1008	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	As others have said, because the Committee has communicated that the timing of the cessation or phaseout of reinvestments will depend on the economic and financial conditions and the evolution of the economy, a pure calendar-based approach might be seen as a departure from that commitment.	96	9
201507	1009	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That said, once we begin reducing the size of the balance sheet, we also should be consistent with the statement that we will do so in a gradual and predictable manner.	96	9
201507	1010	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I take this second commitment to mean that once we actually begin reducing the balance sheet, we intend to rely on changes in the path of the federal funds rate rather than in the pace of balance sheet reductions for marginal adjustments to the amount of policy accommodation provided.	96	9
201507	1011	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In qualitative terms, then, balance sheet normalization should not begin until we are reasonably confident that we won’t have to reverse course in order to avoid jeopardizing progress toward full employment and price stability—that is, until we are reasonably confident that subsequent policy adjustments will be achievable through manipulation of the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	1012	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas staff suggests a comfortable point would be 75 to 100 basis points of leeway.	96	9
201507	1013	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Once the funds rate target is 75 to 100 basis points, or perhaps 100 to 125 basis points, it would seem reasonably unlikely that the zero bound would become a binding constraint on policy.	96	9
201507	1014	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In sum, I would support a specified funds rate threshold for beginning balance normalization rather than calendar-based guidance or guidance based on a set of economic criteria that might be complicated or confusing.	96	9
201507	1015	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	On the second question—and, as a rookie, I guess I can answer the second question—we do make a distinction between the treatment of Treasuries and MBS.	96	9
201507	1016	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas view, as you may have heard in the past, is that the Federal Reserve should not play an ongoing role in providing support to the housing sector.	96	9
201507	1017	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	If housing finance remains difficult for certain groups of potential buyers, it is not the result of temporary liquidity problems but due to deliberate, nonmonetary regulatory and policy decisions.	96	9
201507	1018	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Nor do we see a rationale for continuing purchases of MBS as a countercyclical measure.	96	9
201507	1019	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	By the time the process of balance sheet normalization commences, we are likely to be at or very near full employment, with price stability in view.	96	9
201507	1020	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Accordingly, I favor as rapid an end to MBS reinvestments as is possible without disruption to housing finance.	96	9
201507	1021	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Ending reinvestments completely as soon as balance sheet normalization begins would be ideal, with MBS holdings being allowed to run off until they reach de minimis levels.	96	9
201507	1022	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I would lean toward shrinking the balance sheet by a steady, predictable amount each month initially, consistent with our normalization pledge.	96	9
201507	1023	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Looking at exhibit 4, a reduction of something like $20 billion to $25 billion per month appears realistic.	96	9
201507	1024	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We would see this as made up of sharp cutbacks on MBS reinvestments supplemented with enough of a scale-back of our Treasury securities investments to reach that level.	96	9
201507	1025	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1026	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1027	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	96	9
201507	1028	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1029	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have a view that picks up on themes that have been mentioned during the morning, but some aspects of what I will say are different from almost everybody.	96	9
201507	1030	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	My argument has four parts.	96	9
201507	1031	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	First, I think the balance sheet adjustment has proven to be a potent monetary policy tool, so I will talk about that.	96	9
201507	1032	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is a little bit in answer to Governor Fischer.	96	9
201507	1033	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I think we should admit that it’s a potent tool when we are thinking about returning the balance sheet to a more normal size.	96	9
201507	1034	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Third, “potent tool” naturally means it needs to be managed carefully.	96	9
201507	1035	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that means the adjustment should be state dependent.	96	9
201507	1036	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A lot of people are saying it should be state dependent here this morning.	96	9
201507	1037	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Fourth— and this hasn’t been emphasized as much—we have an existing policy expectation, which is that we will cease reinvestment six months after liftoff.	96	9
201507	1038	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	My conclusion is:  We should choose a policy that is consistent with the existing expectation, but which is state dependent.	96	9
201507	1039	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me elaborate on these points.	96	9
201507	1040	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Regarding the balance sheet adjustment as a potent tool, surprise moves with respect to balance sheet policy have had large consequences, and the taper tantrum episode in the summer of 2013 is one important case for this Committee to consider.	96	9
201507	1041	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Strictly speaking, the tantrum itself only involved changes in expectations of balance sheet policy, not any actual change made by the Committee either at the June 2013 meeting or at the September 2013 meeting.	96	9
201507	1042	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Nevertheless, there were large ramifications, both in the United States and globally, on the order of 100 basis points on longer-term interest rates.	96	9
201507	1043	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is quite a big effect, indeed.	96	9
201507	1044	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think the staff’s models are likely understating potential effects on markets and on the economy that could come from changes in balance sheet policy.	96	9
201507	1045	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Also, the international evidence on balance sheet policy suggests important effects coming from the Bank of Japan’s most recent efforts and, certainly, the ECB’s most recent efforts.	96	9
201507	1046	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	My first point, then, is that this is a potent tool.	96	9
201507	1047	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	And I think we should be clearer that this is the case as we discuss this, because there is a lot of schizophrenia around the table.	96	9
201507	1048	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Some people think, “Oh, these are really small effects.”	96	9
201507	1049	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Well, if you think they’re small effects, then don’t worry about it.	96	9
201507	1050	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It doesn’t really matter when you normalize.	96	9
201507	1051	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	If you think they are big effects, as Governor Fischer was saying, then you have to be a lot more careful about it.	96	9
201507	1052	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Second, I interpret the staff simulations to suggest that if we manage the balance sheet down in a way that does not differ materially from current market expectations, then the effects will be minor.	96	9
201507	1053	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It is not that everything you do with a balance sheet causes big effects.	96	9
201507	1054	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It is only if you deviate from the current expectation, which is what the taper tantrum was.	96	9
201507	1055	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	We should expect small effects as long as we do something pretty consistent with existing expectations.	96	9
201507	1056	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	There is the potential for the effects to be large, and large effects would interfere with our policy rate normalization.	96	9
201507	1057	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Third, because the balance sheet policy is, in principle, quite potent, it needs to be managed carefully.	96	9
201507	1058	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	As many of you know, I have long advocated managing the balance sheet in response to economic conditions.	96	9
201507	1059	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	That means I am going to be in favor of a state-dependent approach.	96	9
201507	1060	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do not recommend going to numerical values.	96	9
201507	1061	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	That doesn’t sound like it’s getting too much support today.	96	9
201507	1062	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A qualitative state-dependent approach, as advocated by President Dudley and others, would be what I’m advocating.	96	9
201507	1063	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	And fourth, as Governor Fischer talked about, we already have an existing balance sheet policy expectation built into financial markets, which is that we will end reinvestment six months after liftoff.	96	9
201507	1064	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, this policy is inappropriate.	96	9
201507	1065	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s too calendar based, and it does not smooth the balance sheet decline appropriately.	96	9
201507	1066	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	At the same time, I interpret the Committee’s sentiment to be that we do not wish balance sheet policy to interfere with the policy rate normalization process.	96	9
201507	1067	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	And I am sympathetic with President Lacker’s comment that you should be able to do this in such a way that you choose the optimal rate path, for an announced balance sheet policy, and that the implications for inflation and unemployment are exactly the same as they would otherwise be.	96	9
201507	1068	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think that is how we want to think about it:  We want to have primacy for our policy rate normalization process, and, therefore, we want to push balance sheet policy into the background, which is fine.	96	9
201507	1069	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	And we do not want some type of tantrum, moving longer-term rates either higher or lower than they would otherwise be in response to unexpected changes in the Committee’s balance sheet policy stemming from an announcement that we might make that this would be forthcoming.	96	9
201507	1070	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Such an outcome would interfere with the intended effects of the Committee’s main policy normalization, which would be taking place through interest rate increases.	96	9
201507	1071	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	So, what’s the bottom line?	96	9
201507	1072	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The task for the staff, as I see it, is to devise a smooth state- dependent strategy for this Committee to use to manage the balance sheet down to a lower level.	96	9
201507	1073	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A simple version would be for the Committee to state that, provided the economy continues to make progress toward our goals, the Committee’s intention is to smoothly reduce the size of the balance sheet by a fixed amount—let’s say, $30 billion per month—at the appropriate time, but that the step size may be reduced if negative economic shocks occur and may be increased if positive economic shocks occur.	96	9
201507	1074	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This would presumably be close to the current market expectation and, therefore, would be unlikely to cause significant reaction in markets.	96	9
201507	1075	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Given the Committee’s past choices, the decision to change the pace of the manage-down would not be likely.	96	9
201507	1076	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	But it would be an important option if a major shock were to be encountered.	96	9
201507	1077	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	And surely if a major shock were encountered, probably the first thing we’d do is end reinvestment.	96	9
201507	1078	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I think you have to think about the ability to change the pace of “manage- down,” and I know several others around the table have said similar things.	96	9
201507	1079	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	As I see it, the “manage-down” would allow to MBS run off.	96	9
201507	1080	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The smoothing would be achieved by appropriately choosing Treasury securities purchases, sales, and reinvestment to achieve the given target, given the maturities on that particular month.	96	9
201507	1081	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is just one possible approach, but it gives us one example to look at.	96	9
201507	1082	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In summary, the balance sheet is a potent tool.	96	9
201507	1083	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It should be managed smoothly and in a state-dependent way.	96	9
201507	1084	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	One goal is to stay close to current market expectations concerning reinvestment, so that interest rate normalization is not derailed.	96	9
201507	1085	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A simple way to achieve these goals is to name a pace of reduction in the balance sheet itself but to retain the option to change that pace of balance sheet reduction in response to economic conditions.	96	9
201507	1086	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1087	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1088	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201507	1089	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1090	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I found this morning’s conversation regarding the thinking about this issue of halting or phasing out reinvestments very useful and interesting.	96	9
201507	1091	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought the discussion that once we reduce the balance sheet in size, there are big costs to reversing that reduction should really bear materially on our thinking about our policy in this space.	96	9
201507	1092	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One way I am thinking about it is that reducing the balance sheet, because we are reducing the amount of accommodation that would be in place when we hit the zero lower bound, is not that different from raising the effective lower bound itself.	96	9
201507	1093	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we hit the zero lower bound with a $4 trillion balance sheet, we have a certain level of accommodation in place.	96	9
201507	1094	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we hit the zero lower bound with only a $3 trillion balance sheet, we have considerably less accommodation in place.	96	9
201507	1095	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another way to think about that is, we should be comfortable lowering the balance sheet when we are comfortable with the idea of raising the effective lower bound.	96	9
201507	1096	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, a couple of us—President Rosengren and I—have talked about our concerns about hitting the zero lower bound even in the longer run.	96	9
201507	1097	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that makes you think about what our long-run goals for the balance sheet should be.	96	9
201507	1098	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we are sort of in this autopilot mode of thinking, “Boy, we should just get the size of the balance sheet back to 2005.	96	9
201507	1099	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That would be a good thing, because 2005 was a really good time.”	96	9
201507	1100	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, 2005 was only three years before 2008.	96	9
201507	1101	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And two before 2007.	96	9
201507	1102	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	96	9
201507	1103	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201507	1104	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201507	1105	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That was helpful.	96	9
201507	1106	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be thinking more systematically and deliberately about what we want our long- run balance sheet to look like.	96	9
201507	1107	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we are really averse in the longer term to the idea of ever increasing the size of the balance sheet because of the institutional or political risks that others have mentioned, I think that consideration really should shape our thinking about what that long- run balance sheet should be.	96	9
201507	1108	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think it should also be shaping our thinking about when to initiate the phaseout of reinvestments.	96	9
201507	1109	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will say a couple of words about that in a minute.	96	9
201507	1110	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The other point—and this has come up a little bit, but I’ll try to emphasize it a little more—is that the amount of accommodation associated with our balance sheet—the size and duration of our holdings—is not shaped by the rate of change of the size of our holdings.	96	9
201507	1111	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So when we think about reinvestments, I think it’s important to be doing that in terms of how they are affecting the size and composition of the balance sheet, not in terms of reinvestments per se.	96	9
201507	1112	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This probably matters the most in terms of mortgage-backed securities.	96	9
201507	1113	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Because they are redemptions, we are delivering pro-cyclical variation in accommodation.	96	9
201507	1114	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can imagine households and businesses becoming more pessimistic about the prospects for the economy, of interest rates falling, and of mortgage refinancing increasing.	96	9
201507	1115	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the mortgages underlying those securities in our portfolio are prepaid, our balance sheet shrinks at a faster-than-expected rate.	96	9
201507	1116	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we are removing accommodation exactly when we need it.	96	9
201507	1117	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we want to be careful in thinking about reinvestment not in terms of the flow of reinvestments, but rather in terms of how it is affecting the stock of holdings on the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	1118	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those are my high-level points.	96	9
201507	1119	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be thinking more about what our long- term goal is in terms of the balance sheet, especially in light of what I hear, which is a feeling of concern regarding, or aversion to, initiating a new asset purchase program.	96	9
201507	1120	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we need to carefully reformulate our reinvestment policy to serve our balance sheet policy.	96	9
201507	1121	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That long-term goal, as I hinted at earlier, really should not just be shaped by a desire to get back to normal times.	96	9
201507	1122	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be taking into account the fact that we a very bad outcome occurred that we didn’t anticipate, and we should be keeping in mind that, as we go forward, we might want tools to deal with that kind of outcome.	96	9
201507	1123	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to the questions—though, having said that, I suspect I won’t be answering the questions because I am not a rookie.	96	9
201507	1124	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I like the idea of a state-based approach.	96	9
201507	1125	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A lot of you have talked about the challenges in communicating effectively about a state-based approach.	96	9
201507	1126	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A couple of people—I remember President Mester doing this, and I think First Vice President Holcomb also mentioned this—suggested that we tie the initiation of phaseouts or reinvestments to the path of the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	1127	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we could announce very soon that the phasing out of reinvestments will begin when the target range of the federal funds rate hits X percent.	96	9
201507	1128	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, what should X be?	96	9
201507	1129	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I would disagree with some of the numbers I heard earlier.	96	9
201507	1130	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve heard people would be comfortable with numbers like 1 percent for the target for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	1131	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Remember what I said at the very beginning:  When would you be comfortable raising the effective lower bound for interest rates?	96	9
201507	1132	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe you’re comfortable with that prospect at 1 percent.	96	9
201507	1133	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I myself would not be.	96	9
201507	1134	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would think we would want a higher target range for the federal funds rate before we go through the relatively irreversible process of shrinking the size of the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	1135	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the staff could be helpful on this by giving us some simulations that would show us a probability of hitting the zero lower bound if we are at 1 or at 2 percent.	96	9
201507	1136	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that it could provide an analytical framework for the Committee to think through those matters.	96	9
201507	1137	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At that point, once we start, I would just announce that the evolution of phaseouts of reinvestments would depend on the evolution of the economy.	96	9
201507	1138	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, if you go with my 2 percent target range for the federal funds rate, that actually gives the Committee quite a bit of time to work on the details of the phaseout strategy.	96	9
201507	1139	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before you do that, though, I think a key part of that work is to settle as much as possible what the long- term vision for the balance sheet is.	96	9
201507	1140	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Rosengren mentioned that the Conference of Presidents’ Financial Stability Committee went through a tabletop exercise in which two of us saw that actually selling assets might be a useful way to respond to a particular financial stability risk.	96	9
201507	1141	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, if you want that as part of your vision, it should be affecting the size of your balance sheet.	96	9
201507	1142	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you are averse to ever buying assets again, that should be affecting the long-term size of your balance sheet.	96	9
201507	1143	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All of these things should be going into thinking about where you want to be headed.	96	9
201507	1144	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Focusing on the size and the composition of the balance sheet, focusing on the long-term goals, and not being comfortable with initiating reinvestments until such time as you are really comfortable with the idea of raising the effective lower bound on interest rates—those things should be connected in our thinking.	96	9
201507	1145	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1146	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1147	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201507	1148	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1149	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Narayana is quite right.	96	9
201507	1150	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	He, Eric, and a few other people over time have alluded to the possible desirability of an end state in which we have a larger balance sheet and one that may have different-duration securities in it.	96	9
201507	1151	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It feels like the next several meetings are going to be potentially full enough that we probably would not have enough time to debate something like that.	96	9
201507	1152	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But should we try to set, at some point, a discussion of that particular issue a little bit apart from the immediacy of decisions about liftoff?	96	9
201507	1153	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just say that the staff have embarked on a project that will concern our long-run framework and will take up these questions, and I planned at the end of the meeting to tell you a little bit more about that work plan.	96	9
201507	1154	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I think that is very important.	96	9
201507	1155	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The staff is thinking about it, and we hope this will be a project that will involve a lot of staff around the System.	96	9
201507	1156	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll be giving you a bit more information about what our expectations are.	96	9
201507	1157	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1158	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201507	1159	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1160	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I want to start by distinguishing between two things.	96	9
201507	1161	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	First, there is clearly a need to have a decent answer to the question of when reinvestments will end, and that need will ripen no later than the liftoff press conference.	96	9
201507	1162	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Second, there is the need to decide a whole range of questions about the exact timing, whether we do it all at once or taper, whether we distinguish between Treasury securities and MBS, and whether the taper is a complex or a simple one.	96	9
201507	1163	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	And most or all of that, I think—though we are talking about it today, and it will go into the minutes and season people’s thinking—is not ready to be decided and won’t be for some time.	96	9
201507	1164	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The way I think about this is that one of the purposes of the first statement, what will be said at the press conference, is to clear space and time to allow the normalization process to proceed and give the Committee the information it needs to make those decisions when they need to be made.	96	9
201507	1165	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Today the public seems to think that the Committee intends to wait somewhere in the range of 6 to 12 months before ending reinvestments either through a taper or perhaps all at once.	96	9
201507	1166	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The primary dealer survey suggests a reasonable likelihood that we would taper over the course of a year.	96	9
201507	1167	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Those are pretty reasonable parameters, they could be about right, but I don’t see how it is in the Committee’s interest to harden those expectations in the near term.	96	9
201507	1168	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’ll offer two reasons for caution.	96	9
201507	1169	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	First, the model shows only a very slight effect on rates from ending reinvestment.	96	9
201507	1170	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Actual effects may differ materially from those in the model.	96	9
201507	1171	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	And, as many have noted, I think we learned that lesson—and shouldn’t forget it—in the taper tantrum, when we sat around this table, and I don’t know that there were more people who thought it would be seen as a tightening move or not.	96	9
201507	1172	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I will speak for myself—I certainly didn’t see it as predicting the move that we saw in the summer of 2013.	96	9
201507	1173	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	These signaling effects are not in the model, and they can be very large or not.	96	9
201507	1174	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t expect that there would be much of a reaction from a decision to taper, but I don’t see any reason to take that risk unnecessarily.	96	9
201507	1175	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The second reason to wait is that I would really like to minimize the chances of ever having to vote again at the zero lower bound on asset purchases.	96	9
201507	1176	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I think both of those reasons argue for caution.	96	9
201507	1177	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I think there’s even a third reason that hasn’t been talked about as much, and that is, the situation has really changed since our earlier discussions on reinvestment.	96	9
201507	1178	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Specifically, the normalization process has slowed down.	96	9
201507	1179	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Liftoff is going to be later than expected, and the pace of increases is going to be slower.	96	9
201507	1180	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I looked back: The median interest rate forecast in the June 2014 SEP showed the policy rate at 1⅛ percent at year-end 2015 and 2½ percent at year-end 2016.	96	9
201507	1181	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Current expectations are far below that.	96	9
201507	1182	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, the reason why liftoff is later and the path is lower is that in June 2014, the central tendency for 2015 economic growth was 3.0 to 3.2 percent, compared with 1.8 to 2.0 percent in the June 2015 SEP.	96	9
201507	1183	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	What has happened is, as global economic growth has weakened, other central banks around the world have cut their rates to their effective lower bound, and they seem likely to remain there for several years.	96	9
201507	1184	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	They’ve also embarked on their own asset purchases.	96	9
201507	1185	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	And all of this is likely to limit significantly the speed with which we can depart from our own effective lower bound.	96	9
201507	1186	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	And unless and until global economic growth moves up significantly, we’re very likely to be forced into a shallow path for rate increases, which is risky but is still preferable to the alternative.	96	9
201507	1187	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t want balance sheet tightening to make that path any shallower, so it makes sense to me that balance sheet tightening should slow down, just like the other pieces of the normalization process.	96	9
201507	1188	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	As a result, when it becomes appropriate to clarify the Committee’s thinking on reinvestment, I would recommend the Committee stress that our focus for now is on the path of the federal funds rate and give only a much more general statement of conditions for shrinking the balance sheet.	96	9
201507	1189	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I would be clearly in the qualitative state-dependent camp.	96	9
201507	1190	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	An example would be, “The Committee expects to begin the process of normalizing the balance sheet when it is reasonably confident that the policy normalization process is well established,” which is very much along the lines of what the Chair, I believe, has said.	96	9
201507	1191	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I have no attraction to calendar-based guidance, nor do I have any attraction to quantitative state-based guidance along the lines of the thresholds that we used earlier.	96	9
201507	1192	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	When we do begin the balance sheet normalization process, I might prefer a phased-in approach to a sudden stop in reinvestments, and I might want to consider distinguishing between Treasury securities and MBS.	96	9
201507	1193	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I think all of those things are going to be informed by events after liftoff, and I find it very hard to have a thoughtful opinion on them until I see where the normalization process is.	96	9
201507	1194	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I will close by echoing President Lockhart’s earlier point about keeping it simple when it comes time to taper.	96	9
201507	1195	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1196	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201507	1197	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201507	1198	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1199	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The policy framework that we have agreed to over the past year is designed to make the federal funds rate the focal point for our policy stance and to make the IOER the primary instrument for influencing that rate, with the ON RRP a secondary tool.	96	9
201507	1200	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	That policy framework has the virtue of being clear and familiar to market participants and the public as well as empirically well understood.	96	9
201507	1201	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, we have far less experience and little quantitative research to guide us on how reductions in the size of the balance sheet away from the effective lower bound would translate into financial conditions.	96	9
201507	1202	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, while it is important to reduce the size of the balance sheet over time, I would not want to do so prematurely if that risked any sacrifice to the efficacy of our policy framework.	96	9
201507	1203	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I would prefer the ceasing of reinvestments to be conditioned on economic developments and based on quantitative rather than qualitative guidance.	96	9
201507	1204	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	There have been considerable time and effort over the past few meetings spent informing the public that monetary policy will be conditioned on economic developments.	96	9
201507	1205	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As reinvestments are an important component of policy, it would be confusing for guidance in this area to be conditioned on the calendar.	96	9
201507	1206	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Quantitative guidance would be clearer and more informative than qualitative guidance.	96	9
201507	1207	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	However, guidance based on one or more macroeconomic indicators would be, I think, problematic and confusing vis-à-vis the macroeconomic framework we have set out for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201507	1208	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The simple solution that others have alluded to is to base reinvestment policy on the federal funds rate, which parsimoniously summarizes the Committee’s view on all macroeconomic factors that influence the outlook for the labor market and inflation.	96	9
201507	1209	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In addition, conditioning on the federal funds rate maintains the focus on our primary policy tool, simplifying communications.	96	9
201507	1210	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	A further advantage is that it guarantees that changes in the IOER and the phaseout of reinvestments will be aligned with one another, minimizing any confusion that might arise from changes to one tool that are not coordinated simultaneously with changes in the setting of the other tool.	96	9
201507	1211	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Regarding the specifics of the guidance to be provided, my preference would be for our communication to state that an initial reduction in reinvestments would likely occur only after the federal funds rate has reached a range around 2 percent.	96	9
201507	1212	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	When rates get into that range, moreover, it may be useful to pause changes to the IOER in order to gauge the effect on financial conditions.	96	9
201507	1213	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The preferred range would be motivated, in my thinking, by several factors.	96	9
201507	1214	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	First, like many others around this table, I place a high priority on minimizing the risk that adverse economic developments cause a return to the zero lower bound.	96	9
201507	1215	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Maintaining investments until the federal funds rate is within more normal levels and comfortably above the zero lower bound would minimize that risk.	96	9
201507	1216	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Now, as we’ve discussed, the model-based analysis suggests that the direct effect of a delay in reinvestments—until the federal funds rate is within more normal levels—on the term premium and, through longer-term rates, on economic activity is likely to be quite small.	96	9
201507	1217	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I’m concerned about the signaling effects of an early change in reinvestment policy, which could produce larger effects than we anticipate.	96	9
201507	1218	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, one risk that I would want to keep in mind as we contemplate our reinvestment policy is the risk that longer-run rates behave in an unexpected way that complicates policy, as happened during the taper tantrum.	96	9
201507	1219	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thus, I prefer to wait on ceasing or tapering until it becomes clear that the headwinds that have limited economic growth to quite moderate levels despite extremely accommodative monetary policy have subsided.	96	9
201507	1220	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I recognize that agreeing to specific quantitative guidance may be difficult, and I’m open to qualitative alternatives such as the ones that have been stated around this table—possibly referring to a time when the federal funds rate returns to more normal levels, or referring to the wish to minimize the risk of a return to the zero lower bound, or simply referencing normalization.	96	9
201507	1221	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the difficulty, though, with any qualitative guidance is that market participants may well interpret it as much sooner or later that we intend, and it will immediately leave Committee members to face ongoing efforts to get us to further elaborate what precisely we mean by those qualitative conditions.	96	9
201507	1222	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In an abundance of caution, I would probably favor some phasing or tapering so as to avoid any possible effects on market function when the time comes.	96	9
201507	1223	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I might also be inclined to apply the phaseout of reinvestments symmetrically to MBS and Treasury securities, although I must say I’d be open to altering this policy if market conditions suggest it would be desirable to do so when we get to that point.	96	9
201507	1224	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Finally, I do favor communicating clearly our policy framework once these decisions have been made, but I would caution about how we reflect this discussion in the minutes, in order not to get ahead of the policymaking process.	96	9
201507	1225	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201507	1226	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, and thanks to everyone for a very rich discussion.	96	9
201507	1227	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think this has really been quite an interesting set of considerations we’ve discussed.	96	9
201507	1228	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	You’ve heard various suggestions about additional staff work that might be appropriate, and I think we will proceed by sitting down with the staff and trying to narrow down a few alternatives based on what we have heard around the table.	96	9
201507	1229	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not going to try to summarize the discussion; I think that probably would be a mistake at this point.	96	9
201507	1230	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I do hear some congealing of views, and I think we can probably narrow down the alternatives for your consideration and get back to you to have a further discussion on this matter.	96	9
201507	1231	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think this has been a really useful discussion, and I thank you for your thoughtfulness.	96	9
201507	1232	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s move along, then, to the fourth item on the agenda, which is “Potential Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections.”	92	9
201507	1233	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And I’d like to call on Governor Fischer to start us off on this topic.	92	9
201507	1234	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201507	1235	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee on communications consists of Loretta Mester, Jay Powell, John Williams, and myself, and we have been considering various enhancements to the SEP.	92	9
201507	1236	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Today we are coming to you with a fairly modest initial proposal, which mainly consists of adding medians to the SEP materials in September.	92	9
201507	1237	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I wasn’t here when FOMC participants considered SEP enhancements in January 2013, but the transcript suggests that adding medians of participants’ responses was the most popular of the proposed changes at that time.	92	9
201507	1238	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The subcommittee continues to think it’s a good idea, and I hope that most of you will think so, too.	92	9
201507	1239	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	You received a memo last week on this topic written by Todd Clark from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and Ellen Meade from the Board staff, who are sitting opposite us.	92	9
201507	1240	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	It was a short memo, as these memos go, and so perhaps you all had a chance to read it.	92	9
201507	1241	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201507	1242	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In a moment, Todd is going to review for you the subcommittee’s proposal and some of our ongoing work, and afterward we’ll have time for any remaining questions or suggestions you may have.	92	9
201507	1243	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Todd, please.	92	9
201507	1244	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Thank you, Governor Fischer.	92	9
201507	1245	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	I will be referring to the handout titled “Materials for Briefing on Potential Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections.”	92	9
201507	1246	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	That handout includes a first page that has an outline of my comments and then some graphics that correspond exactly to those included in the staff memo circulated to the Committee last week.	92	9
201507	1247	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	As Governor Fischer indicated, and as the cover memo from the subcommittee indicated, the subcommittee has identified two broad, promising enhancements to the SEP.	92	9
201507	1248	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The first is the addition of median projections, and the second would be the addition of fan charts to illustrate forecast uncertainty.	92	9
201507	1249	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	At this time, as I will detail, the subcommittee is recommending the addition of medians and one other change to the SEP, which concerns the federal funds rate projections in figure 2.	92	9
201507	1250	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The subcommittee intends to come back to the Committee later this year with a recommendation regarding fan charts, and I will conclude with a brief review of staff work on those fan charts.	92	9
201507	1251	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	In their current form, table 1 and figure 1 of the SEP provide the full range and the central tendencies for the macroeconomic variables that are included in the projections.	92	9
201507	1252	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	In the absence of a median or some other central value, public commentary has tended to focus on the midpoints of the central tendencies as measures of participants’ collective view of the outlook.	92	9
201507	1253	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Figure 2 of the SEP provides the “dot plot” for the federal funds rate.	92	9
201507	1254	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	This dot plot does not report a median projection, but it is pretty easy to identify the median projection, and public commentary makes some use of that median.	92	9
201507	1255	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Finally, in the full SEP materials that are published three weeks later along with the FOMC meeting minutes, figure 3 provides histograms for all the macroeconomic variables and the federal funds rate.	92	9
201507	1256	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	And from those histograms, medians can be computed for each of those variables.	92	9
201507	1257	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The basic rationale for including medians in the SEP would be to improve the Committee’s communications by providing, in a more direct way, a measure of participants’ collective view of the outlook and appropriate policy.	92	9
201507	1258	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The median is a robust statistical measure of the center of a distribution.	92	9
201507	1259	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	It is more standard than the midpoint of the central tendency that some of the public uses today.	92	9
201507	1260	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Publishing the median as a summary measure of the collective view would help illuminate that collective view and would foster the public use of that median in summarizing the Committee’s projections.	92	9
201507	1261	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	To incorporate medians, the subcommittee recommends revising both table 1 and figure 1 of the SEP.	92	9
201507	1262	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The proposed new table 1, which is shown on page 2 of the handout, adds columns that would provide the median projections.	92	9
201507	1263	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	It also includes the federal funds rate as a memo item and an expanded title that makes clear the conditioning of the projections on participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.	92	9
201507	1264	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Since we prepared these materials, President Lacker has offered a suggestion that the subcommittee believes to be helpful, and that would be the insertion of the word “projected” before “appropriate” in three places:  In the memo line, instead of “appropriate policy path,” it would be “projected appropriate policy path,” and then the same “projected appropriate” would appear in the first red sentence in the notes to the tables.	92	9
201507	1265	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The point of President Lacker’s suggestion was to emphasize the endogeneity of policy—that there is a reaction function, and policy will respond as the outlook changes, et cetera.	92	9
201507	1266	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The subcommittee believes that President Lacker’s suggestion will be a useful change.	92	9
201507	1267	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Finally, in terms of medians, in the proposed figure 1, which is shown on page 3 of the handout, thick red lines have been added to report the median projection in the case of each of the macroeconomic variables.	92	9
201507	1268	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The subcommittee recommends implementing these changes with the September 2015 SEP.	92	9
201507	1269	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The minutes of the July meeting will report on the discussion of medians that we are about to have, and those minutes could also review the proposed addition and its rationale, along with a summary of the discussion that occurs today.	92	9
201507	1270	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	If participants favor adding the median, then over the intermeeting period, staff will develop and provide complete mockups of the full set of materials—including tables, charts, and text—that would be warranted by the addition of medians.	92	9
201507	1271	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The other change to the SEP the subcommittee is recommending today concerns figure 2, which is shown in its current form on page 4 of the handout.	92	9
201507	1272	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The top panel provides a histogram of participants’ views on the appropriate year of liftoff.	92	9
201507	1273	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The bottom panel provides the dot plot.	92	9
201507	1274	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The start of normalization will make the top panel obsolete, and the subcommittee recommends removing that top panel at that time.	92	9
201507	1275	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The dot plot, on the other hand, in the bottom panel has been useful for communicating policy views in the period since policy has been constrained by the zero lower bound.	92	9
201507	1276	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Looking ahead, the subcommittee believes the dot plot is likely to remain useful for communicating policy and recommends retaining it even after we’re well away from the effective lower bound.	92	9
201507	1277	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Finally, the subcommittee believes that adding fan charts to the SEP would help communicate the considerable uncertainty that attends the Committee’s projections.	92	9
201507	1278	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	The staff is currently working on fan charts that would be centered on the median projections, with uncertainty bands constructed based on historical forecast errors from a range of public and private sources.	92	9
201507	1279	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Fan charts of this form would provide a quantitative illustration of the historical uncertainty that would complement the judgmental assessment of uncertainty that the SEP currently includes.	92	9
201507	1280	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Fan charts would likely be more effective for communicating the historical uncertainty than the root mean squared errors that are currently provided in a table in the SEP and thereby should help to reduce the public’s occasional confusion of forecast uncertainty with the range of views across FOMC participants.	92	9
201507	1281	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	In light of these potential benefits, the subcommittee plans to come back to the Committee with a concrete proposal later this year after resolving some technical issues, some of which require further investigation by the staff.	92	9
201507	1282	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	That concludes my prepared remarks.	92	9
201507	1283	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	Ellen and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.	92	9
201507	1284	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	92	9
201507	1285	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201507	1286	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I would like to thank Todd and Ellen for their work.	92	9
201507	1287	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	There are a lot of other staff members also involved in this project, and I want to thank them for that, as well as the subcommittee members.	92	9
201507	1288	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think the changes we’re proposing for our September Summary of Economic Projections are very small ones, and because of that they pose little announcement risk.	92	9
201507	1289	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	But I do think they are an enhancement to the SEP.	92	9
201507	1290	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	As Todd said, right now the midpoint of the central tendency is sometimes a focal point in the discussion of the SEP.	92	9
201507	1291	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And in lieu of actually constructing a consensus forecast—which is still one of my aspirational goals that I look forward to telling my great-great-great nieces about when it happens—I think the median is preferable to that central tendency midpoint.	92	9
201507	1292	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, we’re going to have to be clear that the median is not a consensus, but I think that’s easily done.	92	9
201507	1293	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And I think that would be a beneficial addition to the SEP.	92	9
201507	1294	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, regarding the top part of figure 2, as Todd said, when we lift off, it’s irrelevant at that point, it’s obsolete, and it should go.	92	9
201507	1295	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	But the dot plot, I think, has been proven to be a useful communications device.	92	9
201507	1296	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Stepping back from it would be considered a step back in transparency, which I don’t think would be helpful for the Committee.	92	9
201507	1297	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And I think it can prove to be useful in the future as well, depending on how the economy evolves.	92	9
201507	1298	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Finally, as Todd said, it’s important that we give a better sense of the degree of uncertainty surrounding the projections.	92	9
201507	1299	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We have table 2, but a picture can often be worth 1,000 words.	92	9
201507	1300	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think it could be an important enhancement to our communications.	92	9
201507	1301	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We all know that the divergence of views across participants is not the same thing as uncertainty, but we’ve seen discussions of this in the press and in the public in which that often is the way the public interprets the divergence of views.	92	9
201507	1302	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And so if we can think about a better way of doing that in terms of conveying uncertainty, I think it would be worthwhile.	92	9
201507	1303	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	As Todd indicated, the subcommittee is continuing to work through some technical issues involving fan charts to indicate confidence bands.	92	9
201507	1304	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	It’s important to know that other central banks have successfully used fan charts as a way of communicating uncertainty.	92	9
201507	1305	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So I and, I believe, the rest of the subcommittee hope that we can actually use them to enhance our own communications as well.	92	9
201507	1306	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The subcommittee intends to bring a concrete proposal to the Committee later this year.	92	9
201507	1307	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So I just want to say that I think these are important changes that pose little risk and can enhance communications.	92	9
201507	1308	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	92	9
201507	1309	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions or comments?	92	9
201507	1310	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201507	1311	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	92	9
201507	1312	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201507	1313	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with what President Mester just said.	92	9
201507	1314	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to thank her, the rest of the subcommittee, and the staff for bringing forward what will prove, I think, to be enhancements to the SEP that pose little in the way of announcement risk, which is a difficult needle to thread.	92	9
201507	1315	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think it has been done successfully here.	92	9
201507	1316	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a couple of minor comments.	92	9
201507	1317	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is about how we will characterize the medians in the minutes and other SEP documentation.	92	9
201507	1318	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The memo clearly recognizes that the new medians don’t represent a consensus view, but the language “collective view” is, I think, potentially risky.	92	9
201507	1319	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would prefer not to use the phrase “collective view.”	92	9
201507	1320	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To my ear, at least, the word “collective” suggests the Committee has worked together to reach this assessment of the evolution of economic conditions, but, in fact, it’s just a summary statistic of distinct perspectives.	92	9
201507	1321	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think “the midpoint of the range of views,”	92	9
201507	1322	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of fan charts, I have mixed views.	92	9
201507	1323	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree completely that the SEP’s range of projections is too often used inappropriately as an indicator of forecast risk, and so I think the idea of trying to use fan charts to mitigate that confusion is good.	92	9
201507	1324	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do think the fan charts that we propose are a sort of awkward hybrid of Committee views and external statistics.	92	9
201507	1325	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, I will note one thing that we are all asked when we submit our SEP responses:  Do you think that the range of uncertainty today is more or less than in the past 20 years?	92	9
201507	1326	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If many of us said “more” to that, then the fan chart itself is not reflective of that.	92	9
201507	1327	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t have a strong view about this, and I understand the gains that could be made here.	92	9
201507	1328	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will just say a couple of things.	92	9
201507	1329	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is that it may seem modest, but we want to be very careful taking any step like this, because it would be hard, I think, to remove anything from the SEP.	92	9
201507	1330	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And if fan charts are ultimately added, I think it has to be very clearly explained that these are just merely summaries of past data and not the perspectives of the Committee at all.	92	9
201507	1331	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I do applaud the subcommittee for coming up with these enhancements and, particularly in terms of the suggestions made for September, I am completely supportive.	92	9
201507	1332	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	92	9
201507	1333	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My thanks also to the subcommittee and the staff for moving forward on the SEP.	92	9
201507	1334	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ve thought for a long time that we could make some improvement.	92	9
201507	1335	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I do support publishing medians as well as the other proposed changes to table 1 and figure 2.	92	9
201507	1336	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I support making these changes with the next SEP submission and including notice of these changes in the minutes of this meeting.	92	9
201507	1337	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I also support removing the top panel of figure 2.	92	9
201507	1338	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	On the second question about the inclusion of fan charts, I’m more skeptical.	92	9
201507	1339	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not sure adding the proposed uncertainty bands would materially enhance the communications value of the SEP.	92	9
201507	1340	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m not sure there is widespread misunderstanding today that the SEP numbers are subject to a lot of uncertainty.	92	9
201507	1341	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I will wait to see the later construction of the fan charts, but my guess is that they may show very wide potential variance from the median of the projections.	92	9
201507	1342	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think, best case, this would provide information SEP readers already grasp, and, worst case, it would come across as hedging projections so much as to greatly dilute their seriousness.	92	9
201507	1343	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In earlier years, I sometimes used the expression “I am not entirely sure.”	92	9
201507	1344	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My late wife had a knack for cutting to the quick.	92	9
201507	1345	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	When I said, “I am not entirely sure,” she would respond, “You mean you don’t know.”	92	9
201507	1346	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	92	9
201507	1347	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The fan chart idea brought back that memory.	92	9
201507	1348	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As an alternative, if I were a market participant or an outside consumer of the SEP, what I would find useful is information on FOMC participants’ forward-looking, subjective assessments of uncertainty.	92	9
201507	1349	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ve discussed this before, and I still think it’s worth an internal experiment.	92	9
201507	1350	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We collectively have experience in generating simple subjective probability distributions from survey data.	92	9
201507	1351	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The Desk’s primary dealer survey, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of household inflation expectations, and my own Bank’s business inflation expectations survey come to mind.	92	9
201507	1352	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I can support further work on adding some kind of uncertainty overlay on the SEP projections, but I’d like to see that work include an option to generate, as I said, forward-looking, necessarily subjective uncertainty measures concerning the specific forecasts in the SEP.	92	9
201507	1353	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think something like this would be useful to market participants and the public.	92	9
201507	1354	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201507	1355	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Can I ask a clarifying question?	92	9
201507	1356	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Do you mean something like a histogram?	92	9
201507	1357	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So each respondent would write down their histogram of the probability of outcomes?	92	9
201507	1358	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Something along those lines.	92	9
201507	1359	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	92	9
201507	1360	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	92	9
201507	1361	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Sorry—because I have not participated in this discussion before, is the fan chart supposed to be around the median or around each individual projection?	92	9
201507	1362	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Around the median.	92	9
201507	1363	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I don’t really understand the mathematical properties of transposing some kind of uncertainty from other forecasts onto a median that itself comes independent of the broader set of macroeconomic projections.	92	9
201507	1364	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I would just want to see more on the mathematical properties of that before we considered it.	92	9
201507	1365	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201507	1366	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	This says that on the basis of the many forecasts that have been made in the past by various experts, this is roughly the size of the error bands going ahead that we have experienced in the past.	92	9
201507	1367	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	This is a typical range of uncertainty that you see from economists.	92	9
201507	1368	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And that’s all it says.	92	9
201507	1369	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But it’s around a median as opposed to a projection?	92	9
201507	1370	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s around a median.	92	9
201507	1371	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	You could put it around each person if you want, assuming they are all typical people.	92	9
201507	1372	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	That would make more sense.	92	9
201507	1373	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, the Blue Chip is a consensus forecast.	92	9
201507	1374	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The SPF has a median forecast that they publish.	92	9
201507	1375	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And often the calculation we are doing is looking at the forecast errors of the median SPF.	92	9
201507	1376	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So if you think about it that way, we treat the median SPF as a forecast, even though it is no individual’s forecast.	92	9
201507	1377	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We calculate the error bands around that and talk about forecast accuracy that way.	92	9
201507	1378	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I mean, that’s how we talk about it.	92	9
201507	1379	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	These are individual point estimates of that forecast, right?	92	9
201507	1380	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	They’re unconnected to each other, right?	92	9
201507	1381	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	92	9
201507	1382	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	So I think it’s different.	92	9
201507	1383	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	92	9
201507	1384	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I think that having some measure like this could well be an advance.	92	9
201507	1385	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I think there are probably opportunities to make adjustments to how we calculate this over time.	92	9
201507	1386	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think this rises to the level that it would be a really big deal if, a few quarters ahead or years ahead, we altered how we did these calculations and explained it very carefully.	92	9
201507	1387	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I doubt that the size of the bands would vary a lot.	92	9
201507	1388	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But at any rate, I just wanted to indicate that I could easily support this type of fan chart.	92	9
201507	1389	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201507	1390	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I will just wait until the end.	92	9
201507	1391	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The one issue I’ve always had on these fan charts is whether the fan charts are just based on an unbiased average history or are conditioned on where you are in the business cycle.	92	9
201507	1392	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think that is a more substantive choice, because I personally believe that you really want to condition it on all of the available information you have at the time.	92	9
201507	1393	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But that’s a much bigger exercise in terms of calculating these fan charts.	92	9
201507	1394	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	At the subcommittee level, that has come up as something that the staff should look into.	92	9
201507	1395	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	For example, you might think of the unemployment rate:  If you are already at 5 percent, do you really think it can go to 3 percent?	92	9
201507	1396	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	You might want to have that kind of conditionality or asymmetry.	92	9
201507	1397	2015-07-29	meeting	CLARK	So that would be on the to-do list at the staff level.	92	9
201507	1398	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would favor a fan chart on that basis much more than one that is unconditional with regard to where you are in the business cycle, because in the latter case I think you get answers that are not very sensible at times.	92	9
201507	1399	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer, did you want to add something?	92	9
201507	1400	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, just a few things.	92	9
201507	1401	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	When we said there are technical problems, there are two sets of technical problems.	92	9
201507	1402	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	One has already been hinted at, which is that the SEP already includes a question to FOMC participants on whether you think the risk is up or down.	92	9
201507	1403	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We are trying to figure out if we can get a graphical representation of that, so you can see why that is a technical problem.	92	9
201507	1404	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The second problem relates to the question, how do you draw the fan charts for variables like the unemployment rate, which tend to have a lower bound, which is zero.	92	9
201507	1405	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And typically these things all go out like that, and they take you out into the zero range.	92	9
201507	1406	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So we’ve got to figure out a way of dealing with that as well.	92	9
201507	1407	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Those are technical issues which no doubt have a solution.	92	9
201507	1408	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And this was President Lockhart’s point regarding our uncertainty about the projections.	92	9
201507	1409	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I certainly agree with the things President Evans said.	92	9
201507	1410	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We are already trying to figure out how to deal with the problems that we see with using the fan charts.	92	9
201507	1411	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But if I can just drop a personal hint about how I began to believe the width of these fan charts: I used to tell Mervyn King regularly, up to 2007, that his fan charts were much too wide.	92	9
201507	1412	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And then came the great financial crisis.	92	9
201507	1413	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	They were much too narrow, it turned out.	92	9
201507	1414	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So that is how I got to think that maybe there is something to this widening out that you see.	92	9
201507	1415	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201507	1416	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Just a suggestion on the first problem you mentioned, and I think others have mentioned this.	92	9
201507	1417	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We do respond about what uncertainty is, and how large uncertainty is now relative to some historical benchmark.	92	9
201507	1418	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The natural way to communicate would be to supply error bands or fan charts based on that.	92	9
201507	1419	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	And then you’ve got, in the back of the SEP, how the Committee thinks about it relative to that.	92	9
201507	1420	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	92	9
201507	1421	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any further comments?	92	9
201507	1422	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	92	9
201507	1423	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201507	1424	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In terms of the Committee’s suggestion that we make the enhancement that involves including the median and the revised table in September, I have heard several people comment in support.	92	9
201507	1425	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard no one express opposition, but I would like to get a clearer read on sentiment in the Committee.	92	9
201507	1426	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We normally do not decide things like changing the SEP by a vote, but what I would like to do is take a straw poll of all of the participants.	92	9
201507	1427	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The minutes can then express the degree of support.	92	9
201507	1428	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me ask all of the participants to raise your hand if you support the changes that are proposed for September.	92	9
201507	1429	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	92	9
201507	1430	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201507	1431	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any opposed?	92	9
201507	1432	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201507	1433	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	92	9
201507	1434	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will put these changes into effect in September.	92	9
201507	1435	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The minutes will explain what’s going to happen in September and what the Committee has agreed on so it will not come as a surprise in the press conference.	92	9
201507	1436	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And we look forward to the subcommittee coming back with more on fan charts.	92	9
201507	1437	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Ellen.	92	9
201507	1438	2015-07-29	meeting	MEADE	There was also the change to figure 2.	92	9
201507	1439	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, yes, and I take it there is also agreement that, whenever we lift off, we get rid of the top part of figure 2.	92	9
201507	1440	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Only for the most obstinate amongst us.	92	9
201507	1441	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	“We increased it, but it was a mistake.”	92	9
201507	1442	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Well, I’ll be gone.	92	9
201507	1443	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	92	9
201507	1444	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	92	9
201507	1445	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We are now going to turn to the economic and financial situation, and let me call on David Wilcox to start us off on our briefings.	11	1
201507	1446	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201507	1447	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the packet titled “The US Outlook.”	11	1
201507	1448	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Our view of the macroeconomic situation has not changed very much since the time of the June meeting.	11	1
201507	1449	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	As shown in panel 1 of your first exhibit, we continue to think that real GDP growth stepped up in the second quarter, partly reflecting some unwinding of its very weak first-quarter performance.	11	1
201507	1450	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Even with the rebound, we estimate that GDP growth over the first half of the year averaged only a subpar 1 percent at an annual rate.	11	1
201507	1451	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	During the second half of the year, and as in the June projection, we see GDP growth running in the neighborhood of 2 percent.	11	1
201507	1452	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	By the end of the medium term, the level of real GDP in our projection is slightly lower than in the June Tealbook, reflecting a stronger exchange value of the dollar and slower expected growth of state and local spending.	11	1
201507	1453	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	The incoming labor market data have also been broadly in line with our June forecast.	11	1
201507	1454	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Although the June unemployment rate—figuring into the second-quarter average shown in panel 2—was one-tenth lower than we had anticipated, the labor force participation rate also surprised us to the downside, leaving the employment-to-population ratio close to our previous projection.	11	1
201507	1455	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Likewise, recent gains in private payrolls have come in about as expected.	11	1
201507	1456	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	As we noted in the Tealbook, the combination of the June decline in the unemployment rate and the slightly weaker outlook for real GDP, all else being equal, would have left us showing no further reduction in the unemployment rate between last month and the end of 2017—an outcome that, in our view, would not have balanced the risks associated with our unemployment rate forecast.	11	1
201507	1457	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	To better balance the risks, we made some small adjustments to our supply-side assumptions.	11	1
201507	1458	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	In particular, we lowered our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment 0.1 percentage point, to 5.1 percent.	11	1
201507	1459	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	We also trimmed our forecast for potential output growth 0.1 percentage point per year, and we did not let that latter adjustment show through into our outlook for aggregate demand.	11	1
201507	1460	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Taken together—and holding everything else equal—these two adjustments generate a forecast for the unemployment rate that is 0.2 percentage point lower than it otherwise would have been.	11	1
201507	1461	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Half of that amount reflects a tighter economy, and half reflects a better- functioning labor market.	11	1
201507	1462	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	The argument for a lower natural rate is bolstered by the continued aging of the labor force.	11	1
201507	1463	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Although we had recognized a potential role for demographics for some time, until now we have been wary about letting their effect show through too strongly to our post-recession natural rate estimates.	11	1
201507	1464	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Panel 6, which uses the JOLTS data to plot a version of the Beveridge curve, suggests why:  Since the previous business cycle peak, this version of the Beveridge curve has shifted out—a development that could be taken as evidence that labor market functioning had been persistently damaged by the Great Recession.	11	1
201507	1465	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	But we have also been influenced by recent analysis by two Board economists—	11	1
201507	1466	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Andrew Figura and David Ratner—that provides some evidence that the outward shift in the Beveridge curve may not have coincided with an increase in the natural rate.	11	1
201507	1467	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	In fact, they argue that if the large secular decline in labor’s share of income has been due to a reduction in the bargaining power of workers, then the natural rate might actually be similar to levels seen before the crisis despite the outward shift in the Beveridge curve.	11	1
201507	1468	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	In other words, the Figura/Ratner analysis casts greater doubt on one of the considerations that had been impeding us from marking down the natural rate.	11	1
201507	1469	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Regarding the amount of slack that remains to be taken up at present, panel 3 provides updated estimates of three different measures of resource utilization that we follow.	11	1
201507	1470	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	The dotted blue line shows the judgmental estimate that is reflected in the Tealbook baseline.	11	1
201507	1471	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	The red line gives the production-function variant of the output gap from the EDO model, which is one of our DSGE models.	11	1
201507	1472	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	And the black line— labeled FRB/US—plots an estimate of slack that pools the information from a number of production, labor market, and price indicators while explicitly allowing for measurement error.	11	1
201507	1473	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Both the Tealbook and EDO point estimates suggest that resource utilization has nearly returned to its sustainable position, while the FRB/US estimate suggests that it is already there.	11	1
201507	1474	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Meanwhile, the substantial confidence interval around the FRB/US values strongly suggests that precision is not the greatest hallmark of these estimates.	11	1
201507	1475	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to prices, as you can see from panel 4, we have revised down our near-term forecast for total PCE inflation.	11	1
201507	1476	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Virtually all of this revision reflects a sharper expected decline in consumer energy prices over the second half of this year that, in turn, results from the recent step-down in oil prices.	11	1
201507	1477	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Although the exact timing of the pass-through from oil prices to retail energy prices is uncertain, our best estimate is that we will see some noticeable declines in gasoline prices over the next few months.	11	1
201507	1478	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	For core inflation—panel 5—the incoming data have been broadly in line with our expectations.	11	1
201507	1479	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Next year and in 2017, our projections of both total and core inflation rates are little changed from June.	11	1
201507	1480	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, I asked Jeremy Rudd to prepare an additional exhibit that provides a high- level summary of the information that will be available to you at your September, October, and December meetings.	11	1
201507	1481	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Incidentally, I think of this as taking up a challenge that President Lockhart issued a few meetings ago to try to envision more concretely the information set that would be available to the Committee.	11	1
201507	1482	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Specifically, the data releases that will be available at the September FOMC meeting are in the blue-shaded region, the incremental releases that will have become available by the time of the October meeting are in the yellow-shaded region, and the observations that will be available for your December meeting are shown in red.	11	1
201507	1483	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, we’ve indicated the readings that would be consistent with our baseline forecast.	11	1
201507	1484	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see, for the September meeting, you will have PCE inflation data through July—though the August CPI will be released on the first day of the meeting—and labor market data through August.	11	1
201507	1485	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	October will afford you just one more reading on each of these monthly indicators.	11	1
201507	1486	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	And December will give you two more beyond that.	11	1
201507	1487	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	On the real activity front, we expect to see continued solid payroll gains at a pace that, on average, is not too different from the average seen over the first half of this year.	11	1
201507	1488	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	One thing I would note, however, is that based on recent historical experience, there is some risk that the initial August reading on payroll employment growth will be softer than we’ve penciled in as our expectation for the underlying reality and will then be revised up in subsequent months.	11	1
201507	1489	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Last year, for example, job gains in August were initially estimated at 142,000, a figure that was revised up to 203,000 in the subsequent two releases.	11	1
201507	1490	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	More generally, over the past five years, the initial estimate for August has been revised up 75,000 on average.	11	1
201507	1491	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	On the inflation side, we expect the data readings you will have in hand to stay low even through the time of the December meeting.	11	1
201507	1492	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	In the baseline forecast, we now have the three-month change in total PCE prices stepping down noticeably after the September meeting, reflecting the projected energy price declines I mentioned earlier.	11	1
201507	1493	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Core inflation is expected to run slightly below 1½ percent, with the three-month changes expected to be held down some by residual seasonality, which looks to us to weigh most heavily on core inflation in the latter part of this year.	11	1
201507	1494	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Having shown you these values that would be consistent with our baseline forecast, I hasten to note that however murky you may perceive the message of this exhibit to be, the message of the actual incoming data could be a good deal murkier.	11	1
201507	1495	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	The reason is because those incoming data will contain all the features that real-world data have, including measurement error, seasonal adjustment problems, mutual inconsistency, normal random variation, and even substantive departures from our current baseline forecast.	11	1
201507	1496	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Steve will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201507	1497	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, David.	11	1
201507	1498	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	I will be referring to the materials titled “The International Outlook.”	11	1
201507	1499	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	To continue the reference to annoyances, one of the annoyances of summer driving—say, to the beach or mountains on a holiday weekend—is traffic jams.	11	1
201507	1500	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	It’s especially annoying when, for no apparent reason, traffic grinds to a halt, trudges over the next mile and a half at a glacial pace, and then, with no car crash or other distraction in sight, mysteriously speeds back up again.	11	1
201507	1501	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	We’ve had much the same feeling watching developments in Greece.	11	1
201507	1502	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	At the time of your most recent meeting, negotiations between Greece and its creditors had been moving forward, albeit quite contentiously.	11	1
201507	1503	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Then talks broke down, the banks were closed, a payment to the IMF was missed, and Greek voters resoundingly rejected the creditors’ proposals.	11	1
201507	1504	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But then, after marathon all-night negotiations, Greece’s Prime Minister Tsipras agreed to even stricter austerity measures than voters had rejected the week before.	11	1
201507	1505	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And as suddenly as they stopped, talks on the adjustment and financing program started up again.	11	1
201507	1506	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Details of the program are still being hammered out, but it looks to provide up to €85 billion in loans over three years, conditional on the government implementing a broad array of fiscal and structural reforms.	11	1
201507	1507	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Most of the money won’t stay in Greece.	11	1
201507	1508	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although on the order of €25 billion will be used to recapitalize the badly damaged banking system, nearly €55 billion goes out the door to service earlier loans from the IMF and European creditors.	11	1
201507	1509	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Even with this assistance, Greece will likely be required to run primary budget surpluses—that is, budget balances excluding interest payments—of 1½ percent of GDP in the next two years, rising to 3½ percent in 2018.	11	1
201507	1510	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	This burden will be very difficult to bear, considering that Greek GDP—panel 1— will almost certainly plummet this quarter, and that the current government is far from committed to the austerity measures it has promised.	11	1
201507	1511	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, Greece will almost certainly run into problems fulfilling the program’s conditions over the next few years, leading to further difficulties with its creditors and potentially even to the outcome that Greece just narrowly avoided: its exit from the euro area.	11	1
201507	1512	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	While the developments of the past month have further worsened Greece’s outlook, they’ve had little effect on prospects for the euro area more generally.	11	1
201507	1513	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon has described, financial markets outside Greece were little affected.	11	1
201507	1514	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And indicators of euro-area economic activity have generally pointed to continued recovery.	11	1
201507	1515	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 2, we’ve marked down economic growth ¼ percentage point in the third quarter, but that solely reflects the arithmetic effects of Greece’s deep contraction on euro-area GDP.	11	1
201507	1516	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Beyond the near term, we’ve actually boosted the forecast a touch to reflect lower oil prices and the weaker euro exchange rate.	11	1
201507	1517	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But there remains a question of whether Greece’s debacle may have weakened confidence in the resilience of the monetary union and rendered it more vulnerable to subsequent disturbances.	11	1
201507	1518	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The answer is not obvious.	11	1
201507	1519	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	On the one hand, it is reassuring that spillovers from the Greek turmoil were so muted.	11	1
201507	1520	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, the disorganization and disunity evidenced by European authorities, as well as their resistance to directly address the sustainability of Greece’s debt, may bode poorly for the region’s response to future crises.	11	1
201507	1521	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Furthermore, the recent deterioration in Greece’s economic and financial situation has likely diminished its chances for normalizing its situation within the euro area.	11	1
201507	1522	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	In addition to Greece, of course, the correction of the Chinese stock market— panel 3—has attracted considerable attention in recent weeks.	11	1
201507	1523	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But here, too, the sound and fury signified relatively little for our forecast.	11	1
201507	1524	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	To begin with, the fall in equity prices didn’t reveal any fundamental underlying weaknesses that we did not already appreciate.	11	1
201507	1525	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The downturn after the prior surge in stocks looks like a classic example of a bursting bubble.	11	1
201507	1526	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, because of the relatively small weight of the Chinese stock market in household wealth, corporate financing, and overall financial assets, we do not believe the correction will weigh heavily on China’s future economic growth prospects.	11	1
201507	1527	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	It also bears noting that Chinese stock prices remain well above last year’s levels, though this may, in part, reflect government actions to support the market.	11	1
201507	1528	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, China’s financial system is exposed to a number of significant vulnerabilities, including weakened property markets, extremely high debt levels, and a shadow banking sector that remains opaque and poorly regulated.	11	1
201507	1529	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, it is possible that the stock market crash could trigger a chain reaction of margin calls, fire sales, and defaults that leads to broader financial and economic disruptions.	11	1
201507	1530	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But that does not strike us as the most likely scenario.	11	1
201507	1531	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	In our baseline forecast, Chinese GDP growth, having bounced up to nearly 8 percent in the second quarter, moderates over the remainder of the forecast period, in line with declining potential output growth.	11	1
201507	1532	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although the recent developments in neither Greece nor China made a strong imprint on the outlook, the tone of foreign economic activity appears a little weaker than we had previously assessed.	11	1
201507	1533	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 4, economic growth in both the emerging market economies and advanced foreign economies had fallen sharply in the first quarter, but at the time of the June Tealbook—the dashed lines—we had assumed growth would rebound in the second quarter.	11	1
201507	1534	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, recent data on trade, production, and PMIs have been considerably weaker than we’d anticipated, and we have lowered our near-term projections of real GDP growth accordingly.	11	1
201507	1535	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	We still judge most of these downdrafts to be temporary.	11	1
201507	1536	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	In particular, output in Canada, which occupies a large trade weight in our foreign aggregate, was partly depressed by wildfires and maintenance shutdowns in the energy sector.	11	1
201507	1537	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And already, June PMIs have moved up.	11	1
201507	1538	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Therefore, we have foreign economic growth rebounding in the coming quarters, and our medium-term outlook is little changed.	11	1
201507	1539	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, indicators of economic activity and trade came in softer than we expected for many countries besides Canada, and we remain attuned to the risk that the first-half pothole may turn into a more extended slowdown.	11	1
201507	1540	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The continued weak tone of foreign activity likely contributed to a number of developments affecting the US economy, as Simon has described.	11	1
201507	1541	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, as shown in panel 5, oil prices fell $11 per barrel over the intermeeting period, though the decline also reflected still-high levels of oil production and expectations for a step-up in Iranian oil exports following the completion of the nuclear deal.	11	1
201507	1542	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Second, as shown in panel 6, the dollar rose further, likely reflecting continued focus on the divergence between monetary policy prospects in the United States and abroad.	11	1
201507	1543	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The rise in the dollar since last summer has been an important factor weighing on the outlook for US net exports and, thus, on economic activity.	11	1
201507	1544	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, I thought I’d spend a few minutes explaining how we devise our trade forecast and why we are predicting so much drag from the dollar.	11	1
201507	1545	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in your next exhibit, at the heart of our forecast is a model composed of a number of equations for the main categories of exports and imports of goods and services.	11	1
201507	1546	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	These equations explain the evolution of these trade volumes based on movements in their fundamental drivers: foreign and US GDP and real exchange rates.	11	1
201507	1547	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	They are econometrically estimated using more than 35 years of quarterly data, and they are simulated using staff forecasts for the explanatory variables.	11	1
201507	1548	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	These model projections are then augmented by historical trends and judgmental forecasts for several additional trade categories.	11	1
201507	1549	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The bottom line is that, based on our trade model, we assess that a 10 percent rise in the broad real dollar should lead to a deterioration in the contribution of net exports to US GDP of 1.7 percent.	11	1
201507	1550	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Importantly, our econometric estimates identify significant lags in the transmission of the dollar to US trade, so this 1.7 percent drag takes place over a period of three years.	11	1
201507	1551	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The middle panel of your exhibit compares the actual evolution of the net export contribution to US GDP growth (the solid black line) with our model projection, decomposed into the part coming from the dollar (the blue bars), US and foreign GDP (the green bars), and our separate forecast for the volume of oil imports (the purple bars).	11	1
201507	1552	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Looking at the far right of this chart, notice that our forecast of the net export drag coming from the dollar in 2015 and through 2017 totals about 2 percentage points.	11	1
201507	1553	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	This drag essentially reflects the 1.7 percent elasticity coming from our trade model that I mentioned earlier, combined with a rise in the broad real dollar since last summer amounting to 12 percent, as shown in the bottom panel.	11	1
201507	1554	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Turning to the historical portion of the chart, our model does a reasonably good job of tracking previous periods of large dollar appreciation and net exports deterioration as well as periods of dollar depreciation and trade improvement.	11	1
201507	1555	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	The erratic swings in net exports since the global financial crisis have been difficult to track, but we see no evidence that the basic behavior of net exports has shifted significantly from earlier years.	11	1
201507	1556	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Nellie Liang will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201507	1557	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Thank you.	11	1
201507	1558	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	My briefing summarizes the staff’s current assessment of US financial stability.	FS	FS
201507	1559	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I’ll be referring to charts in the handout titled “Financial Stability Developments.”	FS	FS
201507	1560	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The picture is largely unchanged from last quarter, though we have nudged up the level of vulnerabilities stemming from asset valuation pressures and business sector leverage.	FS	FS
201507	1561	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	These vulnerabilities, however, continue to be counterbalanced by relatively high levels of capital and moderate levels of maturity transformation in the financial system.	FS	FS
201507	1562	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	On net, we judge the vulnerability of the financial system as a whole to be in the moderate range, a level determined relative to metrics covering roughly the past 30 years.	FS	FS
201507	1563	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The remainder of my briefing provides some detail on this overall assessment.	FS	FS
201507	1564	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the top-left panel, capital and liquidity positions of bank holding companies are substantially higher than in the period preceding the crisis, increasing the stability of the core of the financial system.	FS	FS
201507	1565	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Common equity tier 1 capital, the red line, has been about unchanged over the past year even as implementation of Basel III has led to a rise in risk-weighted assets.	FS	FS
201507	1566	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, firms have built up their ratio of high-quality liquid assets, the black line, and now most meet their new, fully phased- in liquidity requirements.	FS	FS
201507	1567	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In the nonbank sector, signs related to leverage are mixed.	FS	FS
201507	1568	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Dealers’ net borrowing for fixed-income securities, the blue line in the right panel, has continued to decline to a very low level, and capital ratios, not shown, have been rising.	FS	FS
201507	1569	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	On the other hand, margin debt for equities as a share of GDP is at a record level, and responses to the SCOOS, the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey, and conversations with market participants indicate wider use of “synthetic prime brokerage” arrangements by hedge funds, suggesting some pickup in off-balance-sheet leverage.	FS	FS
201507	1570	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	On net, though, we judge that vulnerabilities from the overall financial-sector leverage to be at a below-average level.	FS	FS
201507	1571	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As Simon discussed earlier, the imprint of recent financial stresses related to Greece and China on the US financial system has been limited.	FS	FS
201507	1572	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the middle-left panel, five-year CDS spreads of large US financial institutions were mostly unchanged.	FS	FS
201507	1573	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The muted response to the financial turmoil in Greece is in sharp contrast to the situation in late 2011, when Greek debt problems had escalated, likely reflecting currently lower direct exposures and, potentially, a smaller shock from Greece related to beliefs that European authorities will take actions to stem contagion.	FS	FS
201507	1574	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The current reactions also likely reflect the considerably stronger financial positions of firms that are connected directly or indirectly to one another.	FS	FS
201507	1575	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	A major vulnerability in the previous crisis was the scale of short-term wholesale funding used to finance longer-term risky assets.	FS	FS
201507	1576	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	An aggregate measure of runnable money-like liabilities, shown in the middle-right panel, has fallen significantly from its peak in 2008 as amounts outstanding for most instruments, such as repo and MMFs, have shrunk.	FS	FS
201507	1577	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, there has been important progress to address key structural problems, such as the SEC’s rulemaking to remove the NAV rounding from institutional prime MMFs, and the near-elimination of intraday credit in the triparty repo market.	FS	FS
201507	1578	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	That said, the full effects of the MMF reforms are still to be seen.	FS	FS
201507	1579	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Recently, many market participants have expressed concerns about reduced bond market liquidity—that is, they are not able to transact in reasonable quantities when they want to at reasonably low and predictable costs.	FS	FS
201507	1580	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	A recent staff assessment of transactions in corporate bonds and Treasury securities does not support a significant deterioration in market functioning, but the picture for the resilience of liquidity is somewhat mixed.	FS	FS
201507	1581	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Two representative indicators are shown in the bottom-left panel.	FS	FS
201507	1582	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown by the black line, bid-asked spreads for corporate high-yield bonds have been trending down and are relatively low.	FS	FS
201507	1583	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	At the same time, the share of trades that are greater than $1 million, the red line, has declined, indicating average transaction sizes are now smaller.	FS	FS
201507	1584	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In the Treasury market, the recently issued interagency study on the October 15 event detailed a sharp decline in market depth in the narrow event window but did not identify a specific cause for the volatility.	FS	FS
201507	1585	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, it showed that trading volumes were very high, pricing was continuous, and cash and futures markets stayed aligned.	FS	FS
201507	1586	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	It also highlighted that firms employing proprietary high-frequency trading strategies accounted for more than one-half the transactions, and traditional broker-dealers accounted for about one-third of transactions on typical days in 2014, indicating important structural changes in the provision of liquidity.	FS	FS
201507	1587	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	One often expressed reason for heightened concerns about market liquidity is the increase in mutual fund holdings of corporate debt, including relatively illiquid loans and bonds, shown in the lower-right panel.	FS	FS
201507	1588	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The concern is that the offer of daily cash redemptions by open-end mutual funds provides a first-mover advantage for investors to exit ahead of others, who would be left to bear the costs of asset sales.	FS	FS
201507	1589	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Thus, a fall in bond prices could lead to greater-than-expected redemptions and to an increase in price volatility.	FS	FS
201507	1590	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The staff are working (along with the FSOC and FSB) on these possible effects, but they currently believe they would likely not have significant spillovers in the absence of leverage by bond investors.	FS	FS
201507	1591	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The next exhibit starts with asset valuations, an area where we have seen some pressure in some sectors based on indicators being notably above their averages of recent decades.	FS	FS
201507	1592	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Asset valuations are tracked because compressed risk premiums could suggest a higher risk of a sharp drop in prices and a potential systemic risk if interacted with other vulnerabilities, such as high leverage and maturity transformation.	FS	FS
201507	1593	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	They also are an indicator of investor risk appetite because much risk-taking behavior is not easily observable or quantifiable.	FS	FS
201507	1594	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the top-left panel, corporate bond yields remain near historical lows, reflecting, in part, low term premiums on Treasury securities.	FS	FS
201507	1595	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Spreads also are narrow, though they rose a bit last year as risks for energy firms increased when oil prices fell.	FS	FS
201507	1596	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Low rates have supported strong issuance of high-yield corporate bonds and leveraged loans, as shown in the lower-right panel, and outstanding debt had been risen rapidly.	FS	FS
201507	1597	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, as we have noted in the past, underwriting standards such as debt-to-earnings multiples have been relatively loose, though public data indicate the credit quality of loans has improved this year.	FS	FS
201507	1598	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In commercial real estate, prices have been rising rapidly in the past three years, and the capitalization rate—the rent-to-price ratio, shown by the black line in the middle-left chart—has been falling to a level last seen in 2007.	FS	FS
201507	1599	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, CMBS issuance, the bars in the panel, have been picking up.	FS	FS
201507	1600	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Combined with CRE loans at banks, the ratio of total CRE debt to GDP is above average but has not yet accelerated.	FS	FS
201507	1601	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Competition among lenders reportedly is leading to a weakening of standards, and loan-to-value ratios and the share of interest-only loans in CMBS pools appear to be rising.	FS	FS
201507	1602	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	At commercial banks, lending standards have been easing, on balance, for the past few years, and supervisors have started to increase their monitoring of this sector.	FS	FS
201507	1603	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In the equity markets, forward price-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 and for small cap stocks, shown in the middle-right panel, have edged off their recent highs but are above their historical averages.	FS	FS
201507	1604	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The equity risk premium, not shown, has continued to decline but is not unusually narrow, largely reflecting the low interest rates.	FS	FS
201507	1605	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Turning to the nonfinancial sector, as shown in the bottom-left panel, real credit growth to households and businesses has been picking up, but this masks distinct trends in the business and household sectors.	FS	FS
201507	1606	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	With the business sector having emerged from the crisis in solid shape, credit has been available on favorable terms for many years, and debt has grown rapidly for the riskier part of the corporate sector.	FS	FS
201507	1607	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the debt-to-asset ratio for speculative-grade corporations, the red line, has increased to near-record levels.	FS	FS
201507	1608	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	This ratio is also rising for all nonfinancial corporations, shown by the black line, though debt service burdens are low, held down by low rates and high earnings.	FS	FS
201507	1609	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In contrast, many households have been continuing to work down their debt, and loan balances are rising only modestly.	FS	FS
201507	1610	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Household debt-to-income ratios, measured at the county level, have moved down significantly in recent years and have yet to turn around.	FS	FS
201507	1611	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In summary, the largest financial firms are now more resilient, and credit for businesses and households is supported by more stable and less complex funding than before the crisis.	FS	FS
201507	1612	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	These developments are central to our overall assessment that the financial system is only moderately prone to amplify shocks.	FS	FS
201507	1613	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	That said, rising debt burdens for riskier businesses, elevated valuations, and loosening lending standards for many assets point to some building pressures and may warrant additional attention if current trends were to persist.	FS	FS
201507	1614	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In addition, bearers of liquidity risk in the corporate bond market appear to have shifted from highly leveraged firms, the banks and broker-dealers, to much less leveraged entities, such as private funds.	FS	FS
201507	1615	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	This shift, in principle, could be stability enhancing, on balance, but raises questions about the resilience of liquidity and possible spillover effects.	FS	FS
201507	1616	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	For markets more broadly, including both corporate and Treasury securities markets, the staff currently are studying potential changes in the incentives for the provision of liquidity, including changes in technology, disclosure practices, and dealers’ business models because of regulations or changes they may have made on their own to their risk-management practices.	FS	FS
201507	1617	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	That concludes our prepared remarks, and we’d be happy to take your questions.	FS	FS
201507	1618	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Thank you.	FS	FS
201507	1619	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for David, Steve, or Nellie?	12	1
201507	1620	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	12	1
201507	1621	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Nellie, I have two questions for you.	12	1
201507	1622	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	First, I want to say that I can actually see changes over time in the QS reports, and I find them very useful, so I appreciate the staff work on that.	12	1
201507	1623	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	One question I have concerns the fact that market participants are telling us that there are liquidity problems in the fixed-income market, and yet our measures really don’t seem to be picking that up.	12	1
201507	1624	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I know we can’t rely too much on anecdotes, but I’m wondering whether they are informing us about our measures being off.	12	1
201507	1625	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	How should we think about that?	12	1
201507	1626	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	How does the staff think about that?	12	1
201507	1627	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And the other thing I noticed in the report is that it talks about how, after the leveraged loan guidance was put out, there doesn’t seem to have been a switch from banks doing it into the nonbank sector.	12	1
201507	1628	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I’m wondering whether that’s telling us something about the guidance, that perhaps banks aren’t paying attention to the guidance.	12	1
201507	1629	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And this is important because Presidents Rosengren and Kocherlakota talked a little bit about the tabletop exercise that we had done on financial stability, and guidance was one of the tools that we said would be a potentially useful tool.	12	1
201507	1630	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	But if it’s not working, or we don’t think it’s going to be working, then we may have to rethink the efficacy of that tool.	12	1
201507	1631	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I’d just like the opinion of the staff on that.	12	1
201507	1632	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Let me speak with regard to market liquidity first.	12	1
201507	1633	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The measures we have, and the ones we have tracked over time, are about transactions that have actually occurred.	12	1
201507	1634	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	So what you don’t observe is a transaction that someone might have wanted to take had they been able to execute at a price they wanted, for example.	12	1
201507	1635	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We are trying to build data that might give you a better look.	12	1
201507	1636	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	For instance, regarding market depth, if you actually have order books and you could see for a typical transaction size how far into the order books you had to go to transact, that might give you better sense of how much there is.	12	1
201507	1637	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We were able to actually see a lot in the October 15 report, which was able to get a lot of detail on the order books at, I think, millisecond units of time.	12	1
201507	1638	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I don’t think we have to go to milliseconds to observe what’s happening in, say, corporate bond markets, but there are more and better data that we’re pursuing.	12	1
201507	1639	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think there are important issues related to why provisional liquidity would have changed, and maybe just understanding the motivations better might be able to help us as well.	12	1
201507	1640	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We hear it everywhere.	12	1
201507	1641	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The data aren’t that supportive, but we’re open to the discussions.	12	1
201507	1642	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	On the leveraged loan guidance, we’ve been tracking that very carefully for migration.	12	1
201507	1643	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	One of the big concerns about guidance was that if you just told the banks they couldn’t do this, the activity would migrate.	12	1
201507	1644	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	What we did was break down the market a little bit into big loans— say, over $100 million—and then what we call the middle market.	12	1
201507	1645	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And for the large loans, there’s less migration.	12	1
201507	1646	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And it could just be that banks need to have size to be able to provide the revolvers associated with $100 million loans.	12	1
201507	1647	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We’ve seen market shares of nonbank firms move from around 7 percent to 10 percent, back to 8 percent—they jump around—and the next tier of investment banks haven’t really gained substantial share.	12	1
201507	1648	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In the middle market, it’s very possible they’re gaining more share.	12	1
201507	1649	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	That’s very hard to track.	12	1
201507	1650	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Business development companies and private equity funds can do some direct lending, but they tend to be much smaller loans.	12	1
201507	1651	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The business development companies are also much less levered than the banks who might provide the loans.	12	1
201507	1652	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think from a financial stability perspective, it might be better.	12	1
201507	1653	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	It is hard to tell.	12	1
201507	1654	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In our view, there continues to be a lot of issuance.	12	1
201507	1655	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Capital is available.	12	1
201507	1656	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The underwriting standards are getting better.	12	1
201507	1657	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think, at least while we’re in the midst of it, it’s hard to know whether it’s been successful, but it seems like it’s gone in the right direction.	12	1
201507	1658	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So what I’m hearing you say is, it’s effective on the banking side, and it doesn’t have the unintended consequences of shifting things.	12	1
201507	1659	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Not yet.	12	1
201507	1660	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Over long periods, say two or three years, it’s possible that the industry could transform and change their practices, and they could pick up the activities of the larger banks.	12	1
201507	1661	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	But it’s not immediate.	12	1
201507	1662	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	12	1
201507	1663	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201507	1664	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would like to echo President Mester’s comment.	12	1
201507	1665	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I find that these QS reports are very valuable.	12	1
201507	1666	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We discuss them quite a bit at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and I’ve seen significant improvement in these over time.	12	1
201507	1667	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The staff should get a lot of credit for that.	12	1
201507	1668	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In our bank’s discussions  last week, I was struck by the radar chart.	12	1
201507	1669	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s in the back of your QS memo.	12	1
201507	1670	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s one of the cooler charts coming out of the Board these days.	12	1
201507	1671	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But besides talking about how it’s cool and knowing that it’s called a radar chart, I wanted to actually ask you for your perspective on this.	12	1
201507	1672	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the text of the QS report, in your judgmental assessment of various parts of this, you actually comment that it might be somewhat different from the quantitative part, but I just want to focus on the quantitative part for this purpose.	12	1
201507	1673	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The radar chart basically breaks out financial stability risk for the financial sector, the nonfinancial sector, and risk appetite/asset valuations.	12	1
201507	1674	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	What’s really striking about your assessment, both this time and for some time before this, is that the heightened risk assessments are all with regard to this asset valuation/risk appetite, and there’s essentially none on the quantitative side regarding the financial-sector vulnerability.	12	1
201507	1675	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, again, in the qualitative discussion in the text, you go into that in a little bit.	12	1
201507	1676	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But the question I have for you is—if you were to roll back time and think about 2006 when, in this radar chart, you show everything is dangerous, we should have known that things were about to explode.	12	1
201507	1677	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To what extent are there hidden aspects of vulnerabilities in the financial system that our quantitative measures somehow don’t see or don’t capture and that, years later, when the thing blows up on you, you say, “Oh, yes, sure.	12	1
201507	1678	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There were a lot of short- term wholesale funding problems.	12	1
201507	1679	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There was a lot of interconnectedness.”	12	1
201507	1680	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t even think the word “interconnectedness” was in our vocabulary in 2006.	12	1
201507	1681	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m asking a serious question about the real-time use of this versus the ex post description of things.	12	1
201507	1682	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	How much confidence do you have that our financial sector has essentially no vulnerability on its own today?	12	1
201507	1683	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That last one was an easy one.	12	1
201507	1684	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	As you know, the radar chart uses time-series data—what you can capture in quantitative data and what you ex post now go back and look at.	12	1
201507	1685	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	If we were to use just this, we might assign a level of vulnerability to the financial system a notch lower than we are— which is, say, moderate, which is in the middle of the range—because, as you say, everything here except for asset values is as low as it’s been.	12	1
201507	1686	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	There are a couple of reasons we don’t.	12	1
201507	1687	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	There are things that I don’t think you can capture in time-series data, so we apply judgment.	12	1
201507	1688	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	One is bank leveraging, for example.	12	1
201507	1689	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think with hindsight we know that capital was too low before.	12	1
201507	1690	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Right now we’re double that, but is that enough?	12	1
201507	1691	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We don’t really know, so we’re withholding judgment on it.	12	1
201507	1692	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	There are also structural issues that don’t get captured in time-series data.	12	1
201507	1693	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	For example, a money market fund vulnerability to runs is very difficult to capture here.	12	1
201507	1694	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Perhaps we’ve addressed that one.	12	1
201507	1695	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	But liquidity transformation is a different risk that we’re hearing about and evaluating and that you can’t capture here.	12	1
201507	1696	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And the one that I probably worry most about is the off-balance-sheet leverage, which is really hard to see.	12	1
201507	1697	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Derivatives markets have changed a lot since the 1980s, and we just haven’t been able to capture that in this yet.	12	1
201507	1698	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Those are a couple of the reasons why we wouldn’t just take this and say this is our assessment.	12	1
201507	1699	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	But it’s useful because it does force you to think about, well, where are you relative to, say, the 1980s?	12	1
201507	1700	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	If you didn’t see structural problems or missing data problems, you might just be able to use this.	12	1
201507	1701	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If I may follow up:  I’ve lived through the 2000s.	12	1
201507	1702	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We all have.	12	1
201507	1703	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We lived through these various bubbles, and if you were to do a real-time, Orphanides-esque exercise about these quantitative measures—and I know you didn’t construct these in 2006—but if you went back and looked at the memos and the analysis that was done, I’m guessing that a lot of these things weren’t even on the chart.	12	1
201507	1704	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And so I worry that there are things that aren’t on the chart today that are really the biggest dangers.	12	1
201507	1705	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I look at something that says it’s all clear, I feel like it’s because we’re not looking, somehow, at the things that just aren’t on the radar, if you will.	12	1
201507	1706	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And with that quip, I’m going to end.	12	1
201507	1707	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But a lot of what Nellie and her office do though, I think—Nellie, correct me if I’m wrong—is to go in and look at where leverage, funding vulnerability, or both are rising, particularly rising at rates that are much larger than historical averages.	12	1
201507	1708	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And then they dig into those.	12	1
201507	1709	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	What you see is the end result of all their analysis.	12	1
201507	1710	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So I think, President Williams, part of what you’re getting in that radar chart is the gross conclusion based on a lot of more discrete inquiries they’re doing along the way that all factor into those gross answers.	12	1
201507	1711	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, there’s no guarantee that they or we or anybody else are picking up on every one of those hidden vulnerabilities you see, but I think there’s some sort of filtering concepts that they, and the people at OFR, and a lot of others who are trying to make it their business to identify financial stability problems in advance are now using to begin the analytics that they engaged in.	12	1
201507	1712	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Is that fair?	12	1
201507	1713	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Well said.	12	1
201507	1714	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Thank you.	12	1
201507	1715	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yes—whenever you defend the staff, they say that was very good.	12	1
201507	1716	2015-07-29	meeting		[Laughter]	12	1
201507	1717	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	The situation in 2005 to 2007 wasn’t that hard to see.	12	1
201507	1718	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	You had to try very hard not to see it.	12	1
201507	1719	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It was seen.	12	1
201507	1720	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s just that people didn’t do anything about it.	12	1
201507	1721	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	12	1
201507	1722	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201507	1723	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A question for Steve Kamin, to interpret your explanation of the exchange rate sensitivity of net exports and their effect on real GDP growth a little bit in a grander way.	12	1
201507	1724	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	When the dollar began to appreciate a little more than a year ago, a back-of-the-envelope guesstimate that I would have made was that a significant amount of our trade is cross-border with Mexico and Canada, a back-and-forth, supply chain sort of trade, which is not necessarily sensitive to an exchange rate.	12	1
201507	1725	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Another big piece of it is agricultural that sells into markets that are dollar denominated.	12	1
201507	1726	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Mining is also conceivably in that category.	12	1
201507	1727	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And then airplane orders are placed well in advance.	12	1
201507	1728	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I would have guessed then that we didn’t have an economy very sensitive to exchange rate movements, or less than some other countries.	12	1
201507	1729	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And yet, in the first quarter, we saw net exports have a pretty significant effect, and your projection, I think, shows a pretty significant effect on economic growth for a 10 percent appreciation.	12	1
201507	1730	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Could you just elaborate a little bit more?	12	1
201507	1731	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	When you step back, what have you learned about the US economy from this process?	12	1
201507	1732	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	I think you are entirely right that the more your trade involves these two- way trades, with inputs going back and forth, that, all else being equal, ought to diminish the effect of exchange rates, at least on gross trade flows.	12	1
201507	1733	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	It will not necessarily diminish their effect on trade balance, because, again, these things are going back and forth.	12	1
201507	1734	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But all else being equal, you might expect some reduced effect of exchange rates on trade the more of your trade is of the two-way type, and the less of it is non-two-way trade in, for example, finished goods.	12	1
201507	1735	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Now, a couple things.	12	1
201507	1736	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, we have been very keen to try to ascertain whether our model estimates, which are basically estimated over a sample that goes back to the 1970s in some cases, in some sense apply less now than they did before.	12	1
201507	1737	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And the short answer is that we are not convinced that they are less applicable, though we are parsing some evidence that goes in different directions.	12	1
201507	1738	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	If you take a look at the charts, looking at the years 2010 through 2014, it doesn’t look like our model has gone tremendously awry.	12	1
201507	1739	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	But at the same time, it doesn’t seem to be fitting as well as in previous episodes.	12	1
201507	1740	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Second, it is true that if you estimate our trade models over some more recent samples—say, starting in 2000—then you do get somewhat smaller elasticities.	12	1
201507	1741	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	On the other hand, you don’t get particularly improved performance, in a robust sense, in tracking changes in the trade balance over this period.	12	1
201507	1742	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And we think that a lot of what is going on is that the global financial crisis so disrupted trade flows—it led to this huge decline in trade, followed by very sharp rebounds, that our model couldn’t capture—and that is part of what’s at play.	12	1
201507	1743	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	So, we are alert to the possibility that the structure of trade has changed over time, but we are not convinced we see enough of that in the data to merit reducing our elasticities of the response of trade to the dollar.	12	1
201507	1744	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	Now, directly to that issue, our model embodies responses of exports and imports to changes in the dollar that are not particularly outsized, and broadly speaking are in the neighborhood of what you will find in the literature.	12	1
201507	1745	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And I would note that, as a rule of thumb, macroeconomists often assume that trade responses, or any type of demand responses to prices, are of a unit elasticity.	12	1
201507	1746	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	So if the price goes up 1 percent, the demand goes down 1 percent.	12	1
201507	1747	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And we often make those assumptions in our trade models, too.	12	1
201507	1748	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, our model incorporates features such that when the dollar goes up 10 percent, exports fall by 7½ percent.	12	1
201507	1749	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	That implies a responsiveness of trade to the dollar that is actually less than 1.	12	1
201507	1750	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	And on the import side, we have even smaller responses to a change in the dollar.	12	1
201507	1751	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	So the merits of further compressing those trade responses don’t seem great.	12	1
201507	1752	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	You raise a question that we are definitely in the process of wrestling with.	12	1
201507	1753	2015-07-29	meeting	KAMIN	For now, we think the trade responses that we have built in are about right, but we are certainly going to be looking into this further.	12	1
201507	1754	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	12	1
201507	1755	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201507	1756	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	This is for David Wilcox.	12	1
201507	1757	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	You went through page 1 of 2 very systematically, and I was waiting for the Beveridge curve, but it seemed to fall off the page.	12	1
201507	1758	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Tell us what we see there and where it’s going.	12	1
201507	1759	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll take that question.	12	1
201507	1760	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	The chart shows that the Beveridge curve for the JOLTS vacancy rate has shifted out.	12	1
201507	1761	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	Ordinarily one would think of a shift out in the Beveridge curve as indicative of a decline in matching efficiency, and we had built that in.	12	1
201507	1762	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	One of the reasons we hadn’t lowered our natural rate was because we were taking some signal from that, offsetting the downward pressure on the natural rate that arises from demographic changes in the labor force.	12	1
201507	1763	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	So what David was referring to was that Andrew Figura and David Ratner on our staff have put forward an argument that the outward shift in the Beveridge curve may not be reflective of an increase in the natural rate of unemployment if it instead is due to a decline in worker bargaining power, as perhaps evidenced by the decline in the labor share over the past decade or so.	12	1
201507	1764	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	In that case it is more profitable for firms to post a vacancy because the labor share is lower, and they get more of the profits from any additional employee.	12	1
201507	1765	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	And that would push up the equilibrium level of vacancies relative to any unemployment rate.	12	1
201507	1766	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	That is roughly the story that David was trying to illustrate with the Beveridge curve.	12	1
201507	1767	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	That it has shifted out.	12	1
201507	1768	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	Previously, we had interpreted that as consistent with a decline in matching efficiency or an increase in the natural rate.	12	1
201507	1769	2015-07-29	meeting	WASCHER	But maybe there is another story that leads us not to take as much signal from that outward shift.	12	1
201507	1770	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	12	1
201507	1771	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201507	1772	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wanted to follow up on the conversation that President Williams started on the radar chart.	12	1
201507	1773	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that you are trying to assess financial-sector vulnerability, and your ability to do that, though, is only as good as the metrics that you have on the right-hand side of the column.	12	1
201507	1774	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I wanted to ask a question on, how do you think about things like legal risk, which has obviously gone up dramatically, or cyber risk, which has gone up dramatically?	12	1
201507	1775	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And when would that rise to the level that you would put that in the radar chart?	12	1
201507	1776	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Because it seems like those are two really big risks that have emerged in the past few years that weren’t significant before.	12	1
201507	1777	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And this is not a criticism.	12	1
201507	1778	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that what you guys are doing is great.	12	1
201507	1779	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It is state-of-the-art, as far as I am concerned.	12	1
201507	1780	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But how do you think about something like that?	12	1
201507	1781	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Behind this are a number of indicators—around 40.	12	1
201507	1782	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	First, cyber risk is not on here.	12	1
201507	1783	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We think of that not as a financial vulnerability.	12	1
201507	1784	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	It is more of an operational risk, which isn’t on here.	12	1
201507	1785	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Legal risk is on the border of that, but, in principle, you could catch that with bank leverage or the bank capital ratios.	12	1
201507	1786	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Do you incorporate?	12	1
201507	1787	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Are they holding capital sufficient for legal or operational risks?	12	1
201507	1788	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And so on.	12	1
201507	1789	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Things that we currently do in the stress test, we try to capture some of that at this point.	12	1
201507	1790	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And so, to the extent we can put that in here in a quantitative way, we do so.	12	1
201507	1791	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We don’t have a time series on that, though, so my guess is, it’s not well captured in here, which is also why this is just a backstop, and we don’t stop here.	12	1
201507	1792	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, one way to get at this a little bit is, you have some very large banks that are still selling at a discount, their book value.	12	1
201507	1793	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And I find that interesting.	12	1
201507	1794	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In an environment in which the stock market is at a multiple of book value, you have these big financial institutions that are still very depressed.	12	1
201507	1795	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That might be something to think about.	12	1
201507	1796	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Yes.	12	1
201507	1797	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	Can I offer just a brief bit of context on what this radar chart is?	12	1
201507	1798	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	And, Nellie, maybe you and I can have a little dialogue back and forth, and we’ll get it straight between the two of us.	12	1
201507	1799	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	My understanding is that a rough way to see what is going on here is to think of this radar chart as, in ever-so-rough terms, analogous to, say, the FRB/US or the EDO model.	12	1
201507	1800	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	It is an algorithmic approach, which I think is used to inform what might be called the analogue to the judgmental staff assessment of financial stability.	12	1
201507	1801	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think there were many staff members who were very excited about putting this radar chart methodology together, but the exercise was not to supplant all of the judgment of the human beings that are involved in the QS process, but rather to say, “Okay, look, what could we do if we had a little bit of an expert system, or a very algorithmic approach based on quantitative indicators?	12	1
201507	1802	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	And let’s just gain some real-time experience with how well or poorly that performs.”	12	1
201507	1803	2015-07-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s a little like the status of the FRB/US model with regard to the judgmental economic outlook.	12	1
201507	1804	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Right.	12	1
201507	1805	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The FRB/US model, though, has a lot of structural modeling elements.	12	1
201507	1806	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	This, in contrast, is pretty statistical.	12	1
201507	1807	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Just to be clear, “algorithm” covers a broad range of approaches.	12	1
201507	1808	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	But that’s exactly right.	12	1
201507	1809	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201507	1810	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201507	1811	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201507	1812	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to ask, on the financial- stability report, the valuation pressures are described as “notable,” but a lot of that seems to be driven—and you can certainly correct me if I am wrong on this—by the fact that term premiums are so low.	12	1
201507	1813	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Risk premiums themselves don’t seem that high.	12	1
201507	1814	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, in fact, you could make an argument that housing looks undervalued in some sense.	12	1
201507	1815	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At least the risk premiums on housing look very high, if you were to try to look at where the price-to-rent ratios are relative to longer- term risk-free yields.	12	1
201507	1816	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My question is, what made you come down on the side of thinking about the valuation pressures being “notable” as opposed to simply noting that term premiums remain remarkably low?	12	1
201507	1817	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	When we say “most asset valuation pressures,” we exclude residential housing.	12	1
201507	1818	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	12	1
201507	1819	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201507	1820	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think in the corporate sector—commercial real estate—there are rising prices and rising capitalization rates, et cetera, even relative to low spreads, at least in the high- yield bond sector.	12	1
201507	1821	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In conjunction with that, we see the weakening of underwriting standards.	12	1
201507	1822	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	So it is just looking at the prices plus looking at what investors are willing to pay for something.	12	1
201507	1823	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And are they willing to give something up just to get an asset that is yielding them something a little higher?	12	1
201507	1824	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	This is based on underwriting standards, quantitative factors that we can assess, conversations with market participants, and the actual metric.	12	1
201507	1825	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	So it has some of that.	12	1
201507	1826	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In that sense, we have it.	12	1
201507	1827	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	In the CRE space, we are seeing the decline.	12	1
201507	1828	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	And we hear a lot of discussions about rising LTVs, shopping for ratings on the CMBS—the kinds of things that make you think people are taking a little bit more risk than they had been for a while.	12	1
201507	1829	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	12	1
201507	1830	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I have a question for Nellie as well, so obviously your report was one that was well read this time around.	12	1
201507	1831	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And it is a follow-up to what Loretta asked about highly leveraged loans.	12	1
201507	1832	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	When we think about financial-stability risk, both amounts and distribution matter.	12	1
201507	1833	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And when you look at the league tables for who is underwriting the highly leveraged loans, there have been some dramatic changes.	12	1
201507	1834	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And, specifically, there is a fairly large broker- dealer who didn’t used to be on the league tables who is now much more significant on the league tables for doing highly leveraged lending.	12	1
201507	1835	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It isn’t in a bank holding company, and it is supervised by the SEC.	12	1
201507	1836	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So I wonder how we think about how people are moving up and down the league tables for some of those markets that we think are critically important, and whether there is some way to also capture some of that concentration of risk that may be moving out of the regulated sector into the unregulated sector, particularly with a supervisor that may not be as focused on financial stability.	12	1
201507	1837	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I just want to make sure everybody is clear.	12	1
201507	1838	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Very little of this stuff is held on the balance sheet of regulated institutions.	12	1
201507	1839	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	What Nellie’s charts are showing is the originations of this stuff—but, Nellie, you have to help me here, because you haven’t done a recent detailed briefing on this—most of which is being held by quite nonleveraged institutions.	12	1
201507	1840	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And so I actually don’t think, as we have looked at this, that we have seen it as a financial stability risk, as conventionally understood, so much as, instead, a potential macroprudential risk because of what would happen to the real economy if there were an awful lot of bankruptcies, which then carried through into affecting the end investors.	12	1
201507	1841	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There is a warehousing risk.	12	1
201507	1842	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	There is warehousing, but to date that has not been big issue.	12	1
201507	1843	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Right.	12	1
201507	1844	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I think the supervisory guidance and the lessons from 2008 are still fresh enough that they’re managing the pipeline risk.	12	1
201507	1845	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	We’ve been looking at the league tables for loans over $100 million.	12	1
201507	1846	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	The largest nonbank entity—which is an SEC-supervised broker- dealer, I think, if we’re referring to the same entity—its shares have held constant between around 3 and 4 percent.	12	1
201507	1847	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Is that what you’re referring to?	12	1
201507	1848	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	I still see the top 10 as being standard bank holding companies.	12	1
201507	1849	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	When you talk to private equity and ask them who they are going to get their bids from, that broker-dealer seems to be the broker-dealer of choice.	12	1
201507	1850	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Right.	12	1
201507	1851	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	It had a 4 percent share in 2014 and 3 percent in each of the first two quarters.	12	1
201507	1852	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	So it clearly is there as an alternative, and it hasn’t really moved up the ranks over the past couple of years as much as we had maybe thought it could.	12	1
201507	1853	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	Again, these are league tables that give the share to the primary bookrunner.	12	1
201507	1854	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	It’s possible that others might participate more than they used to.	12	1
201507	1855	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	This is just one way to look at it.	12	1
201507	1856	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	So, for the large loans, where we are now, the way we’ve been thinking about it is that the ability to provide some backup revolver limits the ability for nonbanks to be the primary lead.	12	1
201507	1857	2015-07-29	meeting	LIANG	For middle-market loans, where a smaller fund could take it and distribute it, then it’s possible these kinds of firms can join.	12	1
201507	1858	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201507	1859	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for comments on financial stability—not a full go-round—and I have two people who indicated they would like to make comments.	FS2	
201507	1860	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me start with President Rosengren.	FS2	
201507	1861	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201507	1862	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I thought it might be useful to give a brief discussion of the financial-stability tabletop exercise conducted by the Financial Stability Committee of the Conference of Presidents in Charlotte in June.	FS2	
201507	1863	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The purpose was to obtain a better understanding of how the nexus of monetary policy and supervisory policy tools could be used in a scenario in which financial stability issues were emerging.	FS2	
201507	1864	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The exercise was based on the assumption that decisions were being made in 2017.	FS2	
201507	1865	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	At that time, the scenario that was assumed was that the economy had attained both elements of the dual mandate and the economy was expected to remain at full employment and 2 percent inflation in the absence of any changes to our monetary policy stance.	FS2	
201507	1866	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The staff provided forecasts for both macroeconomic variables using Tealbook discussions as well as developments in financial markets.	FS2	
201507	1867	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The scenario also included signs of emerging financial instability.	FS2	
201507	1868	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Specifically, the scenario included a rapid rise in real estate values, significant growth in the shadow banking sector, and increased risk-taking by non-SIFI financial intermediaries.	FS2	
201507	1869	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The discussion of the scenario and possible policy responses highlighted the important role of both governance issues and time lags in many of the potential supervisory policy responses.	FS2	
201507	1870	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In part because of these governance complications and the lags in supervisory implementation, some committee members thought that monetary policy tools should be considered to address the concerns about future financial stability, even though doing so would result in a less optimal macroeconomic outcome.	FS2	
201507	1871	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Other members wanted to use supervisory tools and margin requirements but did not necessarily rule out using a monetary policy tool at some later point.	FS2	
201507	1872	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The exercise was useful in crystallizing potential financial-stability problems and the complexity of responding to those problems.	FS2	
201507	1873	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’ve shared the materials with Governors Fischer and Tarullo and think it might be worthwhile considering such an exercise for the full Committee at some future date.	FS2	
201507	1874	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	FS2	
201507	1875	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201507	1876	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	FS2	
201507	1877	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201507	1878	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Actually, my remarks will build on President Rosengren’s.	FS2	
201507	1879	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was one of the members of the committee who did think that monetary policy might be a useful response to the situation that was crafted by the staff.	FS2	
201507	1880	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that in mind, I think that this Committee, the FOMC, should begin to thinking about recording its assessment of financial stability conditions on an ongoing basis in the FOMC statement itself.	FS2	
201507	1881	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we do think there is a chance that, in the future, the FOMC will feel the need to adjust the stance of monetary policy in response to financial-stability risks—and President Rosengren described the very plausible contingency that the New York and Boston Reserve Bank staffs helped frame for the Conference of Presidents’ Financial Stability Committee that seemed to have that feature—and if we think we’re going to be adjusting the stance of monetary policy in that context, then I think it means that we have to, as a Committee, start to say something about how we’re assessing financial-stability contingencies on an ongoing basis.	FS2	
201507	1882	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So what would that look like?	FS2	
201507	1883	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think what it could look like is adding a sentence about financial stability conditions to paragraph 1.	FS2	
201507	1884	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One way to at least start that discussion would be to simply restate the QS report’s assessment that overall financial system vulnerabilities are moderate.	FS2	
201507	1885	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Alternatively, and like the QS report, the new sentence could also mention that there are notable vulnerabilities in valuation pressures.	FS2	
201507	1886	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we were to add such a sentence today or tomorrow in the FOMC statement, you would add a sentence to paragraph 1 that would read, “In the Committee’s assessment, financial system vulnerabilities were moderate.”	FS2	
201507	1887	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You could stop there, or you could add a second clause saying “with notable vulnerabilities associated with valuation pressures in certain asset classes.”	FS2	
201507	1888	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is just a one-sentence description of what we would be seeing in the financial system in terms of financial stability risk.	FS2	
201507	1889	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t think we want to wait until the moment when it turns out that financial system vulnerabilities are really high so we’re going to raise rates to start to record that in the FOMC statement.	FS2	
201507	1890	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I doubt that the Committee will feel comfortable going forward with this in this meeting, but I certainly encourage building toward that kind of formulation in the statement itself.	FS2	
201507	1891	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201507	1892	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201507	1893	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	FS2	
201507	1894	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	FS2	
201507	1895	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, on the tabletop exercise, it was a really good tabletop exercise because it wasn’t obvious what the right policy solution was supposed to be, and people had quite a bit of disagreement.	FS2	
201507	1896	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So it shows there’s a lot of nuance here in terms of figuring out how to use monetary policy versus macroprudential tools.	FS2	
201507	1897	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That was really very useful.	FS2	
201507	1898	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to talk a little bit about Puerto Rico, which is in our District.	FS2	
201507	1899	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The Tealbook had a box on it, which I thought was quite good.	FS2	
201507	1900	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think this is likely to be a very messy process because there is no bankruptcy option currently available for the territory of Puerto Rico or for its public corporations.	FS2	
201507	1901	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Puerto Rico officials are seeking, with the support of the Administration, legislation that would provide a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing option.	FS2	
201507	1902	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This could either be narrow, which is what the Administration would support—in other words, it would just apply as a public corporation, such as PREPA, which is the government power company—or broad, which is what the commonwealth would prefer, and that would apply to all of the commonwealth’s obligations.	FS2	
201507	1903	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But the hurdle to even getting the narrow Chapter 9 legislation is high because many lawmakers are reluctant to set the precedent of providing this option.	FS2	
201507	1904	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Recall that US states do not have the right to file for bankruptcy protection, although municipalities in states do have that option.	FS2	
201507	1905	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you assume that broad Chapter 9 legislation is not forthcoming, it seems to me that it’s going to be very challenging for Puerto Rico authorities to be able to restructure their Puerto Rican debt on a voluntary basis before the territory hits the wall in terms of running out of financial resources.	FS2	
201507	1906	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This means that sometime later this year or early 2016, there really is a risk of a hard landing—you can think of it as our own Greece—with the potential of disruption to social services and even, potentially, social unrest.	FS2	
201507	1907	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	When this will happen is hard to say.	FS2	
201507	1908	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s really considerable uncertainty about how long the liquidity resources of the government and the Government Development Bank will last.	FS2	
201507	1909	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t really know when the timing of this might take place.	FS2	
201507	1910	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, while a bad outcome in Puerto Rico seems quite likely, I do agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that contagion risks seem to be low.	FS2	
201507	1911	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Puerto Rico’s problems are quite unique and are already well known.	FS2	
201507	1912	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Puerto Rican municipal debt, while sizable, only represents about 2 percent of the total tax-exempt market, and the bulk of the Puerto Rico outstanding munis have already been marked down sharply in price.	FS2	
201507	1913	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So a good portion of the pain has already been manifested in financial markets.	FS2	
201507	1914	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One other potential channel of contagion are the monoline insurers, which guarantee about $15 billion of Puerto Rican debt.	FS2	
201507	1915	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Their share prices have often fallen sharply, and they would clearly be hurt further if there was actually an outright default.	FS2	
201507	1916	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The good news is that the role of the monoline insurers has diminished very significantly since the financial crisis.	FS2	
201507	1917	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Monolines currently wrap only about 5 percent of new municipal bond issuance.	FS2	
201507	1918	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So the ability of states and localities to raise funding, even if Puerto Rico got into difficulty and the monoline insurers went out of business, shouldn’t be disrupted unduly.	FS2	
201507	1919	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But this is something that could be very, very messy and difficult for Puerto Rico.	FS2	
201507	1920	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So you want to distinguish between the implications for the country and the implications for Puerto Rico—sort of like Europe.	FS2	
201507	1921	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	FS2	
201507	1922	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a 10-minute break.	FS2	
201507	1923	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	There is coffee available, and we’ll come back to start our economic go-round and, I hope, get through it before dinner.	FS2	
201507	1924	2015-07-29	meeting		[Coffee break]	FS2	
201507	1925	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we get started on our economic go-round.	13	1
201507	1926	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin with President Rosengren.	13	1
201507	1927	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	1928	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Many analysts have noted some improvement in the ECI recently.	13	1
201507	1929	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the current reading of 2.8 percent is up from last year, it’s still relatively low by historical standards.	13	1
201507	1930	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, some analysts have cited the recent trend in the ECI as evidence that tightness in the labor market is starting to show through to the ECI.	13	1
201507	1931	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Some caution should be used for this interpretation.	13	1
201507	1932	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	When you disaggregate the data and consider increases in the minimum wage in many states, it may be premature to place too much emphasis on the recent numbers as indicating tightness in the labor market.	13	1
201507	1933	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	New England, like most of the country, has continued to see improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201507	1934	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Four of the six New England states have unemployment rates below that of the national average.	13	1
201507	1935	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s why it’s surprising that qualitative discussions of labor markets from advisory groups and regional contacts describe wage and compensation pressures as being primarily isolated to difficult-to-fill positions, such as cybersecurity professionals.	13	1
201507	1936	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Even with a low unemployment rate in most New England states, employers aren’t complaining of wage pressures other than those due to legislated salary changes and those in hard-to-fill jobs.	13	1
201507	1937	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the qualitative responses from businesses in our region, it’s been quite puzzling that the employment cost index has recently registered such outsized increases in New England.	13	1
201507	1938	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Nationally, until a year ago, the ECI had been rising at a very modest rate, roughly at 2 percent a year.	13	1
201507	1939	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Over the past three reports, the year-over-year ECI has been trending up and is currently at 2.8 percent nationally, which might be interpreted as showing the first signs in the data of emerging labor market tightness.	13	1
201507	1940	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Interestingly, the regional patterns in the ECI tell a somewhat less straightforward story.	13	1
201507	1941	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the South, the ECI shows little trend, rising only 2.2 percent on a 12-month basis for each of the past three quarters.	13	1
201507	1942	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Midwest has shown more of a trend, but for the 12 months ending in the first quarter, it grew only 2.4 percent.	13	1
201507	1943	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In general, other than in the Northeast, the ECI has increased only modestly.	13	1
201507	1944	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It turns out that a large portion of the increase in 2015:Q1 had to do with a sizable jump in compensation for private industry workers in New England.	13	1
201507	1945	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The seasonally unadjusted quarterly change from the previous quarter was about 20 percent.	13	1
201507	1946	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	On a Q4-over-Q4 basis, the rate of growth was 7½ percent.	13	1
201507	1947	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The increase was even larger for the wages-and-salaries component, indicating the jump was likely not concentrated in benefits.	13	1
201507	1948	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	There are several issues associated with how to interpret the New England ECI reading.	13	1
201507	1949	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	For instance, the jump in the ECI was mostly driven by incentive-paid occupations, such as sales.	13	1
201507	1950	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s dubious, however, that changes in pay for performance from sales commissions reflected genuine change in labor costs rather than just an improvement in demand conditions.	13	1
201507	1951	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, while the BLS did not provide us with the underlying compensation details, in terms of industry and/or occupation in the New England region, it did mention that, in addition to sales, professional business services—namely, computer design, legal services, and scientific and architectural design—were the main drivers of the outsized increase in the first quarter.	13	1
201507	1952	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Other wage data sources, however, do not corroborate such an explanation.	13	1
201507	1953	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	For example, the average hourly earnings for professional business services in Massachusetts does not indicate a jump in earnings in the first quarter of 2015.	13	1
201507	1954	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It’s hard to think that compositional shifts in this measure would have been rapid and large enough to entirely mask the wage increases in these occupations recorded in the ECI.	13	1
201507	1955	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Another possibility, which would complement the BLS interpretation of the recent ECI reading, is that the minimum wage laws in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Vermont have caused a jump for minimum wage workers.	13	1
201507	1956	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	It may also have some effect on supervisors of minimum wage workers or workers whose salary is priced as a spread to the minimum wage.	13	1
201507	1957	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While this would reflect legislated wage pressure and one-shot level increases rather than demand-driven wage pressures, it might also help explain the New England pattern.	13	1
201507	1958	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	To check this, my staff turned to the Current Population Survey to determine the evolution of wages, both in New England and outside New England, for different percentiles of the respective distributions.	13	1
201507	1959	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Reported hourly wages in New England increased in 2015:Q1 to a greater extent than in other regions.	13	1
201507	1960	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, the distribution of reported hourly wages in New England shows some clear shift around the minimum wage cutoffs.	13	1
201507	1961	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But increases in the wages for all New England workers calculated as usual weekly earnings over usual weekly hours were much less anomalous relative to the recent past, suggesting that while it’s possible that minimum wage changes played some role in the ECI increase, such a role was likely modest.	13	1
201507	1962	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In this respect, it’s notable that a disaggregation of CPS usual wage data, in terms of worker skills, does not reveal any special pattern for New England in the first quarter, not even for low-skilled workers.	13	1
201507	1963	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In the end, we’re left with a puzzle.	13	1
201507	1964	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Much of the first-quarter growth in the ECI is concentrated in New England, but other data series and discussions with employers failed to corroborate the increase in the ECI.	13	1
201507	1965	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the ECI outside New England is rising, it’s increasing at a much more modest pace.	13	1
201507	1966	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	And even if the New England ECI reading is accurate, it may well be a result of the augmentation of income for certain occupations and/or minimum wage earners, with little economy-wide inflationary consequences.	13	1
201507	1967	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We hope incoming data will provide more insight into the nature of recent increases in the ECI, but at this point I’d like to see more data before assuming that the overall increase in the ECI is a reflection of broad-based labor demand generated from a tightening of labor market conditions.	13	1
201507	1968	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	1969	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	1970	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201507	1971	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	1972	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Our Fifth District surveys for the month of July were released earlier today.	13	1
201507	1973	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The service-sector revenue index rose 13 points to a robust level of 32, and the manufacturing activity index rose 6 points to a moderately strong level of 13.	13	1
201507	1974	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The positive signals from these diffusion indexes are consistent with recent anecdotal reports from our District.	13	1
201507	1975	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	A spate of reports came in this month about business activity having returned to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201507	1976	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	This caught our attention.	13	1
201507	1977	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	These reports come from an array of contacts, including a banker, a building supply firm executive, an auto dealer, and a seller of sod.	13	1
201507	1978	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Reports received from the commercial real estate sector were quite positive as well, and a panel of retailers with whom we regularly convene was upbeat and said business had improved notably since last year.	13	1
201507	1979	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Interestingly, some of them said that sales have tended to be strong one month and then relatively weak the next month—which is exactly the pattern we’ve been seeing in the national retail sales data.	13	1
201507	1980	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	An increasing number of anecdotal reports mentioned wage increases and tightening labor markets.	13	1
201507	1981	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	When I say “increasing,” it’s not just our impression—we went back and counted, and positive wage comments have been distinctly more frequent this year than last.	13	1
201507	1982	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	A construction site specialist in Maryland said, “No one responds to ads.	13	1
201507	1983	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We’ve tried everything we know.	13	1
201507	1984	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We could be busier if we could get the people.”	13	1
201507	1985	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Our diffusion indexes also indicate building wage pressures.	13	1
201507	1986	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Our service-sector average wage increase increased 4 points to a fairly high level of 25.	13	1
201507	1987	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	As you may recall, a recent Tealbook cited this index as a good indicator of movements in average hourly compensation.	13	1
201507	1988	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In addition, our manufacturing wage index stands at 29, a relatively strong reading.	13	1
201507	1989	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Based on our surveys and anecdotal reports—and at least until I heard President Rosengren’s report—I was not going to be surprised to see more firming in the national wage and compensation data in the last half of this year.	13	1
201507	1990	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But that was a very interesting report on the research you’ve done on the ECI.	13	1
201507	1991	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I’ll have to think about that.	13	1
201507	1992	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Speaking of the national picture, the data we’ve received since the last meeting are quite consistent with the outlook we had back in June, so I think I can be brief.	13	1
201507	1993	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	My projections of real GDP remain similar to the Tealbook’s, with economic growth through 2017 averaging between 2 and 2½ percent, and continued improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201507	1994	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	On inflation, over the last four months for which we have data, the core CPI has increased at an annual rate of 2.4 percent, and the core PCE price index has increased at a 1.7 percent rate.	13	1
201507	1995	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Granted, four months might be too short an interval to get excited about, and some residual seasonality could be at work, as suggested by the staff.	13	1
201507	1996	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Still, I remain pretty confident that inflation is moving toward 2 percent.	13	1
201507	1997	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	1998	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	1999	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201507	2000	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2001	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The tone of recent reports of the majority of our Sixth District contacts continues to be positive.	13	1
201507	2002	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts reported good current activity and were increasingly upbeat about future sales.	13	1
201507	2003	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Retailers continued to affirm strengthening sales volume, especially those feeding off tourism and hospitality.	13	1
201507	2004	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Low gasoline prices are finally being cited as contributing to consumer spending momentum.	13	1
201507	2005	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A number of our interviews fell in the period of the most intense coverage of developments in Greece and China.	13	1
201507	2006	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	While international events had the attention of many contacts, few expressed concern that the momentum they’re enjoying will be disrupted.	13	1
201507	2007	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Hiring challenges continued to intensify for many contacts.	13	1
201507	2008	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Following a pattern we’ve noted over the course of the year, reports of plans to pick up the pace of wage hikes were increasingly broad based.	13	1
201507	2009	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more reports than in earlier periods of investment in employee training and acquisitions as a human capital strategy.	13	1
201507	2010	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My sense is, the incoming data have been largely consistent with the upbeat reports we heard from most of our District contacts.	13	1
201507	2011	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We expect tomorrow’s second-quarter GDP report to register a substantial improvement over the first quarter, and we expect some further improvement in the second half.	13	1
201507	2012	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I believe the economy remains on a track characterized as moderate economic growth, continuing employment gains, and, by some measures, firming price pressures.	13	1
201507	2013	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	This has been my baseline outlook for quite some time.	13	1
201507	2014	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Now that questions of persistence of first-quarter weakness can be put aside, my confidence in the economy’s momentum is much improved from earlier this year.	13	1
201507	2015	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Because my economic outlook is comparatively optimistic and is likely at the upper end of Committee participants’ range of projections regarding real GDP growth, I’m more concerned about chances of downside risks materializing than prospects for upside developments.	13	1
201507	2016	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m watching the broad-based decline of commodity prices as a possible indicator of the direction of global demand.	13	1
201507	2017	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	However, this is not to say that I object to this meeting’s alternative B policy statement attributing a “balance of risk” view of the Committee as “nearly balanced.”	13	1
201507	2018	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m comfortable with the domestic economic picture at this time.	13	1
201507	2019	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think the burden of proof has now shifted from why we should lift off to why we shouldn’t.	13	1
201507	2020	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	To my mind, it would take a sharp deviation in the overall tone of the data over the next six weeks—more than the not unusual month-to-month noise in the data—or an abrupt deterioration in a significant risk factor, such as global economic growth, or some other material shock to dissuade me from carrying through.	13	1
201507	2021	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2022	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2023	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	13	1
201507	2024	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2025	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, the Fourth District economy continued to expand at a moderate pace, with diversity across sectors similar to what we’ve seen over much of the year.	13	1
201507	2026	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	After a strong increase to 36 in June, our diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions fell back to 18 in July, about the level it’s been for most of the year.	13	1
201507	2027	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The lower reading largely reflects the commercial construction sector.	13	1
201507	2028	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Contacts in this sector continued to report a very strong level of activity and large backlogs but less growth than they experienced in the period before our last meeting.	13	1
201507	2029	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in the retail sector are unchanged, with a number of contacts noting higher wages rippling through the sector, given the wage increases announced by some large national chains.	13	1
201507	2030	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Financial reports indicate steady loan growth, especially for auto loans and home equity products.	13	1
201507	2031	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Manufacturers report mixed conditions.	13	1
201507	2032	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Those connected to the auto, aerospace, and construction industries report strong demand and generally good conditions, while those in sectors, such as steel, that are exposed to the appreciation of the dollar, lower drilling activity for oil and gas extraction, and falling commodity prices report slower activity.	13	1
201507	2033	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets continue to improve.	13	1
201507	2034	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Over the first five months of the year, the Fourth District unemployment rate has been stable at around 5¼ percent.	13	1
201507	2035	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	For the year ending in May, District payroll growth continued to edge up, to 1.6 percent.	13	1
201507	2036	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	This is somewhat slower than the national pace of 2.2 percent but in line with demographic differences between the District and the nation.	13	1
201507	2037	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, the incoming data have been in line with my expectations for accelerating economic activity, further improvement in labor markets, and a gradual firming of inflation.	13	1
201507	2038	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	There’s been little change to my outlook since our last meeting.	13	1
201507	2039	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I continue to be more optimistic than the Tealbook.	13	1
201507	2040	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The monthly data we’ve received over the intermeeting period are consistent with the rebound in GDP growth in the second quarter.	13	1
201507	2041	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Averaging the two Cleveland Fed nowcasting models puts second-quarter GDP growth at about 2 percent.	13	1
201507	2042	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	It appears that the stall in growth in the first quarter was driven mainly by temporary factors, including weather and the labor disputes at West Coast ports.	13	1
201507	2043	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Although the pattern of consumer spending has been somewhat choppy from month to month, the data indicate a pickup in spending since the first quarter.	13	1
201507	2044	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I continue to expect consumer spending to be supported by labor market improvement, improved household balance sheets, and low gasoline prices.	13	1
201507	2045	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	While business equipment spending remains subdued, private nonresidential construction is up noticeably on a year-over-year basis.	13	1
201507	2046	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The higher levels of sales and prices in the residential housing sector is welcome news, but I don’t expect housing to be a major contributor to GDP growth over the remainder of the year.	13	1
201507	2047	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Foreign economic growth is subdued.	13	1
201507	2048	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I expect net exports to continue to be a drag on US growth, although this drag should wane over time as the rate of appreciation of the dollar slows.	13	1
201507	2049	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Although our forecast built in weakness abroad, the magnitude of the slowdown in China remains uncertain and poses a downside risk to the forecast.	13	1
201507	2050	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The situation in Greece also remains unresolved.	13	1
201507	2051	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	However, I anticipate it will have a limited effect on the US economy, because our direct exposure via trade and banking is limited.	13	1
201507	2052	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Greek debt is held mainly by the public sector rather than by private-sector investors, and the European Central Bank has tools to contain spillovers to broader financial markets.	13	1
201507	2053	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I expect economic growth to rise to an above-trend pace later this year and next, which will support continued improvement in labor markets.	13	1
201507	2054	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Over the intermeeting period, payrolls continued to expand at a solid pace, and measures of unemployment and underemployment moved lower.	13	1
201507	2055	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	And over the past year, the economy has created an average of 245,000 jobs per month, and nonfarm payrolls are now 3½ million above their previous peak before the recession.	13	1
201507	2056	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Although average hourly earnings remain subdued, we’re beginning to see signs that wage growth is picking up.	13	1
201507	2057	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Year-over-year gains in the employment cost index rose from under 2 percent in the first quarter of last year to over 2½ percent in the first quarter of this year.	13	1
201507	2058	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the evidence suggests that the economy is at or nearly at the Fed’s mandated monetary policy goal of maximum employment.	13	1
201507	2059	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	This isn’t to say there aren’t longer-term issues affecting the labor market.	13	1
201507	2060	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Workforce development is a key issue for this country.	13	1
201507	2061	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We want to ensure that people can enter and remain productive members of the labor force to raise our standards of living and to make us more competitive in the global economy.	13	1
201507	2062	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	However, monetary policy is not the tool for addressing this important challenge.	13	1
201507	2063	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	It’s better served by policies focused on strengthening and increasing access to education and training.	13	1
201507	2064	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	An open question is the extent to which weakness in labor productivity growth may persist and be a cause for concern.	13	1
201507	2065	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think this is an important question.	13	1
201507	2066	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Two of the alternative scenarios in the Tealbook involve persistently weak structural productivity growth, and they have different monetary policy implications depending on whether the weak productivity growth is accompanied by weaker household and business spending.	13	1
201507	2067	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We need a better understanding of the causes for the recent weakness in productivity growth.	13	1
201507	2068	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think it’s too early to conclude much from the recent data.	13	1
201507	2069	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	As the box in the Tealbook suggests, measurement issues plague our assessment of past and future productivity growth.	13	1
201507	2070	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff found that labor productivity growth has historically been subject to large ex post revisions.	13	1
201507	2071	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In addition, within our staff model, there’s little evidence that productivity helps improve forecast accuracy for employment and labor compensation.	13	1
201507	2072	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I take little signal about the near-term evolution of the economy or the labor market from the recent run of weak productivity numbers, but I do think that we need to consider the longer-term implications for our economy and for monetary policy if trend productivity growth remains low.	13	1
201507	2073	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Inflation continues to run below our 2 percent target, but recent readings show signs of firming.	13	1
201507	2074	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	On a year-over-year basis, headline CPI, core CPI, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s median CPI measure edged up in June.	13	1
201507	2075	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The median CPI continues to run at about 2¼ percent.	13	1
201507	2076	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s inflation nowcast, like the Tealbook, has headline PCE inflation rebounding from a decline at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first quarter to a 2 percent rate in the second quarter and core PCE inflation moving up from a 0.8 percent rate in Q1 to a 1.7 percent rate in Q2.	13	1
201507	2077	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.	13	1
201507	2078	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	After a dip earlier this year, the Cleveland Fed’s estimate of 10-year inflation expectations continued to edge up in June.	13	1
201507	2079	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s survey of the expected inflation rate three years ahead has been at 3 percent for the past several months.	13	1
201507	2080	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation ticked down slightly in June and July, but the level is well within the range observed over the past several years.	13	1
201507	2081	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Longer-run expectations from the Michigan survey have a tendency to drift up and down with energy prices, so the recent downtick may well reflect this sensitivity, given the recent declines in energy prices.	13	1
201507	2082	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	The combination of continued stability of long-term inflation expectations, recent stabilization in measures of underlying CPI inflation, and the ongoing economic expansion and improvement in labor markets make me reasonably confident that inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent target over the medium run.	13	1
201507	2083	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, there’s risk associated with the inflation outlook.	13	1
201507	2084	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Since the June FOMC meeting, the dollar has appreciated a bit and oil prices have slipped.	13	1
201507	2085	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	If this pattern continues, there will be downward pressure on measured inflation rates.	13	1
201507	2086	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Still, as I’ve indicated before, the inflation outlook is always uncertain, partly because exchange rates and oil prices are difficult to predict.	13	1
201507	2087	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Updated analysis by my staff indicates that the current degree of uncertainty continues to be in line with historical norms.	13	1
201507	2088	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the economy can handle an increase in the federal funds rate.	13	1
201507	2089	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	A small increase in interest rates from zero is not tight monetary policy, and with the economic progress we’ve made and that I expect to continue, I believe it’s appropriate for monetary policy to take a step back from the emergency measure of having a zero interest rate.	13	1
201507	2090	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Absent significant negative surprises, I hope that we’ll be in a position to take that step at our next meeting in September, which means it will be important that the communications coming out of this meeting do not preclude that possibility.	13	1
201507	2091	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2092	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2093	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201507	2094	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2095	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The reports from my business contacts and directors were similar to what we’ve been hearing for several meetings now.	13	1
201507	2096	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Most see demand expanding at a moderate rate and were reasonably optimistic about prospects for decent economic growth in the United States.	13	1
201507	2097	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But there was broad-based concern about international developments—particularly about those related to China—and on the pricing front, there were no reports of any pickup in inflation.	13	1
201507	2098	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	To the contrary, anyone with exposure to commodity markets was talking about downward price pressures.	13	1
201507	2099	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me start with the positive news for the United States.	13	1
201507	2100	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The industries that I’m going to mention are quite similar to President Mester’s characterization as well.	13	1
201507	2101	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Automakers and their suppliers were upbeat.	13	1
201507	2102	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	GM and Ford were pleased with the recent industry numbers, and both may again be revising up their forecasts for sales in 2015.	13	1
201507	2103	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Each of them once again noted that low borrowing rates have provided important support for vehicle demand.	13	1
201507	2104	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Also on the consumer front, my director who runs Discover credit cards said the company has seen a modest increase in retail usage over the past six weeks.	13	1
201507	2105	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This is notable because earlier this year, he gave us a bit of an early read on the weaker PCE data that we ended up getting.	13	1
201507	2106	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I received positive reports regarding multifamily residential construction.	13	1
201507	2107	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Urban markets are particularly strong.	13	1
201507	2108	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	On the other hand, businesses that manufacture heavy equipment continue to experience sluggish domestic demand, even aside from the weakness in their oil and gas-related businesses.	13	1
201507	2109	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, most contacts in this area are optimistic that energy-related investment will stabilize and demand from other sectors will pick up, leading to stronger equipment sales in 2016.	13	1
201507	2110	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I heard similar commentary about the demand for steel in 2016 from ArcelorMittal.	13	1
201507	2111	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The heavy equipment and steel manufacturers also have a lot of exposure to international developments, and here the story from them and my other contacts is pretty downbeat.	13	1
201507	2112	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The largest worry is China.	13	1
201507	2113	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, several of my contacts characterized the situation there as “troubling.”	13	1
201507	2114	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	There’s widespread concern that China will not be able to sustain the more modest 7 percent growth target laid out by the Chinese government planners.	13	1
201507	2115	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Such an outcome likely implies continued softness for businesses with significant exposure to commodity markets and, more generally, for China’s major trading partners.	13	1
201507	2116	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	It could also further elevate the dollar, leading to stronger headwinds for US economic growth and inflation.	13	1
201507	2117	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Combining my contact reports with the data we’ve received over the intermeeting period, my forecast for GDP and inflation are essentially unchanged from my June SEP submission.	13	1
201507	2118	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Adjusting for differences in our views about potential, my economic growth forecast is close to the Tealbook, and this results in resource gaps essentially closing by late 2016.	13	1
201507	2119	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	My inflation forecast has PCE prices rising 1.7 percent in 2017.	13	1
201507	2120	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	This is the same as the downwardly revised Tealbook projection, but my forecast builds in a later policy liftoff.	13	1
201507	2121	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	While these inflation forecasts are on the low end of the SEP submissions, I’m still concerned that they may be overly optimistic.	13	1
201507	2122	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	We’ve seen little upward movement so far in core inflation.	13	1
201507	2123	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Without something at least beginning to show up in the data, I find it difficult to write down a forecast that has inflation returning to target within the current projection period.	13	1
201507	2124	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, the only statistical model we have in Chicago that generates a reasonably optimistic increase in inflation is one based largely on mean reversion to a constant, and that forecast still falls short of our 2 percent objective, even in 2017.	13	1
201507	2125	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	In sum, the international situation presents an important downside risk.	13	1
201507	2126	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I think we’re well on track to achieving our employment mandate, but I’m still worried about when inflation will finally begin to rise to 2 percent.	13	1
201507	2127	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	With the evidence in hand today and the knowledge of the uncertainty surrounding the inflation process, I cannot yet write down a baseline forecast that has us achieving our inflation mandate within a reasonable period of time.	13	1
201507	2128	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2129	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2130	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	13	1
201507	2131	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2132	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	You may be familiar with the Mark Twain quote, “The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.”	13	1
201507	2133	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Although it turns out that he never exactly said those words, they are apropos to the state of the Texas economy at this stage.	13	1
201507	2134	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Since the June FOMC meeting, we’ve received more evidence that Texas has weathered the energy bust better than expected.	13	1
201507	2135	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Texas employment expanded in June for the third month in a row and is up at an annual rate of 1.7 percent since March, a full percentage point above the growth rate recorded over the first three months of the year.	13	1
201507	2136	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	As the data stand today, March was our only month of outright job declines.	13	1
201507	2137	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	June job growth extended even to the oil and gas sector, where employment increased by 4,100 jobs out of a total increase of 17,800 jobs.	13	1
201507	2138	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Construction- sector jobs also edged up after three consecutive months of decline.	13	1
201507	2139	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Texas unemployment rate is back down at 4.2 percent after a blip upward to 4.3 percent in May.	13	1
201507	2140	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That 4.2 percent jobless rate matches our pre-recession low from 8 years ago.	13	1
201507	2141	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	You have to go back more than 14 years to January 2001 to find a lower rating.	13	1
201507	2142	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Texas, at least, is at full employment.	13	1
201507	2143	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We continue to hear reports of tight labor market conditions.	13	1
201507	2144	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our Texas business outlook surveys—which cover the manufacturing, services, and retail sectors—capture the recent acceleration in economic activity and suggest that it extended into July.	13	1
201507	2145	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Headline indexes had reached multiyear lows in May but bounced up in June and maintained or increased those gains in July.	13	1
201507	2146	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The manufacturing sector continues to contract, but at a substantially slower pace.	13	1
201507	2147	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Retail has been uneven but has now been moderately positive for two straight months.	13	1
201507	2148	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The service sector has gone from weakly positive to solidly positive.	13	1
201507	2149	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Across all three surveys, respondents have become more optimistic about their companies’ prospects over the second half of 2015.	13	1
201507	2150	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	May was the wettest month on record in the state of Texas, with an average of almost nine inches of rain across the state.	13	1
201507	2151	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Housing starts plunged 17.6 percent as a result, and some builders have been limiting sales so that they can catch up on their backlogs.	13	1
201507	2152	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	This bodes well for construction now that drier summer weather has arrived.	13	1
201507	2153	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our housing contacts confirm this expected bounceback.	13	1
201507	2154	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	While there have been definite signs of improvement in the Texas economy, year-to-date job growth of 1.2 percent remains quite modest by Texas standards.	13	1
201507	2155	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We continue to battle the effects of a strong US dollar, uncertainty in Europe, and weaker global growth.	13	1
201507	2156	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Recently, oil prices have resurfaced as a concern.	13	1
201507	2157	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	At our June meeting, I reported that energy industry contacts were expecting some near-term softness in crude oil followed by a firming later this year and through the first half of 2016.	13	1
201507	2158	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Well, we’ve certainly seen the near- term softness.	13	1
201507	2159	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	From about $60 per barrel in mid-June, WTI has slipped below $50 in response to increases in Saudi and Iraqi production and an inventory buildup in Cushing, Oklahoma.	13	1
201507	2160	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Even before the proposed deal with Iran was announced, our contacts had begun to revise their forecasts, pushing back any significant firming of prices until the second half of 2016.	13	1
201507	2161	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	There’s a dichotomy between large producers in areas with highly productive wells and smaller producers with wells mostly in less productive areas—the former believe they can survive sustained $50 oil, the latter cannot.	13	1
201507	2162	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The West Texas oil patch and Houston have been hit hardest by the slowdown in the energy sector.	13	1
201507	2163	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	One executive likened drilling activity in the Permian Basin last year to a “drunken frenzy.”	13	1
201507	2164	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	At the peak of the boom, the Permian had imported 30,000 workers from other states and other areas of Texas.	13	1
201507	2165	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	This is no longer the case, and in Houston—headquarters for much of the US energy and petrochemical industry—employment has been flat over the past six months.	13	1
201507	2166	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Office construction has fallen to 11.8 million square feet from 16.3 million square feet in the second quarter of 2014, and the office vacancy rate is on the rise.	13	1
201507	2167	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Petrochemical producers have seen their cost advantage over foreign competitors eroded because of the strong dollar and the fall in oil prices relative to natural gas.	13	1
201507	2168	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Domestic demand is sluggish, too, due to weak growth in US industrial output.	13	1
201507	2169	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Petrochemical construction projects scheduled for completion in 2016 and 2017 are proceeding, but projects that were slated to turn on after that will likely be indefinitely delayed or canceled.	13	1
201507	2170	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We will be carefully watching the effect of these slowdowns on overall economic progress in the hope that reality doesn’t catch up to the rumors.	13	1
201507	2171	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	At the national level, everything points to the economy being on the path that we thought it was on at the time of the June FOMC meeting.	13	1
201507	2172	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We’ve seen ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, including a further decline in the unemployment rate and job gains that considerably exceed those that can be sustained over the longer term.	13	1
201507	2173	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	And realized headline inflation has bounced upward.	13	1
201507	2174	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We note that since January, CPI inflation has averaged an annual rate of 2.9 percent and PCE inflation has averaged 2.1 percent.	13	1
201507	2175	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	These data confirm that recent very low 12-month headline inflation rates have a large transitory component.	13	1
201507	2176	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That the economic outlook hasn’t appreciably changed doesn’t mean that nothing important has changed.	13	1
201507	2177	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Slack continues to be eliminated, which reduces our maneuvering room and should increase our confidence that we’re on track to achieve price stability over the medium term.	13	1
201507	2178	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In other words, the case for action to scale back accommodation is strengthening, which will be discussed tomorrow.	13	1
201507	2179	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2180	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2181	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	13	1
201507	2182	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2183	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Economic activity in the Third District continues to grow modestly, about the typical pace for the region.	13	1
201507	2184	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Employment growth in our three-state region has remained steady over the past three months at 1.4 percent, with Pennsylvania experiencing the highest employment growth of our three states.	13	1
201507	2185	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Steady job growth led to a 0.2 percentage point decline in the unemployment rate, to 5.6 percent in June.	13	1
201507	2186	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Our unemployment rate is a bit higher than the nation’s, in part due to our somewhat higher participation rate—a rate that has been gradually increasing over the past 12 months.	13	1
201507	2187	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Reflecting the softness in manufacturing nationally, the general activity index in our July manufacturing Business Outlook Survey came in barely positive at 5.7, returning to single-digit territory where it had been for most of the year.	13	1
201507	2188	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Both the shipments and new orders indexes declined as well.	13	1
201507	2189	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	However, optimism prevails in this sector as the future general activity index rose to a solid 41.5.	13	1
201507	2190	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Manufacturers in our District are definitely viewing the recent weakness as temporary.	13	1
201507	2191	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	They also indicate that they have little pricing power.	13	1
201507	2192	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	One of our contacts, who has interest in a diverse range of manufacturing activities, reported that the reason wage growth has been so subdued is a lack of pricing power.	13	1
201507	2193	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Wage growth is unlikely to pick up until some degree of pricing power returns.	13	1
201507	2194	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Although this is anecdotal, his comments reinforce the message that a number of you have made, both around this table and in your speeches, that inflation leads wage growth and not the other way around.	13	1
201507	2195	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	The service sector also showed some unexpected signs of weakness in the District.	13	1
201507	2196	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	The nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey index for the current conditions decreased substantially in July.	13	1
201507	2197	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	The series is quite volatile, and historically lower-than-average numbers are common in July, but seasonality is only part of the story.	13	1
201507	2198	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Much like our District’s manufacturers, firms in this sector remain optimistic about future activity.	13	1
201507	2199	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Housing in the region continues its slow recovery.	13	1
201507	2200	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	But growth in the multifamily component entirely accounts for that recovery, with permits for single-family housing actually declining.	13	1
201507	2201	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Growth in northern New Jersey has been particularly robust, but Pennsylvania and Delaware are also outpacing the nation in multifamily housing activity.	13	1
201507	2202	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	House prices appreciated moderately in May, but at about half the national average.	13	1
201507	2203	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Turning to the nation as a whole, I view the decline in GDP in the first quarter as mainly reflecting problems with seasonal adjustment.	13	1
201507	2204	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Doubly seasonally adjusted GDP grew at a rate of 1.7 percent, GDI grew at a 1.9 percent rate, and GDPplus grew at a 2.4 percent rate in Q1.	13	1
201507	2205	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	So I’m not overly concerned with the weak expenditure data reported in the first quarter, and I’m optimistic that the economy will rebound in the second half of the year a bit more strongly than suggested in the Tealbook.	13	1
201507	2206	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Despite the weak recent data on consumer activity, strong fundamentals lead me to believe that the consumer will underpin an economy that should perform at or a bit above trend over the next year or so.	13	1
201507	2207	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Continued strong job growth, falling unemployment in both U-3 and U-6, and the labor market dynamism reflected in the JOLTS data point to an end of labor market slack in the near future.	13	1
201507	2208	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	A lot of progress has been made.	13	1
201507	2209	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Further, I found the recent work by Didem Tüzemen and Jonathan Willis of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to be quite compelling.	13	1
201507	2210	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	The authors indicate that match qualities have improved in the labor market over the past year or so, and that even those with less than a high school education are finding highly skilled employment.	13	1
201507	2211	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	A contact in my region confirms that, as we heard previously, firms are engaging in more training and apprenticeship programs in order to find people to fill jobs that require higher skills.	13	1
201507	2212	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	The recent news on inflation has reduced my concern about disinflationary pressures, even though inflation remains a bit on the low side.	13	1
201507	2213	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	As mentioned previously, headline CPI inflation has accelerated a bit of late, and other measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean measures that are computed at the Reserve Banks of Dallas and Cleveland, are not very far behind our target.	13	1
201507	2214	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Further, expected inflation measures produced at Cleveland and our own SPF survey have remained stable and are also near our inflation target.	13	1
201507	2215	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	I am thus persuaded that inflation will most likely gradually return to target.	13	1
201507	2216	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2217	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2218	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201507	2219	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2220	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Employment in the 10th District declined in recent months primarily because of weakness in the energy and agriculture sectors.	13	1
201507	2221	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Manufacturing activity decreased, although services continued to expand.	13	1
201507	2222	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Contacts in both services and manufacturing expect activity to increase in the coming months.	13	1
201507	2223	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	And wage and salary growth picked up slightly outside energy-dependent areas.	13	1
201507	2224	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	The residential real estate market remains tight, with low inventories across most of the District.	13	1
201507	2225	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	House prices continue to rise, leading to a decline in housing affordability.	13	1
201507	2226	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Yet, despite low inventories and rising prices, residential construction activity continues to increase only at a modest pace.	13	1
201507	2227	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Excessive rainfall in parts of the Midwest have boosted corn prices, although profit margins in the livestock sector have declined as cattle and hog prices softened and input costs remained elevated.	13	1
201507	2228	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, District energy activity continued to decline in the second quarter but at a slower rate than earlier in the year.	13	1
201507	2229	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	And expectations for future activity were slightly positive in our quarterly energy survey conducted in late June.	13	1
201507	2230	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	This modest optimism was, in part, due to less tightening of energy financing than had been expected, along with domestic oil prices remaining at about $60 at that time.	13	1
201507	2231	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	However, many firms were concerned about another oil price drop— which has since occurred—as it would likely cause energy activity to contract further.	13	1
201507	2232	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, my outlook for the medium term is little changed.	13	1
201507	2233	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	With the first-quarter weakness proving transitory, I expect economic growth to pick up during the year and average around 2 percent in 2015 before moving up a bit higher next year.	13	1
201507	2234	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Healthy growth in household spending is a key aspect supporting my forecast.	13	1
201507	2235	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	And, in terms of the labor market, the declines in the unemployment rate and the broader U-6 measure in June indicate that labor market slack continues to diminish.	13	1
201507	2236	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Regarding the inflation outlook, with the unemployment rate close to its natural rate and continuing improvement in the labor market, inflation seems poised to firm in the second half of the year.	13	1
201507	2237	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Despite the stronger dollar and lower oil prices, we have seen four solid monthly increases in the core PCE price index, giving me reasonable confidence that headline inflation should return to the 2 percent goal over the medium term.	13	1
201507	2238	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Looking at inflation expectations, Tealbook A noted that some measures of longer-term inflation expectations, including the median five-year-forward measure from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, have edged down during the past years, and that this could suggest a risk of a downward shift in expectations.	13	1
201507	2239	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	I asked my staff to look at this more closely, and they found that the individual longer-term forecasts for PCE inflation in the SPF resulted because a number of forecasts above 3 percent had steadily fallen since the recession, and the very high outliers have disappeared.	13	1
201507	2240	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	In contrast, the number of forecasts below 1 percent have remained steady.	13	1
201507	2241	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Although this could lead the median to decline, I see the reduction in outliers as consistent with better-anchored expectations.	13	1
201507	2242	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2243	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2244	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201507	2245	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2246	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Data released in the past few months underscore the transitory nature of the measured first-quarter weakness and confirm that the economy is on a solid growth path.	13	1
201507	2247	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking forward, I expect real GDP growth to average about 2½ percent for the remainder of the year before slowing to a more sustainable pace next year.	13	1
201507	2248	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	With growth above trend, I expect continued progress in closing output and unemployment gaps and in moving inflation back to our 2 percent target.	13	1
201507	2249	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The ongoing improvement in economic conditions means that we’re very near to achieving our employment objective.	13	1
201507	2250	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The question is, how close are we?	13	1
201507	2251	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Labor market conditions have unequivocally improved.	13	1
201507	2252	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Job growth is averaging more than 200,000 jobs per month so far this year, well above the roughly 100,000 per month that we need to keep up with trend labor force growth.	13	1
201507	2253	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consequently, unemployment and other measures of labor utilization, such as the broader U-6 measure, have steadily declined.	13	1
201507	2254	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	At the same time, job vacancies and perceptions of job availability have improved substantially.	13	1
201507	2255	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And quits, a barometer of the confidence workers have in the labor market, are only a tad above pre-recession levels.	13	1
201507	2256	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The improvement in the labor market data is echoed by my contacts.	13	1
201507	2257	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They tell me it’s getting more difficult to hire workers—and that’s not just high-tech workers, but also those needed to fill medium- and lower-skilled jobs in sectors like construction.	13	1
201507	2258	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m also hearing concerns about retaining workers.	13	1
201507	2259	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, a large trucking firm in my District reports unusually high voluntary turnover—up to 100 percent annually.	13	1
201507	2260	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, a few labor market indicators are still lagging behind, including involuntary part-time work and labor force participation.	13	1
201507	2261	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, as I have reported previously, it’s clear that some portion of the shift in these measures reflects longer-standing changes in demographics and in the labor market that are beyond the reach of monetary policy.	13	1
201507	2262	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Wage growth is another measure that typically lags until unemployment draws nearer to its natural rate.	13	1
201507	2263	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Consistent with this pattern, we’ve started to see signs of a pickup in labor compensation.	13	1
201507	2264	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And like the Tealbook, I expect further acceleration as the labor market tightens further.	13	1
201507	2265	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like President Lacker, I found President Rosengren’s comments about the minimum wage and the regional nature of the increases in the employment cost index very interesting.	13	1
201507	2266	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I suppose I viewed at least a significant portion of the increase of the minimum wage as reflecting economic forces.	13	1
201507	2267	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I know it’s a political decision, but often it reflects labor market conditions, too.	13	1
201507	2268	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it’s an interesting issue: to what extent, historically, have minimum wage changes or other legislated labor changes actually been endogenous responses to economic conditions versus some kind of one-time exogenous factors?	13	1
201507	2269	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I do think it’s a really interesting question to think about.	13	1
201507	2270	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To sum up, the steady improvements in the labor market mean we’re closing in on full employment.	13	1
201507	2271	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, in my forecast we reach a natural rate of unemployment this year and fall below it for much of 2016.	13	1
201507	2272	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	By contrast, the progress in our inflation objective has been less clear, with our preferred measure still running well below target.	13	1
201507	2273	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, I expect that we will reach our 2 percent inflation objective by the end of next year.	13	1
201507	2274	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And for those who ask what I mean by that, I just mean the quarterly rate.	13	1
201507	2275	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I don’t mean the four-quarter change.	13	1
201507	2276	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Ah, I’m not as crazy as you thought.	13	1
201507	2277	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2278	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored, and I expect additional firming of price inflation with increased activity and further tightening of the labor market.	13	1
201507	2279	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Moreover, the key factors depressing current inflation—namely, the oil price declines and the dollar appreciation—are transitory.	13	1
201507	2280	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Much of the effect of last year’s drop in oil prices has moved through the pipeline, so to speak, and very recent additional declines in oil prices reflecting optimism about renewed Iranian oil exports should only temporarily depress inflation.	13	1
201507	2281	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	A bigger concern is the dollar appreciation, which has been sizable over the past year and may well continue.	13	1
201507	2282	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The dollar appreciation has a considerable but transitory effect on inflation.	13	1
201507	2283	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The consensus from recent research is that a 10 percent rise in the dollar knocks about ½ percentage point off core inflation in the first year.	13	1
201507	2284	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This effect alone explains much of the shortfall in core inflation that we’ve been seeing of late.	13	1
201507	2285	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Importantly, though, this effect quickly fades.	13	1
201507	2286	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Based on this evidence, I expect the effects of the past dollar appreciation and recent dollar appreciation on inflation rates to largely disappear by next year.	13	1
201507	2287	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead, there are concerns that our policy normalization, coupled with continued easy monetary policy abroad, will lead to renewed dollar appreciation, and obviously that’s a risk.	13	1
201507	2288	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But here I agree with the Tealbook:  Further appreciation in the dollar is likely to be moderate.	13	1
201507	2289	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Our upcoming policy normalization is widely anticipated and should be reflected in markets’ expectations.	13	1
201507	2290	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Adding up all of these considerations, I expect we’ll achieve our 2 percent inflation target in the next few years as underlying inflation moves toward our goal and temporary factors dissipate.	13	1
201507	2291	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, more data are needed to say confidently—I have to cheat, everybody else does, and get a little policy discussion into this go-round—that our return to our 2 percent goal will be timely.	13	1
201507	2292	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll have more to say on that tomorrow.	13	1
201507	2293	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2294	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2295	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201507	2296	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2297	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.	13	1
201507	2298	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	News from District contacts has not changed appreciably from our previous meeting in most dimensions.	13	1
201507	2299	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal reports of tight labor market conditions have become commonplace.	13	1
201507	2300	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A very wet spring has significantly reduced the percentage of crops in good condition.	13	1
201507	2301	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Declining commodity price prospects generally have reduced expectations for farm income for 2015.	13	1
201507	2302	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Unemployment in District MSAs is exactly at the national average, according to the most recent reading.	13	1
201507	2303	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Housing markets seem stable, and District home prices are rising but are not as volatile as in the nation as a whole.	13	1
201507	2304	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to spend the bulk of my comments on the national economy and, in particular, on the unemployment forecast.	13	1
201507	2305	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to see the staff’s unemployment forecast as somewhat out of sync with more mainstream views.	13	1
201507	2306	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I see the staff’s forecast as, at certain points, based on a more stretched interpretation of certain aspects of the data than I think is wise to use as a basis for US monetary policy.	13	1
201507	2307	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Pages 2 and 3 of Tealbook A show that the staff’s forecast path for real GDP tends to be lower than private-sector forecasts, as described by the Blue Chip as of July 10, 2015.	13	1
201507	2308	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Similarly, the staff forecast for unemployment tends to be higher than private- sector forecasts, as described by the Blue Chip.	13	1
201507	2309	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The staff’s forecast of unemployment falls to 5.2 percent by the end of 2016—just 0.1 percentage point lower than today over the next 18 months—and to 5.1 percent by the end of 2017—just 0.2 percentage point lower than today over the next 2½ years.	13	1
201507	2310	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have said before that I do not see this as a credible forecast, taking into account the declines in unemployment in the recent past.	13	1
201507	2311	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	My view is that unemployment is more likely to continue to fall further, and that this should be part of the baseline case for this Committee.	13	1
201507	2312	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	One piece of support for the idea that unemployment will fall further comes from the historical series given on page 15 of Tealbook A.	13	1
201507	2313	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The unemployment rate fell to below 4 percent in the late 1990s; it fell to the middle of the 4 percent range in the 2000s.	13	1
201507	2314	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In view of the low interest rate environment that’s anticipated over the next few years, and barring an adverse shock, the historical experience of the most recent two expansions is, I think, the best guide to likely developments in the next few years.	13	1
201507	2315	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Page 20 of Tealbook A contains alternative scenarios for unemployment.	13	1
201507	2316	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Key assumptions are, one, that the ratio of payroll employment to Current Population Survey measures of employment is rising, and, two, that the labor force participation rate will return to an estimated trend line.	13	1
201507	2317	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think these are good baseline assumptions.	13	1
201507	2318	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The ratio of payroll employment to CPS employment has risen recently, but it did not rise during the 2002–07 expansion.	13	1
201507	2319	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	It has moved up but may or may not rise further.	13	1
201507	2320	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The labor force participation trend is on page 29 of Tealbook A.	13	1
201507	2321	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is, indeed, an unusual trend line that has not made any contact with the data over the past five years.	13	1
201507	2322	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The trend is, in fact, everywhere above the data.	13	1
201507	2323	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This strikes me as a stretched interpretation of the participation data.	13	1
201507	2324	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	A more reasonable interpretation would accept the empirical evidence and fit a trend line to the existing data.	13	1
201507	2325	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In other words, the trend line would run through the data.	13	1
201507	2326	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This would likely suggest less future improvement in the labor force participation rate.	13	1
201507	2327	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Tealbook also provides what the unemployment forecast would be without these assumptions.	13	1
201507	2328	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	On page 20, changing either assumption would send the unemployment rate below 4½ percent over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201507	2329	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Changing both assumptions likely sends the unemployment rate below 4 percent over the forecast horizon.	13	1
201507	2330	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Some version of these alternative scenarios would provide a better benchmark case for this Committee, in my view, and would be more consistent with available private-sector forecasts.	13	1
201507	2331	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	An additional consideration in my mind is that weekly initial unemployment insurance claims are at the lowest level in decades and that, indeed, if one adjusts for the size of the labor force, the claims are even lower than in historical experience.	13	1
201507	2332	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Finally, Tealbook A also provides a past evolution of the forecast on page 33.	13	1
201507	2333	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The forecast for 2014 end-of-year unemployment and 2015 end-of-year unemployment estimates were initially high when they were made in 2012 and 2013 and have declined more or less continuously since that time.	13	1
201507	2334	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In other words, the staff unemployment rate forecasts have consistently been too high—too pessimistic about unemployment improvement.	13	1
201507	2335	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Importantly, this is despite real GDP growth forecasts also being too high over this period.	13	1
201507	2336	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	One would have expected that the slower growth would have made the unemployment forecast more nearly correct, but the forecast unemployment rates are still too high.	13	1
201507	2337	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is all my way of explaining some of the differences between my forecast and the staff forecast.	13	1
201507	2338	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	One implication would be that, using only the staff model, there would be more upward pressure on inflation than is suggested in the baseline forecast.	13	1
201507	2339	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	On this, I would note that the Blue Chip CPI forecast for 2016 is 2.3 percent.	13	1
201507	2340	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we subtract 0.3 percentage point from that to translate it into PCE inflation, then headline inflation is projected to be at target by private- sector forecasters by the end of next year.	13	1
201507	2341	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This strikes me as a reasonable expectation.	13	1
201507	2342	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2343	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2344	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201507	2345	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2346	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before I talk about what I prepared for these remarks, I wanted to touch on some of the issues that have been brought up in others’ interventions.	13	1
201507	2347	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is a lot of discussion about a “transitory first quarter,” and I just wanted to clarify the meaning of that.	13	1
201507	2348	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In growth rate terms, it’s correct that we don’t see the very low growth rate that we saw in the first quarter—of near zero, below zero, or maybe we’ll see the revisions later this week that will push it a little bit above zero—carried forward into the second quarter, third quarter, or fourth quarter.	13	1
201507	2349	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Rather, we see more robust growth in those quarters.	13	1
201507	2350	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But many of the stories with regard to that “transitoriness” are actually stories that you would not expect to show up in the level of GDP.	13	1
201507	2351	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, the low growth that we saw in the first quarter is actually translating into distinctly lower levels of GDP at the end of the year than at least I had anticipated going into the year.	13	1
201507	2352	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not seeing a 3 percent growth rate overall.	13	1
201507	2353	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not seeing catch-up in the second and third quarters.	13	1
201507	2354	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think when we use the word “transitory,” the stories we tell for that transitoriness should be stories that actually lead to a permanently lower level of GDP going forward to the end of 2015.	13	1
201507	2355	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The seasonal adjustment story has that flavor, but some of the other stories, such as the port strikes and others, seem much more challenging along those lines.	13	1
201507	2356	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For the second issue that came up, I was very interested to hear from President George about the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s analysis of the SPF, about how some of the decline in the forecast is from losing the inflation nutters—those forecasting the 3 percent and above.	13	1
201507	2357	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Losing those forces in the market is actually a challenge for us.	13	1
201507	2358	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you have folks in the market that are betting on inflation being above 3 percent, that helps keep the real interest rate low and helps stimulate the economy.	13	1
201507	2359	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If those folks are exiting the market—are not betting that inflation is going to be high—that actually serves to drive up the real interest rate and push down stimulus, as long as we’re keeping the nominal rates the same, or the expectations of nominal rates the same.	13	1
201507	2360	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is in line with the idea, which I haven’t voiced publicly yet, that Allan Meltzer was actually one of the big forces for accommodation in the past five years, because the idea that inflation was going to be high in the years ahead was actually a very positive force for this Committee, in light of the fact that we’re not able to drive nominal interest rates lower.	13	1
201507	2361	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Was that a beta test of that argument?	13	1
201507	2362	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It was a beta test, yes.	13	1
201507	2363	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2364	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Maybe a gamma test.	13	1
201507	2365	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Well, Allan says people don’t always understand nominal versus real, and this argument demands that people understand nominal versus real.	13	1
201507	2366	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to a discussion of what I prepared.	13	1
201507	2367	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I’ll first talk about local economic conditions in the Ninth District, then I’ll talk about international risks, and I’ll close by presenting what I see as a key feature of the inflation outlook.	13	1
201507	2368	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	By some metrics, the Ninth District labor market looks very strong.	13	1
201507	2369	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The unemployment rate has fallen to 4 percent in the Ninth District.	13	1
201507	2370	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, the four states that are located entirely in the District—Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota—all have unemployment rates below 4 percent.	13	1
201507	2371	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yet other metrics suggest the labor market recovery is not yet complete in the Ninth District.	13	1
201507	2372	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thus, on average over the past 12 months, the fraction of people aged 25 to 54 in the Dakotas and Montana who have a job remains more than 2 percentage points below its 2007 level.	13	1
201507	2373	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And the fraction of those aged 16 and over who work part time for economic reasons remains high in Montana and South Dakota.	13	1
201507	2374	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But yet, in Minnesota, the metrics are consistent with a more complete labor market recovery.	13	1
201507	2375	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On average over the past year, the fraction of people aged 25 to 54 who have a job has returned to its 2007 level.	13	1
201507	2376	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The fraction of people over the age of 16 who are working part time but would like a full-time job has fallen back to its 2007 level.	13	1
201507	2377	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So if you look at Minnesota, the full range of labor market metrics—the unemployment rate, the PTER, and the 25-to-54 EPOP—have all come back to 2007 levels.	13	1
201507	2378	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Despite these strong labor market metrics, however, inflation is not unduly high in Minnesota.	13	1
201507	2379	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Both core and headline CPI inflation remain at or below 2 percent in the Minneapolis–St Paul metro area.	13	1
201507	2380	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Notably, there are little signs of inflationary pressures, even in nontradables.	13	1
201507	2381	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The BLS reports that, in 2014, the inflation rate for services was essentially the same in the Twin Cities as it was nationally.	13	1
201507	2382	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think Minnesota’s experience gives some confidence that a broad range of national labor market metrics can return to pre–Great Recession levels—possibly even better—without generating undue inflationary pressures.	13	1
201507	2383	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s on the Ninth District front.	13	1
201507	2384	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to international risks, where I see two key risks.	13	1
201507	2385	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One is well captured by the alternative scenarios regarding recent developments in China in which adverse international events cause a deterioration in global demand and in global financial market conditions.	13	1
201507	2386	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The result is that inflation in the United States remains below target for an even more extended period of time than in the baseline, which enhances the risk that longer-term inflation expectations will slide downward further.	13	1
201507	2387	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One way to mitigate these risks that the alternative scenario does not consider is to delay the date of liftoff beyond the September 2015 meeting.	13	1
201507	2388	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	By delaying the date of liftoff beyond that considered in the alternative scenarios, the Committee would essentially be taking on insurance against these eventualities.	13	1
201507	2389	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second international risk is associated with our own actions regarding the stance of US monetary policy.	13	1
201507	2390	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is a risk that interest rate increases, especially in the absence of any obvious inflationary pressures, could lead to rapid changes in financial market conditions abroad that could then feed back domestically.	13	1
201507	2391	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In that case, we could well see large capital outflows from the EMEs and Europe as investors seek to take advantage of higher US interest rates.	13	1
201507	2392	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These outflows could have adverse consequences for the US economy in at least three different ways.	13	1
201507	2393	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, they could create global financial instabilities that would be problematic.	13	1
201507	2394	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, the dollar could rise rapidly, creating downward pressures on the demand for US goods.	13	1
201507	2395	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And, third, the EMEs could feel forced to tighten their own monetary policies in order to keep domestic inflation under control, which would then push the demand for US goods down further.	13	1
201507	2396	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thus, on the international front, I think there are two risks overall: One is associated with exogenous events, and the other is more endogenous to our own actions.	13	1
201507	2397	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Finally, let me turn to an assessment of the national inflation outlook, although, I have to say, not much has changed in this dimension from our previous meeting, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2398	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Under the policy stance of Tealbook A, the Board staff projects that inflation will return to target only after 2020.	13	1
201507	2399	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The policy stance in Tealbook A is actually considerably more accommodative than what’s described in the most recent median S&P forecast, which raises serious concerns that the actual policy choices of the Committee will result in an even more protracted deviation from the inflation target.	13	1
201507	2400	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ve suggested before, I think there are good reasons to put a lot of weight on the market-based forecasts of inflation as guides to policy, and these are telling a similar story to what’s implied by the Board staff’s outlook.	13	1
201507	2401	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Zero-coupon inflation swaps imply a CPI inflation rate of 1.7 percent over a period of one to two years from now.	13	1
201507	2402	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That would translate to something on the order of 1.3 to 1.4 percent in PCE terms.	13	1
201507	2403	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The four-year, one-year forecast, which projects what inflation will be in 2020 based on the zero-coupon inflation swaps, is still very low—1.6 percent in PCE terms.	13	1
201507	2404	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, the modal inflation outlook strongly suggests the need for further accommodation.	13	1
201507	2405	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I’m sneaking into policy.	13	1
201507	2406	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We surely noticed.	13	1
201507	2407	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2408	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Dragging it in.	13	1
201507	2409	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The risks to the outlook, though, are skewed further to the downside because of the constraint posed by the zero lower bound.	13	1
201507	2410	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Risk-management considerations also push in the direction of additional accommodation.	13	1
201507	2411	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I’ll talk more about that tomorrow.	13	1
201507	2412	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2413	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2414	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201507	2415	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2416	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My views haven’t changed much since the June meeting, and they don’t differ very much from the Tealbook’s forecast.	13	1
201507	2417	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to economic growth, I think there are both positives and negatives.	13	1
201507	2418	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Together they add up to perhaps a 2 percent growth rate in the second half of the year, with the risks about balanced around that trajectory.	13	1
201507	2419	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d put the outlook for consumer spending and residential investment on the positive side.	13	1
201507	2420	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Household spending should be well supported over the near term by solid job gains and a saving rate that is higher than what one would expect on the basis of the level of net worth relative to income.	13	1
201507	2421	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And the Iranian deal, if it holds, increases the likelihood that oil and gasoline prices will stay low for an extended period, which may also help free up some additional spending.	13	1
201507	2422	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I see several positives with respect to housing, including the relatively low level of housing starts relative to employment growth and the easing of lending standards for residential mortgages evident in the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices.	13	1
201507	2423	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Housing is a part of the economy—unlike motor vehicle sales, for example—that one can argue is still cyclically depressed.	13	1
201507	2424	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the negative side, I would expect trade to remain a drag and inventory investment to fall, given the fact that inventory accumulation rates during the first half of the year were quite high.	13	1
201507	2425	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The biggest risk in my mind, though, remains the employment trend, which has been very sturdy relative to the pace of economic growth.	13	1
201507	2426	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If that trend stays intact over the next few months—I’m going to speak on the monetary policy part here—then I think the case for monetary policy liftoff will be quite compelling.	13	1
201507	2427	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But I am reluctant to count on those chickens just yet.	13	1
201507	2428	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to inflation, I continue to become less worried that inflation will remain persistently below 2 percent.	13	1
201507	2429	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This reflects several factors.	13	1
201507	2430	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the trend of core inflation has flattened out despite the damping effect of lower oil prices and a firmer dollar—influences that will likely prove to be transitory.	13	1
201507	2431	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, a tighter labor market is likely to translate soon into higher compensation trends.	13	1
201507	2432	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	While I know that the linkage between wages and inflation is very tenuous, I still believe that pressure on resources does matter in terms of affecting the inflation outlook.	13	1
201507	2433	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And, third, my own reading is that there is some scope for higher inflation from a firmer trajectory for shelter and health-care costs.	13	1
201507	2434	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As we all know, these components have a significant weight in core inflation measures.	13	1
201507	2435	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I do have one nitpick with the Tealbook—as I said, I mostly agree with it.	13	1
201507	2436	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But Tealbook A, after noting on page 19 that “readings on longer-term inflation expectations have changed little over the intermeeting period,” goes on to say that “some of these measures seem to have edged down during the past handful of years.”	13	1
201507	2437	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, that’s not really new information.	13	1
201507	2438	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	These developments, Tealbook A continues, “suggest a downside risk to our maintained assumption that expectations will remain well anchored.”	13	1
201507	2439	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I’m not sure I share this view— and I’m channeling President Mester a bit here, I think—because the size of these changes is not that large.	13	1
201507	2440	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s on the order of 15 to 25 basis points.	13	1
201507	2441	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And as Loretta pointed out, the University of Michigan measure tends to get bounced around by the trajectory of oil prices.	13	1
201507	2442	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So some of the decline that you see in the University of Michigan measure may just reflect the oil price trends.	13	1
201507	2443	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, as President Mester also pointed out, some measures of consumer inflation expectations have moved higher recently.	13	1
201507	2444	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Survey of Consumer Expectations has shown a clear uptick in expected inflation at the one-year and three-year time horizons in recent months.	13	1
201507	2445	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The one-year median expected inflation rate has risen 27 basis points since April, to 3 percent.	13	1
201507	2446	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And the three-year median expected inflation rate has risen 8 basis points since March, to 3 percent as well.	13	1
201507	2447	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I wouldn’t overemphasize those increases.	13	1
201507	2448	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They’re not very large, either.	13	1
201507	2449	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But I think it does push against the notion that there’s compelling evidence that substantial risk to the downside in terms of inflation expectations are emerging.	13	1
201507	2450	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t think the data really support that conclusion.	13	1
201507	2451	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I just want to talk a little bit about this issue of how much excess slack there is in the labor market.	13	1
201507	2452	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff has done a lot of work on the issue of how much hours worked would increase if the other measures of unemployment, like U- 6, were to be normalized with the actual level of the unemployment rate measured by U-3.	13	1
201507	2453	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Ayşegül Şahin, who is sitting over here, has done a lot of work on this.	13	1
201507	2454	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And when you actually ask yourself the question of how much hours worked would you get if all these other measures normalize, it’s not as much as you might think or hope.	13	1
201507	2455	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It suggests that maybe the unemployment rate overstates the tightness of the labor market by about ½ percentage point.	13	1
201507	2456	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In other words, if you could get U-6 down to where you’d expect it to be relative to U-3, you might get about ½ percent of additional hours worked.	13	1
201507	2457	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So it points in the right direction of saying that you have some extra labor market slack, but it’s not a huge increment of slack, in my opinion.	13	1
201507	2458	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2459	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2460	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201507	2461	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2462	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The picture of the economy presented in the July Tealbook is consistent with, but a bit weaker than, that presented in the June Tealbook.	13	1
201507	2463	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Personal consumption expenditures are expected to continue to grow at an annual rate of a little more than 3 percent over the remainder of this year, while residential investment is expected to grow at more than 5 percent—a good rate, albeit lower than predicted six weeks ago.	13	1
201507	2464	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Nonresidential private investment is expected to grow at a rate slightly higher than GDP and more rapidly than expected in the June Tealbook, although very recent declines in the price of oil may reduce investment relative to the current forecast for the second half of the year.	13	1
201507	2465	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Government purchases for the second half of the year are expected to grow very slowly, at a rate well below the rate of growth of GDP.	13	1
201507	2466	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And net exports are, of course, expected to continue to decline relative to GDP in the second half of this year and to reduce the growth rate of GDP in the second half by about 0.7 percentage point.	13	1
201507	2467	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The staff attributes much of the subdued performance of GDP in the first half of the year to two factors:  first, the decline in net exports, and, second, the effects of the lower price of oil on drilling and mining investment.	13	1
201507	2468	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	These are both related to factors that have also contributed to the lower rate of PCE inflation.	13	1
201507	2469	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Particularly interesting is the effect of lower oil prices on GDP growth, which seems to be negative—at least in the short run—rather than positive, as we had expected when the price of oil began its significant decline.	13	1
201507	2470	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Our fear from six weeks ago that events in Greece and China could produce major disturbances in Europe and globally, respectively, in the short run has been significantly reduced by the agreement on a third stabilization program reached with the Greek government earlier this month and by the actions taken by the Chinese government to stabilize the stock market, although the Shanghai Stock Exchange has yet to be stabilized.	13	1
201507	2471	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	At the June meeting, I was worried that the underlying strongly positive trends in the economy—especially in the labor market, where monthly increases in employment had averaged 260,000 in 2014—could be slowing.	13	1
201507	2472	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	That fear was exacerbated by the March increase in employment of only about 120,000, a figure we knew at the June meeting.	13	1
201507	2473	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The fear was alleviated by the second-quarter monthly rate of increase of employment of 220,000 and the staff’s forecast monthly rate of increase of 210,000 for the second half of the year.	13	1
201507	2474	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thus, the labor market is expected to continue to perform well in the years ahead, albeit with a participation rate that is not expected to rise through 2017.	13	1
201507	2475	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	This outcome is consistent with the staff’s judgment that the rate of unemployment will continue to decline very slowly.	13	1
201507	2476	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The Tealbook is an excellent document, but it may be a bit too interesting, for it includes so many interesting details.	13	1
201507	2477	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2478	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We could go back to the longer version.	13	1
201507	2479	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	It includes so many interesting details that there are inevitably some facts or trends in it that point down and some that point up, on one or the other of which we are often inclined to expand.	13	1
201507	2480	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I have just been doing that.	13	1
201507	2481	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But we need mainly to look at the overall picture of this economy.	13	1
201507	2482	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The overall picture is of an economy growing slowly, at a rate of about 2 percent or a bit higher, but with a labor market that has worked remarkably well over a long period despite having had to contend with hardly any support from fiscal policy, an appreciation of the dollar that has significantly reduced aggregate demand, and some surprisingly negative influences from the decline in the price of oil.	13	1
201507	2483	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	As of now, the unemployment rate is near most estimates of the longer-run rate of unemployment projected by participants in the SEP, and it is projected to continue declining.	13	1
201507	2484	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	When exactly we will reach the longer-run rate, as defined by SEP participants, is hard to say because the Committee’s views on the natural rate can change and because there are margins of slack remaining that are not adequately captured by the difference between the unemployment rate and the estimated natural rate of unemployment.	13	1
201507	2485	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I would now like to revisit and repeat some points I made at last month’s meeting.	13	1
201507	2486	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	First, it is worth reemphasizing that the labor market has, for some time, seemed much stronger than the GDP data.	13	1
201507	2487	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Since early last year, the unemployment rate has declined by well over 1 percentage point.	13	1
201507	2488	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The difference in the behavior of output and employment has been puzzling since soon after the start of the recovery in 2009, and it was particularly stark in the first quarters of 2014 and 2015 when GDP declined.	13	1
201507	2489	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The staff generally takes the view that when the employment and GDP data appear inconsistent, the employment data are more likely to be accurate than the output data, which is to say that we should put more weight on the behavior of employment than on the behavior of GDP.	13	1
201507	2490	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, we all await Thursday’s revisions of the national income data with keen interest and hope, and we will have those data when we come to make our decision in September.	13	1
201507	2491	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I remain reasonably confident that we will see inflation beginning to move back toward our 2 percent target before very long.	13	1
201507	2492	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Core PCE inflation in the second quarter was 1.7 percent, but it is expected to decline to 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter before rising to 1.5 percent over the four quarters of 2016 and 1.7 percent for the four quarters of 2017.	13	1
201507	2493	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The core CPI is expected by the staff to be 2 percent in both 2015 and 2016, to be followed by 2.1 percent in 2017.	13	1
201507	2494	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The price of oil is now declining but looks about to reach a new range from which it is as likely to move up as to move down.	13	1
201507	2495	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And the Board staff is forecasting that core import prices will resume increasing early next year, which should help support core inflation in the period ahead.	13	1
201507	2496	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	As the influence of declining oil and import prices begins to wane, we will begin to see the core inflation rate moving up.	13	1
201507	2497	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Those will be the inflation rates relevant to any changes in monetary policy we put in place in the next few months.	13	1
201507	2498	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I am reassured that inflation expectations have remained reasonably steady despite the very low levels of headline inflation.	13	1
201507	2499	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But, overall, it is not the inflation indicators today that persuade me that we will see inflation rising over our projection horizon.	13	1
201507	2500	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Rather, it is my conviction that economic slack has been diminishing and continues to diminish, and that the Phillips curve will reassert itself, as the incoming evidence is beginning to suggest.	13	1
201507	2501	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Needless to say, I also have concerns about the outlook.	13	1
201507	2502	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, consumer spending has been disappointing when we consider how real income has been boosted by lower gasoline prices.	13	1
201507	2503	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Industrial production data has likewise been disappointing, and developments in the Chinese economy have yet to play out.	13	1
201507	2504	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yet we need to remind ourselves that all of this is taking place against the background of a labor market that is near full employment and is expected to continue to strengthen.	13	1
201507	2505	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2506	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2507	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201507	2508	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2509	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I agree with those of you who have said that, on balance, the economic picture hasn’t really changed much since June.	13	1
201507	2510	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I wanted to underscore the point that President Kocherlakota made that, although it’s reasonably clear that we didn’t begin to sink into a period of substantially reduced growth after the first quarter, this was not a repeat of last year, when really good second and third quarters made up for the very bad first quarter.	13	1
201507	2511	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So, on net, there has been a loss.	13	1
201507	2512	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I wanted to add a few thoughts on labor markets and international factors to what some of you have already said.	13	1
201507	2513	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Before going to those thoughts, though, I did want to comment on some of the things that some of you have said already.	13	1
201507	2514	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to proposals to raise the minimum wage and actual minimum wage increases, I think there’s a lot, John, to what you say about past efforts to raise minimum wages.	13	1
201507	2515	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Having been through a couple of those efforts myself, I found that oftentimes what would happen is that those who favored minimum wage increases would wait until a point at which they could make the argument that a nontrivial portion of people covered by minimum wages were already above that wage.	13	1
201507	2516	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So the net effect on employers would not actually be that great.	13	1
201507	2517	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	One of the salient differences, I think, between the proposals and the things that have been enacted this time around and the past is, that argument isn’t being made.	13	1
201507	2518	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the contrary, employers are saying that, basically, they’d have to raise wages for all of their employees.	13	1
201507	2519	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s because the political origins of this particular set of initiatives come more from this sense that, persistently and chronically, wages have not been rising.	13	1
201507	2520	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So we can’t be sure about it, but my guess is that there is some difference between the effect that the minimum wage increases would have now and what I think you quite rightly intuit as past patterns.	13	1
201507	2521	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I have a couple of other things.	13	1
201507	2522	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, I don’t know about the rest of you, but I would like to try to encourage the staff to continue to do their own economic forecast rather than to attempt to get themselves close to the median of the Blue Chip.	13	1
201507	2523	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The whole purpose of what we’re asking them to do is to give us an independent, more or less coherent, picture of what they think is going on in the economy, which then allows us to see whether that’s convincing, and not to try to calibrate it so that the final numbers somehow align well with what others are saying.	13	1
201507	2524	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I would also point out that the Blue Chip is itself a median.	13	1
201507	2525	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	There are a bunch of people in the Blue Chip who think unemployment is going to be higher and a bunch of people in the Blue Chip who think unemployment is going to be lower.	13	1
201507	2526	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s interesting that one of the things that, as a whole, the Blue Chip has been consistently wrong about for the past seven years is what’s going to happen to inflation.	13	1
201507	2527	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So, again, while I agree or disagree with particular components of it, I think that it’s really important that we encourage the staff to take an independent view.	13	1
201507	2528	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll make one other comment on that.	13	1
201507	2529	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Regarding the labor participation rate trend line, again, I don’t think it would be a good idea for the staff to feel that they had to get their trend line to actually track the data for any relatively short period of time.	13	1
201507	2530	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I believe the coherent argument that has been made by the staff is that, because of the nature of the crisis and the recession, there were substantial dislocations in labor markets, which are only slowly returning to what people would anticipate to be trend.	13	1
201507	2531	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	They’ve adjusted their trend line for labor participation at least twice since I’ve been here, taking into account not only demographics, but also shifts that they’ve seen in the patterns of behavior of middle-aged and older people leaving the workforce permanently sooner rather than later.	13	1
201507	2532	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think recent experience has validated the instinct that the staff had, because, with participation having been more or less flat for a couple of years, it’s actually gotten closer to the trend line, just as they’ve been predicting for several years.	13	1
201507	2533	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll turn now to a couple of things that I had prepared to say.	13	1
201507	2534	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	On labor markets, as many people have commented, we’ve had continued improvement across most dimensions with the notable exception, I still think, of wages.	13	1
201507	2535	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	After an upward tick, average hourly earnings ticked back down again, so they’re in the same 12-month range that they’ve been in for quite some time.	13	1
201507	2536	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The ECI has gone up, but Eric already made the point I would have made—that the ECI, in particular, incorporates incentive pay, which has actually been pretty significant in a number of industries.	13	1
201507	2537	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So it may not be as revealing of underlying wage trends as some of the other measures.	13	1
201507	2538	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I was thinking this weekend—in the inevitable seven- to eight-week effort to ask, “What can you say that’s new?”—that I actually now believe that the story of wages in this recovery was written by Samuel Beckett.	13	1
201507	2539	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is not an overly literary crowd, I can tell.	13	1
201507	2540	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2541	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I will now elaborate, although I appreciate that the Chair got it.	13	1
201507	2542	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	It might not be a funny reference.	13	1
201507	2543	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	[Laughter]	13	1
201507	2544	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’re waiting.	13	1
201507	2545	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Beckett had his boy character appear only twice to announce that Godot would not be arriving today but would surely be arriving the next day, whereas we have heard predictions of accelerating wages and anecdotal reports of same more or less continuously during the past couple of years.	13	1
201507	2546	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, while Godot never did arrive, sending Vladimir and Estragon to the point of suicide, most of us probably believe that accelerating wages will.	13	1
201507	2547	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	There have been numerous efforts both inside and outside the System to determine just when that might be, based on historical correlations between accelerating wage increases in post-recession periods and other labor market indicators.	13	1
201507	2548	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to mention a couple of relatively recent efforts by Federal Reserve economists that I found both interesting and well thought through.	13	1
201507	2549	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But precisely because they turn out, perhaps, not to be correct, I think they’re a cautionary tale about reading too much into any effort to create such correlations.	13	1
201507	2550	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	One, which I believe hasn’t been reduced to a paper yet but was presented within various parts of the System earlier this year, suggests that wages begin to accelerate when the post-recession unemployment rate has declined between 70 and 80 percent of the way from its recession high to its pre-recession trough.	13	1
201507	2551	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The other, which is a little less numerically determinate, maps historical correlations between the quits rate and wage increases and concludes that a rise in the former is a good predictor of a later rise in the latter.	13	1
201507	2552	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	That is a Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Fed Letter—it was just posted on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s website.	13	1
201507	2553	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to the first, if my arithmetic is right—not always a foregone conclusion—we’ve now already retraced more than 80 percent of the increase in unemployment from the pre-recession low to the recession high without noticeable and persistent wage acceleration.	13	1
201507	2554	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And when I looked at the charts that were presented by the authors of that presentation, by the time that 70 to 80 percent had been reached, there was already a quite persistent and noticeable increase.	13	1
201507	2555	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to quits, while the quits rate has been rising for some years now, it has only relatively recently gotten back into the lower end of its pre-crisis range.	13	1
201507	2556	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So it may be a little bit early to judge how well this correlation holds up in the present recovery.	13	1
201507	2557	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	If I read the paper right, President Evans, I think that paper was not actually trying to make a very firm numerical determination but was instead just trying to suggest directionally that this is when you can begin to expect some acceleration of wages.	13	1
201507	2558	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	My point, as in past discussions, is that the origins of the 2007–09 recession and the ensuing recovery in a financial crisis may mean that there will be very different trajectories in the labor market, as there have been in some other areas.	13	1
201507	2559	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So we should remain open to the possibility, even the likelihood, that things won’t be following the same pattern as they have been in the past several recessions and recoveries, and we have to instead look for nontransitory evidence in the data.	13	1
201507	2560	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	All of that, of course, is against the backdrop of the considerable uncertainty about the relationship between wage acceleration, even when it does occur, and price inflation.	13	1
201507	2561	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Turning to international factors, I want to talk about two that, again, several people have mentioned that carry some downside risk.	13	1
201507	2562	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The first is China.	13	1
201507	2563	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I do not pretend to understand what is going on in China, and I certainly don’t have very much confidence in my own assessment of the risks of a significant drop-off in economic growth there.	13	1
201507	2564	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	What I’ve noticed is that people who speak to Chinese officials or who analyze data tend to discount the stock market turmoil and take a relatively optimistic view that China’s growth will stabilize around where it’s now reported to be, whereas people who do business in China tend as a group to be more pessimistic and view the overleveraged stock market as a harbinger of other problems.	13	1
201507	2565	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Being in neither group—I guess that’s not true because at FSB meetings, I talk to Chinese officials—I can readily identify cognitive biases in both groups, so I don’t know whose story is more convincing.	13	1
201507	2566	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But what I think is relatively clear is that there isn’t much upside risk in China these days.	13	1
201507	2567	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So, while the risks it poses to global economic growth and, through the mechanism of reduced demand for commodities, to downward pressures on inflation may be hard to quantify for now, those risks are not balanced by any realistic upside risk that, say, Chinese economic growth is going to improve to between 8 and 9 percent over the next couple of years.	13	1
201507	2568	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the dollar, the Tealbook already projects significant drags on US growth over the next four to six quarters stemming from negative net exports, the reasons for which Steve explained in his introductory remarks.	13	1
201507	2569	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Because the Tealbook also projects only a small additional increase in the trade-weighted value of the dollar during that period, what they’re projecting is mostly a J-curve effect.	13	1
201507	2570	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But against the backdrop of the Tealbook’s stipulation of a September federal funds rate increase, the Tealbook projection embeds the assumption that most of the capital investment shift associated with divergent monetary policies has already been priced into relative markets.	13	1
201507	2571	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	This may well be the case, but I think there are at least some reasons to think otherwise.	13	1
201507	2572	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The first, of course, is the fact that rates have been at the zero lower bound here for more than six and a half years.	13	1
201507	2573	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So there may have developed more entrenchment of positions that haven’t moved so much, even in response to the increasingly explicit predictions of rate rises that many have been announcing.	13	1
201507	2574	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Second, any near-term increase in US rates will have been accompanied by a decrease in effective rates in much of the rest of the world.	13	1
201507	2575	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The only clear exceptions already are South Africa and Brazil, and the United Kingdom looms out there as potentially an exception along with us.	13	1
201507	2576	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Accommodation has been enhanced significantly in both the euro zone and Japan through their QE programs.	13	1
201507	2577	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is a great statistic:  Rate reductions by central banks in the rest of the world have outnumbered increases 44 to 4 since the beginning of the year.	13	1
201507	2578	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The 4 are, again, 2 in South Africa and 2 in Brazil.	13	1
201507	2579	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So I wonder whether the traditional pattern of markets buying on rumors and selling on the fact may not hold true here, and whether there may be the potential for greater cross-border capital flows if we increase rates before either economic or financial conditions have become more mixed in the rest of the world.	13	1
201507	2580	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	The risk here is, I believe, a little more balanced than that with respect to China, because, if the Greek situation continues to be a problem mostly for the Greek people and not for the rest of the euro zone, one can definitely imagine the euro strengthening somewhat.	13	1
201507	2581	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I think it very unlikely that there would be a significant depreciation of the dollar when we start raising rates, whereas there is at least a modest risk of a significant appreciation.	13	1
201507	2582	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2583	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2584	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201507	2585	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2586	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	What have we learned since the June meeting?	13	1
201507	2587	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m tempted to say, “Not much,” in light of the paucity of new US economic data in the intermeeting period.	13	1
201507	2588	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	However, the little data that we have received do support continued confidence in the trajectory of the economy.	13	1
201507	2589	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Moreover, some of the near-term uncertainties on the international environment have materially diminished.	13	1
201507	2590	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The labor market has continued to strengthen.	13	1
201507	2591	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Payrolls averaged 220,000 per month in the second quarter.	13	1
201507	2592	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The unemployment rate dropped to 5.3 percent in June and now is 0.3 percentage point below last December’s reading, although some of that is probably due to the 0.3 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate in June, which it may well reverse—I certainly hope that it does.	13	1
201507	2593	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Nonetheless, labor market slack continues to diminish.	13	1
201507	2594	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I have a comment on the box on pages 20–21 of Tealbook A.	13	1
201507	2595	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The box, on employment and unemployment in the staff projection, describes a pro-cyclical relationship between the different measures of employment in the establishment survey as compared with the household survey.	13	1
201507	2596	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	That difference is a big part of what’s driving the baseline forecast of a significant slowdown in the pace of decline of U-3 in the household survey in the face of still-strong payroll growth.	13	1
201507	2597	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So it’s a very important box, and I applaud its inclusion in the Tealbook.	13	1
201507	2598	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	As the box says, this pro-cyclical relationship has held somewhat consistently, but not totally consistently, across prior recoveries, and I continue to think that there’s a significant chance that U-3 will decline faster and reach a lower level than the forecast shows, given payroll growth.	13	1
201507	2599	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	We also now have more evidence that the stalling of GDP in the first quarter was anomalous.	13	1
201507	2600	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	In addition, some of the real weakness in the first half came from the drop in oilfield investment, and the recent bottoming out in oil rig counts indicates that the substantial drag from that sector may have run its course.	13	1
201507	2601	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Although the recent further decline in oil prices may spur a bit more of a pullback, I don’t expect that it will be as extreme as what we’ve just been through.	13	1
201507	2602	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So the second half should be stronger than the first.	13	1
201507	2603	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The staff’s second-half GDP forecast is notably more downbeat than that of private forecasters, most of whom seem to be at 2½ percent or above.	13	1
201507	2604	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	David Wilcox noted earlier that that was principally due, we think, to net exports.	13	1
201507	2605	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	We’re not submitting a real GDP growth forecast for this round, but I feel that, at a minimum, there’s risk to the upside.	13	1
201507	2606	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I want to stop there for a second and echo what Governor Tarullo said earlier.	13	1
201507	2607	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’ve chosen, with some trepidation, to depart from the staff forecast on a couple of items.	13	1
201507	2608	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I want to say that I appreciate that what you do is to take a position, explain it with great transparency, and not be too concerned about where the public consensus is.	13	1
201507	2609	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Then you grade yourself in the back of the book and show how the actual performance was.	13	1
201507	2610	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I think there’s a lot of value in that, and I appreciate the thoughtfulness that goes into it.	13	1
201507	2611	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	One of the risks to economic growth that was frequently noted in the last go-round in June was the disruptions from developments in Greece and China, and those risks do seem much lower now, as has been noted by many around the table.	13	1
201507	2612	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	There’s been no important fallout to date from the ongoing Chinese stock market correction.	13	1
201507	2613	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Greece now seems to be headed toward a new deal with its creditors and not to an exit.	13	1
201507	2614	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Even if that deal doesn’t get done, the measures taken over the past several years in Europe seem to have successfully inoculated the periphery from contagion from Greece.	13	1
201507	2615	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So it seems to me that the risks to our economy from international developments have diminished materially since the June meeting.	13	1
201507	2616	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	An additional risk I mentioned earlier is the risk that the expectation and reality of increasing policy rates in the United States will cause the dollar to strengthen more than forecast, causing a further decline in net exports as demand is shifted abroad.	13	1
201507	2617	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Unfortunately, this risk seems likely to be with us as long as global economic growth remains weak, and the sharp decline in commodity prices does suggest that that could be a while.	13	1
201507	2618	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to inflation, the other half of our mandate:  The price and wage data clearly present some challenges.	13	1
201507	2619	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The staff estimates that total PCE inflation was only 0.2 percent for the 12 months ending in June, and that core inflation was only 1¼ percent.	13	1
201507	2620	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, headline inflation is being pulled down by oil prices, and that will end.	13	1
201507	2621	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The staff estimates that core inflation is also being held down about 40 basis points by the indirect effects of energy and import prices.	13	1
201507	2622	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	That would suggest that underlying core inflation may be around 1.7 percent.	13	1
201507	2623	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	It therefore seems to me reasonable to expect, with some degree of confidence, that core and total inflation will move back up to 1¾ percent once these temporary factors are behind us.	13	1
201507	2624	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	However, the recent decline in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar will restrain inflation throughout the second half of this year and, to a much lesser extent, next year, and that may present a real communications challenge throughout the fall as the Committee considers liftoff.	13	1
201507	2625	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	A related challenge comes from the wage data.	13	1
201507	2626	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Wage pressures are everywhere in the anecdotes but still not that easy to find in the data.	13	1
201507	2627	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Average hourly earnings, the most prominent wage measure, rose only 2 percent over the 12 months ending in June.	13	1
201507	2628	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	By contrast, as others have noted, the ECI is now at 2.6 percent over the trailing 12 months, although, as President Rosengren and others have mentioned, there are reasons to doubt the sustainability of that measure.	13	1
201507	2629	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	We’re going to get several readings on labor compensation before the September meeting—including another ECI, average hourly earnings, and compensation per hour—which may help clarify our assessment of labor market conditions as well as ease the challenge of communicating that assessment.	13	1
201507	2630	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2631	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2632	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201507	2633	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2634	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The data since June have contained few surprises on the domestic front, although the price of oil is down about 20 percent and the exchange rate is up an additional 3 percent since then.	13	1
201507	2635	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I want to underscore the observation made earlier that, while we have seen a welcome return to moderate economic growth in the second quarter, we have not seen a bounceback sufficient to compensate for the slowdown in the first quarter relative to what had been anticipated.	13	1
201507	2636	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to improve steadily.	13	1
201507	2637	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Consumption remains moderate, buoyed by strong fundamentals, but apparently not strong enough to overcome the continued drag on investment and production from earlier oil price declines and the persistent effects of a stronger exchange rate.	13	1
201507	2638	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Inflation remains noticeably and persistently below our 2 percent target.	13	1
201507	2639	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me take each of those in turn.	13	1
201507	2640	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The current data suggest that net exports subtracted a little over 1 percentage point from GDP growth over the first half of this year, and the staff’s econometric model suggests that trade will continue to exert substantial downward pressure on demand through 2016.	13	1
201507	2641	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Given this restraint and the relatively moderate pace of increase in domestic demand, increases in overall demand are likely to remain quite limited.	13	1
201507	2642	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there are numerous factors supporting consumer demand—rising real income, high net worth, and buoyant sentiment—the recent data continue to suggest that consumer spending is rising at a relatively moderate pace of around 3 percent over the middle of the year.	13	1
201507	2643	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on housing starts and permits point to further gains in residential investment, but the rise in activity remains gradual and the contribution to overall demand relatively modest.	13	1
201507	2644	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The drag on business investment due to last year’s sharp decline in oil prices looks to be fading, with the sharp fall in drilling rigs over the first half of this year leveling out.	13	1
201507	2645	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, new orders for capital goods and measures of business sentiment suggest fairly tepid increases in investment spending over the second half of this year, and the implications of the recent drop in oil prices are as yet unclear.	13	1
201507	2646	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Meanwhile, government spending looks to add very little to aggregate demand growth this year.	13	1
201507	2647	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The pace of improvement in the labor market has been stronger than that for aggregate demand for some time, with the difference being reflected in strikingly weak measured productivity growth.	13	1
201507	2648	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market improvement has been steady but somewhat more gradual so far this year.	13	1
201507	2649	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The sizable decrease in the overall unemployment rate in the July report was offset by a decline in labor force participation; it also came with a somewhat surprising drop in average hourly earnings growth.	13	1
201507	2650	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Job gains have clearly slowed from last year’s very rapid pace.	13	1
201507	2651	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Looking at a wide range of labor market indicators suggests to me that some slack still remains, even with overall unemployment at 5.3 percent.	13	1
201507	2652	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent demographic changes and other structural changes in the labor market, as well as still-subdued wage growth, suggest that the natural rate could be below the current level of the unemployment rate.	13	1
201507	2653	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As has been discussed at some length, slack also exists on the labor force participation margin.	13	1
201507	2654	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Despite some cyclical improvement over the past year or so, the participation rate remains below what I believe to be its structural trend.	13	1
201507	2655	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The number of those out of the labor force but wanting a job, as well as other measures of marginally attached nonparticipants, still appears elevated relative to pre-recession norms, and the same is true of the share of employees working part time for economic reasons.	13	1
201507	2656	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	That said, the labor market certainly continues to show improvement.	13	1
201507	2657	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In contrast, incoming data so far have not provided grounds for reasonable confidence on the inflation leg of our dual mandate.	13	1
201507	2658	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data suggest an underlying trend of price inflation of around 1¼ to 1½ percent.	13	1
201507	2659	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The 12-month change in core PCE prices, for example, is estimated to have been 1¼ percent in June, while the 12-month change in the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean was 1½ percent in May.	13	1
201507	2660	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	These rates are quite similar to the 1¼ percent average pace of core inflation over the past several years.	13	1
201507	2661	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As the effect of dollar appreciation on core import prices fades and resource utilization tightens further, I would expect that inflation will rise toward our 2 percent target.	13	1
201507	2662	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But, in view of the absence of any noticeable response of inflation to the reduction in resource slack over the past several years and the apparent flattening of the Phillips curve, the increase is likely to be quite gradual.	13	1
201507	2663	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Furthermore, the risks to the inflation forecast seem to be tilted to the downside.	13	1
201507	2664	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although inflation expectations have been quite stable, there are some hints of some movement downward.	13	1
201507	2665	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	This is true if you look at market-based inflation expectations; we’re also seeing that in survey measures.	13	1
201507	2666	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As I mentioned earlier, we’ve seen a further leg down in crude oil prices and some increase in the trade-weighted dollar.	13	1
201507	2667	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	There’s also a fair risk that the downward pressure on inflation due to dollar appreciation and falling commodity prices could stretch beyond this year.	13	1
201507	2668	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	This last concern follows from the foreign economic outlook.	13	1
201507	2669	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	China is slowing to an unknown degree and exerting a drag on both commodity prices and the growth prospects of commodity exporters.	13	1
201507	2670	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although reported Chinese GDP growth was surprisingly robust in the second quarter following relatively weak first-quarter growth, the extent to which this may reflect a temporary run-up in the financial sector that is already reversing is unclear.	13	1
201507	2671	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Other indicators, such as commodity prices and economic growth in other East Asian economies, suggest a slowing in Chinese economic growth sufficient to exert a drag more globally.	13	1
201507	2672	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Meanwhile, economic difficulties in other important emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia, are likely to continue for some time.	13	1
201507	2673	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	A number of our close trade partners, such as Canada and Mexico, have also slowed.	13	1
201507	2674	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The departure of Greece from the euro zone was avoided this month, so I see less risk as being associated with those scenarios.	13	1
201507	2675	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But, of course, negotiations on a third program are likely to be contentious, and Greek economic progress is likely to be limited over the next year.	13	1
201507	2676	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	More broadly, uncertainty and weak internal demands seem likely to weigh on economic activity within the euro area, ensuring that monetary policy will stay extremely accommodative throughout the medium term, and that any contribution of Europe to global demand will remain pretty limited.	13	1
201507	2677	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	For all of those reasons, I expect foreign developments to continue to exert deflationary pressures.	13	1
201507	2678	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As the contrast between a US economy on the verge of raising short-term rates and foreign economies in which monetary accommodation is likely to continue becomes increasingly apparent to market participants, the risks of further dollar appreciation may well increase.	13	1
201507	2679	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As markets adjust to relatively weak demand growth in both advanced and emerging economies, global deflationary pressures could be quite persistent.	13	1
201507	2680	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	An economic outlook featuring moderate US demand growth, still-present economic slack, persistently below-target inflation, and downside risks from abroad has important implications for monetary policy, which we will return to in tomorrow’s meeting.	13	1
201507	2681	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201507	2682	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201507	2683	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	My thanks to everyone for another interesting round of comments on the economic outlook.	13	1
201507	2684	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve been at it a long time today, so I’m going to dispense with my usual summary.	13	1
201507	2685	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Today I’d just like to make a couple of comments of my own.	13	1
201507	2686	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	For me, the data flow during the intermeeting period will be critical in deciding whether it’s appropriate to raise the funds rate target range in September.	13	1
201507	2687	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So I thought I’d comment on what I’ll be looking for in judging whether our two liftoff conditions have been met.	13	1
201507	2688	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with the labor market, in my view, conditions have clearly improved somewhat since earlier in the year when we set out as a condition for liftoff that we need to see further improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201507	2689	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Based on your comments, I think this view was pretty widely shared.	13	1
201507	2690	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate is down from 5.5 percent at the time of our March meeting to 5.3 percent in the June report, and the improvement in broader measures of labor utilization has been more noticeable, with U-6 down from 11 percent to 10½ percent now.	13	1
201507	2691	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The labor force participation rate is down a bit since the March meeting, and the employment-to-population ratio is unchanged, but the sideways movement of the employment-to-population ratio represents an improvement on the underlying demographic trend.	13	1
201507	2692	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So the staff estimates that the cyclical component of this ratio has narrowed modestly over the past four months.	13	1
201507	2693	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Payroll gains have averaged almost 200,000 per month in the four labor market reports we received since the March meeting.	13	1
201507	2694	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s down considerably from the large gains seen, on average, over the previous 12 months, but the recent pace is nonetheless healthy.	13	1
201507	2695	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	If it’s maintained over the next few months, that’s consistent with a further modest rise in labor utilization.	13	1
201507	2696	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, not all of the labor market indicators are better.	13	1
201507	2697	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The JOLTS quits rate has moved sideways, and the hiring rate is actually down a bit relative to the data we had in hand back in March.	13	1
201507	2698	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The ECI released in April suggested a pickup in wage growth.	13	1
201507	2699	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve had a very interesting discussion around the table, and, of course, as President Rosengren noted, there are a lot of question marks about how to interpret this reading, in view of the fact that the pickup is concentrated in the Northeast.	13	1
201507	2700	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	June’s disappointing reading on average hourly earnings also calls into question whether any pickup in wage gains is actually under way.	13	1
201507	2701	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Even so, not every indicator needs to move in the right direction for us to reasonably say that overall conditions have improved.	13	1
201507	2702	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In that regard, the labor market conditions index, prepared by the Board’s staff, has registered gains in recent months.	13	1
201507	2703	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The real issue is not whether there has been some improvement since March, but rather whether there’s been enough to justify liftoff.	13	1
201507	2704	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I think waiting until we’ve seen some further improvement is advisable, but I also believe that we could have sufficient evidence in hand by the time of the September meeting.	13	1
201507	2705	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	For example, if monthly payroll gains in July and August come in around 200,000 or so, on average—perhaps accompanied by a rise in labor force participation—I would likely judge the cumulative improvement to be sufficient.	13	1
201507	2706	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, stronger readings on average hourly earnings and the ECI would strengthen the case for me.	13	1
201507	2707	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	To be clear, I would not see such a limited amount of additional improvement as sufficient to return us to full employment.	13	1
201507	2708	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Like the staff and many of you, I believe that we still have a ways to go beyond what is likely to be accomplished in the next couple of months.	13	1
201507	2709	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We aren’t that far off anymore, and, provided that the outlook for economic growth is sufficiently strong to support a continued tightening of the labor market, I wouldn’t see a problem with starting the normalization process before all slack in the economy has been eliminated.	13	1
201507	2710	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	This economic growth requirement also bears on the other criterion we established for liftoff.	13	1
201507	2711	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me next turn to the conditions that will allow me to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few years.	13	1
201507	2712	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Inflation data over the past few months have been in line with staff projections and my own expectations.	13	1
201507	2713	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you noted, these data serve to confirm our assessment that the downward pressure on inflation stemming from the huge earlier fall in energy prices would prove to be temporary and indirectly support our assessment that the effects of past dollar appreciation will also fade.	13	1
201507	2714	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In the meantime, however, oil prices have fallen some more, leading the staff to revise down its forecast for inflation appreciably in the second half of the year and, especially, in the fourth quarter.	13	1
201507	2715	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thus, we will face a communications challenge if we choose to lift off this year because headline PCE inflation on a 12-month basis is likely to remain close to zero until early 2016.	13	1
201507	2716	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, as David showed, referencing core inflation may not be of much help either, as the staff projects the available readings on 12-month core PCE inflation to continue to run close to 1¼ percent through the December meeting.	13	1
201507	2717	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	At liftoff, we will need to make a good case for projecting that inflation is heading back to 2 percent.	13	1
201507	2718	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	To me, that case largely rests on the basic nature of the inflation process.	13	1
201507	2719	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Based on the econometric evidence, I’m persuaded that something like the staff’s inflation model provides a reasonable way to assess the outlook.	13	1
201507	2720	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	According to this model, inflation should move back up to 2 percent over the medium term and in an environment of full employment, provided that longer-run inflation expectations remain anchored at their pre-crisis level and we don’t experience further significant price shocks.	13	1
201507	2721	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Most of the more complicated, DSGE, models maintained around the System make the same prediction and for essentially the same reasons.	13	1
201507	2722	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In these models, longer-run expectations serve as an attractor to which inflation converges in the absence of offsetting pressures.	13	1
201507	2723	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, there’s a lot we don’t understand about the inflation process.	13	1
201507	2724	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	All of these models may be wrong or incomplete in some important way, but that’s true of any model.	13	1
201507	2725	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think the appropriate standard to apply here is not that we have complete confidence in our models, but rather that our models do a reasonably good job of explaining the historical data and are not outperformed by some other forecasting procedure with a significantly different outlook.	13	1
201507	2726	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I believe that’s the case.	13	1
201507	2727	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, the staff’s estimates suggest that current survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations are not, in fact, consistent with inflation converging not to 2 percent, but instead to a modestly lower level.	13	1
201507	2728	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	If so, I would see that as roughly equivalent to saying that the natural rate of unemployment is somewhat lower than our current estimate, a possibility we always face due to the uncertain nature of our supply-side estimates.	13	1
201507	2729	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We deal with such uncertainty by continually reassessing our estimates of the natural rate and adjusting the stance of monetary policy accordingly.	13	1
201507	2730	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So if the staff’s analysis of the survey evidence is correct, we’ll find that bringing inflation back to 2 percent requires a stronger labor market than we now anticipate.	13	1
201507	2731	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As a result, I expect that, in response to incoming data, we’ll find ourselves raising the federal funds rate somewhat more slowly over time than we now expect.	13	1
201507	2732	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Like President Kocherlakota, a factor that I think is somewhat concerning is the decline over the past year in far-dated market-based measures of inflation compensation.	13	1
201507	2733	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	This decline, which has been partially reversed in the past few months, calls into question the premise that longer-run inflation expectations have remained stable over the past seven years and thus the forecast that inflation is headed back to pre-crisis levels.	13	1
201507	2734	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Fortunately, staff analysis suggests that most of the decline probably represents a shift in liquidity and inflation risk premiums rather than an actual fall in expectations per se.	13	1
201507	2735	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, these data won’t lead me to raise serious questions about my inflation projection—particularly if they continue to drift back up toward their old level—but a renewed decline in inflation compensation would certainly give me pause.	13	1
201507	2736	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The most important factor affecting my confidence will be the outlook for economic growth and the labor market.	13	1
201507	2737	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll need to see incoming data suggesting that real GDP growth will be enough above trend to complete the return to full employment even as interest rates rise.	13	1
201507	2738	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	If so, I likely will be reasonably confident that resource utilization will prove sufficiently tight to bring inflation back to 2 percent over the medium run.	13	1
201507	2739	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But if the prospects for economic growth were to weaken in the near term, then I will be reluctant to begin the normalization process even if the cumulative improvement in labor market conditions has been appreciable.	13	1
201507	2740	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As many of you noted, one recent favorable development for the outlook has been that the risks from the Greek debt situation have diminished, although Greece still faces a daunting path to debt sustainability.	13	1
201507	2741	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I, like several others, will be watching developments in China carefully because I judge the downside risks to be significant.	13	1
201507	2742	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ll conclude by making two additional points about economic conditions and policy after the first increase in the funds rate.	13	1
201507	2743	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, I judge that, under appropriate policy, the unemployment rate probably needs to fall below its longer-run natural rate temporarily.	13	1
201507	2744	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As I mentioned, like the staff, I judge that actual labor market slack currently exceeds the amount suggested by the unemployment gap.	13	1
201507	2745	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I therefore think that an expeditious return to maximum employment will likely require the unemployment rate to undershoot my estimate of its longer- run normal level for a time in order to foster the tight conditions needed to bring labor force participation and involuntary part-time employment back to their normal, cyclically adjusted levels.	13	1
201507	2746	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Alternatively stated, the effective short-run natural rate, in my view, is lower than my assessment of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.	13	1
201507	2747	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	A period of somewhat tighter labor and product market conditions is also necessary to increase the likelihood that inflation will return to 2 percent at an acceptable pace.	13	1
201507	2748	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	This is a point illustrated by some of the Tealbook B simulations.	13	1
201507	2749	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Second, I’d note that it’s likely to be quite a while before the Committee can be fully confident of its outlook that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201507	2750	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Based on the staff forecast, we will have to wait until early 2016 for the data to confirm that the inflation effects of lower oil prices and a higher dollar were, indeed, completely transitory.	13	1
201507	2751	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	It will take yet longer to confirm that inflation is moving back to 2 percent rather than just plateauing at around 1½ percent.	13	1
201507	2752	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	With verification of our basic inflation forecast likely to emerge so gradually, the normalization process will probably need to proceed quite cautiously.	13	1
201507	2753	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We may also want to explore alternatives to the “reasonably confident” language in our public statements, both at liftoff and beyond, to better indicate the uncertainty that we face.	13	1
201507	2754	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	13	1
201507	2755	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have a choice.	13	1
201507	2756	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Either we could ask Thomas to begin his monetary policy briefing now or we could quit and go have dinner.	13	1
201507	2757	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	How about we do the following.	13	1
201507	2758	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think we have plenty of time tomorrow morning.	13	1
201507	2759	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll start off at 9:00 am  Thomas will begin his monetary policy briefing then.	13	1
201507	2760	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You want to be perfectly fresh for something so deep and sophisticated.	13	1
201507	2761	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Right.	13	1
201507	2762	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Absolutely.	13	1
201507	2763	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thomas, we don’t want to shortchange you at all.	13	1
201507	2764	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re doing this for you, Thomas.	13	1
201507	2765	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	2	2
201507	2766	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will start off giving Thomas our full attention at 9:00 am  In the meantime, let’s go have a drink.	2	2
201507	2767	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	2	2
201507	2768	2015-07-29	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201507	2769	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	July 29 Session .	2	2
201507	2770	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201507	2771	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	This morning we’re going to start off with Thomas’s briefing about monetary policy alternatives.	21	2
201507	2772	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201507	2773	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201507	2774	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Your first exhibit reviews market participants’ monetary policy expectations and their economic conditionality.	21	2
201507	2775	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The top two panels plot the probability distributions for the timing of liftoff derived from federal funds rate futures quotes—on the left— and responses to the Desk’s Survey of Primary Dealers—on the right—that Simon also showed in his briefing.	21	2
201507	2776	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Both show very low odds of policy firming at this meeting.	21	2
201507	2777	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As Simon noted, some care needs to be taken in deriving probabilities from federal funds futures quotes to control for market participants’ assumptions about where in the target range the effective federal funds rate will trade.	21	2
201507	2778	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Under the assumption that it will trade in the middle of the range, the odds of liftoff in September based on federal funds futures are 33 percent; they are 40 percent, on average, in the dealer survey.	21	2
201507	2779	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Both show lower, but still significant, probabilities that policy normalization will begin in December, and, according to federal funds futures, there is roughly a 25 percent chance that it might begin only in March of next year or later.	21	2
201507	2780	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As you can see from the dashed lines, investors’ views have changed little since the time of the June FOMC meeting.	21	2
201507	2781	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The next three panels shed some light on investors’ views about the medium-term path for the federal funds rate as well as the economic forecasts that underlie these policy expectations.	21	2
201507	2782	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown on the left, almost three-quarters of the primary dealers are anticipating that core PCE inflation during 2016 will be at or very close to 2 percent.	21	2
201507	2783	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The expectation of the median respondent, shown by the blue vertical line, is close to that in the June SEP, shown by the black vertical line.	21	2
201507	2784	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	At the same time, as illustrated on the right, most dealers are anticipating that, by the end of next year, the unemployment rate will have fallen more noticeably below their estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate than was true for the SEP median.	21	2
201507	2785	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The dots in the bottom-left panel show the paths of the federal funds rate associated with these economic projections.	21	2
201507	2786	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The dealers’ expectation of a substantial tightening in resource utilization and of core inflation returning to close to 2 percent in 2016 seems consistent with the fact that most of them expect policy normalization to begin in September.	21	2
201507	2787	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But although the median dealer expects labor markets to tighten somewhat faster than the median June SEP respondent, the median dealer’s projection of the federal funds rate is identical to the median SEP dot at the end of 2016 and slightly lower at the end of 2017.	21	2
201507	2788	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	This slightly lower path than in the SEP might reflect an expectation of a more accommodative policy stance or, alternatively, a lower path of the equilibrium real interest rate.	21	2
201507	2789	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the lower-right panel, the primary dealers assign greater-than-even odds to the pace of tightening in the first year after liftoff being 100 basis points or less, and these expectations are essentially unchanged from June.	21	2
201507	2790	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Averaging across the Desk’s two surveys, the pace of tightening in the first two years following liftoff is about 100 basis points per year, conditioned on not returning to the zero lower bound.	21	2
201507	2791	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Returning to the lower-left panel, although the dealer survey traces an expected path for the federal funds rate not too different from the June SEP, the path derived from OIS quotes—the red line—runs substantially lower.	21	2
201507	2792	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In part, this difference might reflect term premiums associated with the benefits of holding these nominal assets in states in which the federal funds rate remains very low.	21	2
201507	2793	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	While decomposing these risk-neutral expectations into term premiums and risk-adjusted expectations is challenging—especially with short-term rates at their effective lower bound—staff estimates suggest that only a modest share of the discrepancy between the OIS path and the other two paths can be explained by negative term premiums over the first two years.	21	2
201507	2794	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, the marginal investors in this market seem to anticipate a yet more gradual pace of policy rate increases.	21	2
201507	2795	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In sum, while market participants seem to be prepared for the possibility of policy tightening at your next meeting, they expect a lower trajectory of the federal funds rate over subsequent years than is embedded in the SEP median, after controlling for differences in their economic outlook to the extent we can.	21	2
201507	2796	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the draft statements for this meeting, the three alternatives offer a range of characterizations of current and prospective progress toward the Committee’s economic objectives and of the likelihood of policy tightening (or further policy tightening) at upcoming FOMC meetings.	21	2
201507	2797	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As indicated in the bullets in the top panel of your second exhibit, alternative B is intended to convey the Committee’s assessment that the economy has been evolving in such a way that it could become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in September, provided that the Committee sees additional progress toward maximum employment and becomes reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	21	2
201507	2798	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	However, the language of the statement would express sufficient dependence on the incoming data to avoid deliberately shifting the current probability distribution of the timing of liftoff toward September and to retain the option to defer the start of normalization.	21	2
201507	2799	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The message of paragraph 1 would be that the economy is again expanding moderately, with solid job gains and declining unemployment providing evidence of continued improvement in the labor market—one of your criteria for commencing normalization.	21	2
201507	2800	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	To underscore the Committee’s view of the importance of the cumulative progress in labor market conditions, paragraph 1 would note that “underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.”	21	2
201507	2801	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 3 would provide an additional indication that the Committee sees labor market conditions as having moved closer to those that would be consistent with policy normalization, saying that the Committee needs to see “some” further improvement in the labor market.	21	2
201507	2802	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative B would leave largely unchanged the Committee’s previously stated assessment of current and expected inflation developments and would repeat that it still needs to become reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.	21	2
201507	2803	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	However, the draft of paragraph 1 suggests dropping the reference to energy prices having stabilized.	21	2
201507	2804	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The change would recognize that crude oil prices have fallen back a bit over the intermeeting period, and it could be read as suggesting that the drag on headline inflation from energy prices might not dissipate as quickly as previously anticipated.	21	2
201507	2805	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As I indicated earlier, investors currently view September as the most likely meeting at which policy normalization will begin, and most dealers expect no material change to the forward guidance in today’s postmeeting statement.	21	2
201507	2806	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That would seem to imply that a draft statement like alternative B would not elicit a significant market reaction or shift the probabilities of the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate noticeably.	21	2
201507	2807	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	However, as we noted in Tealbook B, if market participants interpret the insertion of “some” in paragraph 3 as boosting the odds of a decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate in September, then interest rates might rise, equity prices could fall, and the dollar would likely appreciate.	21	2
201507	2808	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As noted in the middle panel, the draft statement for alternative A would provide an assessment of labor market conditions and inflation that would indicate that the Committee does not anticipate seeing, for some time, conditions that would warrant the beginning of policy normalization.	21	2
201507	2809	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Such a statement would likely shift the distribution of expectations regarding the date of policy tightening noticeably later.	21	2
201507	2810	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 of alternative A would report that “in light of economic and financial developments abroad, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as tilted to the downside.”	21	2
201507	2811	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	And it would indicate the Committee’s concern that “inflation could run substantially below the 2 percent objective for a protracted period.”	21	2
201507	2812	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	This concern would be emphasized by the introduction of a stronger inflation criterion for policy normalization in paragraph 3 and the addition of a commitment to use all of the Committee’s tools to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years “if inflation does not begin to rise soon.”	21	2
201507	2813	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The draft for alternative C—summarized in the lower panel—would present an assessment of economic conditions and the outlook consistent with a decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.	21	2
201507	2814	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	More important, it introduces for your consideration a number of other changes that you might make when you announce the start of policy normalization.	21	2
201507	2815	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	First, paragraph 2 would modify the reference to the policy assumption underlying the Committee’s outlook to indicate that it expects to continue to make “appropriate adjustments in the stance of monetary policy.”	21	2
201507	2816	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 3 would set the stage for additional increases in the target range for the federal funds rate and would add a sentence emphasizing the Committee’s view that, “even after this adjustment, the stance of policy remains highly accommodative and will continue to support a strong economy.”	21	2
201507	2817	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The new sentence would link the Committee’s assessment of the overall stance of policy directly to its principal policy tool—the funds rate.	21	2
201507	2818	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In the current statement, that assessment only appears at the end of paragraph 4, in which the Committee states that keeping the balance sheet sizable “should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.”	21	2
201507	2819	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative C also provides several options for updating the forward guidance concerning future adjustments of the federal funds rate after normalization begins.	21	2
201507	2820	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In paragraph 4, you might choose to follow the language of the Committee’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and communicate that the Committee’s decisions will depend on its assessment of realized and expected “deviations from its objectives.”	21	2
201507	2821	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	However, if you are concerned that the reference to “deviations” would suggest that the Committee has a numerical definition of labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment, you may want to say more broadly that you will assess “economic conditions relative to” your objectives.	21	2
201507	2822	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In either case, the draft offers an option of retaining the current guidance that the Committee “will take a balanced approach” to pursuing its objectives.	21	2
201507	2823	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	And, finally, while paragraph 4 would repeat the Committee’s expectation that “economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run,” it would also communicate that the Committee’s assessment might change as economic conditions evolve by stating that the actual path for the target range “will depend on the incoming data.”	21	2
201507	2824	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201507	2825	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That concludes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201507	2826	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201507	2827	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	To begin our go-round, I’d like to say just a few words about our policy decision and, in particular, our communications with the public.	23	2
201507	2828	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Economic conditions appear to be evolving in a manner that will likely make it appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime this year.	23	2
201507	2829	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	That was the message coming from the June SEP, and, based on what I heard during the economic go-round, I don’t believe that view has materially changed.	23	2
201507	2830	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As was evident from my own remarks yesterday as well as from my own recent public communications, I believe that liftoff at our next meeting, in September, is a distinct possibility.	23	2
201507	2831	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	This decision, however, remains dependent on the data and their implications for the outlook.	23	2
201507	2832	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Hence, in our communications, we face the challenge of striking the right balance between keeping our options open, on the one hand, and not taking markets completely by surprise, on the other.	23	2
201507	2833	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Depending on how the data evolve and, along with them, both our thinking and that of the markets, achieving this balance may be tricky, and our public communications between now and liftoff will be under enormous scrutiny.	23	2
201507	2834	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In considering this challenge, I went back and reviewed our policy on external communications, and I’m pleased that it offers some clear and useful guidance for us.	23	2
201507	2835	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, the first principle of our policy is that every Committee participant has an obligation to enhance the public’s understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.	23	2
201507	2836	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So I would ask you to try to keep this principle in mind at all times, but especially now, when there’s such tremendous focus on the timing of liftoff.	23	2
201507	2837	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have explicitly adopted a data-dependent approach to policy, and we’re not yet in a position to determine when we will raise rates.	23	2
201507	2838	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Opining in public on the exact timing of the first move, in my own view, not only detracts from our consensus-driven deliberative process, but also can easily confuse markets and the general public, adding to volatility and, ultimately, diminishing the effectiveness and credibility of our policy.	23	2
201507	2839	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the more we talk about the precise timing of the first move, the more we stoke the media’s attention on one particular change in interest rates.	23	2
201507	2840	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	To be sure, the initial increase in the federal funds rate will be noteworthy, as it will mark the end of an extraordinary period of near-zero rates.	23	2
201507	2841	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But, based on the economics, liftoff arguably contains more symbolism than substance.	23	2
201507	2842	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As I’ve emphasized in my public statements, it is the entire expected path of the policy rate that matters for financial conditions in the economy, not just the initial increase.	23	2
201507	2843	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And the real issue we will face is how cautiously we raise rates after liftoff to ensure that the economy can really absorb higher interest rates, and that inflation is truly heading back to 2 percent.	23	2
201507	2844	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, our communications guidelines affirm that participants are free to present their own views, but it’s critical that this be done in a way that clearly distinguishes one’s individual view from the Committee’s agreed-upon policy stance.	23	2
201507	2845	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would note that our policy explicitly prohibits making a prediction about Committee action in advance of the Committee announcement of its decision.	23	2
201507	2846	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So my suggestion for all of us is to refrain from speculating about the time of liftoff.	23	2
201507	2847	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	One useful formulation when asked about liftoff is to say that no decisions have been made, the Committee remains focused on the data, and you look forward to discussing this decision with your colleagues at the next FOMC meeting.	23	2
201507	2848	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	If pressed, three additional points might be useful.	23	2
201507	2849	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, this can be seen from the June SEP.	23	2
201507	2850	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	If economic conditions evolve as expected, most FOMC participants view a first move sometime this year as likely.	23	2
201507	2851	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Second, even after the initial increase, policy will remain accommodative to support progress toward our dual objectives.	23	2
201507	2852	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, finally, as I just noted, it is the overall path of the policy rate that is of greatest import for the economy and not simply the first move.	23	2
201507	2853	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me end by noting that it’s conceivable to me that some type of communication may be warranted if we find ourselves in a situation in which the Committee appears inclined to raise the federal funds rate at our next meeting but markets, in the run-up, appear to be judging it as unlikely.	23	2
201507	2854	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In that case, my inclination might be to make some widely available public comments through some sort of event or interview to try to better align public expectations for our near- term deliberations.	23	2
201507	2855	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I want to assure you that, before doing this, I would certainly consult with you to hear your thoughts and advice.	23	2
201507	2856	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there, begin our go-round, and remind you that, in addition to your thoughts on today’s policy decision, it would be very useful if you could also provide your views regarding the suitability of alternative C for a meeting at which we first decide to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.	23	2
201507	2857	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’re going to begin with President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201507	2858	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	2859	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Before I begin, I was wondering if I might have an opportunity to ask Thomas a question.	22	2
201507	2860	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Oh, I’m sorry.	22	2
201507	2861	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I apologize.	22	2
201507	2862	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I should have allowed questions for Thomas.	22	2
201507	2863	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s do that.	22	2
201507	2864	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	22	2
201507	2865	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have a question about the addition of the word “some” in alternative B, paragraph 3.	22	2
201507	2866	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wasn’t sure what that was supposed to connote beyond what was already in paragraph 1.	22	2
201507	2867	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Paragraph 1 describes that labor markets have improved.	22	2
201507	2868	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re getting closer, presumably, to whatever represents maximum employment because of that progress.	22	2
201507	2869	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’m not sure what the word “some” was supposed to connote beyond what was already in paragraph 1.	22	2
201507	2870	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	My personal thinking is that it’s not unambiguous that “further improvement in the labor market” has a fixed starting point.	22	2
201507	2871	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	It could be simply measured in terms of further improvement from wherever you are today.	22	2
201507	2872	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I think what the “some” signifies is simply that there is, in fact, implicit in this a fixed starting point, which was when the Committee first adopted this language, and that some of that distance has been traveled and only some of it remains.	22	2
201507	2873	2015-07-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s what it’s intended to clarify.	22	2
201507	2874	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there further questions for Thomas before we begin our go- round?	22	2
201507	2875	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	22	2
201507	2876	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201507	2877	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	23	2
201507	2878	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, with the exception of a few months in late 2011 and early 2012, core PCE inflation has been below our adopted target of 2 percent for nearly seven years.	23	2
201507	2879	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The outlook in Tealbook A is that it will not return to target until the next decade.	23	2
201507	2880	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I do not see this outcome as consistent with our commitment to keep inflation at 2 percent over the longer run.	23	2
201507	2881	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How can we do better?	23	2
201507	2882	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff provides a clear answer to this question in the excellent optimal control simulations in Tealbook B, in which they put zero weight on unemployment falling below the natural rate.	23	2
201507	2883	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Basically, we can facilitate a more rapid return of inflation to target if we are not averse to living in an America in which the unemployment rate is below 5 percent for several years.	23	2
201507	2884	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, for those of us in the Ninth District, we can tell you it’s not so bad to have unemployment below 5 percent.	23	2
201507	2885	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We live with it all the time.	23	2
201507	2886	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So if we’re willing to make policy choices that give rise to unemployment rates in the 4s for an extended period of time, then those policy choices will push inflation back to target in a much more timely fashion.	23	2
201507	2887	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, the optimal control exercises also indicate that we could obtain those outcomes, even if we initiate liftoff later this year rather than waiting longer, as long as we raise the federal funds rate very slowly, by about 10 basis points per quarter.	23	2
201507	2888	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I’m not convinced this “go early and super slowly” approach is the best one.	23	2
201507	2889	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A key part of what makes these policies work in the simulations is, the agents in the model know that the FOMC is not averse to having unemployment below 5 percent.	23	2
201507	2890	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the real world, the public doesn’t know that, and I don’t believe that lifting off in, say, September would signal that clearly.	23	2
201507	2891	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	From this communications point of view, we would be much better off deferring liftoff until, say, the latter portion of next year and then raising the federal funds rate more rapidly than 10 basis points per quarter.	23	2
201507	2892	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the footnotes in Tealbook B suggest, we would get pretty similar inflation and unemployment outcomes by doing that—as long as assumptions in the model are met, of course.	23	2
201507	2893	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	All of this is based on the modal outlook.	23	2
201507	2894	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I talked yesterday about some of the downside risks—possibly adverse international outcomes and a further downward slide in inflation expectations.	23	2
201507	2895	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought Governor Brainard’s comments on the dollar were ones that really sharpen the points I was attempting to make about international risks.	23	2
201507	2896	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Especially in light of the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound, these risks also support deferring liftoff until we have a stronger inflation outlook.	23	2
201507	2897	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am sure that some of you, perhaps many of you, are undoubtedly concerned about other risks:  a possibility that the Phillips curve may prove to be considerably steeper than what the staff has modeled, or that risks to financial stability arise from low interest rates.	23	2
201507	2898	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These are absolutely legitimate concerns.	23	2
201507	2899	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee meets eight times per year and gets plenty of advance warning for these particular outcomes.	23	2
201507	2900	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ll hear about and see inflationary pressures through the behavior of inflation itself and through our intelligence- gathering efforts.	23	2
201507	2901	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The QS report, through the diligent work of our staff, will reveal risks to financial stability.	23	2
201507	2902	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we feel that the QS report is not designed to elicit the kinds of risks to financial stability that we’re concerned about, we should be letting our staff know what other information they should, in fact, be including in that report.	23	2
201507	2903	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Importantly, not only do we get the information about these risks when they actually materialize, but this Committee also has the tools to deal with these risks, should they transpire.	23	2
201507	2904	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It can increase rates more rapidly; it can halt reinvestments sooner; and it can, if needed, sell assets.	23	2
201507	2905	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is in contrast with the downward risks, concerning which we’re so constrained by the zero lower bound.	23	2
201507	2906	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I urge the Committee to be willing to pursue our 2 percent inflation objective with urgency, even if that pursuit results in an unemployment rate under 5 percent for an extended period of time.	23	2
201507	2907	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I recommend alternative A.	23	2
201507	2908	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	While I’m recommending alternative A, I do have a comment about alternative B, which follows up on the question I asked Thomas.	23	2
201507	2909	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I would suggest not including the word “some” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201507	2910	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that a good discipline on all communication is, we should be adding words if we have a very specific message we want to deliver.	23	2
201507	2911	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not sure what message the Committee is attempting to deliver.	23	2
201507	2912	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the Committee is attempting to deliver the message that September is very “live” in its thinking, the route you were describing whereby you were going to have a public set of remarks during the intermeeting period seemed like a much more useful way to proceed.	23	2
201507	2913	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	2914	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	2915	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201507	2916	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	2917	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201507	2918	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Between now and the September meeting, we will have two employment reports and further evidence on whether we are experiencing wage and price acceleration consistent with returning PCE inflation to 2 percent in the medium term.	23	2
201507	2919	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I’m reasonably confident that labor markets will continue to improve, particularly in light of the apparent waning of several important geopolitical concerns, I need to see more data to determine whether we are returning to our 2 percent inflation target within a reasonable horizon.	23	2
201507	2920	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Although the oil price decline and dollar appreciation since the end of last year are likely to be attenuating, recent movements in oil prices and the exchange rate indicate that these forces may be continuing to influence pricing developments.	23	2
201507	2921	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook has a very gradual return to our inflation target.	23	2
201507	2922	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to see a more rapid return, and, currently, that pace remains uncertain.	23	2
201507	2923	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	My own view is that, in September, core PCE inflation may be as likely to fall further as to rise—not probabilities consistent with reasonable confidence of a return to target.	23	2
201507	2924	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The economy is approaching a point at which the Committee will confront a difficult decision at each meeting.	23	2
201507	2925	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If labor markets continue to improve and the wage and price data show further evidence of inflation returning to target, I could be persuaded that September was the time for liftoff.	23	2
201507	2926	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I can easily imagine that wage and price data will not be improving as hoped, and that a later liftoff would be appropriate.	23	2
201507	2927	2015-07-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The statement is data dependent, and I believe we should be open minded to reacting only when the data have confirmed the conditions we have set out in our statement.	23	2
201507	2928	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	2929	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201507	2930	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	2931	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B as written, and I agree with President Rosengren about the use of the word “some.”	23	2
201507	2932	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it does, as Thomas explained, capture the fact that we’ve made significant progress in terms of our employment mandate.	23	2
201507	2933	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic conditions look increasingly favorable.	23	2
201507	2934	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most important, the labor market has improved steadily this year.	23	2
201507	2935	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Although we may not be quite there yet, we are finally closing in on full employment.	23	2
201507	2936	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, while inflation remains low, the most recent data are consistent with a gradual return to 2 percent.	23	2
201507	2937	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, with oil prices dropping again and the dollar having edged up some, the return to 2 percent may be delayed a bit longer, but the experience over the past year confirms that those effects will be transitory.	23	2
201507	2938	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Between now and our next meeting, a deluge of data on wages, prices, spending, and labor market conditions will be released, and this counsels a bit more patience.	23	2
201507	2939	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, barring any major surprises, I anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target funds rate at our September meeting.	23	2
201507	2940	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Looking ahead to that time, I support the overall approach taken in alternative C.	23	2
201507	2941	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It provides a smooth transition from past statements, which focus on the conditions for liftoff, to future statements, which will focus on the likely path of policy normalization.	23	2
201507	2942	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I agree with President Rosengren.	23	2
201507	2943	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I see this statement, maybe, as the bridge between the past and future statements in which we will be trying to describe the future policy decisions.	23	2
201507	2944	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this statement is a transition statement to get us from one point to the next.	23	2
201507	2945	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I agree with your point about the need for talking about future policy normalization.	23	2
201507	2946	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that regard, I have two comments on how we should frame our policy decisions in this post-liftoff era, thinking ahead to the statements of the future once we’ve raised rates.	23	2
201507	2947	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	First, when we’re nipping at the heels of full employment, we’ll need to get away from language that implies that we need to see further improvement in the labor market for rate hikes.	23	2
201507	2948	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	For example, it could well be appropriate in the future to raise rates even if the labor market softens a bit between meetings, assuming I’m talking about a situation in which the unemployment rate is around 5 percent.	23	2
201507	2949	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Instead, future statement language should focus more, I think, on the overall strength of the labor market—that is, the level, rather than the change.	23	2
201507	2950	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess that’s just a sign of the success I’m foreseeing in terms of our employment mandate over the rest of this year.	23	2
201507	2951	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, I’m concerned about how the bracketed “balanced approach” language in paragraph 4 of alternative C could be interpreted in a rising rate environment.	23	2
201507	2952	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, this language may pose communication risks when inflation is below target and the unemployment rate is at or below the perceived longer-run natural rate of unemployment, a scenario described by the Chair in her comments yesterday, and a characterization of my own forecast.	23	2
201507	2953	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, it’s a situation in which we are appropriately pushing unemployment below 5 percent—picking up on the comments of President Kocherlakota, too—in order to bring inflation back to 2 percent, but inflation is still too low.	23	2
201507	2954	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As noted in our consensus statement, “balanced approach” refers to situations in which we’re trading off conflicting goals.	23	2
201507	2955	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the circumstances I’m considering here, it’s unclear what we are balancing or trading off.	23	2
201507	2956	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Does a low unemployment rate on its own require a restrictive policy adjustment that would delay the attainment of our 2 percent inflation objective?	23	2
201507	2957	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This issue is nicely illustrated by the Tealbook optimal control simulation using asymmetric weights on positive and negative unemployment gaps, a simulation that features a more accommodative policy stance and faster attainment of the inflation goal than implied by the standard symmetric quadratic loss function, as President Kocherlakota just mentioned.	23	2
201507	2958	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Economic theory does not provide clear guidance on this issue.	23	2
201507	2959	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Unquestionably, the unemployment rate can be too low from an efficiency point of view.	23	2
201507	2960	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, the longer-run natural rate of unemployment—the unemployment rate consistent with constant inflation—can and likely does differ from the efficient, socially desirable level.	23	2
201507	2961	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the longer run, our inflation mandate implies that this tension must be resolved in favor of the natural rate of unemployment, and our consensus statement makes that point.	23	2
201507	2962	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this doesn’t answer the shorter-run question of how to weigh deviations from our longer-run employment goal in our policy deliberations.	23	2
201507	2963	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As President Kocherlakota has pointed out in previous meetings and again today, we as a Committee haven’t really discussed this issue at any length, nor have we come to any definitive conclusion.	23	2
201507	2964	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, to be clear, I’m not advocating a particular position on the current level of the efficient level of unemployment or the short-term natural rate of unemployment that the Chair mentioned yesterday relative to the longer-run natural rate.	23	2
201507	2965	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just highlighting an important issue in terms of framing our policy communications because of the uncertainty about how best to think about this.	23	2
201507	2966	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because of the high degree of uncertainty associated with the measures of full employment that we’re trying to reach, I am wary of including the “balanced approach” language in the way that is laid out in alternative C.	23	2
201507	2967	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Astute observers will take notice and may raise sensitive and, ultimately, distracting questions about whether perceived excess employment, which President Kocherlakota says seems to be quite pleasant, is resulting in a tighter setting for monetary policy.	23	2
201507	2968	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To avoid the potential for such an unforced error, in the parlance of tennis, I prefer the language that emphasizes “economic conditions relative to” rather than the “deviations from,” and prefer not to include the bracketed “balanced approach” language in our future statements as described in alternative C.	23	2
201507	2969	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201507	2970	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	2971	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201507	2972	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	2973	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In my view, the incoming data continue to indicate that the economy can support an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate from today’s very low, essentially zero, level.	23	2
201507	2974	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Economic growth has strengthened, the labor market has improved notably over the past year, and I expect that to continue.	23	2
201507	2975	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Continued economic expansion and improvements in the labor market, the stability of longer-term inflation expectations, and recent stabilization in some of the inflation measures make me reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium run.	23	2
201507	2976	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I do believe we need to be data dependent.	23	2
201507	2977	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	But, barring any significant negative surprises, I believe the conditions we’ve indicated for liftoff will have been met by September.	23	2
201507	2978	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	What’s important for me today is that our statement not preclude September as an option for liftoff.	23	2
201507	2979	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Personally, I probably would have preferred that we move further toward laying the foundation for the rationale for liftoff.	23	2
201507	2980	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	As we discussed yesterday, conveying the points that monetary policy needs to be forward looking, and that our inflation models project inflation to return to 2 percent over the medium run even if the current measures of inflation are underrunning 2 percent, is going to be key to that rationale.	23	2
201507	2981	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Nonetheless, I believe the language in alternative B keeps September alive, so I support it.	23	2
201507	2982	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I appreciate that paragraph 1 gives some indication of the longer-term gains we’ve seen in the labor market, rather than focusing solely on the developments over the intermeeting period.	23	2
201507	2983	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 3, I support adding the word “some” to the liftoff conditions for the labor market.	23	2
201507	2984	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I think that’s appropriate because it acknowledges the progress we’ve seen, and I agree with Thomas’s explanation of the value of adding that word.	23	2
201507	2985	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	With liftoff getting near, I believe it’s appropriate that we consider the language we’ll want to use at the time, and I’m glad the Chair has asked us to comment specifically on alternative C language.	23	2
201507	2986	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I do think this statement will also serve as a liftoff statement.	23	2
201507	2987	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Paragraph 1 provides a longer-term perspective on economic developments, which is appropriate in our statement, not only at liftoff but also beyond.	23	2
201507	2988	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	As paragraph 3 does, it is important to remind the public that, even after this initial increase in the funds rate, policy will remain highly accommodative and supportive of the economy.	23	2
201507	2989	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I like not only the addition of “some” to paragraph 3 in alternative B, as I’ve already said, but also the evolution of the statement in alternative C.	23	2
201507	2990	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	In paragraph 4 of alternative C, I appreciate the inclusion of a language choice in this version of the statement.	23	2
201507	2991	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I have a strong preference for saying that we’ll assess “economic conditions relative to” our objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation, rather than “deviations from,” because I think one of the issues the Committee has struggled with over the past few years is how to explain that, while we do have a numerical objective for our price- stability objective, we do not have one for our maximum-employment objective.	23	2
201507	2992	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I believe speaking about deviations might be misconstrued as implying that we have a numerical goal, and this is the explanation that Thomas gave.	23	2
201507	2993	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	My initial thought about our saying in paragraph 4 that we will take a balanced approach to pursuing objectives was that it was okay because this language is used in our Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy statement.	23	2
201507	2994	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	But I want to think about some of the issues that President Williams raised with respect to using this in this statement at this particular time.	23	2
201507	2995	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So I need to consider that further.	23	2
201507	2996	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	I agree that including language that our path is anticipated to be gradual is appropriate.	23	2
201507	2997	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	We’ve been saying that, but I also think that adding the language that it’s data dependent would be helpful.	23	2
201507	2998	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Finally, because of the scrutiny any change to our statement gets, there will be few times when we can make significant changes to the structure of the statement without risking something being read into it.	23	2
201507	2999	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Liftoff affords us the opportunity, because the focus is going to be solely on our action.	23	2
201507	3000	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	So this might be a time to return to the structure of making the policy decision the first paragraph of the statement, as we did before the crisis.	23	2
201507	3001	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Or, as they say in journalism, we might take the opportunity to stop burying the lede.	23	2
201507	3002	2015-07-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3003	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3004	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201507	3005	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3006	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy decision in alternative B.	23	2
201507	3007	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I also support the alternative B statement as presented.	23	2
201507	3008	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I see paragraph 1 as a good characterization of the state of the economy.	23	2
201507	3009	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I like the effect of the phrase “since early this year” in the sentence on underutilization of labor resources.	23	2
201507	3010	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it appropriately widens the aperture in discussing progress and conveys that the Committee is considering and giving weight to accumulated gains, and that it will not be unduly influenced by one month’s data, if they are disappointing.	23	2
201507	3011	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I also favor the insertion of the word “some” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201507	3012	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I hope this small change in wording will be seen as a slight foreshadowing of a possible move in September and therefore serve to prepare markets without conveying any sense that liftoff in September is a certainty.	23	2
201507	3013	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Although these messages are subtle, I think the statement positions the policy question appropriately.	23	2
201507	3014	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding alternative C as a template for a liftoff statement, I can envision wording similar to that in paragraphs 1 and 2 working well at the time of liftoff.	23	2
201507	3015	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll make some small points, however, about paragraphs 3 through 5.	23	2
201507	3016	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Yesterday, I was part of the group that explicitly or implicitly argued for putting balance sheet policy in the background relative to interest rate policy.	23	2
201507	3017	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thomas earlier pointed out that the added sentence in paragraph 3 is intended to link the overall stance of policy with the funds rate as the principal policy tool.	23	2
201507	3018	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	To be consistent with my remarks yesterday, I have to agree with this approach.	23	2
201507	3019	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll just point out, however, that we may not have totally wrestled to the ground the question of whether the overall stance of policy includes balance sheet policy, and therefore the added sentence might come later.	23	2
201507	3020	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In the same vein, the “balanced approach” wording in paragraph 4, which, at present, I think should stay in—I’m with President Mester in wanting to consider President Williams’s points earlier—and which used to be in the now-eliminated paragraph 6, could be made about an overall approach to setting policy that includes balance sheet policy.	23	2
201507	3021	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I raise these points as minor considerations.	23	2
201507	3022	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	On the bracketed choice in paragraph 4, I prefer the broader meaning of “economic conditions relative to” as opposed to the phrase “deviations from.”	23	2
201507	3023	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	To summarize, I think alternative C is workable for liftoff purposes, with some consideration of structure and sequencing in paragraphs 3, 4, and 5.	23	2
201507	3024	2015-07-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3025	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201507	3026	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201507	3027	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3028	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	First, let me say I share the concerns raised by President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201507	3029	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Until wages start rising, consistent with employment being—however you want to describe it—excessively high and inflation at or above 2 percent, I think there’s a chance the natural rate is less than 5 percent.	23	2
201507	3030	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So that’s worth watching.	23	2
201507	3031	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201507	3032	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t prefer including the qualifier “some” in paragraph 3.	23	2
201507	3033	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t believe it’s necessary, and I think the economic updates in paragraph 1 should be sufficient to capture the evolving fundamentals for our policy decision.	23	2
201507	3034	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But, having said that, I can certainly live with including “some” in the statement.	23	2
201507	3035	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	With regard to the question of whether alternative C contains the appropriate language for when the time does come to raise the target rate, I don’t have any major problems with that statement, either.	23	2
201507	3036	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I would prefer a couple of small changes—namely, maintaining the commentary in paragraph 2 that the Committee will be monitoring inflation developments closely.	23	2
201507	3037	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I think that would be important.	23	2
201507	3038	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I also would include the language in paragraph 4 regarding taking a balanced approach to our policy objectives.	23	2
201507	3039	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Of course, my comments are premised on the assumption that we actually have reasonable confidence that inflation will be getting back up to 2 percent within a reasonable period of time when we make this policy move.	23	2
201507	3040	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I could not support the language in the alternative if we were beginning to normalize policy before we were, in fact, reasonably confident of such an outcome.	23	2
201507	3041	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	For me, I’m still skeptical that the data will support reasonable confidence in this inflation outlook by the end of the year, if then.	23	2
201507	3042	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I thought it was interesting that, in the commentary yesterday on the Phillips curve, a number of people mentioned they had—however you want to describe it—confidence or faith that the Phillips curve would reassert itself in terms of inflationary dynamics.	23	2
201507	3043	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So I went back and revisited what the Phillips curve, as it’s usually employed in the Tealbook, looks like.	23	2
201507	3044	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	On the right side of the equation, you have a number of variables.	23	2
201507	3045	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	One of them is inflation expectations.	23	2
201507	3046	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Another is some transitory X variables, which, in this case, are going to play the part of oil prices, energy, the dollar—that type of thing.	23	2
201507	3047	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	They’re transitory and should be waning.	23	2
201507	3048	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Then, of course, there’s resource slack.	23	2
201507	3049	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The resource slack isn’t really contributing very much there one way or another, because we’re close to the natural rate of unemploymenr, and it’s not helping us get to 2 percent until we overshoot.	23	2
201507	3050	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Even then, it’s not going to help us very much, because the argument itself will be very small.	23	2
201507	3051	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	For anybody who’s done empirical work, it’s just really hard to get any noticeable slope on that, so the actual effect is pretty small.	23	2
201507	3052	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	People might remember times when it was larger, but, more recently, it’s very hard to get results like those.	23	2
201507	3053	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So most of the heavy lifting to get us to 2 percent is going to depend on this inflation expectations term and the waning contributions of the transitory factors, the X variables.	23	2
201507	3054	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s certainly reasonable that the contributions of the X variables are going to wane, but then that gets us to inflation expectations.	23	2
201507	3055	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t see how you get anything above 1.8 to 2 percent inflation in this kind of environment.	23	2
201507	3056	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook has the—whatever the term is—reference rate for longer-term inflation, which is not exactly longer-term inflation expectations, at about 1.8 percent.	23	2
201507	3057	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I hope it’s moving up.	23	2
201507	3058	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I understand the empirical reasons why we have longer-term inflation expectations in that equation.	23	2
201507	3059	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	It fits better, but the theory is really much more about a shorter-term kind of inflation expectation.	23	2
201507	3060	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	You can understand why that would provide some uplift, the so-called gravitational pull about which we all say, “If it’s moving from the two- to four-year variety of inflation up to the longer term, then that would get us up there.”	23	2
201507	3061	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s just really hard to see any risk of inflation being 2 percent or higher in this type of formulation, even if I have pretty good faith in the Phillips curve, unless I foresee pretty substantial overshooting on the resource side.	23	2
201507	3062	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	So I think there’s continued risk here that, when we say our objective is 2 percent, we start our normalization process, and we end up with something that looks like the Tealbook inflation projection, it’s going to be interpreted as indicating that 2 percent looks a lot like a ceiling.	23	2
201507	3063	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t believe we’re going to get above 2 percent.	23	2
201507	3064	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s one of the big risks that I really see with all of this.	23	2
201507	3065	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	I continue to be very nervous about that.	23	2
201507	3066	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	But, having said that, I certainly support alternative B today.	23	2
201507	3067	2015-07-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3068	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3069	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Harker.	23	2
201507	3070	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3071	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Although I’m not in favor of adjusting the funds rate at this meeting, both the underlying strength of the economy and my reasonably high level of confidence that inflation will return to target over the medium term incline me toward the view, conditioned on the data we will receive over the next several weeks, that September will be the correct time to lift off.	23	2
201507	3072	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	I also favor a gradual path of policy firming, which I believe will be made more likely by an earlier liftoff.	23	2
201507	3073	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	In the current economic environment, a gradual tightening of policy will maintain an accommodative policy stance for some time, which is appropriate in light of what has transpired over the past eight years.	23	2
201507	3074	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	While I agree that our statement language should emphasize that policy will remain data dependent, we should also recognize, to a greater degree, that economic conditions are now close to being consistent with our dual mandate.	23	2
201507	3075	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	To that end, I would suggest replacing the fourth sentence of paragraph 1 in alternative B with the fourth sentence of paragraph 1 in alternative C, and that would communicate that sentiment much better.	23	2
201507	3076	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	To me, alternative C also represents reasonable statement language for when we decide to liftoff.	23	2
201507	3077	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	It emphasizes two key elements that are recognized as necessary for liftoff—the substantial progress we’ve made on the economic front and our increased confidence that inflation is returning to target.	23	2
201507	3078	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Including these key elements will send a message that the Committee believes the economy is on solid footing and will underscore the confidence the Committee has in continued good economic outcomes.	23	2
201507	3079	2015-07-29	meeting	HARKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3080	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3081	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201507	3082	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3083	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	I have no objection to alternative B today from the standpoint that its posture keeps future meetings open for a decision to raise rates.	23	2
201507	3084	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Although liftoff is not on the table for this meeting, I could have supported it today, as economic data received since our June meeting generally confirm that economic growth resumed after a weak first quarter, with further improvement in labor markets and low and stable inflation.	23	2
201507	3085	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Assuming no big surprises in tomorrow’s GDP release, the current expansion is the fifth longest within the 33 US business cycles documented by the NBER.	23	2
201507	3086	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Not only are policy prescriptions flashing their support of higher rates, but also the Tealbook r* measure remains more than 1 percentage point above the actual real federal funds rate.	23	2
201507	3087	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Looking back at the past 10 years of Tealbook B and Bluebooks, this is among the most accommodative settings of policy over this period.	23	2
201507	3088	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Perhaps some of this was warranted, as policy was constrained by the effective lower bound.	23	2
201507	3089	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	But as conditions continue to normalize and this r* measure rises, the additional accommodation provided by the current stance of policy should be factored into our liftoff decision.	23	2
201507	3090	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of the suitability of alternative C for a meeting at which the Committee decides to raise the federal funds rate, I generally support the language shown, although I would keep the language focused on data dependence at that time and avoid references to deviations from our objectives.	23	2
201507	3091	2015-07-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3092	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3093	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201507	3094	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3095	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	At the April meeting, I made the case that conditions warranted higher interest rates.	23	2
201507	3096	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	That case was based on the sustained improvement in real activity we’d seen—strong consumer spending growth and labor market conditions—and the sense that forces damping inflation readings and depressing Q1 economic growth were temporary and likely to pass soon.	23	2
201507	3097	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The forward guidance we had in place at the time, however, precluded such a move, and the economic consequences of lifting off just a meeting or two later seemed small.	23	2
201507	3098	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	That basic assessment of economic conditions didn’t change for me in June, and, in fact, the data confirmed that transitory factors were dissipating.	23	2
201507	3099	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I thought a strong case could be made for raising rates then as well, although, again, the consequences of waiting seemed small.	23	2
201507	3100	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	As data have come in consistent with our outlook, the case for raising rates has been getting even stronger, making me less and less comfortable with further delay.	23	2
201507	3101	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Lifting off at a meeting without a prescheduled press conference would be a bit awkward, however, because markets clearly do not expect a move except under unusual circumstances, despite our statements to the contrary.	23	2
201507	3102	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But absent a significant unexpected turn in the data between now and our September meeting, I would oppose any further delay.	23	2
201507	3103	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	For today, I can support alternative B.	23	2
201507	3104	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	By softening the requirement for further labor market improvements, it prepares us for a September liftoff, which I think will be appropriate.	23	2
201507	3105	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	When we do lift off in September, I believe the language in alternative C is, for the most part, appropriate.	23	2
201507	3106	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The one exception to this is in paragraph 3, in which I would delete the last clause of the last sentence, which says “and will continue to support a strong economy.”	23	2
201507	3107	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	At best, this clause is redundant, because we begin by saying “policy remains highly accommodative.”	23	2
201507	3108	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	But I actually think it’s a bit worse than redundant, because it’s unbalanced relative to our objectives.	23	2
201507	3109	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	By singling out the real side, it risks reinforcing unrealistic expectations about the real effects of monetary policy in current circumstances.	23	2
201507	3110	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	With that deletion and without a marked change in the data flow, alternative C will work well in September.	23	2
201507	3111	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In fact, it would work well today, and it would have worked well in June, too.	23	2
201507	3112	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Finally, let me say a word about intermeeting data.	23	2
201507	3113	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate that we are and ought to be data dependent, but I don’t think we should insist that the last smidgen of data be an uptick.	23	2
201507	3114	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	We should be mindful of the frequency with which one month’s data reflect noise rather than signal.	23	2
201507	3115	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Madam Chair, you’ve emphasized the entire path of the federal funds rate.	23	2
201507	3116	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	That perspective suggests a focus on where economic conditions are likely to be a year or two down the road and what rate would be appropriate then, rather than the last month’s smidgen of data.	23	2
201507	3117	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, this perspective suggests evaluating current economic conditions in the context of how far we’ve come over the past six and a half years since we reduced rates to zero.	23	2
201507	3118	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In view of the millions of jobs the economy has added since 2009, it would seem perverse to delay liftoff if August payrolls fell short of expectations by, say, 100,000.	23	2
201507	3119	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	The intermeeting data should be broadly consistent with our assessment of economic trends, and the record that we’ve seen that’s documented those economic trends has included occasional hiccups in the data.	23	2
201507	3120	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I think we need to be mindful of that as we approach September.	23	2
201507	3121	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3122	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3123	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	23	2
201507	3124	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3125	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I support alternative B, even though its language could go further in acknowledging the progress that’s been made toward meeting the criteria for liftoff.	23	2
201507	3126	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Over the past six weeks, we have had confirmation of a bounceback from the economy’s first-quarter stall, we have had a tentative resolution of some of the international uncertainty with which we were concerned, and we have had direct evidence of further progress toward full employment.	23	2
201507	3127	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Confirmation that the economy is growing at an above-trend rate should give us increased confidence that inflation is on an upward track.	23	2
201507	3128	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	But we also have the direct evidence from the inflation rates we’ve seen since oil prices bottomed in January.	23	2
201507	3129	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	As mentioned yesterday, these include headline CPI and PCE, core CPI and PCE, and trimmed mean PCE.	23	2
201507	3130	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our outlooks for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation over the next year or two are more optimistic than those in the Tealbook.	23	2
201507	3131	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas staff economic forecasts are closer to the June SEP central tendency than they are to the latest Tealbook baseline.	23	2
201507	3132	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Anticipating stronger GDP growth, a lower path for the unemployment rate, and a higher path for inflation, we attach greater urgency to proceeding with policy normalization.	23	2
201507	3133	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I also think that using language like that in alternative C is appropriate to announce the start of normalization when the time comes.	23	2
201507	3134	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The changes from the draft circulated in June are all sensible and represent positive improvements.	23	2
201507	3135	2015-07-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3136	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3137	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201507	3138	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3139	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B for today, and I support the “some” language in paragraph 3.	23	2
201507	3140	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In my opinion, the Committee is in a good position for a September liftoff, depending on the incoming data.	23	2
201507	3141	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we are able to make the move based on relatively good news, it will be a good day for the US economy.	23	2
201507	3142	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I support the idea of starting the normalization process soon and going at a more gradual pace from there, depending on how the economy evolves.	23	2
201507	3143	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think we have maintained what are essentially emergency policy settings for a long time—possibly too long.	23	2
201507	3144	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we get into a position in which we have to move rates higher at a faster pace, the result may be considerably more volatile for financial markets and for the economy as a whole.	23	2
201507	3145	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Regardless of how monetary policy evolves during the remainder of this year, we have already committed to an exceptionally accommodative policy over the coming quarters and years.	23	2
201507	3146	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	This bet has already been made by this Committee.	23	2
201507	3147	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In my view, President Kocherlakota will get his wish.	23	2
201507	3148	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Under reasonable assumptions on labor force participation and the ratio of payroll employment to CPS employment, the US unemployment rate will soon fall well into the analysis.	23	2
201507	3149	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I also think that inflation will move toward target over the forecast horizon as temporary effects from oil and the dollar abate.	23	2
201507	3150	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we evaluate outcomes on inflation and unemployment based on a quadratic objective, we have rarely been as close to our goals over the postwar era as we are today.	23	2
201507	3151	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Yet policy remains at very aggressive settings, with the policy rate at zero and the balance sheet at $4.5 trillion.	23	2
201507	3152	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	We would be wise to find an appropriate opportunity to carefully back off these emergency settings.	23	2
201507	3153	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	An appropriate monetary policy will have the important benefit of extending the length of the expansion by moving rates to more normal levels and hedging our bets against imbalances that might develop, as they did during the 1990s and the 2000s.	23	2
201507	3154	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	The financial wealth-to-income ratio is higher today than it was in 1999 or 2007.	23	2
201507	3155	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have just a few comments on alternative C.	23	2
201507	3156	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In general, I think this statement will serve us well in the event of liftoff.	23	2
201507	3157	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 3, if I understood President Lacker’s suggestion, I would support truncating the last sentence at “highly accommodative” and simply ending the statement there.	23	2
201507	3158	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	That was your suggestion, I believe.	23	2
201507	3159	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	That would make some sense and is something we could consider.	23	2
201507	3160	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	In paragraph 4, like President Mester, I would prefer the “economic conditions relative to” language as opposed to the “deviations from.”	23	2
201507	3161	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Despite my nerdiness in liking “deviations” language, I think it’s too nerdy and too technical for a document of this type.	23	2
201507	3162	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	So it would be more appropriate to say “economic conditions relative to.”	23	2
201507	3163	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I also like the “balanced approach” language.	23	2
201507	3164	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’ve always felt as though that was excellent language to describe the Committee’s approach, but I want to further consider President Williams’s comments on this.	23	2
201507	3165	2015-07-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3166	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3167	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201507	3168	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3169	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B, particularly its identification of where we have made further progress toward our goals, which is primarily in the labor market, and situations that are more complicated, which is primarily with respect to inflation.	23	2
201507	3170	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the labor market, I support the inclusion of the word “some” in alternative B.	23	2
201507	3171	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to inflation, I am reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and I hope that we will be able, at the end of the next meeting of the FOMC, to put in place language like that in alternative C of this meeting’s Tealbook, though I reserve the right to suggest changes in September’s alternative B.	23	2
201507	3172	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In last month’s Tealbook A, Michael Kiley was responsible for a box that noted that the economy is closer to our goals now than it has been at just about any time over the past 50 years, as President Bullard has just said.	23	2
201507	3173	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	This helps explain why, in the July Tealbook B, Taylor rules with no inertia indicate that the federal funds rate is far too low.	23	2
201507	3174	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The Taylor (1999) inertial rule is also in agreement that it is time to begin normalization.	23	2
201507	3175	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If one consults the table on page 11 of Tealbook B, one sees that all of the six rules that are included in that table suggest takeoff this year, most of them—almost all of them, in fact—in September.	23	2
201507	3176	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	It is noteworthy that every one of the six monetary rules whose outcomes are presented in that table, which includes the dynamic results of the use of both the first-difference and optimal control rules, shows core PCE inflation rates of 1.6 to 1.8 percent in 2017 and 1.8 to 2 percent in 2018.	23	2
201507	3177	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Indeed, it is striking how little difference the different monetary rules make to the behavior of unemployment and inflation rates through 2019.	23	2
201507	3178	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	If one were to choose on the basis of the results of the rules shown on page 11, it is probably the first-difference rule that would come out ahead, although, in this case, one would very much like to see the extension of the simulations beyond 2019, because this is the rule that produces the Kocherlakota result but it doesn’t show us the dynamics of the bounceback to target.	23	2
201507	3179	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The dynamics of the FRB/US model mean that it’s hard to argue forcefully, on the basis of that model, about the perfect moment to move rates.	23	2
201507	3180	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We’ve probably all said at some time that it’s unlikely to make much difference whether we lift off in September or December—we used to say June or September—for we will be discussing an interest rate difference of only 25 basis points for one quarter.	23	2
201507	3181	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Actually, we say that, but with most of the rules we have, we’re actually discussing a path that is probably higher by 25 basis points for a very long time.	23	2
201507	3182	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	So it’s more than one quarter.	23	2
201507	3183	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I want, nonetheless, even if it were true that it didn’t make much difference, to mention eight reasons for starting the process of normalization.	23	2
201507	3184	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	First and foremost, we need to look ahead and set a framework for our strategy of normalization.	23	2
201507	3185	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	That strategy should be—and the Chair has said this repeatedly—timely and gradual.	23	2
201507	3186	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We control the timeliness.	23	2
201507	3187	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The data control the gradualness.	23	2
201507	3188	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	At present, I believe the process will be gradual.	23	2
201507	3189	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We should continue to make it clear, as the Chair has done and continues to do, that we believe that is what will happen, but we cannot promise it.	23	2
201507	3190	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Second, we’ve now held the nominal interest rate at its effective lower bound for six years and eight months.	23	2
201507	3191	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	In so doing, we’ve been sending a signal that the situation in the US economy is still extremely far from being normal.	23	2
201507	3192	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The interest rate aside, I do not believe that the current situation is extremely far from being normal, and I do not think that sending that message is good either for the economy or for the citizens of the United States.	23	2
201507	3193	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I do believe that if the FOMC sends a well-reasoned signal that we think the US economy is now strong enough to begin normalizing the interest rate, we would be providing an important boost to confidence for businesses and households.	23	2
201507	3194	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Third, I think that beginning normalization, when we’ve met the criteria that we have set out to meet, will enhance the credibility of the FOMC.	23	2
201507	3195	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Conversely, if we continue to delay, market participants and Fed watchers will not know what to make of our communications, and our credibility will suffer.	23	2
201507	3196	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	We may, as a result of the Great Recession, be entering a period of a new normal, but there is no normal in which the federal funds rate should be kept near zero.	23	2
201507	3197	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Fourth, we need to move because we have to regain our freedom of action to deploy a normal, two-sided monetary policy.	23	2
201507	3198	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the basis of revealed preferences, we seem to have given up on the use of QE.	23	2
201507	3199	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I continue to be puzzled, however, by the argument that we should not raise the interest rate from the effective lower bound because we might have to return it to that level.	23	2
201507	3200	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that we made considerable progress yesterday when Governor Tarullo, I think it was, began to talk about the desirability of building up a policy safety cushion to deal with possible future negative shocks to aggregate demand and to output.	23	2
201507	3201	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Fifth, that safety cushion should include a least two elements.	23	2
201507	3202	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The first is an interest rate level that is sufficiently high to provide a significant impetus to aggregate demand while being cut to a level above the effective lower bound.	23	2
201507	3203	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The second is either a willingness and ability to conduct normal, expansionary monetary policy through open market purchases or a balance sheet sufficiently large that variations in the rate of runoff can be deployed to adjust the level of stimulus provided by the size of the balance sheet.	23	2
201507	3204	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, this choice invites further thought on the timing and methods of normalizing the size of our balance sheet, which we began to discuss very interestingly and constructively yesterday and which I won’t consider further today.	23	2
201507	3205	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Sixth, the interest rate conveys price signals, among them a signal about the cost of waiting to make investment expenditures.	23	2
201507	3206	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	As long as we keep the interest rate at zero, we’re keeping the cost of waiting extremely low.	23	2
201507	3207	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	By beginning normalization, we would be sending a message that delaying an investment in capital equipment may be costly for a business, as the interest rate may increase.	23	2
201507	3208	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Seventh, we’re considering a measure that will move monetary policy from an ultra-expansionary stance to an extremely expansionary stance.	23	2
201507	3209	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	As we say in alternative C today, monetary policy will continue to be extremely supportive of economic growth.	23	2
201507	3210	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And that will be for some time after we begin normalization, for we are not about to lift off, which is vertical—we’re about to begin the process of gradual normalization.	23	2
201507	3211	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Eighth, we have to stop giving the impression that we are frozen in place.	23	2
201507	3212	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Among the incoming data in every period, there will be data that are less supportive and data that are more supportive of beginning liftoff.	23	2
201507	3213	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Each of us is free to emphasize one aspect or the other of that set of numbers.	23	2
201507	3214	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But as I said yesterday, we need to look at the big picture.	23	2
201507	3215	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	That picture is of an economy growing slowly, at the rate of about 2 percent or a bit higher, but with a labor market that has worked remarkably well over a long period, despite having had to contend with little support from fiscal policy and sometimes with a contractionary fiscal policy.	23	2
201507	3216	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s had to contend with an appreciation of the currency that has significantly reduced aggregate demand and some surprisingly negative influences from the decline in the price of oil.	23	2
201507	3217	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But despite all of that, as of now, the unemployment rate is near most estimates of the longer-term unemployment rate provided by participants in the SEP, and it is projected to continue declining.	23	2
201507	3218	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	And it is reasonable to expect the inflation rate to move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	23	2
201507	3219	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The criteria for beginning normalization have very nearly been met, and we need to be willing to move.	23	2
201507	3220	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	The balance we need to strike was set out yesterday in the Chair’s concluding remarks.	23	2
201507	3221	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, we are data dependent, and if the data falter again seriously or if the economy gets hit with a significant new negative shock, we will want to wait to see how things unfold.	23	2
201507	3222	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	But I would caution against interpreting small weaknesses as a reason to delay further the beginning of the normalization process.	23	2
201507	3223	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3224	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3225	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201507	3226	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3227	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, and, while I remain open to increasing the funds rate in September, as things currently stand and as I expect them to develop in the next seven weeks, that would not be my preferred policy option.	23	2
201507	3228	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Looking now at the two criteria we have laid out for the first federal funds rate increase, I think that, with respect to labor markets, there is no question that there has been a lot of improvement.	23	2
201507	3229	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But, for reasons I have explained multiple times at multiple meetings, I still believe there is a nontrivial amount of additional slack that could be taken up, and there are still no persistent signs of accelerating wage increases.	23	2
201507	3230	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me unlikely that, if and as those accelerating wage increases come, they would be rapid.	23	2
201507	3231	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So in a noninflationary environment, I regard the present circumstances as an opportunity to get further improvement in labor markets, in line with the part of our statutory dual mandate that obliges us to seek maximum employment.	23	2
201507	3232	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I think Presidents Evans and Kocherlakota have already pointed out, that effort may, in turn, help pull us closer to the inflation target.	23	2
201507	3233	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to note in passing, because there have been a number of references to people’s projections of the longer-term natural unemployment rate, that I personally think the natural unemployment rate is lower right now than I would anticipate it being in the longer run because of things like the unusual number of people working part time for economic reasons and the still- lower labor force participation rate.	23	2
201507	3234	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	As those things normalize over time, I would expect the natural rate to be closer to 5 percent, but my sense right now is that it is probably a little bit lower than that.	23	2
201507	3235	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to inflation, here, to be honest, I am having a hard time seeing how, right now at least, we can have reasonable confidence that inflation will return to the 2 percent target.	23	2
201507	3236	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	As a background point, I’ll note that FOMC practice does not appear to have maintained a symmetrical loss function with regard to the inflation target over the recent and, indeed, medium- term past.	23	2
201507	3237	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Over the past 20 years, inflation has been over target mostly because of oil shocks, but it has spent quite a bit of time under target, including much of the past eight years.	23	2
201507	3238	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, just by dint of the fact that I read what I’m about to say in one of the economic blogs, I can’t vouch for its precision, though it’s a pretty good blog.	23	2
201507	3239	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But the author had calculated that core and headline PCE inflation over the past 20 years averaged 1.75 percent and 1.86 percent, respectively, both under and, indeed, somewhat comfortably under what the FOMC has first implied and then said is its inflation target.	23	2
201507	3240	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Next, I’ll note that, although it is quite reasonable to state at a conceptual level that inflation should rise as the output gap shrinks, that intuition doesn’t tell us when is the best time to increase the federal funds rate and how quickly inflation may set in.	23	2
201507	3241	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Even if we are approaching full employment, we don’t know when and how quickly inflation would start to rise.	23	2
201507	3242	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Most answers I have heard to these questions that have counseled moving soon or, indeed, have counseled moving some time ago have basically been a matter of inference from past experience and correlations.	23	2
201507	3243	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Reasonable as that approach is as a starting point for policy decisions, I don’t think it should ever be an endpoint, particularly when current circumstances differ in significant ways from the past circumstances in which those correlations were observed.	23	2
201507	3244	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I believe it’s hard to get away from the fact that the environment we’re facing now is the product of a major financial crisis and the most serious recession we had had since the Great Depression.	23	2
201507	3245	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	What are some of the potentially different relevant circumstances today?	23	2
201507	3246	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Well, I see some of them as including the low-growth and disinflationary global environment and the seeming increases in propensities to save and to sit on a whole lot of cash, which may be associated with low levels of investment returns.	23	2
201507	3247	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, somebody drew my attention to the responses from the primary dealer survey to the question that was posed there about the current level of real equilibrium interest rates.	23	2
201507	3248	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	When one reads some of those responses, one may fairly ask just how much accommodation we really are providing right now.	23	2
201507	3249	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Economic growth is near trend, and we’re at the zero lower bound with the balance sheet where it is, and, in most people’s view, at least, we are not growing at substantially above trend.	23	2
201507	3250	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’m also sympathetic to those who counsel patience because we have ample means to tighten and to tighten pretty quickly if necessary, whereas, as we discussed yesterday, we at present have quite limited means for further accommodation if a federal funds liftoff were to prove premature.	23	2
201507	3251	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s not just a question of saying, “Well, would we go back immediately to zero if we needed to?”	23	2
201507	3252	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I believe we may increase the chances of a problem by lifting off somewhat prematurely.	23	2
201507	3253	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Obviously, there are some risks associated with a potential need later to go on a somewhat steeper rate, but that’s, as is often the case, a matter of balancing potential costs and potential benefits.	23	2
201507	3254	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	My own judgment is that the risks of moving prematurely are greater than the risks that a later, quicker move—presumably in an environment in which the economy is growing more quickly and inflation is actually rising—would pose.	23	2
201507	3255	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So my present inclination is, we should be awaiting some more concrete basis—both for thinking that we’re getting close enough to eliminating the output gap and for believing that price rises rather than, say, reduced profits will ensue—before assuming a position of reasonable confidence.	23	2
201507	3256	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, I do take seriously the proposition that, under certain unusual circumstances, it may be appropriate to tighten policy even in the absence of either maximum employment or inflation heading above target, on the grounds that failure to take such action would pose significant risks to attainment of those statutory objectives in the medium term.	23	2
201507	3257	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I also agree that such instances may be more likely to occur after a long period of stability and interest rates at low levels.	23	2
201507	3258	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But those risks don’t seem especially high right now.	23	2
201507	3259	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	There is ample reason to be paying attention to leverage and funding vulnerabilities, particularly outside prudentially regulated institutions, but right now, we don’t have generalized asset levels above historical norms with unusual amounts of leverage.	23	2
201507	3260	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, unlike some other countries, we don’t have the kind of activity in residential housing that would warrant action, even action specific to that sector, although that would, of course, require that anyone in the US government actually had authority to take such action, which nobody actually does.	23	2
201507	3261	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I am open to the possibility that there could be significant changes between now and September.	23	2
201507	3262	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But if we just keep chugging along between now and then without seeing something a bit new, I think my preference would be not to move.	23	2
201507	3263	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to make mention of something, and Vice Chairman Dudley may be returning to this theme in a moment.	23	2
201507	3264	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I do want to take notice of the points that Vice Chairman Dudley has quite sensibly made about why, other things being equal, December might not be the best time for an initial liftoff.	23	2
201507	3265	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I would add to the things the Vice Chairman has previously said the possibility of some fiscal drama at the end of the year.	23	2
201507	3266	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think he was trying to suggest that those considerations should be dispositive, only that they should be taken into account in deciding between September and possibly December or, for that matter, between December and possibly March.	23	2
201507	3267	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Looking at the language in today’s statement—specifically “some,” which is, I think, all there is to talk about in today’s statement—I have, as people know, generally been in favor of using paragraphs 1 and 2 to signal changes in our views, both of what’s happened and of what’s going to happen.	23	2
201507	3268	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’ve been somewhat leery of making changes in paragraph 3, on the grounds of, as I’ve said before, my little homey metaphor of a kitchen timer going off.	23	2
201507	3269	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think the insertion of “some” rises to that level.	23	2
201507	3270	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t believe it’s like some other adjectives that have been proposed over time.	23	2
201507	3271	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s a little ambiguous, actually, and might be read a little bit differently than people expect, but I think the odds are that it will be read as verifying or validating what the Chair said at her monetary policy testimony.	23	2
201507	3272	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	So although that doesn’t really reflect my own policy preference, I have to say that, if I end up coming around to the September view—or losing the battle and the FOMC moves anyway—as a matter of cost minimization, I don’t believe we would have wanted that move to have come as a surprise.	23	2
201507	3273	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Again, looking at the interests of monetary policy as a whole and the Committee as a whole, I think it is not a bad idea to inject something that at least will probably be read as validating what she said.	23	2
201507	3274	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I’m a little concerned that if there were no change in the statement at all, it might be read as saying the Committee backed off a little bit.	23	2
201507	3275	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, in the wake of all of the use of the word “September” by a number of you over the past several weeks, maybe that’s not that much of a risk, but I think it’s still some risk.	23	2
201507	3276	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Because people do look at what the Chair is saying and what the Committee is saying, that’s probably where we should be.	23	2
201507	3277	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the liftoff language, notwithstanding the fact that I’m probably at the other end of the policy spectrum from President Lacker, I agree with President Lacker’s suggestion to delete the clause “and will continue to support a strong economy” in paragraph 3, in part because I’m just not confident that we actually would continue to support a strong economy.	23	2
201507	3278	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to paragraph 4, I would prefer, wonkiness notwithstanding, the “deviations from” because I think it tracks more precisely what people have said, over time—that we’ve actually got a symmetrical loss function.	23	2
201507	3279	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	We look at both of them; we see the deviations.	23	2
201507	3280	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Then, for the same reason, I do like the “balanced approach” language, although, like everybody else, when the transcript comes out, I will study President Williams’s comments.	23	2
201507	3281	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3282	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3283	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I could repeat them.	23	2
201507	3284	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201507	3285	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Can you give them to us?	23	2
201507	3286	2015-07-29	meeting	TARULLO	Actually, if they’re written out, President Williams—several people might feel the same way—it might be really helpful if you could distribute them rather than our having to wait for the transcript.	23	2
201507	3287	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’ll wait for the transcript.	23	2
201507	3288	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	[Laughter]	23	2
201507	3289	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m sorry.	23	2
201507	3290	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I couldn’t avoid it.	23	2
201507	3291	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If you were sorry, you wouldn’t have said it.	23	2
201507	3292	2015-07-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201507	3293	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201507	3294	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3295	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I support alternative B today.	23	2
201507	3296	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	If incoming data arrive about as anticipated and the balance of risks doesn’t materially shift in a negative direction, I expect that I will continue to support a September liftoff as a reasonable course of action.	23	2
201507	3297	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	To me, the test of further improvement in the labor market seems to have been met.	23	2
201507	3298	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Although I believe there’s still some amount of slack, labor market conditions are now certainly more than close enough to full employment to warrant liftoff.	23	2
201507	3299	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So I would look for continued job gains and other evidence that the labor market continues to tighten.	23	2
201507	3300	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	The more difficult question is clearly whether there is a basis for reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective in the medium term.	23	2
201507	3301	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Current readings, especially headline, are well below that objective and will remain so through the end of the year.	23	2
201507	3302	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	However, that is mostly, but not entirely, due to lower oil prices and the stronger dollar, which are transitory factors that I would be inclined to look through.	23	2
201507	3303	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Underlying core inflation is actually closer to 1.7 percent or so, not that far from our objective.	23	2
201507	3304	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m reasonably confident that inflation will eventually rise toward the 2 percent objective as long as the economy and, especially, the labor market continue to tighten and as the effects of previous commodity price declines and the higher dollar recede.	23	2
201507	3305	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, the recent further commodity price declines and the rise in the dollar make it quite unlikely that we will see much pickup in inflation, if any, by September.	23	2
201507	3306	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Current readings do present a significant communications challenge, and that would be a greater concern for me if I thought that inflation expectations were under serious pressure.	23	2
201507	3307	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I do not believe so.	23	2
201507	3308	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Survey measures are stable.	23	2
201507	3309	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Market-based readings declined with the recent declines in oil prices, but only at the short end.	23	2
201507	3310	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Five-year, five-year-forward breakevens have been, on net, just about stable since the June meeting, and those are the ones that I would tend to look at for longer-term inflation expectations.	23	2
201507	3311	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	As our discussions about when to lift off presumably wind down, I believe it will be important that the Committee’s actions are supportive of its words—specifically, the oft-expressed view that policy will be data driven and not fall into an excessively predictable rate path.	23	2
201507	3312	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to the statements, I would include the word “some,” and I would offer a slightly different reason.	23	2
201507	3313	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I accept and support the reason that it does acknowledge progress to date.	23	2
201507	3314	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	But in a world in which we’re depending heavily—at least I am—on Phillips curve concepts for believing in future inflation, there’s the sense that, even though we may have already met the employment test for raising rates, continued progress in the labor market, along with continuing tightening in the economy, is one of the fundamental things that will give us reasonable confidence about the future course of inflation.	23	2
201507	3315	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I would want to see additional progress, notwithstanding that we may, in my view, have already met the employment part of the test.	23	2
201507	3316	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So I like “some” for that additional reason.	23	2
201507	3317	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Turning to alternative C, I like the economic growth language in paragraph 3 because I do think, again, economic growth is important for inflation.	23	2
201507	3318	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	If there were a risk of overshooting on inflation or something along those lines, then I would be concerned about too much emphasis on that part of the mandate.	23	2
201507	3319	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	But I don’t see that issue here.	23	2
201507	3320	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	In paragraph 4, I prefer the “economic conditions” language to the “deviations” language.	23	2
201507	3321	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m not sure why we need the “balanced approach” language, as there’s a sense that putting in that language implies that there’s some tension between the objectives.	23	2
201507	3322	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see that tension here.	23	2
201507	3323	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	So I, too, will review President Williams’s language and want to think further about that.	23	2
201507	3324	2015-07-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3325	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3326	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201507	3327	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3328	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I can support alternative B.	23	2
201507	3329	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The labor market has continued to improve, and I expect to see further progress toward full employment before liftoff begins.	23	2
201507	3330	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	By contrast, inflation has remained notably below our target, with no concrete progress that we can point to.	23	2
201507	3331	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Furthermore, currently low measures of underlying inflation, subdued wage growth, the limited effect of higher resource utilization on wages thus far in the recovery, and some hints that inflation expectations have moved lower suggest that the movement of inflation toward our target as resource utilization tightens could be quite slow, with risks tilted to the downside.	23	2
201507	3332	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these conditions do not currently make me reasonably confident that inflation will return to its 2 percent target over the medium term.	23	2
201507	3333	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me turn to the important question of whether the improvement in the labor market and the inflation outlook will be sufficient by our next meeting, or is likely to be sufficient, to warrant the commencement of tightening.	23	2
201507	3334	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	By the September meeting, we will have received employment reports for July and August, an ECI reading for the second quarter, and second- quarter compensation per hour data as well as revisions to GDP, productivity, and compensation over the past three years.	23	2
201507	3335	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	These will be very important in thinking about labor market conditions and the future trajectory of economic activity.	23	2
201507	3336	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If employment growth increases strongly, slack declines noticeably, nominal wage growth shows more consistent signs of firming, and the economic outlook is favorable, I believe that the labor market will have improved enough for liftoff to occur, but only if inflation also looks set to rise to 2 percent.	23	2
201507	3337	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s certainly possible, although it seems less likely, that we will receive data by September that would give me reasonable confidence that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.	23	2
201507	3338	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the first day of our September meetings, we’ll receive the CPI for August, and, of course, we’ll already have in hand the July CPI.	23	2
201507	3339	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ll have also received another Michigan survey of inflation expectations for August and a preliminary reading for September as well as another month and a half of data on market-based inflation expectations.	23	2
201507	3340	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If the staff inflation forecast is correct—and it’s been relatively accurate of late—the most recent estimate of the 12-month change in the core PCE price index will be 1.3 percent at the time of our meeting, the same as the average rate of core inflation over the past three years.	23	2
201507	3341	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If survey- and market-based measures of inflation expectations also remain near their current levels, it would be difficult to justify that our confidence had increased sufficiently to meet the reasonableness test.	23	2
201507	3342	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Instead, justification would have to come from the strength of the labor market and the belief that this strength will soon show through to inflation with sufficient force to boost inflation to 2 percent over the next two years.	23	2
201507	3343	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Whether labor market developments by September can, by themselves, justify reasonable confidence, which is the underlying premise of the description of economic conditions in alternative C, is a question I will be wrestling with over the next month and a half.	23	2
201507	3344	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, there remains a fair risk of continuing downward pressure on inflation from dollar appreciation and falling commodity prices, based on the foreign economic outlook.	23	2
201507	3345	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	China is slowing to an unknown degree and appears to be exerting a material influence globally on both commodity prices and the economic growth prospects of commodity exporters.	23	2
201507	3346	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Economic difficulties in important emerging markets, such as Brazil and Russia, seem likely to continue for some time, and any contribution of Europe to global demand is likely to be quite limited.	23	2
201507	3347	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	When the contrast crystallizes between a United States starting on a tightening path and foreign economies in which monetary accommodation is likely to continue, the risk of additional dollar appreciation may well increase.	23	2
201507	3348	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I’ve heard the case made to lift off in September and then stay on hold for some time.	23	2
201507	3349	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The risk with that strategy is that markets will surely put great weight on any action we take, but perhaps less on an expected path that is subject to a great deal more questions of interpretation and uncertainty, as I think President Kocherlakota noted earlier.	23	2
201507	3350	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I do believe September should remain a live option.	23	2
201507	3351	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But, based on the reading of the data we have available today, along with the additional data that will be available to us at the September, October, and December meetings, as against the substantial uncertainty around the degree of tightening we could see through the markets, it would make me want to maintain optionality around December from a risk-management perspective.	23	2
201507	3352	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In that regard, it’s important to address the questions that have arisen about whether we need to view September as the last viable option to move this year.	23	2
201507	3353	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I find it hard to accept that logic, although, of course, I think it’s important to be mindful of possible end-of-year market dynamics and possible risks around the debt limit.	23	2
201507	3354	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, I believe we have the tools and the capacity to manage those risks.	23	2
201507	3355	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, I would favor liftoff in September only if both inflation and labor market conditions make it compelling, and I’d like to maintain optionality on December.	23	2
201507	3356	2015-07-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3357	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	23	2
201507	3358	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201507	3359	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3360	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201507	3361	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be wonderful if the data were sufficiently definitive that we could confidently signal that we’re highly likely to lift off at the next meeting.	23	2
201507	3362	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That would finally end the suspense.	23	2
201507	3363	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Unfortunately, I don’t think that’s the case.	23	2
201507	3364	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The growth momentum of the economy is not particularly strong, and inflation remains below our objectives.	23	2
201507	3365	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Most important, relatively small differences in economic growth, productivity, and employment growth have quite important implications for the trajectory of the unemployment rate and the amount of labor slack in the economy, and that then feeds into the appropriate timing of liftoff.	23	2
201507	3366	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I, for one, remain very much data dependent in terms of my own thinking about September.	23	2
201507	3367	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine scenarios in which it would be easy for me to support liftoff in September, scenarios in which I couldn’t support liftoff, and some in-between ones in which I would have to reflect very carefully about whether it made sense to wait longer.	23	2
201507	3368	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The key for me will be the state of the labor market, the degree of forward momentum in the economy, and the degree of downside risk to the economic outlook.	23	2
201507	3369	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If the risk of a quick return to the effective lower bound were to diminish, that would also influence my thinking.	23	2
201507	3370	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m also going to put some weight at the margin on the fact that September does have better characteristics, compared with December, in terms of the timing of the initial liftoff.	23	2
201507	3371	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	People will be around after the September meeting.	23	2
201507	3372	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Markets will be deeper.	23	2
201507	3373	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In my view, in September, there will be less risk of a messy start to the normalization process compared with December.	23	2
201507	3374	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s important because that potentially could affect our credibility in the liftoff process.	23	2
201507	3375	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of alternative B, I think it keeps our options open.	23	2
201507	3376	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It says we’re making progress toward our objectives, but not so much that we’re highly confident that the conditions will be in place to begin to normalize at the next meeting.	23	2
201507	3377	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, I think the word “some” sends the right message.	23	2
201507	3378	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’ve made some progress in terms of the labor market, but we’re not quite there yet, and I think market participants will interpret it in the correct way.	23	2
201507	3379	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of alternative C serving as a template for what the statement should look like at liftoff, I’m broadly supportive.	23	2
201507	3380	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In paragraph 4, I prefer the “economic conditions relative to” phrase compared with the more wonky “deviations from.”	23	2
201507	3381	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I also think the first sentence of paragraph 3 could be shortened quite a bit.	23	2
201507	3382	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It really reiterates a lot of the thoughts that are in paragraph 2—the “objective of maximum employment” and the expectation that “inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective.”	23	2
201507	3383	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’d like to at least put on the table for consideration something much shorter.	23	2
201507	3384	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We could just say “our dual-mandate objectives” and shorten that first part of that sentence down significantly.	23	2
201507	3385	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	People know what our dual-mandate objectives are; we’ve said it in paragraph 2.	23	2
201507	3386	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m not really sure we need to repeat it all in what is a five-line sentence right now.	23	2
201507	3387	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s really quite a run-on type of sentence.	23	2
201507	3388	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the “balanced approach,”	23	2
201507	3389	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m sympathetic with President Williams.	23	2
201507	3390	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It could be misinterpreted because sometimes our objectives don’t conflict.	23	2
201507	3391	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What does a balanced approach mean in that context?	23	2
201507	3392	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I need to be convinced about what it adds to the statement to feel that it should be in the statement.	23	2
201507	3393	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m slightly leaning against it on that point, but I’d like to see President Williams’s remarks, too.	23	2
201507	3394	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll take them before the transcript.	23	2
201507	3395	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201507	3396	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201507	3397	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks for a very good discussion of the policy issues that we face.	23	2
201507	3398	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I heard a couple of suggestions in the go-round for changes but, on balance, quite broad-based support for alternative B as written.	23	2
201507	3399	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me propose that we vote on alternative B as written.	23	2
201507	3400	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Matt.	23	2
201507	3401	2015-07-29	meeting	LUECKE	Yes.	23	2
201507	3402	2015-07-29	meeting	LUECKE	The vote will be on the statement language from alternative B, shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, and on the directive on page 11 of that handout.	23	2
201507	3403	2015-07-29	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes.	23	2
201507	3404	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you all very much.	23	2
201507	3405	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, before we break up, there are a couple of things.	23	2
201507	3406	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, the topic of looking at our long-run framework came up yesterday, and I indicated that I wanted to make a couple of comments about that.	92	9
201507	3407	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So if you don’t mind, I have some brief comments.	92	9
201507	3408	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I definitely think it’s appropriate for us to begin to evaluate the issues that are going to bear on our decisions concerning a long-run implementation framework, in spite of the fact that, under our baseline outlook, it’s going to be a number of years before we need to make any final decisions.	92	9
201507	3409	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And I believe we’ve all agreed that we’re going to be learning a great deal about the efficacy of our various policy tools during the normalization process.	92	9
201507	3410	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But because I think we want to get a head start on this, I’ve asked Thomas and Simon to organize a System effort that will examine a number of important issues.	92	9
201507	3411	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we had quite a lot of previous staff work on this topic.	92	9
201507	3412	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	It was presented to the Committee in 2008, and that provides a solid foundation for the work ahead.	92	9
201507	3413	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	As some of you may recall, the 2008 work focused largely on alternative systems that could be used to target the federal funds rate.	92	9
201507	3414	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d expect that the basic issues of what rate we should target and how we should employ our policy tools in doing so will be a key part of the current effort as well.	92	9
201507	3415	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But as we were discussing yesterday, there are a number of developments since 2008 that I think warrant additional study.	92	9
201507	3416	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	An important one is, I do believe it’s appropriate for us to consider how robust any monetary policy implementation framework is to future adverse shocks that could result in a return to the zero lower bound.	92	9
201507	3417	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, regulatory and other structural developments since 2008 may be affecting financial institutions and markets in ways that could influence our choice of implementation framework.	92	9
201507	3418	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	In light of our experience of conducting large-scale asset purchases over recent years, we need to give some thought to the long-run structure of our assets and liabilities that best supports our macroeconomic and financial-stability objectives.	92	9
201507	3419	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think we should aim to benefit as much as we possibly can from the expertise and the insights of staff members across the Federal Reserve System.	92	9
201507	3420	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	On top of that, it may be appropriate to solicit input from academics and others on a number of the broader issues.	92	9
201507	3421	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Certainly, we will also want to consult with experts at other central banks, many of whom have confronted or will be confronting similar questions.	92	9
201507	3422	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Assuming that the Committee is comfortable with initiating a System effort on this set of topics, I’ve asked Thomas and Simon to send a letter soon to all research directors with some additional information on the proposed scope, organization, and timeline of this project.	92	9
201507	3423	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	We would hope to identity over the summer the membership of some of the core working groups that we intend to put together, and we’re thinking tentatively that this is a project that might well run through the end of next year.	92	9
201507	3424	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I expect that the System groups exploring these topics will be reporting back to the Committee on a periodic basis, and there will be many opportunities for input by FOMC participants throughout this effort.	92	9
201507	3425	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	So I’d be happy to take questions, and Thomas and Simon would as well, if there are any at this stage.	92	9
201507	3426	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	But our plan is to provide additional details shortly to the research directors.	92	9
201507	3427	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	92	9
201507	3428	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m very much supportive of this.	92	9
201507	3429	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Not to do this would be, I think, a dereliction of duty.	92	9
201507	3430	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’re at a particular point here of starting from a very different regime, with a different balance sheet and a different regulatory environment.	92	9
201507	3431	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I would encourage the staff and everyone around the table to be very open minded in their view and to look at this issue broadly, without any prejudgment about what we should go to, because there are many things that we’re going to have to balance here.	92	9
201507	3432	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There’s going to be a lot of learning that we’re going to have to do as we go through the normalization process and see how some of these new tools, in fact, actually work.	92	9
201507	3433	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So my advice is to look broadly and be open minded, because I believe we should really view this as an opportunity to think about what regime we want to have in place 5 or 10 years from now.	92	9
201507	3434	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Madam Chair?	92	9
201507	3435	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	92	9
201507	3436	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thanks.	92	9
201507	3437	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I also strongly support this initiative.	92	9
201507	3438	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	I just want to get some more defined idea of what will be included.	92	9
201507	3439	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	There’s everything that happens around this table.	92	9
201507	3440	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Is that part of the framework that you want examined?	92	9
201507	3441	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	When you say “everything that happens”—we’re thinking about the operating framework.	92	9
201507	3442	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	When you say “around this table,” do you mean our decisionmaking framework?	92	9
201507	3443	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yes.	92	9
201507	3444	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	No, it’s not about our decisionmaking framework.	92	9
201507	3445	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s about execution and our operating strategy for monetary policy.	92	9
201507	3446	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m assuming we’re going to stick with the “tried and true” for decisionmaking.	92	9
201507	3447	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Okay.	92	9
201507	3448	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, “tried,” anyway.	92	9
201507	3449	2015-07-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	92	9
201507	3450	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Or “tried and whatever”—longtime methods for running the Committee.	92	9
201507	3451	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201507	3452	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	92	9
201507	3453	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this is great.	92	9
201507	3454	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m very appreciative of you and the staff for launching this effort.	92	9
201507	3455	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll commend especially the openness to seeking input from outside constituencies like academics and other central banks.	92	9
201507	3456	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That could be incredibly informative for this very complicated problem that the Vice Chairman just outlined.	92	9
201507	3457	2015-07-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	92	9
201507	3458	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great, thanks.	92	9
201507	3459	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	92	9
201507	3460	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I, too, commend the effort.	92	9
201507	3461	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I can’t fault making a systematic study of this.	92	9
201507	3462	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Communication is going to be key.	92	9
201507	3463	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	If we’re going to go outside, I think we want a communications strategy concerning what this is about that’s pretty robust so that it’s not just dribbling out.	92	9
201507	3464	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	In that regard, a tricky issue is that it was less than a year ago that we adopted a normalization plan.	92	9
201507	3465	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	I take it from what you’re saying that what balance sheet we’re headed to might be on the table.	92	9
201507	3466	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Is this intended to reopen some of those issues?	92	9
201507	3467	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think what we said at the time was, the smallest balance sheet consistent with an efficient and effective conduct of monetary policy, and primarily Treasury securities.	92	9
201507	3468	2015-07-29	meeting	POTTER	That is a constraint.	92	9
201507	3469	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	All right.	92	9
201507	3470	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	So you don’t view this as reopening that.	92	9
201507	3471	2015-07-29	meeting	DUDLEY	No, I don’t think so.	92	9
201507	3472	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I wasn’t thinking of reopening that.	92	9
201507	3473	2015-07-29	meeting	LACKER	Well, that makes communication a little easier.	92	9
201507	3474	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	There are two further things.	1	1
201507	3475	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, I want to confirm the date of our next meeting and note that it will be held on a Wednesday and Thursday, not a Tuesday and Wednesday.	1	1
201507	3476	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’ll be Wednesday and Thursday, September 16 and 17.	1	1
201507	3477	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then I wanted to tell you that Linda Robertson is prepared to now give us a legislative update.	1	1
201507	3478	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	I guess lunch will be available, Matt, at 11:30?	1	1
201507	3479	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	For those of you who are able to stay, I think it makes sense for Linda to begin her legislative update now.	1	1
201507	3480	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	And for those of you who are still here at 11:30, lunch will be served next door.	1	1
201507	3481	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	The meeting is adjourned.	1	1
201507	3482	2015-07-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, all.	1	1
