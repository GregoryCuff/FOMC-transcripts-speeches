201401	1	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We thought we’d just do this for a couple of hours.	5	5

201401	5	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Good afternoon.	5	5
201401	6	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Welcome to our annual organizational meeting.	3	3

201401	11	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	3	3
201401	12	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Because of the impending change in leadership and the position of Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, I’ll be calling for three sets of nominations and votes this afternoon rather than the usual two.	3	3
201401	13	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, I’d like to ask for a nomination for FOMC Chairman to serve through January 31, 2014—which is to say, Friday—which happens to be Chairman Bernanke’s last day in office.	3	3

201401	33	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	A second?	3	3
201401	34	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I second that nomination.	3	3
201401	35	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Any other nominations or discussion?	3	3
201401	36	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	[No response]	3	3
201401	37	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Without objection.	3	3
201401	38	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is actually quite easy, Mr Chairman.	3	3
201401	39	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	[Laughter]	3	3
201401	40	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, so far so good.	3	3
201401	41	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	You have to write a statement about it, though.	3	3

201401	62	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	3	3
201401	63	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Hearing none, thank you.	3	3
201401	64	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 2, “Selection of a Federal Reserve Bank to Execute Transactions for the System Open Market Account.”	3	3
201401	65	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	New York is again willing to serve.	3	3
201401	66	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any objections?	3	3
201401	67	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	3	3
201401	68	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I can take items 3 and 4 together.	3	3
201401	69	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 3 is “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.”	44	4
201401	70	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	You received a memo on this.	44	4
201401	71	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 4 is “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.”	44	4
201401	72	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I think there were only technical amendments here, but let me ask Simon if he has anything to say about these two.	44	4
201401	73	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	44	4
201401	74	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I have a prepared text.	44	4
201401	75	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I’ll try to get through it pretty quickly.	44	4
201401	76	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	44	4
201401	77	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	At its first meeting each year, the Committee reviews the authorizations you just spoke about.	44	4
201401	78	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And, with regard to the domestic open market operations, I recommend that the Committee approve the authorization with one small wording change that would make the structure of paragraph 1A similar to the structure of paragraph 1B.	44	4
201401	79	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition to this change, I’d like to update the Committee on two items related to the domestic authorization.	44	4
201401	80	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	First, as you know, the System Open Market Account (SOMA) contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it is conducting transactions in MBS.	44	4
201401	81	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As such, I recommend a continued suspension of the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal- Agency Issues.	44	4
201401	82	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Second, the current authorization codifies the Open Market Trading Desk’s ability to transact in agency MBS for the SOMA through agents such as asset managers.	44	4
201401	83	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This year, we plan to remove this service from our agreements with the asset managers, which would allow for the removal of paragraph 3 from the domestic authorization next January.	44	4
201401	84	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	No Committee vote is needed related to these two items.	44	4
201401	85	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Turning to foreign currency operations:  The Desk conducts such operations under the terms of the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.	44	4
201401	86	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I recommend that the Committee approve these documents with three sets of amendments.	44	4
201401	87	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.	44	4
201401	88	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The first amendment is to remove paragraph 8 in the foreign authorization, which discusses the transmission of pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.	44	4
201401	89	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I propose that this type of communication instead be governed by the Program for Security of FOMC Information, which currently governs the transmission of similar information.	44	4
201401	90	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The memo circulated ahead of the meeting titled “Proposed Amendments to FOMC Organizational Documents” detailed how the staff recommends that this be addressed in the Program for Security of FOMC Information.	44	4
201401	91	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The second set of proposed amendments pertains to the central bank swap arrangements.	44	4
201401	92	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	At the October 2013 meeting, the Committee approved standing facilities with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England (BOE), the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the Swiss National Bank.	44	4
201401	93	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As a result, new language in the three documents is intended to incorporate these liquidity swaps and, where appropriate, align the treatment of the liquidity swaps and that of the reciprocal swaps that were put in place with the central banks of Mexico and Canada as part of the North American Framework Agreement (NAFA).	44	4
201401	94	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	There are five specific changes I’d like to highlight related to the swap arrangements.	44	4
201401	95	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	First, I propose aligning the review and approval process for any changes in the terms of existing NAFA swap arrangements with those for the liquidity swap arrangements.	44	4
201401	96	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Under this proposal, changes in the terms of existing swaps would be referred for review and approval to the Chairman instead of the Committee.	44	4
201401	97	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The Chairman would keep the Committee informed of any changes in the terms, and the terms shall be consistent with the principles discussed with, and guidance provided by, the Committee.	44	4
201401	98	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	To enact this change, I propose moving the language in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization on “changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements” to the Procedural Instructions with the addition of paragraph 1D.	44	4
201401	99	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I also propose replacing the reference to “the proposed terms of any new arrangements” in paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization with broader language that states, “Any new swap arrangements shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.”	44	4
201401	100	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Second, I propose eliminating references to the maximum term of any drawing under the NAFA swaps in the Foreign Authorization in light of the previous proposal to have the procedural instructions govern the terms of all swap drawings.	44	4
201401	101	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The swaps will remain “subject to annual review and approval by the Committee.”	44	4
201401	102	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This affects paragraphs 1C and 2A of the foreign authorization.	44	4
201401	103	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Third, I would like to align the annual review process of the liquidity swaps with that of the NAFA swaps by subjecting the liquidity swaps to “annual review and approval” instead of just “annual review.”	44	4
201401	104	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This also affects paragraph 2 of the Foreign Authorization.	44	4
201401	105	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	While small, this change will require an annual vote on the liquidity swaps.	44	4
201401	106	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I plan to ask for this vote at the third or fourth FOMC meeting of the year along with the vote on the NAFA swaps.	44	4
201401	107	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This is consistent with the approach Steve Kamin and I proposed in the October 21, 2013, memo on this topic.	44	4
201401	108	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Fourth, I would like to expand the current arrangement for consulting with the Committee prior to initial liquidity swap drawings.	44	4
201401	109	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Specifically, I propose that the Chairman or the Foreign Currency Subcommittee will consult with the Committee when possible.	44	4
201401	110	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The resolution states that just the Foreign Currency Subcommittee will consult with the Committee when possible.	44	4
201401	111	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I address this change with the proposed addition of paragraph 2A in the Procedural Instructions.	44	4
201401	112	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Lastly, I would like to clarify that any changes in the terms of existing liquidity swap arrangements shall be referred for review and approval to the Chairman, consistent with my earlier proposal for handling changes in the terms of the NAFA swaps.	44	4
201401	113	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The resolution approved by the Committee in October specified the approval process for changes to the rates and fees only.	44	4
201401	114	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I address this change with the proposed addition of paragraph 2B in the procedural instructions.	44	4
201401	115	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The third set of proposed amendments clarifies the link between the Procedural Instructions and the Foreign Authorization through additions to the wording in the new paragraph 3A.iii and paragraph 4 in the Procedural Instructions.	44	4
201401	116	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I would also like to update the Committee on one item related to the foreign portfolio.	44	4
201401	117	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Paragraph 6 of the Foreign Authorization requires that all foreign operations “be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and the Committee.”	44	4
201401	118	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The Desk performs a wide variety of tasks within its mandate to manage the foreign portfolio, and the reporting time varies by each specific operation, depending on the nature of each activity.	44	4
201401	119	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The memo we circulated ahead of the meeting titled “Request for Votes on Authorization for Desk Operations” included an appendix that clarifies the New York Fed’s Markets Group staff’s reporting practices related to operations conducted under the foreign authorization.	44	4
201401	120	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Mr.	44	4
201401	121	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Chairman.	44	4
201401	122	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	44	4
201401	123	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In designating these changes as technical, I certainly didn’t mean to preclude any questions or discussion.	44	4
201401	124	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any questions for Simon?	44	4
201401	125	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any comments?	44	4
201401	126	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	44	4
201401	127	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I have no objections, then?	44	4
201401	128	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	44	4
201401	129	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	44	4
201401	130	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We will take those as approved.	44	4
201401	131	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 5 is “Proposed Revisions to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”	92	9
201401	132	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	What we have before us was circulated before the meeting.	92	9
201401	133	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It is the statement that we have approved in the two prior years, with only two, nonsubstantive changes—changing “judges” to “reaffirms its judgment” and updating the central tendency for longer-run unemployment where that number comes up.	92	9
201401	134	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So this is essentially identical to the statement of policy that we have approved the last two years.	92	9
201401	135	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Because this is our third time through, I’ve conferred with Governor Yellen, and I think we agree that this year would be a good time to review this statement and to see if we’re satisfied with it, if it is saying what we want it to say, and if it’s consistent with our policy approach.	92	9
201401	136	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Yellen tells me that she intends to ask a new subcommittee on communications, which—I assume, because Stan Fischer’s not here— will be headed by Stan if he is confirmed and willing, to look at this statement and consult with the Committee and see if there are any more substantive changes or questions that should be raised.	92	9
201401	137	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Is that correct?	92	9
201401	138	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	That is, indeed.	92	9
201401	139	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Today we have before us the statement as amended.	92	9
201401	140	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Does anyone want to comment on the statement?	92	9
201401	141	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	92	9
201401	142	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes, Mr Chairman.	92	9
201401	143	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you very much.	92	9
201401	144	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t have any objections to the first change, in terms of “reaffirms its judgment” versus “judges.”	92	9
201401	145	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m not sure the nuances there will be picked up by the marketplace, but, nonetheless, I’m fine with that.	92	9
201401	146	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Regarding the second change, though, there remains considerable uncertainty both in the marketplace and around this table about what we mean by true maximum employment and what it actually is.	92	9
201401	147	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And I think we struggle with understanding what it means and how it varies over time.	92	9
201401	148	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m concerned that, unfortunately, over time, the markets and the public have come to think of what we report in the SEP as somehow our target as opposed to some information about our assessment, despite what we’ve said.	92	9
201401	149	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We had a discussion about this when we first launched this statement—and maybe this is a topic for the Committee coming up—but I’d be inclined to try to drop the last two sentences of that paragraph altogether so that we don’t find ourselves having to change the unemployment numbers every time the SEP changes.	92	9
201401	150	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We ought to think about doing that—at least dropping the last sentence even if we don’t drop the second-to-last sentence.	92	9
201401	151	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I’d like to put that on the table as something for discussion and for consideration by this Committee.	92	9
201401	152	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	92	9
201401	153	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I think it’s something that the subcommittee would have to look at.	92	9
201401	154	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It’s certainly a very substantive change.	92	9
201401	155	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We do say, in the course of the statement, that this is our assessment of the long-run normal unemployment rate and that it can change.	92	9
201401	156	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	This, of course, illustrates that it, in fact, can change.	92	9
201401	157	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	92	9
201401	158	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	92	9
201401	159	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I indicated last year—and I won’t go through my thinking again—I found the statement—and, in particular, the fifth paragraph—very useful in guiding my own thinking about policy.	92	9
201401	160	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I’m very glad to hear that a subcommittee will be formed to evaluate the statement in its third year of use.	92	9
201401	161	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In particular, I think that—and I mentioned this last time at our meeting—as time evolves and we get closer to maximum employment and inflation gets closer to target, financial-stability concerns are likely to play more of a role in our deliberations.	92	9
201401	162	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And financial stability is mentioned explicitly in the second paragraph as being a factor that we take into account when we think about policy.	92	9
201401	163	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it is not linked back to our description of the monetary policy strategy in the fifth paragraph.	92	9
201401	164	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I think that is a potential opportunity for improvement that the subcommittee could take into account; that was the only comment I had.	92	9
201401	165	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	92	9
201401	166	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Other comments?	92	9
201401	167	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Rosengren.	92	9
201401	168	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d like to follow up on that comment.	92	9
201401	169	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thinking about financial stability in the fifth paragraph is something that is worth considering.	92	9
201401	170	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Also, maybe taking a fresh look at the inflation paragraph would be worth doing in two respects: first, maybe clarifying a little bit more the difference between a target and a ceiling and how the Committee feels about that; and, second, thinking about deviations below as well as deviations above and how we think about that.	92	9
201401	171	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So when it’s time for this Committee to rethink this whole strategy, in addition to the two other suggestions, those would be things to consider as well.	92	9
201401	172	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We will put all of these suggestions before the new subcommittee when that deliberation begins.	92	9
201401	173	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Tarullo.	92	9
201401	174	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	92	9
201401	175	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I will again abstain from the vote on the adoption of this statement.	92	9
201401	176	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the one hand, I continue to believe that it doesn’t actually reflect a strong enough consensus among Committee members to permit a more effective communication of our policies to the public.	92	9
201401	177	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the other hand, I don’t think it’s done any particular harm, and, particularly as interpreted and explained by the current Chairman—and, I’m quite confident, the future Chair—I’m very comfortable with those explanations.	92	9
201401	178	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I do welcome the prospect of further discussion of the entire statement.	92	9
201401	179	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Some of you may recall that my original concerns a couple of years ago were focused on the absence of what I thought to be an explicit enough statement of our having a symmetrical loss function with respect to the two policy aims of the dual mandate set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, which is, after all, the source of this Committee’s powers.	92	9
201401	180	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I continue to have those concerns, although, more recently, I join Eric in having some concerns about the way in which the inflation number is actually understood—whether it is understood as a target, properly stated, or as more of a ceiling.	92	9
201401	181	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I dare say that some members of the Committee would be distressed with a forecast that inflation would be 2.6 percent, 2.4 percent, and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the next several years.	92	9
201401	182	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	But, as we sit here today, we have a forecast of inflation at 1.4 percent, 1.6 percent, and 1.7 percent, respectively, over the next three years—that is to say, deviating on the downside by exactly the amounts hypothesized as upside deviations a moment ago.	92	9
201401	183	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to be clear:  I pose this hypothetical not to argue for a specific policy response, but just to draw attention to what I think is at least a latent issue with respect to the stated goal of 2 percent inflation in the current statement.	92	9
201401	184	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	So when it comes time for Committee deliberation on this, I would be very interested in hearing an elaboration of not only the points that have already been made by some of our colleagues but also, I hope, the points that will be made by others of you.	92	9
201401	185	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	92	9
201401	186	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	92	9
201401	187	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Anyone else?	92	9
201401	188	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Tarullo has noted his abstention if we take a vote now.	92	9
201401	189	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Is there anyone else who would like to abstain or vote no?	92	9
201401	190	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	92	9
201401	191	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Seeing none, may I take it, then, that we approve the statement?	92	9
201401	192	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	92	9
201401	193	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	92	9
201401	194	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 6, “Proposed Revisions to the Rules of Procedure, and the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”	44	4
201401	195	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Again, without prejudice, I would say that both changes were mostly technical; a memo was circulated.	44	4
201401	196	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I think the most substantive item here is to create a deputy manager for the SOMA.	44	4
201401	197	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Did you have anything to say on this, Simon?	44	4
201401	198	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	No, I think the memo discussed the role of the deputy manager.	44	4
201401	199	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	44	4
201401	200	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The memo was circulated.	44	4
201401	201	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any questions or concerns?	44	4
201401	202	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	44	4
201401	203	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If not, may I take this as approved?	44	4
201401	204	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	44	4
201401	205	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	44	4
201401	206	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	44	4
201401	207	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 7, following on item 6, would be the selection of the manager and the deputy manager.	44	4
201401	208	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Simon Potter is again willing to serve as manager.	44	4
201401	209	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Given that the new deputy manager position has been approved, Lorie Logan is willing to serve in that role.	44	4
201401	210	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let’s have some discussion.	44	4
201401	211	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I’ll give the floor to Vice Chairman Dudley.	44	4
201401	212	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	44	4
201401	213	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Lorie is a fine choice.	44	4
201401	214	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	She played a very important role in the Markets Group when I was head of the Markets Group back in the darkest days of 2007 and 2008.	44	4
201401	215	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	She was Brian Sack’s chief of staff when Brian was the head of the Markets Group, and today she’s essentially Simon’s direct deputy on the SOMA and the Treasury operations in the Markets Group.	44	4
201401	216	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So she’s extraordinarily well qualified to be the deputy manager.	44	4
201401	217	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	44	4
201401	218	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any other questions or comments?	44	4
201401	219	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	44	4
201401	220	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Without objection.	44	4
201401	221	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	44	4
201401	222	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	44	4
201401	223	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We’re going to get into the substance of our policy discussion.	44	4
201401	224	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Item 8, “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations.”	61	6
201401	225	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me turn to Simon Potter.	61	6
201401	226	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	61	6
201401	227	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Markets responded positively to the Committee’s decision at the December meeting to reduce the pace of asset purchases, with a rise in equity prices and stable longer-term interest rates.	61	6
201401	228	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Shorter-term interest rates rose the day after the meeting, however, as some investors reportedly viewed the Committee’s qualitative modification to its forward rate guidance as less forceful than other options it was thought to be considering.	61	6
201401	229	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Since then, markets have fluctuated in response to economic data and, most recently, an increase in concerns regarding financial and economic stability in some emerging market economies.	61	6
201401	230	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	These concerns pushed U.S equity prices and interest rates significantly lower last week.	61	6
201401	231	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the first column of the top-left panel of your initial exhibit, using a slightly longer event window than usual to compensate for the extended horizon over which market participants reportedly digested the information provided by the Committee, short-dated rates increased and risk assets rallied following the December meeting.	61	6
201401	232	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the second column, on net over the intermeeting period, the implied rate on the December 2016 Eurodollar futures contract increased, while the 10-year nominal Treasury yield and 30-year primary mortgage rate declined.	61	6
201401	233	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Option- adjusted spreads on high-yield corporate credit narrowed, and the S&P 500 and DXY dollar indexes were little changed.	61	6
201401	234	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, shorter-term US interest rates and domestic equity prices fluctuated around the levels reached after the digestion of the FOMC decision, until conflicting labor market data introduced turbulence into short rates.	61	6
201401	235	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Toward the end of last week, increased concerns about growth and financial stability in China and other emerging market economies pushed US interest rates and risk asset prices significantly lower.	61	6
201401	236	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have highlighted several factors in explaining this pattern of movements in short-dated rates and equity prices.	61	6
201401	237	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	First, the FOMC’s modification to its forward rate guidance at the December meeting was perceived as less forceful than other options that the Committee was thought to be considering alongside a reduction in asset purchases, prompting a rise in short-dated rates the day after the meeting.	61	6
201401	238	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Second, fixed-income markets were relatively stable in the immediate wake of the announcement of the reduction in the pace of asset purchases; the passage of this risk event without the initial adverse market impact that some had expected supported risk asset prices.	61	6
201401	239	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Third, investors’ confidence in the economic outlook improved over the early part of the period, in part because of the Committee’s policy action and communications at the December meeting, as well as some better-than-expected economic data.	61	6
201401	240	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The dark-blue bars in the middle-left panel show the net changes in nominal one- year forward Treasury rates over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201401	241	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	One-year rates two to three years forward increased, while one-year rates six to nine years forward declined notably.	61	6
201401	242	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	In addition to reflecting a small upward shift in the expected target rate path, the rise in short-dated forwards likely reflects some increase in uncertainty regarding the target rate path, especially as the unemployment rate approaches the 6½ percent threshold.	61	6
201401	243	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, matching the moves in short-dated forward rates, three-month implied volatility on shorter-dated tenors increased over the period, as shown by the light-blue bars.	61	6
201401	244	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The decline in longer-dated forward rates and implied volatility at those long horizons may reflect some reduction in term premiums due to the less-adverse-than- expected impact of the “taper” announcement, as well as some reduction in uncertainty about the future path of the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases.	61	6
201401	245	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Demand for Treasury securities driven by developments in emerging markets last week also appears to have contributed to the fall in longer-dated forward rates.	61	6
201401	246	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown to the middle right, the market-implied target rate path now lies very close to the path implied by the median of year-end projections from the December SEP.	61	6
201401	247	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This stands in contrast to mid-November, when the market-implied path had fallen notably below the path implied by SEP projections.	61	6
201401	248	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Results from the Desk’s latest Survey of Primary Dealers indicate a modest shift up in the expected target rate path since the survey conducted ahead of the December meeting, and dealers lowered their point estimates of the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff.	61	6
201401	249	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This shift likely reflects the large decline in the unemployment rate relative to the disappointing improvement in other labor market indicators in the December employment report as well as the enhancement to forward guidance in the December FOMC statement.	61	6
201401	250	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As noted previously, some market participants expected a more explicit strengthening of forward guidance with the decision to reduce the pace of purchases.	61	6
201401	251	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	While short-dated rates decreased rather than increased following the unexpected fall in the unemployment rate to within 20 basis points of the threshold, market participants are increasingly turning their attention to how forward guidance will evolve after the threshold is reached.	61	6
201401	252	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Many appear to be relying on their expectation for a steady reduction in purchase pace of $10 billion at each meeting—in conjunction with the Committee’s view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends—as a form of near-term rate guidance.	61	6
201401	253	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Bill English will discuss some of the changes in forward guidance that dealers think are likely.	61	6
201401	254	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	One measure of the dispersion of market views on the relationship between the unemployment rate and liftoff is given in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201401	255	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Dealers’ current probability assessments for the unemployment rate at liftoff are shown in blue, alongside results from the Desk’s first pilot survey of buy-side market participants, shown in red.	61	6
201401	256	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The pilot survey aims to understand the expectations of active investment decisionmakers.	61	6
201401	257	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	While the average of beliefs is remarkably similar across the two sets of respondents, both sets of respondents show considerable dispersion of beliefs, with some buy-side respondents putting high odds on liftoff at unemployment rates close to the current level.	61	6
201401	258	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	More generally, the dealers and buy-side market participants have broadly similar expectations for asset purchases, SOMA holdings, the path of the target rate, and changes to the forward rate guidance.	61	6
201401	259	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We will continue to analyze the surveys over time to understand how the expectations of the dealer economists and investment managers compare.	61	6
201401	260	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-right panel, the five-year TIPS-based measure of inflation compensation increased 10 basis points over the period, while the five-year measure five years forward declined 10 basis points.	61	6
201401	261	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Both measures remained within the relatively tight range that prevailed over recent months and seemed little affected by monetary policy developments.	61	6
201401	262	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Many market participants anticipate that an “attack on the forward guidance” is most likely to occur if measures of inflation expectations start to move up out of recent ranges.	61	6
201401	263	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As indicated in your next exhibit, the policy outlook in the United Kingdom and the euro area was also in focus over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201401	264	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	In the United Kingdom, the unemployment rate has approached the Bank of England’s 7 percent threshold faster than many had expected, pressuring short-term rates higher.	61	6
201401	265	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This has increased uncertainty regarding how the BOE will adjust its forward guidance after the threshold is reached and regarding the pace of policy normalization thereafter.	61	6
201401	266	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This uncertainty is reflected in higher levels of short-dated interest rates and swaption- implied volatility, the latter of which is shown for the United Kingdom and the United States in the top-left panel.	61	6
201401	267	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Despite their recent rise, both remain below the levels reached during mid-2013.	61	6
201401	268	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	By contrast, short-dated euro-area swaption-implied volatility and EURIBOR rates were little changed to modestly lower over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201401	269	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This relative stability reflects continued expectations that inflation will run at below-target levels in the euro area for some time, as well as the ECB’s reiteration of its forward rate guidance.	61	6
201401	270	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The ECB’s current policy stance, along with the backstop provided by the OMT, has been an important factor contributing to the continued narrowing in euro-area peripheral sovereign debt spreads.	61	6
201401	271	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the top-right panel, these spreads are now at their tightest levels since at least August 2011.	61	6
201401	272	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Another factor contributing to the narrowing over recent months is greater confidence in the region’s growth outlook.	61	6
201401	273	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Amid ongoing risks in emerging markets, some foreign investors are shifting capital from emerging markets to the periphery.	61	6
201401	274	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Spread tightening since the start of 2014 also appears related to the passage of the reference date for the ECB’s asset quality review, as some peripheral banks reportedly repurchased domestic sovereign debt that they had previously shed for window-dressing purposes.	61	6
201401	275	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Together, these factors have improved access to capital markets for peripheral sovereign issuers, evidenced by strong demand and lower rates at recent auctions and syndications.	61	6
201401	276	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The improvement in the periphery has also extended to euro-area risk assets, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201401	277	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Euro-area equities have increased about 3 percent over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201401	278	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Some of the sharpest increases have been in bank shares, with the Euro STOXX bank index up almost 10 percent.	61	6
201401	279	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Your middle-right panel shows that emerging market currencies depreciated and local bond yields increased following the December FOMC decision.	61	6
201401	280	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Initially, these moves were relatively modest and orderly in most countries.	61	6
201401	281	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Since the beginning of the year, however, emerging market currencies and local bond prices have resumed their earlier fast declines.	61	6
201401	282	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Sentiment toward emerging market assets continues to be clouded by a number of interrelated concerns, including structural headwinds to emerging market growth; ongoing risks related to the cost and availability of external financing as market participants focus on the prospects for normalization of US monetary policy; questions about how China will navigate growth and financial- stability risks; and the potential for political and social unrest, underscored by recent developments in Turkey and Thailand.	61	6
201401	283	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	These concerns intensified last week, following a weaker-than-expected Chinese PMI reading, a selloff of the Turkish lira, and Argentina’s devaluation.	61	6
201401	284	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Steve will discuss the implications of these developments further in his briefing.	61	6
201401	285	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants’ views on China are highly dispersed, and most admit to having a limited understanding of Chinese economic and financial developments.	61	6
201401	286	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	For example, there are differing interpretations of spikes in Chinese interbank funding rates, the most recent of which occurred in December and mid-January, as shown in the bottom-left panel.	61	6
201401	287	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Some have suggested that these spikes are due to the inability of Chinese authorities to effectively manage interbank funding markets.	61	6
201401	288	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, the PBOC recently expanded its short-term liquidity facility to smaller banks that typically demand interbank liquidity at penalty rates; this may better allow for management of episodic strains.	61	6
201401	289	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	However, others suspect that liquidity strains are intended as a signal for smaller banks to rein in rapid off-balance-sheet credit expansion.	61	6
201401	290	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Although Chinese aggregate credit growth—or total financing—has decelerated since the summer, its expansion has remained robust and may be higher than the authorities’ presumed comfort level.	61	6
201401	291	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The opaqueness of China, particularly with respect to its evolving financial structure, has caused some global investors to become concerned with financial- stability risks that could be posed by developments on the mainland.	61	6
201401	292	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Many have pointed to the recent growth of Chinese “shadow banking” and the lack of a uniform strategy among financial regulators to stem its expansion as one such risk.	61	6
201401	293	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	For example, market participants were recently focused on how Chinese financial regulators might treat future defaults on wealth-management or trust products and the implications of that for the Chinese banking sector.	61	6
201401	294	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Although there are limited windows to understanding Chinese risk appetite and financial stresses, some have pointed to the Shanghai Composite Index, an admittedly flawed indicator shown in the bottom-right panel, as the best metric for gaining some insight.	61	6
201401	295	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This index declined significantly over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201401	296	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Turning to recent Desk operations, Treasury and agency MBS purchases since the December meeting have proceeded smoothly, with no issues arising from reduced market liquidity over year-end.	61	6
201401	297	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Further, we are not seeing signs of any notable impact directly related to the reduction in the pace of purchases.	61	6
201401	298	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Spreads on agency MBS narrowed a bit during the intermeeting period despite the shift lower in the expected total stock of asset purchases.	61	6
201401	299	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	According to the Survey of Primary Dealers, expectations for the overall amount of Federal Reserve asset purchases have declined about $90 billion since December, driven largely by the Committee’s decision to reduce the pace of purchases and the Chairman’s comments at the postmeeting press conference.	61	6
201401	300	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the solid line in the top panel of your third exhibit, the pace of purchases is expected to gradually decline over coming months.	61	6
201401	301	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The median expectation is that the Committee will reduce the pace of purchases in $10 billion increments at each meeting—split equally between Treasuries and MBS—until ending the program following the October meeting.	61	6
201401	302	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Thereafter, the portfolio is projected to remain steady for some time before beginning to shrink through MBS paydowns starting in mid- 2015, ahead of the expected timing of liftoff.	61	6
201401	303	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Treasury holdings are not expected to decline meaningfully until 2016.	61	6
201401	304	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The Treasury will auction its first floating-rate note tomorrow; the Desk’s work to build operational capacity in these securities is ongoing.	61	6
201401	305	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Separately, we have recently completed the initial testing of small-value MBS operations on our FedTrade platform, including the first outright sale, and intend to gradually incorporate FedTrade into our ongoing MBS operations in the coming months.	61	6
201401	306	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	A final note related to purchases:  If the Committee were to decide to reduce the pace of purchases at this meeting, the Desk would release a statement at the same time as the FOMC statement indicating that the new pace for Treasury securities and MBS will take effect at the start of February, similar to the statement that was released after the December meeting.	61	6
201401	307	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I will now turn to recent developments in money markets and the daily overnight RRP operations and discuss the staff’s recommendation for continuing the exercise.	61	6
201401	308	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the middle-left panel, the number of participants and total allotment in the overnight RRP operations increased in late December.	61	6
201401	309	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Usage was particularly heavy on year-end, when take-up totaled $198 billion across 102 counterparties.	61	6
201401	310	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Since then, take-up has averaged around $66 billion, considerably above levels that prevailed prior to the December meeting.	61	6
201401	311	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The increase in usage is due in large part to continued low overnight secured rates relative to the fixed rate offered in the operations.	61	6
201401	312	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that usage in the exercise remains quite sensitive to the spread between the rate offered on overnight RRPs and market rates for Treasury GC repo.	61	6
201401	313	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	It also has some sensitivity to nonprice factors, driven in particular by shifts in balance sheet management behavior around financial statement dates.	61	6
201401	314	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The higher usage is also attributable to the increase in the per-counterparty bid limit from $1 billion to $3 billion that was implemented on December 23.	61	6
201401	315	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This has obviously allowed for increased take-up in operations.	61	6
201401	316	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, on December 31, 35 counterparties took advantage of the larger cap by submitting maximum bids—representing 53 percent of the total amount awarded— and 47 other counterparties submitted bids for $1 billion or more.	61	6
201401	317	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Outside of year- end, the number of counterparties bidding for the maximum amount is typically relatively small, though many counterparties are taking up more than the prior cap of $1 billion.	61	6
201401	318	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The increase in usage since the December meeting has been principally driven by government-only and prime money market mutual funds, which are shown in the dark-blue and light-blue bars in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201401	319	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	On year-end, the GSEs and primary dealers also increased their participation, with primary dealer usage remaining surprisingly high in January.	61	6
201401	320	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As I mentioned earlier, usage in the operations is sensitive to the spread between the rate offered on overnight RRPs and comparable overnight secured rates.	61	6
201401	321	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The path of these rates is shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit; it can be seen here that the tightening in this spread was driven partly by a drop in market rates, with some of this drop occurring when the rate on the facility was lowered to 3 basis points.	61	6
201401	322	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The decline in rates around year-end was attributed in part to decreased primary dealer repo activity, which has been typical over recent year-ends, as well as lower borrowing in dollar funding markets by foreign banks.	61	6
201401	323	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Another important factor contributing to lower overnight secured rates over recent weeks has been declines in bill supply, shown in the upper-right panel.	61	6
201401	324	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Declines in bill supply are largely due to seasonal factors and the Treasury managing down its cash position in advance of the statutory debt limit, which will become binding on February 7.	61	6
201401	325	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	After this date, the Treasury is expected to utilize extraordinary measures to fund the government.	61	6
201401	326	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Secretary Lew publicly estimated that these measures will be exhausted in late February, though others estimate that this will occur in mid- March.	61	6
201401	327	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Correspondingly, there is a slight kink in the Treasury bill curve around these dates, reflecting some investor reluctance to hold securities with potentially delayed payments; the effects of this kink can be seen in the one-month Treasury bill rate shown in light blue in the top-left panel.	61	6
201401	328	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants have reported that money market rates would have been much lower and likely negative around year-end if not for our operations.	61	6
201401	329	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	They continue to note their expectations that overnight RRP operations could provide a firm floor for money market rates if implemented in full scale.	61	6
201401	330	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	However, several features of the current exercise may limit the extent to which we see this in practice:  the short time frame over which the exercise is authorized, which reportedly creates hesitancy on the part of some of our counterparties to move away from their existing relationships; limited bargaining power on the part of those with access to the facility; and some operational frictions, including around the timing of the operations.	61	6
201401	331	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Finally, many market participants also note that it remains unclear whether the current number and mix of counterparties are sufficient.	61	6
201401	332	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	As described in a memo circulated to the Committee in advance of the meeting, the staff’s assessment is that there would be benefits to extending the exercise beyond the end of January, with enhancements to the terms that may help mitigate some of the issues I just noted.	61	6
201401	333	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	This would give us further insight into how operations might influence money market rates and may give the Committee greater confidence in the use of overnight RRPs in normalizing policy.	61	6
201401	334	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	In particular, as outlined in the middle- left panel, the staff seeks to better understand the extent to which overnight RRPs are able to establish a floor on money market rates, to evaluate the impact of adding counterparties on effectiveness, and to assess the feasibility and impact of operating later in the day or possibly twice in one day.	61	6
201401	335	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Learning more soon about the potential effectiveness of a facility allows time for further development of or adjustments to the operations and associated testing, as well as for enhancements of other tools, if needed.	61	6
201401	336	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	To this end, as shown in the middle-right panel, the staff recommends extending the overnight RRP exercise for one year; raising the allotment cap in a series of steps; and, assuming no adverse developments, moving gradually to full allotment over the coming months.	61	6
201401	337	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The staff also recommends continuing to operate the overnight RRP tests within a band of 0 to 5 basis points.	61	6
201401	338	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	If the Committee agrees with these recommendations, the staff would release a Desk statement at the same time as the FOMC statement tomorrow afternoon, as described in appendix 2 of the memo that we sent to you.	61	6
201401	339	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Any changes in terms would require approval of the Chair, and, as noted in the memo, the Committee would be consulted before approval of a recommendation to go to full allotment.	61	6
201401	340	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	61	6
201401	341	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	That completes my prepared remarks.	61	6
201401	342	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	62	6
201401	343	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I propose that we take up this resolution on the overnight RRP facility first.	62	6
201401	344	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	After we finish with that, we can come back and ask questions about the financial markets.	62	6
201401	345	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Just to clarify, the proposal is as follows:  First, extend this exercise for one year in order to allow more continuity with counterparties so that they can count on having a relationship that extends more than meeting to meeting.	62	6
201401	346	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Second, raise the allotment cap in steps.	62	6
201401	347	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The recommendation is to approve full allotment, but increases in the allotment would require the Chairman’s approval, and the staff has said that it will come back to the Committee to get further input before going to full allotment.	62	6
201401	348	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Finally, continue to manage the rate within 0 to 5 basis points to minimize interference with the federal funds markets and other money markets.	62	6
201401	349	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me say that, in parallel to that—and again, I have conferred with Governor Yellen— staff work is under way that will look at the intermediate operating procedures that we might consider, the long-run operating procedures that we might consider, the effects of these types of facilities on the funds rate and the federal funds market, and the possibility of switching to a different interest rate indicator for our monetary policy communication.	62	6
201401	350	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All of this work is under way, and, on the current schedule, the Committee would discuss these matters at the April FOMC meeting.	62	6
201401	351	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So that’s the proposal.	62	6
201401	352	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me open the floor for comments and discussion.	62	6
201401	353	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	62	6
201401	354	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Mr Chairman, when you talk about perhaps seeking or finding another market rate that we might use as our reference point, I presume that, again, despite the recommendation that was made, it would still be a decision of the Committee.	62	6
201401	355	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Is that correct?	62	6
201401	356	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Yes.	62	6
201401	357	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you very much.	62	6
201401	358	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Others?	62	6
201401	359	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lockhart.	62	6
201401	360	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	361	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Simon, the higher allotment, which, if it were to persist, sort of amounts to temporary reserve drains—do you perceive that there’s any need to educate the market that this isn’t a small form of tightening in some way?	62	6
201401	362	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We’ve been remarkably lucky in that sense—people seem to view this as an exercise.	62	6
201401	363	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	It’s rearranging the liabilities on the balance sheet of the Fed.	62	6
201401	364	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	No one has associated this with tightening yet.	62	6
201401	365	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s one of the concerns we had back in September, but so far, there’s been no notice of that.	62	6
201401	366	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I think the range of 0 to 5 basis points is really important, because that means that you’re not really affecting financial conditions in a broad sense.	62	6
201401	367	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	What we are seeing is some effect in overnight markets, where we’ve seen low rates recently over year-end and where the usage goes up, but that’s really affecting functioning within those money markets and not affecting broader financial conditions.	62	6
201401	368	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201401	369	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I had a question.	62	6
201401	370	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you raise the bid limit, presumably the actual take-up would probably be pretty modest, as the chart that shows that most people aren’t even close to their limit today.	62	6
201401	371	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that correct?	62	6
201401	372	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Is that a reasonable inference?	62	6
201401	373	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I looked back at the transcript of the last meeting, and I said $30 billion to $40 billion.	62	6
201401	374	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And we’re averaging $66 billion—we did $94 billion today.	62	6
201401	375	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	So I’m a little bit wary of what that would actually look like, depending on where market rates are.	62	6
201401	376	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	What we’ve seen is a lot of people bidding between $1 billion and $3 billion.	62	6
201401	377	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We’ve seen more people bidding above $1 billion than you would have predicted from who was capped out.	62	6
201401	378	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	That could just be due to the Treasury bill supply issue and year-end.	62	6
201401	379	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The highest usage we’ve had is $198 billion, and it would surprise me if we went above something like that.	62	6
201401	380	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And then you have to think about how that feels relative to the $2.5 trillion of reserves out there.	62	6
201401	381	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	But so far, no one has viewed this as a draining operation.	62	6
201401	382	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	62	6
201401	383	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	384	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m concerned that we’re moving too quickly on this, maybe putting the cart before the horse in the process.	62	6
201401	385	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I actually can support continuation of the exercise and believe there’s more work that could be done.	62	6
201401	386	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My recommendation would be to scale back the time from a year to, say, six months—until July or something of that nature.	62	6
201401	387	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I also would prefer that we still maintain a cap on the size of the allotment at this point.	62	6
201401	388	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I see no reason to sort of precommit at this point that we’re on a path toward full allotment, as I don’t think this Committee has reached that decision yet.	62	6
201401	389	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And I see nothing that says we shouldn’t, perhaps, raise the cap.	62	6
201401	390	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m not objecting to that, either.	62	6
201401	391	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I prefer to leave the cap in there until such time as this Committee has done the work that we’re talking about doing in April and agreed on what its consequences may be and which direction we want to head.	62	6
201401	392	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And I don’t think there’s any particular reason why we have to jump the gun at this point and be predisposed to or prejudge the outcome of that discussion.	62	6
201401	393	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	There are lots of open questions.	62	6
201401	394	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The federal funds market has clearly shrunk because the system is awash in reserves.	62	6
201401	395	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	This overnight repo facility could cause the funds market to shrink even further and perhaps even die away.	62	6
201401	396	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	At such a point in time, it may be difficult for us to revive that market if we choose to revive the fed funds target.	62	6
201401	397	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It may be difficult, once we go to full allotment or get very large allotments, to pull back on this scheme at all.	62	6
201401	398	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we need to make a very deliberate decision as to what path we’re going to be on going forward and keep that constrained in a way and in tandem with where the Committee stands on this.	62	6
201401	399	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We’ve discussed the possibility of that regarding our exit strategy principles, and those principles still state that the funds rate is going to be our instrument.	62	6
201401	400	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Obviously, we’d have to review that as well.	62	6
201401	401	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	How feasible is this system altogether?	62	6
201401	402	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	What policy rate are we going to target?	62	6
201401	403	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Perhaps we choose a GC Treasury repo rate.	62	6
201401	404	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Is that a good choice?	62	6
201401	405	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Are there other choices?	62	6
201401	406	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Do we have a sense of how difficult that’s going to be to execute?	62	6
201401	407	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	How much collateral would we have to maintain on our balance sheet to be successful at this and to hit any kind of target?	62	6
201401	408	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Which counterparties are going to be more important?	62	6
201401	409	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In some of the experimentation, I think you’ll discover something about that and, as I said, what the volume of transactions would need to be.	62	6
201401	410	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Should we worry about the scale of interventions that would be required to execute this policy?	62	6
201401	411	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	What about the fees?	62	6
201401	412	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	What about the costs of executing this policy?	62	6
201401	413	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The repo market is very much larger than the funds market.	62	6
201401	414	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It extends well beyond banks.	62	6
201401	415	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Perhaps that’s really an important benefit to targeting a rate that goes beyond just the banking system.	62	6
201401	416	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I’m open to that suggestion.	62	6
201401	417	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But there are costs as well, and what are those costs?	62	6
201401	418	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Are we further blurring the lines between monetary and fiscal policy in a way in which we’re standing up and guaranteeing that we will supply Treasury collateral to all takers at any particular price?	62	6
201401	419	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the main reason in the near term for supporting the RRP, as Simon said, is to shore up the leaky IOER, in some sense, relative to the funds rate.	62	6
201401	420	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Might an alternative be just not to worry about that?	62	6
201401	421	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Maybe we set a target range for the funds rate and let it fluctuate within that range as we try to raise rates.	62	6
201401	422	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	What’s the difference between following that strategy and going with this other strategy?	62	6
201401	423	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t know the answers to all of these questions.	62	6
201401	424	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Perhaps they’re easy and can be answered.	62	6
201401	425	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think these are questions that the Committee needs to grapple with.	62	6
201401	426	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We need to understand where we’re going before we go too far and find ourselves in a place where, perhaps, we’d rather not be.	62	6
201401	427	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As most of you know, I am uncomfortable with a monetary policy operating framework that decouples the size of our balance sheet from our policy decisions.	62	6
201401	428	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t think that’s a good place to be.	62	6
201401	429	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And so I would not want to make a decision today that would lead to this de facto choice of such a framework going forward without the Committee making some deliberate decisions about that.	62	6
201401	430	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As has been mentioned, the staff is doing a lot of work to prepare this.	62	6
201401	431	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think we need to be patient, get that work done, and have this discussion.	62	6
201401	432	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Then perhaps we can make another decision that raises the cap and raises the scale of this operation more gradually, once this Committee has a better sense of what all of the ramifications of this strategy might be.	62	6
201401	433	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	434	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	62	6
201401	435	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lacker.	62	6
201401	436	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	437	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I support further exercises.	62	6
201401	438	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	As Governor Stein and I have been predicting for a few meetings, short of full implementation, we’re always going to be left wanting to know some more about the effects of this.	62	6
201401	439	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I have some serious concerns about how we’re going about this, though.	62	6
201401	440	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I think we’re putting the cart before the horse to expand the time frame and to authorize full allotments at this time, even with the check- in that they talk about, before having the benefits of the staff’s analytical work, which I support and strongly encourage.	62	6
201401	441	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	We should have the benefit of that work.	62	6
201401	442	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	If we’d commissioned that in September, as I’d suggested, I think we’d be in a good position now, and I’d feel comfortable authorizing the steps the way they’re laid out in this resolution.	62	6
201401	443	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	But I’m not, given the open questions we have.	62	6
201401	444	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	President Plosser outlined a lot of them.	62	6
201401	445	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	One thing I’d add is that the staff seems to view increasing the bargaining power of some financial market participants as an important benefit of that.	62	6
201401	446	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I find that really puzzling because it implies a diminution of someone else’s bargaining power, and you don’t usually think of monetary policy operations as targeting the allocation of bargaining power.	62	6
201401	447	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	There are two elements of irreversibility to the path we’re on that give me pause.	62	6
201401	448	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	One was mentioned by the manager, and it’s that some market participants have been reluctant to join the program, not knowing how long we’re going to be committed to this.	62	6
201401	449	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	That’s one of the reasons he advocates a one-year extension.	62	6
201401	450	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I think that, in some of the documentary material, he refers to that reluctance as due to switching costs—costs of severing counterparty relations.	62	6
201401	451	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Well, by the same token, should that switching occur, we’ll be in a situation in which backing away from the program would impose switching costs again, and that would raise a hurdle and would impede us from changing course if we weren’t ready to go full steam ahead in this direction.	62	6
201401	452	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s too soon to go raising barriers to our changing course.	62	6
201401	453	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s too soon to commit on that basis.	62	6
201401	454	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The other thing is the fed funds market.	62	6
201401	455	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes, 5 basis points is below generally where we’ve seen things, but this is a collateralized transaction, and you’d expect that to trade a little bit below an uncollateralized transaction like federal funds.	62	6
201401	456	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The risk here is that we suck all of the large dollar transactions out of the market—the Federal Home Loan Banks and the GSEs— and what we’re left with is the odd-lot stuff.	62	6
201401	457	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, on a day-to-day basis, federal funds trades range up to 30 or 35 basis points.	62	6
201401	458	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So there are a bunch of trades up there in the 20s and low 30s, and they could dominate the effective rate.	62	6
201401	459	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The effective rate could conceivably go from low, from about the middle single digits, up to more than 20.	62	6
201401	460	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t know—the Desk obviously has the data on it, and I don’t think we need to get into that.	62	6
201401	461	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	But the principle here is that if we expand too rapidly, we could trigger the shift out of the federal funds market that the staff is, I think, rightly concerned about and that we need some analysis of.	62	6
201401	462	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	We’ve got legal contracts, OIS and the like, that are pegged to and that write in, as with LIBOR, this effective rate, and here we’re risking changing drastically the meaning of that rate.	62	6
201401	463	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	We ought to be really cautious as we tiptoe up to that.	62	6
201401	464	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So I’d prefer that we shorten the time frame to a horizon just after a meeting at which we’re confident staff analysis can come back to us, and that we not authorize full allotment at this time and we just authorize $5 billion.	62	6
201401	465	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I think that would be enough for another round of operations.	62	6
201401	466	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Clearly, we learned a lot at year-end, but, since year-end, there’s been a step-up in usage that we’re learning from, in terms of the effect of this program on the structure of money markets.	62	6
201401	467	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So that would be my suggestion for this resolution.	62	6
201401	468	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Mr Chairman, could I respond?	62	6
201401	469	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Yes.	62	6
201401	470	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I think it’s true that interest on excess reserves can achieve the goals that you want.	62	6
201401	471	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	It will be somewhat messy, I believe, in the current structure.	62	6
201401	472	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	There’s no doubt that we could raise rates.	62	6
201401	473	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	The urgency here is, we’d like to learn how to raise rates in the smoothest possible way.	62	6
201401	474	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And if you are raising rates at the start of next year—a possible time frame under some measures—we don’t have that much time to learn about how to do that in the smoothest way, which is why we’d like the exercise to be extended in a way that we think we can learn the most.	62	6
201401	475	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I think this is the discussion we had last time, President Lacker, on this issue.	62	6
201401	476	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	When we were thinking about it, we thought this was the best setup in which to learn the most in the next few months, particularly if there are operational changes that we need to make to make this more effective.	62	6
201401	477	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And the big change we’re not making is changing the rate structure; that’s 0 to 5 basis points for the moment.	62	6
201401	478	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	62	6
201401	479	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	May I ask a question, Simon?	62	6
201401	480	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Is it critical that we go to full allotment in order to achieve what you just described?	62	6
201401	481	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	It is not critical.	62	6
201401	482	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	If you think of taking $10 billion or $20 billion as the cap and multiplying by 120 counterparties, that’s a lot of money.	62	6
201401	483	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Right.	62	6
201401	484	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I think one of the tensions here is between how much we want to be intrusive in the counterparty relationships that are there right now and how much we want to be intrusive at a later date if this is something that we use at a later date.	62	6
201401	485	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	What we’re doing means if market rates go up a lot and they’re well above 5 basis points, you shouldn’t see that much take- up of the facility that we have, and it should be the case that you do get market rates moving up a little bit if the bargaining power does go up.	62	6
201401	486	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	So that’s the bargaining power that people get.	62	6
201401	487	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Some people have less bargaining power, and that means that we’re not transmitting the rate structure fully through the way that we’d like to.	62	6
201401	488	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Well, as you know—and I’ve expressed it in the media—I have enormous confidence in the way you—and your deputy, by the way—operate.	62	6
201401	489	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I do think President Plosser and President Lacker have some good points, and I am a little uncomfortable going to full allotment.	62	6
201401	490	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I would like to have this Committee fully briefed; a lot of this is quite esoteric for all of us.	62	6
201401	491	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Again, this isn’t questioning our confidence or my confidence or any participant’s or member’s confidence in you, because we have enormous confidence in you.	62	6
201401	492	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I do think, Mr.	62	6
201401	493	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Chairman, that President Plosser and President Lacker raise a very good question.	62	6
201401	494	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m uncomfortable with full allotment for the same reasons that they expressed.	62	6
201401	495	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Again, I want to underscore—and Simon knows this, and you know this because you’ve seen it in the New York Times—that I have tremendous faith in you.	62	6
201401	496	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I think we need to be educated in the process along the way, and if it’s not critical that we go to full allotment in order to achieve a better understanding of this exercise, then, unless you were to say it is critical, I would argue the same as President Plosser and President Lacker.	62	6
201401	497	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’d feel uncomfortable.	62	6
201401	498	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We cannot say that it’s critical right now.	62	6
201401	499	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We can still learn more by increasing the cap.	62	6
201401	500	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And we want you to learn more.	62	6
201401	501	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s a key thing.	62	6
201401	502	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I’d say that I would find it harder to learn in a way that’s neutral if we didn’t have a long horizon over which to do that.	62	6
201401	503	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Setting up these speed bumps is a worrying thing to do, particularly if the speed bump is sometime in the summer and you see markets getting worried about the forward guidance.	62	6
201401	504	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	They will be hypersensitive to some of the things we try to learn about at that time.	62	6
201401	505	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s why probably the 12-month extension is a bigger deal than going to full allotment right now.	62	6
201401	506	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I do think that something like $10 billion to $15 billion, looking at the chart I have here, allows us to learn more than $5 billion would, and that’s very close to full allotment.	62	6
201401	507	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	It doesn’t have what people have expressed—this feeling that we have to be going down this road.	62	6
201401	508	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	I would say, personally, that the chance that you will choose this as one of the main tools that you use to control interest rates is close to 100 percent once all of the memos come back, but you might want to wait and find out.	62	6
201401	509	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s fine, because it’s your choice.	62	6
201401	510	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Mr Chairman, I would like to recommend that we not go to full allotment—again, just in terms of being fully comfortable with this exercise—although I do agree with Simon that this is going to be a critical tool for us to use.	62	6
201401	511	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Personally, I actually see it replacing the federal funds rate.	62	6
201401	512	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I think we should be cautious, if only in order that we have a full understanding and because it is not critical that we go to full allotment to achieve a better operating understanding.	62	6
201401	513	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So that would be my recommendation—say, do the $10 billion.	62	6
201401	514	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Would you be comfortable with $10 billion?	62	6
201401	515	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Yes, sir, I would.	62	6
201401	516	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201401	517	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with Simon that the time period is more important than $10 billion versus full allotment, but I also think that this suggestion that we shouldn’t learn more prior to April doesn’t make a lot of sense to me, because that’s actually going to inform the discussion in April.	62	6
201401	518	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Learning as much as we can by April is actually going to lead to a better discussion in April.	62	6
201401	519	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I also do have the same concerns as Simon that the more we can do now to put this in place reduces the risk of doing something later whereby this is seen as part of the exit strategy.	62	6
201401	520	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I can live with the $10 billion cap, but I feel very strongly that having a 12-month time horizon is much better than a 6-month time horizon.	62	6
201401	521	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	62	6
201401	522	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	523	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I, too, would prefer to have the $10 billion cap at this time.	62	6
201401	524	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I appreciate the remarks that the Vice Chairman just made.	62	6
201401	525	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the other hand, I think we have to balance that against some of the costs that President Plosser pointed to—that going down the path of experimentation creates potential costs for us in terms of irreversibilities that might lead us to be more reluctant about certain choices regarding long-run operating frameworks.	62	6
201401	526	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So there’s an interaction between our experimentation now and our choices later that we should be taking into account as well.	62	6
201401	527	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On balance, for me, the way to compromise between these tensions is a cap at $10 billion but an extension for a full year.	62	6
201401	528	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	62	6
201401	529	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The proposal—$10 billion cap and one year—is on the table.	62	6
201401	530	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Is that acceptable?	62	6
201401	531	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lacker.	62	6
201401	532	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The concern about the time horizon that I hadn’t heard before has to do with the possibility that an announcement we’d make at the end of that period about extending the exercise further could become confused with a signal about the exit strategy.	62	6
201401	533	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Two things.	62	6
201401	534	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	First, I think we can communicate the separation.	62	6
201401	535	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	We’ve done that with all of our experimental stuff so far—successfully, I believe.	62	6
201401	536	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think the Desk has reported problems in conveying the separation of these experimental things from policy signals.	62	6
201401	537	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Probably because we’ve been careful to try to do that.	62	6
201401	538	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Right, and I trust that we’d be careful again.	62	6
201401	539	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	62	6
201401	540	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	But, second, it strikes me that there’s no less risk of confusion a year from now than there is six months from now at announcing something that might be confused with a signal about exit.	62	6
201401	541	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So I just don’t see the argument on that ground.	62	6
201401	542	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	62	6
201401	543	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, the second reason to have a longer time horizon is, of course, that people will take this as something that is going to be more long lasting.	62	6
201401	544	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So they’re actually going to adjust their counterparty relationships in a way that makes the test more realistic.	62	6
201401	545	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Which is the controversial part.	62	6
201401	546	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That is the controversial part, but you want something that’s actually going to behave in testing how it’s actually going to behave in substance if you move to substance subsequently.	62	6
201401	547	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think the 12-month time horizon is also appropriate because it’s going to make the value of the information we get better.	62	6
201401	548	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We can also use rates if we want to ease the switchback.	62	6
201401	549	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We can operate at zero rates.	62	6
201401	550	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	You could decide to offer negative rates only.	62	6
201401	551	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	There are lots of things you could do if you wanted to use prices to smooth people back out of it.	62	6
201401	552	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	There’s maybe a six-month horizon on the typical relationship.	62	6
201401	553	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	So going a bit past six months is helpful for people.	62	6
201401	554	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lacker.	62	6
201401	555	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Can I ask when the staff work is expected to be ready for us?	62	6
201401	556	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The April meeting.	62	6
201401	557	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	We had a test of the federal funds market over year-end in which there was a reduction in the FHLBs’ supplying fed funds.	62	6
201401	558	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	You saw a very small decline in the federal funds rate.	62	6
201401	559	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	One story we’ve heard is that the overnight RRP actually helped with that because it was propping up rates.	62	6
201401	560	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	So market participants definitely believe that it is providing a somewhat firm floor at the moment—just at this level.	62	6
201401	561	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	That’s great, but we’re talking about the advantage of a long period being building up momentum in participation, and that’s exactly what makes it a little bit irreversible.	62	6
201401	562	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	It strikes me that April is less likely, if anything, to be confused on the exit ground.	62	6
201401	563	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So the 12-month period from this April to next April seems more attractive than the coming 12 months.	62	6
201401	564	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, if you want to do this in a parliamentary way, you could make an alternative amendment.	62	6
201401	565	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We could compare your amendment with the $10 billion amendment and then vote that against the original proposition.	62	6
201401	566	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Does that seem fair?	62	6
201401	567	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Sure.	62	6
201401	568	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	What’s your alternative?	62	6
201401	569	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	April, $5 billion.	62	6
201401	570	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Through April 30?	62	6
201401	571	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	At the April meeting.	62	6
201401	572	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	And when’s the FOMC?	62	6
201401	573	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, it’s April 30.	62	6
201401	574	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Can we make it the end of the month?	62	6
201401	575	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Is that what you want?	62	6
201401	576	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Sure.	62	6
201401	577	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	62	6
201401	578	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So we have the proposal of $5 billion through April 30, and we have the $10 billion.	62	6
201401	579	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I’m going to ask for a show of hands from all participants.	62	6
201401	580	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s $10 billion with a January date?	62	6
201401	581	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I meant $10 billion with a one-year extension.	62	6
201401	582	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Yes.	62	6
201401	583	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Okay.	62	6
201401	584	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We’ll take the winner of that and then ask whether we want to amend the original proposal.	63	6
201401	585	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right?	63	6
201401	586	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So there are now two potential amendments on the floor.	63	6
201401	587	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Who’s in favor of $5 billion and April?	63	6
201401	588	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Show of hands]	63	6
201401	589	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s 1, 2, 3, 4.	63	6
201401	590	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Who’s in favor of $10 billion and one year?	63	6
201401	591	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Show of hands]	63	6
201401	592	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.	63	6
201401	593	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	63	6
201401	594	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So the proposed amendment is $10 billion and one year.	63	6
201401	595	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We are now asking who is in favor of making that amendment as opposed to the original proposal.	63	6
201401	596	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those in favor of making that amendment—that is, to change the original proposal to put on a $10 billion cap—please raise your hand.	63	6
201401	597	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those in favor?	63	6
201401	598	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Show of hands]	63	6
201401	599	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.	63	6
201401	600	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those in favor of the original proposal, which was no cap?	63	6
201401	601	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I see 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.	63	6
201401	602	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	63	6
201401	603	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So the amendments are rejected.	63	6
201401	604	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Barney Frank would be proud of me.	63	6
201401	605	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Laughter]	63	6
201401	606	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	You need a few more jokes.	63	6
201401	607	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Yes, I need a few more jokes.	63	6
201401	608	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Finally, we’re going to take a vote on the proposal versus negating the proposal.	63	6
201401	609	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	63	6
201401	610	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All in favor of the proposal, raise your hand.	63	6
201401	611	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Show of hands]	63	6
201401	612	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.	63	6
201401	613	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those against the proposal?	63	6
201401	614	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So, 1, 2.	63	6
201401	615	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Is this just voters?	63	6
201401	616	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Participants.	63	6
201401	617	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Should we do it again?	63	6
201401	618	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, I think we should.	63	6
201401	619	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let’s go again.	63	6
201401	620	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It should be just voters.	63	6
201401	621	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	63	6
201401	622	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	For the record, let’s have voters on approving this original proposal.	63	6
201401	623	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Voters in favor of the original proposal?	63	6
201401	624	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Show of hands]	63	6
201401	625	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.	63	6
201401	626	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those voters against the proposal?	63	6
201401	627	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay, 1, 2.	63	6
201401	628	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	63	6
201401	629	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The usual suspects, Mr Chairman.	63	6
201401	630	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	63	6
201401	631	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Fine.	63	6
201401	632	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, nevertheless, I think the Desk heard some of the concerns.	63	6
201401	633	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We will go slowly.	63	6
201401	634	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We will come back to the Committee.	63	6
201401	635	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	At the start of the morning tomorrow, I would like to go through the Desk statement that we would release because the discussion suggested we might want to make some changes in that.	63	6
201401	636	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Right.	63	6
201401	637	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	And we’ll be very careful not to disturb existing markets unduly.	63	6
201401	638	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	63	6
201401	639	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you for that.	63	6
201401	640	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Now let’s go back.	63	6
201401	641	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any questions for Simon on financial market issues?	62	6
201401	642	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	62	6
201401	643	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Simon, I want to come back to the very beginning of your presentation.	62	6
201401	644	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You mentioned, within the first three exhibits, that the decision we took at the last meeting was very undimensional and had little or no impact on Desk operations.	62	6
201401	645	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You also mentioned, and we have the table in front of us, that the 10-year yield has actually come down.	62	6
201401	646	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The last time I looked, it was 2.77 percent, but the point is, it’s come down to close to the 3 percent area.	62	6
201401	647	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But you did mention, and we saw, a significant—I think that was the word you used—recent selloff in risk assets.	62	6
201401	648	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think that we have to keep this in perspective because we had about a 30 percent rise last year.	62	6
201401	649	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The S&P is now two and a half times its March 9, 2009 low , and we see that, since the previous FOMC meeting, the S&P index is up 0.5 percent, even though it was up a little bit higher.	62	6
201401	650	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You can see that in the right-hand chart.	62	6
201401	651	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I drill on this only because I think we have to be mindful of the fact that we’ve had an enormously robust, bullish market.	62	6
201401	652	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There are going to be corrections, and they might be much more severe than what we had.	62	6
201401	653	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Of greatest interest to me is that the 10-year Treasury bond yield has really not moved that much.	62	6
201401	654	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In fact, it’s come off a little bit.	62	6
201401	655	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I’m personally more interested in what happens in the bond markets.	62	6
201401	656	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And you would expect a reaction, of course, in the equity markets.	62	6
201401	657	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I would just like the Committee to be aware of the fact that it would not be at all surprising to see a not insignificant correction in equities—on the order of 10-plus percent— just because of the single direction it’s been going in for an awfully long time.	62	6
201401	658	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And I wouldn’t want that to condition policymaking, unless we see something very odd in the fixed-income markets.	62	6
201401	659	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I mention that, Mr Chairman, because I think it’s an important point.	62	6
201401	660	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And if we were to take chart 2 and stretch it out to March 2009, we would see a different picture entirely.	62	6
201401	661	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s an important thing for us to bear in mind.	62	6
201401	662	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	62	6
201401	663	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	62	6
201401	664	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Other questions for Simon?	62	6
201401	665	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	62	6
201401	666	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I need a motion to approve the domestic open market operations since December.	63	6
201401	667	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	So moved.	63	6
201401	668	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	63	6
201401	669	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	63	6
201401	670	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Without objection.	63	6
201401	671	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let’s turn now to item 9, “Economic Situation,” and I’ll call on David Wilcox for the presentation.	11	1
201401	672	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	11	1
201401	673	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I’ll be referring to the single exhibit titled “Material for Forecast Summary.”	11	1
201401	674	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	For the most part, the economic recovery appears now to be on firmer ground than it did at the time of the December meeting.	11	1
201401	675	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	To be sure, even Garrison Keillor would concede that not all of the news that we received over the intermeeting period was above average, but much of it was.	11	1
201401	676	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	As you can see from the top-left panel of the “Forecast Summary” exhibit, the incoming spending data caused us to mark up our estimate of second-half real GDP growth by a little more than 1 percentage point, with consumption, business investment, and foreign trade all contributing.	11	1
201401	677	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The upward revision to consumer spending was particularly encouraging and brings that category of spending into closer alignment with the predictions of some of the models that we follow.	11	1
201401	678	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We still have the growth of real PCE stepping down in the current quarter relative to the torrid fourth-quarter pace, partly because we continue to assume that the Congress will not reverse the expiration of the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program that took place at the turn of the year.	11	1
201401	679	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	As in the previous Tealbook, we expect the expiration of this program to subtract about ½ percentage point from real consumption growth in the current quarter.	11	1
201401	680	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Today’s advance durables report was one of the flies in Garrison Keillor’s ointment, but, even folding in this news, we still have the level of equipment spending a little higher in the current quarter than we did six weeks ago.	11	1
201401	681	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Another fly in the ointment came from residential investment.	11	1
201401	682	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	While December’s single-family starts figure retraced only some of November’s jump, single-family permits—which we generally look to as providing a better gauge of activity in the sector—surprised us to the downside in December.	11	1
201401	683	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	So where do we stand in the broader recovery of housing activity?	11	1
201401	684	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	First, we think the most intense phase of adjustment to last year’s upward movement in mortgage interest rates is likely behind us.	11	1
201401	685	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We take some encouragement in this regard from the flattening out of existing home sales and the brighter tone of recent readings on builder, Realtor, and homebuyer sentiment.	11	1
201401	686	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Second, while future increases in rates will exert further restraint, we continue to think that, in the medium term, the basic arithmetic of the situation is that activity has to move up from its current level, because otherwise we will be running an ongoing deficit relative to demographically driven demands.	11	1
201401	687	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	But the latest data raise important questions about how quickly homebuilding will resume that more normal pace, and those are the questions we’ll be focusing on quite intently in future rounds.	11	1
201401	688	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	In previous Tealbooks, we raised the possibility that the then-available estimates of real GDP were misleadingly weak, and that the faster growth of real GDI and the ongoing declines in the unemployment rate might have been providing the truer signals about the strength of the recovery.	11	1
201401	689	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	At the risk of tempting fate, it’s hard not to regard the brighter tone of the incoming data over the intermeeting period as giving that hypothesis greater credence.	11	1
201401	690	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Our projection for real GDP growth over the next few years is, nonetheless, at this point, little revised from December, as two opposing forces fought each other roughly to a draw: On the one hand, aggregate demand seems to have a little greater momentum than before.	11	1
201401	691	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	On the other hand, some of the other factors that we condition our forecast on have become a little less supportive of growth.	11	1
201401	692	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Chief among these is the trajectory for the foreign exchange value of the dollar, which we’ve adjusted upward relative to our assumption in the December Tealbook.	11	1
201401	693	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	In addition, as we described in the Tealbook, we have the funds rate coming up a little more quickly than we did in December, and the steeper increase in the funds rate drives a slightly faster rise in longer-term rates.	11	1
201401	694	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Turning to the labor market, the December employment report was a mixed bag.	11	1
201401	695	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	On the establishment side, total nonfarm payroll employment rose only 74,000 in December.	11	1
201401	696	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Even accounting for the likely effect of last month’s bad weather—which we estimate to be on the order of about 20,000 jobs—December’s gain was well below our forecast.	11	1
201401	697	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	For the most part, we looked through the disappointment in payroll employment, as you can see in the top-right panel, and left our jobs forecast over the medium term essentially unrevised relative to December.	11	1
201401	698	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	On the household side, the puzzles were, if anything, even bigger.	11	1
201401	699	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The unemployment rate—shown in the middle-left panel—declined 0.3 percentage point last month, to 6.7 percent, whereas we had been projecting no change.	11	1
201401	700	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	At the same time, the labor force participation rate—not shown—declined 0.2 percentage point; again, we had been expecting no change.	11	1
201401	701	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	As you know, and as Charles Fleischman reiterated in his briefing yesterday, we’ve been too pessimistic about the unemployment rate for a couple of years now, despite a pretty good track record with respect to the growth of real GDP.	11	1
201401	702	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	To make a very, very, very long story considerably shorter, we trimmed our assumption for the growth of potential GDP, both during the past few years and, to a lesser extent, going forward.	11	1
201401	703	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Mechanically, this adjustment allows us to better explain the decline in the unemployment rate during the past couple of years, particularly given that we wanted to scale back the role of the panic-and-normalization story that had, until now, featured more prominently in our narrative.	11	1
201401	704	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	As a result of the changes we made to the supply side—and the surprises to actual output and the unemployment rate that we’ve seen since the December Tealbook— we now have an output gap at the end of last year that’s ½ percentage point narrower than in our previous projection and an unemployment gap that is ¼ percentage point narrower.	11	1
201401	705	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Moreover, we project that the unemployment rate will cross your 6½ percent threshold around the middle of this year and will lie just below our assumed 5¼ percent natural rate at the end of 2016.	11	1
201401	706	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We also took another look during the intermeeting period at the behavior of the labor force participation rate in recent years.	11	1
201401	707	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	In a memo that you received last week, Tomaz Cajner and Bruce Fallick conclude that about half of the reduction in the participation rate since 2007 is due to demographic factors—specifically, the aging of the population.	11	1
201401	708	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	As the middle-right panel shows, participation rates for men and women drop off sharply around age 65; hence, the increasing share of those aged 65 or above in the overall population has yielded a secular decline in the aggregate participation rate.	11	1
201401	709	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	This trend has been exacerbated by changes in group-specific participation rates—such as reductions in participation among younger and prime-age individuals—an important share of which also appears to be structural rather than cyclical in nature.	11	1
201401	710	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The fact that the decline in aggregate participation late last year coincided with a surprising decline in the unemployment rate certainly raises the question as to whether the two developments might be causally linked.	11	1
201401	711	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Until now, we’ve been skeptical of such a linkage, based on previous historical experience.	11	1
201401	712	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	But in light of the magnitude of the surprises in the two variables, this round our baseline projection incorporates the possibility that unusual weakness in participation might help explain the surprising decline in the unemployment rate.	11	1
201401	713	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	This is a linkage that we’ll obviously be scrutinizing going forward.	11	1
201401	714	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Finally, with respect to inflation:  The recent data have come in about as we expected; as you can see from the bottom-left panel, we’ve edged up our core inflation forecast over the medium term to reflect the slightly narrower margin of slack in this projection.	11	1
201401	715	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The panel on the bottom right decomposes the contour of our core PCE projection in terms of its fundamental determinants.	11	1
201401	716	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	A similar exercise was undertaken for the December Tealbook forecast in the recent memo on the staff inflation outlook by Alan Detmeister, Jean-Philippe Laforte, and Jeremy Rudd.	11	1
201401	717	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We expect core inflation to step up this year, reflecting an acceleration in import prices and a reduced influence of some other factors that kept core inflation low in 2013 but that we think will prove largely transitory.	11	1
201401	718	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Thereafter, core inflation edges up gradually as inflation expectations remain anchored near the Committee’s target, and the amount of economic slack diminishes.	11	1
201401	719	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The projected contour of headline PCE inflation—not shown—is broadly similar, though projected declines in consumer energy prices leave headline inflation running just below core.	11	1
201401	720	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Steve Kamin will now continue our remarks.	11	1
201401	721	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for the Foreign Economic Outlook.”	11	1
201401	722	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated in panel 1, in the top-left corner, after several years of weak and choppy performance, the economies of our trading partners appear set for solid, sustained economic growth.	11	1
201401	723	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The global financial turbulence that erupted after we put the Tealbook to bed last week could, in principle, snowball and derail this recovery, but we don’t consider that to be the most likely outcome.	11	1
201401	724	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	But before discussing this risk, I’ll briefly review our forecast.	11	1
201401	725	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Starting with the advanced foreign economies, the solid black line in panel 1, their rebound actually started early last year as the euro-area recession ended, the UK economy emerged from its doldrums, and Japanese growth surged on the back of Abenomics-inspired fiscal and monetary expansion.	11	1
201401	726	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We estimate that average growth in the AFEs remained solid last quarter and should edge up a little more over the next several years as the euro-area recovery picks up speed, more than offsetting a moderation in Japan’s growth to more sustainable rates.	11	1
201401	727	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The emerging market economies (EMEs), the red line, have also rebounded from their earlier weakness, and we estimate that GDP growth notched up further in the fourth quarter.	11	1
201401	728	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	China’s growth slowed a touch, but to a still quite solid 8 percent, while activity in the other Asian EMEs appears to have accelerated as exports strengthened.	11	1
201401	729	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	For Latin America, we estimate that the Mexican economy grew at a 3½ percent pace for the second quarter in a row, while Brazilian GDP picked up after contracting in the third quarter.	11	1
201401	730	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We are looking for just a bit higher growth for the EMEs in the remainder of the forecast period, driven importantly by stronger demand from the advanced economies, including the United States.	11	1
201401	731	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	With economic data from abroad generally coming in as we’d expected, our forecast is essentially the same as the one we wrote down in December, as you can almost see by looking at the dotted lines in panel 1.	11	1
201401	732	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the Tealbook, we identified two reasons why, despite the fact that we did not alter our projection, our confidence in the global recovery had strengthened.	11	1
201401	733	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, we noted that, in peripheral Europe, financial stresses had continued to ease and output is bottoming out, further reducing the likelihood of a resurgence of the euro-area crisis.	11	1
201401	734	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We stand by that call.	11	1
201401	735	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Second, we noted that your decision to taper asset purchases at the December meeting had been largely taken in stride by emerging financial markets, and this boded well for future stability in the region.	11	1
201401	736	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Here, the turbulence in global markets that erupted late last week has given us pause.	11	1
201401	737	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As Simon noted, market commentary attributed the global selloff in risky assets late last week to a number of disparate events—a low PMI reading for China, the selloff of the Turkish lira, and Argentina’s devaluation—that may signal a sharp decline in emerging market economic growth.	11	1
201401	738	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We are skeptical that these developments support such a sharp downgrade in either the emerging market or the global outlook.	11	1
201401	739	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In particular, the decline in the flash PMI for Chinese manufacturing in January to 49.6, which was cited in many media reports, does not signal outright contraction in output.	11	1
201401	740	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Rather, it is entirely consistent with our forecast of only a gradual moderation of Chinese growth in the current and next few quarters.	11	1
201401	741	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	All of that said, however, even if this bout of financial turbulence is due more to an upswing in risk aversion than to fundamental factors, were it to persist and intensify, it could still damp the global economic recovery and thus bears watching closely.	11	1
201401	742	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Beyond the risks of financial flare-ups in emerging markets, we have also been focused on the possibility of deflation in the advanced foreign economies.	11	1
201401	743	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Panel 2 shows that inflation rates in some of the major AFEs have moved down along with US rates in the past couple of years.	11	1
201401	744	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	To shed more light on this development, panel 3 reproduces from a box in the Tealbook a decomposition of movements in the average inflation rate of the advanced foreign economies excluding Japan.	11	1
201401	745	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The decomposition is based on Phillips curve regressions that link quarterly headline inflation rates (the solid line) to survey measures of inflation expectations, the output gap, supply factors such as oil and import prices, and consumption taxes.	11	1
201401	746	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Focusing on inflation between 2011 and 2013, much of the decline can be attributed to a widening output gap (the red bars) and, more important, the waning of earlier upward pressures from supply factors (the green bars) and tax hikes (the pink bars).	11	1
201401	747	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Going forward, declining oil prices and moderate currency appreciation should exert only modest further downward pressures.	11	1
201401	748	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As the recovery in these economies progresses, reductions in resource slack should push inflation back up toward target levels, as shown in panel 2.	11	1
201401	749	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, this outlook depends critically on inflation expectations continuing to remain well anchored.	11	1
201401	750	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	An alternative simulation in the Tealbook shows that if, instead, inflation expectations start to drift down, real interest rates will rise, AFE economic activity will weaken, and thus US growth will be dragged down as well.	11	1
201401	751	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Foreign central banks are clearly focused on these risks.	11	1
201401	752	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In November, the ECB cut rates when 12-month inflation unexpectedly fell to 0.7 percent, and, more recently, Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz noted that downside risks to inflation were a central concern, suggesting that the Bank of Canada might keep interest rates low for longer than previously anticipated.	11	1
201401	753	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Conversely, in the United Kingdom, where inflation has fallen close to the 2 percent target, the Bank of England faces a different problem, and one closely related to our own policy challenge.	11	1
201401	754	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In August of last year, as marked by the vertical line in panel 4, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee announced it would not tighten policy at least until unemployment fell below 7 percent, a threshold it anticipated reaching in 2016.	11	1
201401	755	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, as indicated by the red line, the UK unemployment rate plummeted, and the threshold may already have been crossed.	11	1
201401	756	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Thus, the Bank of England is confronting the questions of whether falling unemployment rates reflect an actual narrowing in resource slack and how it should adjust its forward guidance in response.	11	1
201401	757	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Unlike in the United States, the decline in the UK unemployment rate has not been accompanied by falling labor force participation.	11	1
201401	758	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 5, labor force participation has, in fact, risen slightly in recent years.	11	1
201401	759	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Instead, turning to panel 6, over the past couple of quarters, unexpectedly rapid employment growth, which has been associated with surprisingly weak productivity, has been the main driver of falling unemployment in the United Kingdom.	11	1
201401	760	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although rapidly rising employment suggests narrowing output gaps, Bank of England staff members point to a number of reasons why they believe that sufficient slack remains to obviate the need to raise interest rates in the near future: Inflation has been declining and wage growth has been weak; the unemployment rate remains above their estimates of the natural rate; average weekly hours remain depressed; and they continue to hope that, just as earlier declines in GDP were associated with falls in productivity, resurgent output growth will lead to a recovery of productivity.	11	1
201401	761	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	They plan to elaborate on these issues in their February Inflation Report.	11	1
201401	762	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We do not know how the Bank of England’s policymakers will adjust their forward guidance, but our sense is that they are less likely to lower their unemployment rate threshold than to emphasize, as we have done, that they will look at a range of indicators and likely hold the policy rate low until well after the threshold is crossed.	11	1
201401	763	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	This concludes my prepared remarks.	11	1
201401	764	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	David and I will be happy to answer your questions.	11	1
201401	765	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you very much.	11	1
201401	766	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there questions for David or Steve?	12	1
201401	767	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201401	768	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	12	1
201401	769	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First of all, I want to compliment David on the inclusion of the alternative view in the box in the Tealbook A.	12	1
201401	770	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that was a very positive step forward.	12	1
201401	771	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s very important for the Committee to be kept abreast of the debates that are being held within the Board staff, and so I found that very helpful.	12	1
201401	772	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I follow with a question.	12	1
201401	773	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the last six months or so, there’s been, I think, a relatively large gap developing between what we see in the establishment survey and what we see in the household survey with respect to employment.	12	1
201401	774	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I was wondering what the staff’s thoughts about that gap are.	12	1
201401	775	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	You’re right, and I think the answer is, we don’t really understand why there’s such a difference.	12	1
201401	776	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	Because they’re different surveys, there could just be measurement differences in the two surveys.	12	1
201401	777	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	The BLS tries to adjust the household survey to the payroll concept.	12	1
201401	778	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	But in this particular case, that doesn’t really help very much.	12	1
201401	779	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	I think the other possibility is that there tend to be cyclical patterns in the difference between household and payroll employment.	12	1
201401	780	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	When the economy is very weak, household employment tends to fall less than payroll employment, and the reverse occurs in recoveries.	12	1
201401	781	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	One possible explanation for that is, in a weak economy, you may have a lot of people working off the books for a few hours a week.	12	1
201401	782	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	They report themselves as employed in the household survey, but they’re not really on anybody’s payroll in a technical sense.	12	1
201401	783	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	So they’re not picked up by the payroll survey.	12	1
201401	784	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	It’s possible that what’s going on over the past year or so is that, as the economy continues to improve, you’re getting more people who are moving back into payroll jobs even though they were already in jobs in the “informal” sector, if you will.	12	1
201401	785	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To maybe sharpen my question, your sense is that what’s going on in the establishment survey is more a sign of the evolution of labor market health than what’s going on in the household survey?	12	1
201401	786	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	Right.	12	1
201401	787	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	Over periods like that, six months or so, we tend to pay a lot more attention to the trends in the payroll survey than to those in the household survey.	12	1
201401	788	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	12	1
201401	789	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	12	1
201401	790	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I had a really—almost silly—technical question.	12	1
201401	791	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	David, the question is about the 1.9 percent assumption on expected inflation in the last chart, in the bottom right of your handout—and it was discussed in one of the memos.	12	1
201401	792	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Because the methodology changed, and therefore it lowered the longer-run average by one-tenth of 1 percent, you lowered expected inflation to 1.9 percent.	12	1
201401	793	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that’s a weird way of doing it.	12	1
201401	794	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Given that consumers think our target is 2 percent, wouldn’t you think they would still think our target was 2 percent?	12	1
201401	795	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I didn’t understand the logic of that.	12	1
201401	796	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	It’s an annoying situation.	12	1
201401	797	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just didn’t understand it.	12	1
201401	798	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wouldn’t have done it that way, I guess.	12	1
201401	799	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, I’m sympathetic to that.	12	1
201401	800	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	12	1
201401	801	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I wasn’t missing something, then.	12	1
201401	802	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	No.	12	1
201401	803	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	But here’s the conundrum.	12	1
201401	804	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We thought we had a thermometer outside that said it was 32 degrees.	12	1
201401	805	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We took a survey of people, and we asked them, “How cold does it feel?”	12	1
201401	806	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	They said, “Well, it feels about 32 degrees outside.”	12	1
201401	807	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We changed the thermometer.	12	1
201401	808	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Now the thermometer reads 31.	12	1
201401	809	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The survey expectations still were unchanged, as before.	12	1
201401	810	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	How do we handle that situation?	12	1
201401	811	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	That’s a crude analogy.	12	1
201401	812	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But we’re telling them, on the new thermometer, that we’re going to still be at 32, not 31, right?	12	1
201401	813	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	No matter what it feels like, it’s 32.	12	1
201401	814	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think that’s right, but I don’t want to debate it excessively because what we’re talking about is 10 basis points on the inflation rate.	12	1
201401	815	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Perhaps with this discussion we could feel that we’ve done our job of alerting—and you’ve helped to alert—the Committee to the issue.	12	1
201401	816	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	To the extent of 10 basis points on the inflation rate, we think that, at the margin, you’ll need to run that much of a more expansionary monetary policy in order to get inflation, as actually measured, up to your 2 percent objective.	12	1
201401	817	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	And that’s the reason why we felt duty bound, constrained by intellectual integrity, to reduce expectations to 1.9 percent.	12	1
201401	818	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess what I’m concerned about is, I would be hesitant in future meetings to have the chart continue to show 1.9 percent inflation expectations in perpetuity when we’re targeting 2 percent.	12	1
201401	819	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It just seems inconsistent.	12	1
201401	820	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m going to drop that.	12	1
201401	821	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I have a question for Steve that’s more substantive.	12	1
201401	822	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	I hope so.	12	1
201401	823	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, this is clearly relevant, though, to what you show going forward.	12	1
201401	824	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	EMEs—you’ve seen the turbulence recently.	12	1
201401	825	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We have a forecast of acceleration in economic growth.	12	1
201401	826	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	How nervous are you about that forecast, given that we’ve seen some very sharp market moves in recent days?	12	1
201401	827	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Not knowing what’s going to happen, do you put much weight on what’s been happening over the last week in terms of a risk to the forecast, or do you put very little weight on it?	12	1
201401	828	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just want to get your sense.	12	1
201401	829	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	I would say that we put more than very little weight on it.	12	1
201401	830	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The way I would put it is, as we moved into the second half of the year, when emerging markets were obviously in a more turbulent situation, responding to expectations of tightening in the United States and other advanced economies, we perceived the volatility and we assumed it would last for quite some time, moving into the coming year.	12	1
201401	831	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	What’s been happening recently is a little bit outsized in comparison with our expectations, because we wouldn’t have expected so much volatility both to erupt so quickly and to have such a marked impact on advanced-economy equity markets and bond markets.	12	1
201401	832	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In that sense, it’s been a little faster and more marked than we would have expected.	12	1
201401	833	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	But these things happen.	12	1
201401	834	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	And, that said, the upswing in volatility is more or less consistent with our sense that there were going to be these bumps in the road, and that this is one of them.	12	1
201401	835	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In that sense, if we had to redo our Tealbook forecast right now, we might shave it down just a touch to acknowledge this, but we probably wouldn’t move it very much.	12	1
201401	836	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	So that’s the baseline.	12	1
201401	837	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	All of that said, we know from experience that seemingly trivial events, like a Thai devaluation in 1997, can unexpectedly lead, through contagion in investor perceptions, to much more egregious events.	12	1
201401	838	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	So there’s no way we’re going to claim right now that, no, that cannot happen.	12	1
201401	839	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	12	1
201401	840	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Fair enough.	12	1
201401	841	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	12	1
201401	842	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Tarullo.	12	1
201401	843	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Mr Chairman, can I just piggyback on Bill’s question?	12	1
201401	844	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Steve, have you incorporated in your baseline economic growth forecast any sense of the reaction that emerging market countries may have in order to stave off more financial problems?	12	1
201401	845	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That is, if they follow normal prescriptions, they’re going to do some tightening of monetary policy and maybe implement some austerity measures, which will presumably bring growth down.	12	1
201401	846	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	And although that may have the salutary effect of holding off a set of currency problems, it would presumably be reducing economic growth.	12	1
201401	847	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Both in the December Tealbook and in previous Tealbooks dating back to the middle of last year, we had already built into our emerging market growth forecast the expectations that there would be some volatility and financial stresses, which would directly restrain economic growth, and, on top of that, prospective increases in interest rates, particularly in countries such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia, which would have to raise their rates in order to rein in inflation and to respond to the financial volatility.	12	1
201401	848	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	So we had built in all of that.	12	1
201401	849	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The effect on EME growth is relatively small.	12	1
201401	850	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	It’s on the order of ¼ percentage point.	12	1
201401	851	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	And so far, we have not felt the need to, in some sense, increase the amount of drag we put into our forecast in response to these developments.	12	1
201401	852	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Assuming that, in fact, markets calm down over the next week or two, we’d still be good with the adjustment we’ve put in.	12	1
201401	853	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	If markets go a different way, then we’ll have to respond.	12	1
201401	854	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	12	1
201401	855	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	12	1
201401	856	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	On Steve’s side, on the real economy side, one thing you might want to look at is what’s happening to the lease rates for Capesize and bulk shippers.	12	1
201401	857	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	They’ve come up significantly.	12	1
201401	858	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	China drives that market, as you know, and the build market.	12	1
201401	859	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	They’ve replaced the Koreans to a significant extent, and the Japanese are now building for their own consumption.	12	1
201401	860	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So there’s a capacity expansion, and yet lease rates are coming up.	12	1
201401	861	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Purchase prices are coming up.	12	1
201401	862	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	From what I understand from talking to shippers, a lot of this, of course, is driven by—even though it’s slower—a still-significant pace of import demand for iron ore, pulp, and whatnot by the Chinese.	12	1
201401	863	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	As Simon pointed out in his excellent briefing, the Shanghai composite is not a very useful indicator.	12	1
201401	864	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And a lot of changes are taking place with respect to the shadow banking system and so on, as was pointed out.	12	1
201401	865	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So I think we have to be careful, but, as you say, we should be watchful.	12	1
201401	866	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The point I wanted to make, though, is that, first, I want to agree with President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201401	867	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think Mr Wilcox has done some great work.	12	1
201401	868	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I like the devil’s advocate box, being a devil’s advocate; I also want to congratulate staff members on their very honest and straightforward paper on price inflation.	12	1
201401	869	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I have just one question that I didn’t see answered in that paper—and we can talk about it offline—but my question is, when we talk about measures of slack either in the EDO model or the FRB/US model, are you all focused on changes in slack or just the level of slack?	12	1
201401	870	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s not clear to me what we focus on or what we input.	12	1
201401	871	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	For the most part—and I’ll look to Jeremy Rudd, who was one of the authors—it’s the level of slack, but we do have some specifications that have a speed effect.	12	1
201401	872	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We inspect those specifications from time to time.	12	1
201401	873	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Jeremy, do you want to add anything?	12	1
201401	874	2014-01-29	meeting	RUDD	I’d say that our main focus is going to be on the level of slack.	12	1
201401	875	2014-01-29	meeting	RUDD	As David said, we do look at specifications that have a speed effect.	12	1
201401	876	2014-01-29	meeting	RUDD	We find that particular speed effects are present for some of the less-finished goods prices—commodity prices and that sort of thing.	12	1
201401	877	2014-01-29	meeting	RUDD	But we find, in general, that our main emphasis is on the level of the gap, which is the level of the unemployment rate relative to a natural rate construct.	12	1
201401	878	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you.	12	1
201401	879	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We’ve done some work on it—Evan Koenig, sitting behind me, has done some work on that difference—and maybe we could be of some help there.	12	1
201401	880	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Finally, on housing, you mentioned single-family permits and starts.	12	1
201401	881	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Because the fly is in Garrison Keillor’s ointment, am I correct that, in terms of the four census areas, the West actually had pretty good numbers in December compared with the three frozen areas, as it were?	12	1
201401	882	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So could you deduce that this might have been weather-related?	12	1
201401	883	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	It could be.	12	1
201401	884	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Normally, the permits numbers are much less affected, and so when we’re looking to explain an anomaly for starts, we often take refuge in referring to permits.	12	1
201401	885	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Generally speaking, the anecdotes from builders and others are that they can get down to city hall and file a permit application pretty much regardless of what the weather conditions are.	12	1
201401	886	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	So when it comes to looking at the permits numbers, those, historically, have been less affected by weather anomalies than the starts numbers.	12	1
201401	887	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I agree with that, but I just did note it.	12	1
201401	888	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There was a differential, particularly in the starts.	12	1
201401	889	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And then you mentioned examining the pace of future homebuilding.	12	1
201401	890	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You have some questions about that.	12	1
201401	891	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	For what it’s worth, again, I take a deep dive with the homebuilders in my go-round before this meeting.	12	1
201401	892	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	What I found interesting is that, first, their biggest concern is labor supply, which has a direct correlation to immigration policy and, second, their expectation, of course, is that the spring season started early.	12	1
201401	893	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But where they’re really finding cost pressures or frictions is in the ability to retain labor.	12	1
201401	894	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	As you know, most homes are built by Mexicans—I’ve talked about how there’s a little Costa Rican contingent—whether it’s in Maine, Seattle, or Dallas, it doesn’t matter.	12	1
201401	895	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But I’m hearing this across the board, for what it’s worth.	12	1
201401	896	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And it also has a price impact.	12	1
201401	897	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So that’s one thing you might want to examine.	12	1
201401	898	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s outside the realm of monetary policy, but, according to the builders themselves, it’s not insignificant.	12	1
201401	899	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s just a point I wanted to put on the table.	12	1
201401	900	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Yes, we’ve been a little surprised.	12	1
201401	901	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	To put exactly the same idea, I think, in slightly different vocabulary, we’ve been a little surprised about how steep the short-run supply curve is, and that it looks as though the industry may be undergoing some greater adjustment costs in getting back up to the kind of capacity that we saw before the recession.	12	1
201401	902	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Our guess is that those short-run supply restrictions will ease over time, and that we’ll get back to a situation in which builder capacity is much greater than it seems to be today.	12	1
201401	903	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, and again, thank you for this good work.	12	1
201401	904	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	12	1
201401	905	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Evans.	12	1
201401	906	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	12	1
201401	907	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I have two questions.	12	1
201401	908	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me ask one and get an answer and then try the second one, if I may.	12	1
201401	909	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m interested in the alternative simulation in the Tealbook related to low inflation, and I guess I’m maybe worried that our analysis doesn’t assign a very high cost to low inflation relative to our target.	12	1
201401	910	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So let me try to get that out.	12	1
201401	911	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In the simulation, the inflation rate is knocked down, and it stays there.	12	1
201401	912	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So the real rate would be high, and that would be bad for economic growth.	12	1
201401	913	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	But because the funds rate was going to start moving up, it has the ability not to move up quite so much, and it can basically offset that increase in the real rate because the zero lower bound is not really binding anymore.	12	1
201401	914	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That is, if you compare the real outcomes in this simulation with the baseline outcomes, they’re spot on.	12	1
201401	915	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	There’s no loss of economic growth; there’s no additional unemployment; there’s really no real cost.	12	1
201401	916	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So I guess I’m wondering whether there is a significant cost in these analyses to having a low inflation rate if the zero lower bound isn’t binding.	12	1
201401	917	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Just so that people aren’t concerned that this is only a low-inflation question, I think it’s symmetric.	12	1
201401	918	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	If we had a higher inflation rate and we could offset that higher run of inflation with a different funds rate, we might also have the same type of outcome.	12	1
201401	919	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I’d be interested in your reaction to that and what its implications might be for how we specify our loss function with regard to missing our inflation target.	12	1
201401	920	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I would agree with you.	12	1
201401	921	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	This is one version of a low-inflation scenario, and I think it would be possible to create versions that would be more pernicious in terms of their implications for economic activity.	12	1
201401	922	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We thought this one was among the range of possibilities, of which this is only one.	12	1
201401	923	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We thought this was one that was worth looking at.	12	1
201401	924	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	The Japanese experience, for example, did feature a fairly lengthy period of very low inflation but not a cumulating downward spiral, and that’s what we had in mind here.	12	1
201401	925	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	You’re right that, through the period in which the zero lower bound becomes less of a constraint, monetary policy is able to counteract much of the implication for real activity, but I entirely agree that, with other mechanisms, it’s possible to have a much more serious consequence for real activity.	12	1
201401	926	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Yes, I kicked this around with my staff a little bit, and so I understand the rules of the scenario, and it does seem reasonable.	12	1
201401	927	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	You’re trying to have a run of low inflation.	12	1
201401	928	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I guess I was wondering the following:  If you told me that inflation in 2015 was going to be 0.8 percent after it had already been like that, would I then expect GDP growth in 2015 to be 3.4 percent?	12	1
201401	929	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think I’d have that high a probability on that, and it is probably because I’d have a different scenario in mind—more like something that knocks down aggregate demand and does something.	12	1
201401	930	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	But that’s a different scenario.	12	1
201401	931	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So I take your point of what you’re trying to get across here.	12	1
201401	932	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think a critical issue would be, what’s the precipitating shock that gives rise to the persistent low inflation, and is it conceivable to imagine a shock directly to inflation expectations, and hence to inflation, that doesn’t operate predominantly through weaker activity?	12	1
201401	933	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	But there are other precipitating shocks that could do that.	12	1
201401	934	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	All right.	12	1
201401	935	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me move on to the second question, and thanks to the staff for the inflation memo.	12	1
201401	936	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It was impressive analysis, as almost always—given the way that I refer to my own “somewhat expert” staff, I mean, how could you expect me to say something different [laughter]?	12	1
201401	937	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Sorry.	12	1
201401	938	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	All right.	12	1
201401	939	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Anyway, I’m going to tackle a bunch of tough issues, and I think that the inflation specification in your equation 1 makes a lot of sense for how you’re going about doing it.	12	1
201401	940	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	12	1
201401	941	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	But now, having said all of that, let me ask the unfair questions.	12	1
201401	942	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s also the case that global inflation is low, as Steve just mentioned.	12	1
201401	943	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	And I guess there are at least two ways to think about that.	12	1
201401	944	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	One hypothesis is what you lay out here.	12	1
201401	945	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	There are a bunch of special factors—energy prices and things like that that show up as your colored boxes.	12	1
201401	946	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	You’ve got anchored long-term inflation expectations, and it’s these anchored long-term inflation expectations that I really want to get your reaction to, because they’re playing an awfully large role in this.	12	1
201401	947	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s the first hypothesis.	12	1
201401	948	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s a bunch of special factors.	12	1
201401	949	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	They’re largely transitory—that’s why they’re special.	12	1
201401	950	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	They’re going to work their way off, and it’s inevitable that we’re going to have inflation move up unless something else happens.	12	1
201401	951	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The second hypothesis would be to back off the emphasis on the long-term inflation expectations.	12	1
201401	952	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	And I appreciate how important they are for fitting the specification, but if you couldn’t have that, then the hypothesis might be that each country has a monetary policy that somehow just isn’t accommodative enough in order to get inflation up, because inflation ought to be monetary, and so everybody somehow is doing something similar.	12	1
201401	953	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s global low inflation.	12	1
201401	954	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So something that’s affecting inflation is happening in each and every country.	12	1
201401	955	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	You think it ought to be a common explanation.	12	1
201401	956	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Those are two types of common explanations.	12	1
201401	957	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So we’re just not fighting hard enough in order to get inflation back up to its target.	12	1
201401	958	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Now, after thinking that through, reading the memo, and looking at equation 1, I’m struck wondering what monetary policy does to keep inflation close to its long-run target.	12	1
201401	959	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We’ve got anchored long-term inflation expectations, and we’ve got a relatively flat Phillips curve.	12	1
201401	960	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So we can debate the size of the resource slack for quite a long time, but it’s not going to contribute a ton right off the bat for quite some time.	12	1
201401	961	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	And that’s exactly where you can see a role for monetary policy, on a meeting-to-meeting basis, to have some effect, but, instead, we’ve got long-term inflation expectations anchoring everything.	12	1
201401	962	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So that matters a lot, given the modeling choice.	12	1
201401	963	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The 1.9 percent question that Vice Chairman Dudley was asking about is another little annoyance in all of this once you link yourself to that anchored inflationary expectation.	12	1
201401	964	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I guess, when I think more deeply about it, the question is, what’s the role for monetary policy in this specification?	12	1
201401	965	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We think that monetary policy, as we said in the memo, plays a crucial role in supporting inflation expectations.	12	1
201401	966	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Predominantly, my overwhelming reaction to your remarks is, boy, that makes me feel really good, because it sounds as though the message of the memo came through very clearly.	12	1
201401	967	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We’re pinning a lot on this role of inflation expectations, and it’s an arguable proposition.	12	1
201401	968	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think it’s fair to say that it survives only because, at this point, it beats any alternative that we’ve been able to come up with.	12	1
201401	969	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We’ve got a fundamental problem as social scientists here.	12	1
201401	970	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	If we were attempting to build a model of inflation expectations, what would we normally do?	12	1
201401	971	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We’d put the variable we want to explain on the left-hand side of an econometric equation.	12	1
201401	972	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We’d start out by probably putting a constant term on the right-hand side of that econometric equation.	12	1
201401	973	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	And then we’d start looking for other explanatory variables.	12	1
201401	974	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Well, we’d quickly arrive at the conclusion that—oh, wait a minute—that constant term does a pretty good job of explaining the left-hand side variable.	12	1
201401	975	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	You all, by running really good monetary policy over the past 15 or 20 years, have created a significant problem for us, from an econometric perspective.	12	1
201401	976	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We don’t have any variation to explain in the left-hand side variable.	12	1
201401	977	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Among other things, that immediately creates the difficulty that it’s very hard to posit a causal explanation for the role of monetary policy in influencing inflation expectations.	12	1
201401	978	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	So I’m not going to offer any pushback, because, indeed, I think a main message of the memo was precisely that.	12	1
201401	979	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I believe I heard Governor Tarullo use the word “magic.”	12	1
201401	980	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Another possibility would be to say that it is, to a degree, unfortunately, an article of faith.	12	1
201401	981	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I wish I could represent it to you otherwise, but I think it’s important to acknowledge that.	12	1
201401	982	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	With regard to the global phenomenon of a downward drift in inflation, it certainly is very eye catching that, at the very same time that inflation drifted a little bit downward here in the United States, it was doing similarly in the euro area and in some other locations.	12	1
201401	983	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	There I think Jeremy, again, and the others impressed on me the important point that our inflation errors over the past few years have, in fact, been two-sided.	12	1
201401	984	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Now, it is the case that, most recently, inflation has come in a little lower than our prediction.	12	1
201401	985	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	In 2011 and 2012, the opposite was true.	12	1
201401	986	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	It made me feel no more comfortable back then to come to the Committee and say, “Well, we’ve had a run of errors to the upside on actual inflation.”	12	1
201401	987	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	We put forward for the Committee an analysis that I think ultimately proved to be correct.	12	1
201401	988	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Past performance is no guarantee of future accuracy here, but our narrative now, for better or for worse, is very much the same as it was back then.	12	1
201401	989	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you so much.	12	1
201401	990	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The memo and your response were extraordinarily useful.	12	1
201401	991	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Bullard.	12	1
201401	992	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	12	1
201401	993	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me follow up on President Evans’s comment here a little bit.	12	1
201401	994	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I did like this chart in the “Forecast Summary” exhibit that shows the 1.9 percent inflation, although I do think it should be 2.0.	12	1
201401	995	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I think I know an adjustment we’re going to be making [laughter] for the March Tealbook.	12	1
201401	996	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Yes.	12	1
201401	997	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	But I love your point, which is one I’ve tried to emphasize in the past—that a great inflation-targeting bank will keep inflation right at target all of the time, and then you won’t have anything to study other than the fact that inflation is at target all of the time.	12	1
201401	998	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	But maybe a way to put President Evans’s point is that if you look at a chart like this and you say that inflation expectations are anchored, then you get the impression that a situation like the one in Japan couldn’t develop in the United States because, well, inflation expectations are anchored, so it can’t happen.	12	1
201401	999	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	But, as policymakers, I think what we want is some sense of, under what circumstances would we get stuck in a zero-nominal-interest-rate, low-inflation environment?	12	1
201401	1000	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	And I think we’ve struggled to be able to say something coherent about that and to be able to put a probability on that.	12	1
201401	1001	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t want to put words in your mouth, President Evans, but I guess, in my interpretation of what he said, that what would be useful to policymakers is some kind of statement about how likely that outcome is, what types of things might lead to that outcome in the United States, and, maybe beyond that, what could we do to avoid that?	12	1
201401	1002	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	For that, you would need a model of why longer-term inflation expectations might drift, and we don’t really have that model.	12	1
201401	1003	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	It’s precisely with the Japanese example in mind that Jeremy and his coauthors put the figure on page 11, which demonstrates that, in the Japanese case, inflation expectations remained really quite stable, and, for a time, actual inflation, on a long moving- average, tracked those expectations quite well.	12	1
201401	1004	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	But then what’s worrisome and is intended precisely to put a pit in your collective stomachs is that actual inflation began to track lower and became detached from inflation expectations.	12	1
201401	1005	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	And so it’s with that in mind that we wanted to make sure to communicate the real doubt that we have about whether this will necessarily work out in the way that we’ve outlined in the baseline.	12	1
201401	1006	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	12	1
201401	1007	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	12	1
201401	1008	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Moving to a less existential level here on inflation, I have two sorts of questions.	12	1
201401	1009	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	First, I’d like to follow up on the comments of President Kocherlakota and others who have expressed appreciation for the alternative that was put forward in the Tealbook.	12	1
201401	1010	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that’s a great contribution.	12	1
201401	1011	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I look forward to other alternatives being laid out and discussed in a similar manner.	12	1
201401	1012	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I had one question about that, and this may be asking too much.	12	1
201401	1013	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It would be interesting over time, as these scenarios are more fully described, for the staff to offer some guidance or thoughts about the broad probabilities they place on some of these scenarios.	12	1
201401	1014	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Are they highly likely or very unlikely?	12	1
201401	1015	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Clearly, they are not the modal forecast.	12	1
201401	1016	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We understand that.	12	1
201401	1017	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But the staff’s view of how the probabilities associated with these various scenarios may be shifting over time might be a very valuable source of discussion and insight as we move forward.	12	1
201401	1018	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I just put that out there.	12	1
201401	1019	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I know it wouldn’t necessarily be trivial.	12	1
201401	1020	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The second question I had follows up on President Kocherlakota’s question about the household survey and the establishment survey.	12	1
201401	1021	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the things we do know about the two is, a lot more revision goes on in the establishment survey, for all sorts of different reasons.	12	1
201401	1022	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Have you given any thought to the pattern of revised data that has occurred over, let’s say, the recovery?	12	1
201401	1023	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My sense is that, on average, we’ve seen a lot more upward revisions from the first print as we go through.	12	1
201401	1024	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Is there evidence of any systematic patterns that arise in the revision process in the establishment data, particularly vis-à-vis the household survey?	12	1
201401	1025	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In other words, do they tend to move back, do they tend to move together, or how should I think about that?	12	1
201401	1026	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	The household survey isn’t revised, so it’s whatever it is.	12	1
201401	1027	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	It is the case, as I mentioned in response to President Kocherlakota’s question, that there do seem to be cyclical patterns in the difference between the two, and the household survey falls less than the payroll survey during weak periods and then increases less during recoveries.	12	1
201401	1028	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	So there are typical patterns.	12	1
201401	1029	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	They tend to move around and then move back toward each other over time.	12	1
201401	1030	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	In terms of revisions, the big revisions are obviously the benchmark revisions.	12	1
201401	1031	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	We’re going to get the 2013 revision next month—we already know that it’s a downward revision if you adjust for some classification changes.	12	1
201401	1032	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	But the revisions in both 2011 and 2012 went the other way; the payroll survey was revised up.	12	1
201401	1033	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	And I think the general pattern is that, early in recoveries, you tend to see some upward revisions.	12	1
201401	1034	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	That’s probably due to increases in new business formation that aren’t picked up initially in the payroll survey.	12	1
201401	1035	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	Beyond that, there tend to be downward revisions during recessions and weak periods.	12	1
201401	1036	2014-01-29	meeting	WASCHER	So, from 2007 to 2010, there were downward revisions, and then in 2011 and 2012, there were upward revisions to the level of employment.	12	1
201401	1037	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I have one other observation.	12	1
201401	1038	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I don’t want to make too big a deal of this, because I’ll get in over my head very quickly, but, in terms of the inflation issue, one of the things that many of the DSGE models have—and I think the New York model has this in it in some detail—is that the inflation process in those models depends a lot on the nature of the shocks.	12	1
201401	1039	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In the financial sectors that they have, you can have these shocks to the return on capital or the marginal efficiency of capital.	12	1
201401	1040	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And those things can actually work through the system in ways that can lead, at least in those models, to lower inflation than you might otherwise have anticipated.	12	1
201401	1041	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It’s the nature of the financial sector and the restrictions in the financial sector that have given rise to some of that.	12	1
201401	1042	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I was wondering whether or not more work has been done in thinking about those types of models—as opposed to the classic, more traditional models that you report to us on—in terms of the effects that different types of shocks have on generating the lower inflation that we’ve seen.	12	1
201401	1043	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know—is Egon Zakrajšek here?	12	1
201401	1044	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	If he’s not, then I’ll attempt to characterize some recent research that he’s done.	12	1
201401	1045	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	You’ll probably do better at characterizing that than I did in attempting to characterize my position here in the first place.	12	1
201401	1046	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	I don’t know—Jeremy or Michael Kiley, are you familiar with this, before I launch into an attempt here?	12	1
201401	1047	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Broadly speaking, what Egon and his coauthors are trying to explain is, why didn’t we have more disinflation?	12	1
201401	1048	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	It’s a fascinating paper.	12	1
201401	1049	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	They are working with microeconomic data.	12	1
201401	1050	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	They split firms into two buckets:  One contains firms whose balance sheets were very adversely affected through the financial crisis, and the other bucket, the complement.	12	1
201401	1051	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	What they find, I believe, is that the firms whose balance sheets were severely adversely affected through the financial crisis are much more resistant to allowing price reductions, whereas firms whose balance sheets were not particularly affected by the financial crisis behave in a more historically normal manner.	12	1
201401	1052	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	And it’s that mechanism that provides an alternative explanation, by the way, to the anchored inflation expectations that they put forward as a possibility.	12	1
201401	1053	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That’s not exactly what I was asking.	12	1
201401	1054	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But we can do this offline.	12	1
201401	1055	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My question is whether some of these models with financial frictions of various kinds get movements in inflation rates that are not as closely tied to monetary policy as we normally think.	12	1
201401	1056	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That was the gist of what I think some of these models are trying to tell us, but we can talk about this later.	12	1
201401	1057	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Michael, do you want to offer any comments about that?	12	1
201401	1058	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	It’s certainly the case that the staff did a lot of work on a variety of DSGE models with different types of financial frictions and shocks and on how the different shocks are transmitted through those mechanisms.	12	1
201401	1059	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	You’re definitely right that those mechanisms and shocks can have effects on activity and inflation that differ from those of other demand shocks.	12	1
201401	1060	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	So it’s the case that financial frictions can alter the way in which shocks are transmitted both to the real economy and to inflation.	12	1
201401	1061	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	But I think it’s fair to say that there’s no common result across those models, because there are lots of financial frictions now.	12	1
201401	1062	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	And so I don’t think it would be fair to say that it’s a general feature that shocks, other than monetary shocks, become much more important in explaining inflation in some different way.	12	1
201401	1063	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	It’s a much more open area.	12	1
201401	1064	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Very model dependent.	12	1
201401	1065	2014-01-29	meeting	KILEY	Yes.	12	1
201401	1066	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	12	1
201401	1067	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	2	2
201401	1068	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Why don’t we take a quick coffee break and come back at 4:20 and start our go-round?	2	2
201401	1069	2014-01-29	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201401	1070	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	2	2
201401	1071	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let’s recommence, please.	2	2
201401	1072	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We’re ready for the economic go-round, and our first contributor is President Evans.	13	1
201401	1073	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1074	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	This being your last meeting, let me just mention that it has been an honor and privilege to work with you during this difficult period.	13	1
201401	1075	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Since our December meeting the incoming data have been quite good, with the exception of the December payroll employment number.	13	1
201401	1076	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m pleasantly surprised that the second half of 2013 came in at nearly a 4 percent rate.	13	1
201401	1077	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	This is more than 1 percentage point stronger than what we thought in December, and, importantly, it’s reflecting very good fourth-quarter numbers for consumption and fixed investment and not just an outsized inventory build.	13	1
201401	1078	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Our business contacts have similarly become more optimistic.	13	1
201401	1079	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	As one of my banking directors put it, some of his clients are now describing the business climate as “tentatively bullish.”	13	1
201401	1080	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Most commentary was more reserved.	13	1
201401	1081	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Contacts indicated that activity was picking up, and that demand was good but not exceptionally strong.	13	1
201401	1082	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Put all of this together, and I am more comfortable assuming that the real economy is broadly firming along the lines of the Tealbook projections.	13	1
201401	1083	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I had preferred delaying our December taper to gather more information, but this all seems to be working out reasonably well at the moment.	13	1
201401	1084	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, I remain concerned over the very low inflation outlook.	13	1
201401	1085	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	There hasn’t been any real change in the numbers since our last meeting, but that is not surprising.	13	1
201401	1086	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Not much time has passed.	13	1
201401	1087	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	As the Tealbook projections indicate, there is a good chance that transitory factors have driven these low inflation readings and that these factors will recede before much longer.	13	1
201401	1088	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	This may work out just fine within six months’ time, but our understanding of these factors and the inflation equation itself is tenuous at best, and the risk of prolonged low inflation cannot be ruled out.	13	1
201401	1089	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	My business contacts contribute to my worries over this dilemma when they tell me that they have little pricing power and that cost pressures are low.	13	1
201401	1090	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	A key reason why cost pressures are low is that wage growth has been modest to meager.	13	1
201401	1091	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We haven’t spent much time discussing wages.	13	1
201401	1092	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s probably because, in recent decades, wages have not been a reliable leading indicator for inflation pressures.	13	1
201401	1093	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Instead, wages have tended to lag inflation.	13	1
201401	1094	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In any event, the low wage levels and wage growth we see today are, at a minimum, confirming evidence of the lack of inflationary pressures existing in the current economic environment.	13	1
201401	1095	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	These wage data suggest possibly more persistent influences on low inflation.	13	1
201401	1096	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In order to get an outbreak of stronger and persistently higher inflation, we almost surely would have to have sympathetic increases in wages.	13	1
201401	1097	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	If such an outbreak were in the works, we’d expect to see workers demanding, and firms granting, notably higher wage increases, and this should be occurring broadly across occupational and industrial sectors.	13	1
201401	1098	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Of course, none of this has taken place at the moment, and none of my business contacts think it is at all likely to happen for the foreseeable future.	13	1
201401	1099	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, as the Board’s inflation forecasting memo discussed—and I should note, too, research by President Williams’s staff—because of downward nominal rigidity, it’s possible that wages have not yet fully adjusted to earlier weakness in labor markets.	13	1
201401	1100	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That might mean we could see residual resistance to wage increases for some time, even as other labor market conditions further improve.	13	1
201401	1101	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In sum, the wage-cost side of the ledger seems to suggest that inflation could remain low for some time.	13	1
201401	1102	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	This poses a substantial risk to achieving our inflation objective of 2 percent within a reasonable time frame.	13	1
201401	1103	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	At the moment, the primary reason for rising inflation in our projections is that we expect anchored long-term inflation expectations to exert an upward pull on actual inflation.	13	1
201401	1104	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The inflation-forecasting models discussed in the Board memo place substantial emphasis on these long-term expectations, and much of my own staff’s analysis has a similar flavor.	13	1
201401	1105	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I am not aware of a better inflation specification in spite of the commentary that I made earlier in asking questions.	13	1
201401	1106	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Nevertheless, this is unsatisfying.	13	1
201401	1107	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Most theoretically grounded specifications place a greater weight on short-term inflation expectations.	13	1
201401	1108	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Of course, short-term expectations bounce around a lot more and pose difficult challenges for successful empirical implementation.	13	1
201401	1109	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Most of the time, anchored long-term expectations work better empirically, and the discrepancy is smaller and more transitory than what we’ve had.	13	1
201401	1110	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The Board’s modeling choice is completely understandable, but it feels unsatisfying and less structural than desired, and that’s especially the case now.	13	1
201401	1111	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I can’t help wondering if this modeling compromise will continue to work well under today’s unusual circumstances.	13	1
201401	1112	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Cost pressures are low and may remain that way for some time, especially from labor.	13	1
201401	1113	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	How is inflation going to pick up?	13	1
201401	1114	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	New firms are pursuing aggressive pricing, and actual inflation has been stuck near 1 percent for some time.	13	1
201401	1115	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	There just seem to be many factors on the ground today fighting against whatever the upward pull might be from expectations for inflation 5 or 10 years out in the future.	13	1
201401	1116	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The Japanese inflation experience is worrisome.	13	1
201401	1117	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	After all, inflation and long-term inflation expectations there have lost their close relationship as our discussion of that chart in the Board memo indicated.	13	1
201401	1118	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Until we actually see inflation move up smartly toward our 2 percent target, I think we are running a risk of misjudging the persistence of our low-inflation environment and relying too heavily on long-term expectations to save the day.	13	1
201401	1119	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In any event, maintaining our current accommodative monetary policy seems important to counteract the low- inflation-risk scenario.	13	1
201401	1120	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1121	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1122	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Rosengren.	13	1
201401	1123	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1124	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The memos have done a very nice job of clarifying staff members’ positions on the important but difficult issue of which labor market and price anomalies reflect transitory movements and which reflect trends.	13	1
201401	1125	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The very low payroll number last month is assumed to be an anomaly, suggesting that much stronger payroll employment growth is imminent.	13	1
201401	1126	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, part of the very low inflation numbers is an anomaly, suggesting that we will soon see PCE inflation moving toward our 2 percent target.	13	1
201401	1127	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In contrast, the large declines in labor force participation are assumed to be permanent, reflecting primarily demographic and cohort trends.	13	1
201401	1128	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the parsing of these data patterns into transitory or trend categories seems reasonable, I would note with the benefit of hindsight that we have not always been able to distinguish well between what is transitory and what is a trend.	13	1
201401	1129	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	A simple example is the assumption that Internet investments during the dot-com phase reflected a change in trend productivity growth that could justify high stock prices rather than a transitory fluctuation, only to be revised down once the dot-com bubble burst.	13	1
201401	1130	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, while assessments made by the staff are reasonable, our actions should reflect the inherent uncertainty around such judgments.	13	1
201401	1131	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The payroll employment number was a surprise.	13	1
201401	1132	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The 10-year Treasury rate moved down substantially after the announcement and has only fallen further with growing concerns around emerging markets.	13	1
201401	1133	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Financial markets seem to have taken to heart at least some of the surprise information, at least for now.	13	1
201401	1134	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The Tealbook makes clear that it is assumed that the low payroll employment is transitory, because it is incongruent with both the other labor market indicators and the stronger GDP growth we have seen recently.	13	1
201401	1135	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the highly correlated movement of global stock prices surrounding emerging market concerns and the decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since our last meeting, despite strong GDP numbers and our strong GDP forecast, give me some pause about the forecast.	13	1
201401	1136	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The recent serially correlated misses on many of our PCE inflation forecasts are also assumed to be transitory.	13	1
201401	1137	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the longer we miss significantly on our forecast, the less confidence we should have that inflation will be inexorably drawn higher by the gravitational force of our 2 percent target.	13	1
201401	1138	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The staff highlights that in Japan the long-term expectations for inflation moved little despite inflation being below zero for over a decade.	13	1
201401	1139	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The observation is very consistent with work my staff has done.	13	1
201401	1140	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	They show empirically that Japanese inflation data may have been more responsive to short-run inflation expectations than long-run expectations.	13	1
201401	1141	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, the model that relies on well-anchored expectations fits the past 20 years of data reasonably well but is sensitive to the time period over which it is estimated.	13	1
201401	1142	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If it turns out that, in very low inflation environments, short-run inflation expectations are more important than long-run expectations in describing the inflation process, we should be much less certain how quickly we will return to our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201401	1143	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The staff paper on labor force participation is good.	13	1
201401	1144	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The paper provides a nice statistical summary of both demographic and within-cohort trends.	13	1
201401	1145	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I agree with the demographic exposition, the within-cohort trends seem tenuous.	13	1
201401	1146	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While there were sound economic reasons for the rise in labor force participation by women in the 1970s and 1980s, the economic rationale for a trend reduction in participation by prime-age male cohorts is less clear, and, thus, questions remain as to whether their lower participation rates will be reversed by a stronger labor market.	13	1
201401	1147	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, we should be cautious about our inferences regarding which data reflect transitory influences and which reflect trends.	13	1
201401	1148	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The implications of this uncertainty for policy, which I will discuss tomorrow, suggest that a patient approach to removing accommodation is warranted.	13	1
201401	1149	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1150	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1151	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201401	1152	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1153	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will spend most of my time today discussing my assessment of the long-run unemployment rate that is consistent with the dual mandate.	13	1
201401	1154	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will make two points.	13	1
201401	1155	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, any assessment of this kind relies on gauging the inflationary pressures associated with any given unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1156	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, over the past year or two I have lowered my assessment of the inflationary pressures associated with any given unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1157	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a result, my assessment of the long-run unemployment rate consistent with maximum employment has fallen 1 full percentage point, down to the 5¼ percent rate in Tealbook A.	13	1
201401	1158	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me start with the relationship between inflationary pressures and unemployment.	13	1
201401	1159	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have agreed, and we just reaffirmed again today, that appropriate monetary policy should give rise to an inflation rate that averages 2 percent over the longer run with inflation expectations well anchored around that same rate.	13	1
201401	1160	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Of course, the mandate-consistent unemployment rate has to also be consistent with that kind of monetary policy.	13	1
201401	1161	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It follows that, over the longer run, the mandate-consistent unemployment rate is the unemployment rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation with well-anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201401	1162	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This observation has implications for how we go about measuring the long-run mandate- consistent unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1163	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, there’s a lot of work being done in the System and elsewhere that attempts to do so by filtering out short-run fluctuations and various aspects of employment and unemployment data.	13	1
201401	1164	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	From a statistical point of view, this is hard work, and President Rosengren alluded to this in his remarks.	13	1
201401	1165	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Trend–cycle decompositions are challenging, and they’re especially challenging at the end of a sample.	13	1
201401	1166	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the economic challenge is actually a deeper one.	13	1
201401	1167	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Conceptually, the mandate-consistent unemployment rate, as I just mentioned, is the unemployment rate that is consistent with 2 percent inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201401	1168	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Estimating this unemployment rate necessarily requires information beyond quantity data alone.	13	1
201401	1169	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It requires information about the compensation pressures associated with any given unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1170	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is those compensation pressures that eventually translate into inflation in the prices of goods and services.	13	1
201401	1171	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me then move to my second point.	13	1
201401	1172	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Over the past year or two, I’ve lowered my assessment of the pressures on compensation associated with any given unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1173	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why have I done that?	13	1
201401	1174	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are three main reasons.	13	1
201401	1175	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, a falling unemployment rate over the past four years has been associated with little increase in wage and compensation pressures.	13	1
201401	1176	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, in the first three quarters of 2013, average hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector was essentially flat.	13	1
201401	1177	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, for any given long-run unemployment rate, I’ve lowered my estimate of the fraction of prime-age people, those between the ages of 25 and 54, who will have jobs.	13	1
201401	1178	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ve done so because, conditional on the falling unemployment rate, the employment-to-population ratio for 25- to 54-year-olds has risen surprisingly little.	13	1
201401	1179	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, marginally, I see a prime-age person without a job as putting more downward pressure on wages than a similar person with a job.	13	1
201401	1180	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s definitely hard to pin down magnitudes here, but the effect on the margin is to lower the inflationary impact of any given long-term unemployment rate because there are more prime-age people without jobs.	13	1
201401	1181	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Third, for any given unemployment rate, I’ve raised my estimate of those working part- time who would like to be able to work more hours.	13	1
201401	1182	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’m tracking this through the difference between two broader measures of labor force underutilization, the ones labeled U-6 and U-5.	13	1
201401	1183	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The difference between U-6 and U-5 rose dramatically in the recession.	13	1
201401	1184	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Relative to the sharp decline in the unemployment rate, U-3, this difference has fallen little since late 2009.	13	1
201401	1185	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This large number of people who are looking for extra hours are also likely to put more downward pressure on wages for any given measure of the unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1186	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At the national level, then, we’ve seen little in the way of wage pressures, we have a larger fraction of prime-age people who do not have jobs, and the difference between U-6 and U-5 has remained persistently high.	13	1
201401	1187	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, we go to the local conditions in the Ninth District.	13	1
201401	1188	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have also heard suggestive evidence along the same lines.	13	1
201401	1189	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In Minnesota, the current unemployment rate is 4.6 percent, but our business contacts consistently report little wage pressure.	13	1
201401	1190	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Similarly, our labor union contacts generally see themselves as having little bargaining power in the coming year or two.	13	1
201401	1191	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why are wage pressures so muted in Minnesota given that the unemployment rate is so low?	13	1
201401	1192	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We certainly don’t have a definitive answer to this question, but it is important to note that, relative to the improvement of the unemployment rate in Minnesota, there has been less improvement in the Minnesota employment-to-population ratio for prime-age people.	13	1
201401	1193	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Also, just as it’s true nationally, the difference between U-6 and U-5 in Minnesota has come down little since its 2009 peak.	13	1
201401	1194	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I put all of this information together, I’ve been led to lower my assessment of the wage pressures associated with any unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1195	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are huge uncertainties, of course, associated with these exercises, but I have lowered my estimate of the long-run mandate- consistent unemployment rate 1 full percentage point over the past year, and, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, at this point I’m basically down to the 5¼ percent that’s in Tealbook A.	13	1
201401	1196	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Mr Chairman, I want to close by saying that it has been a huge honor and privilege to serve under your leadership on this Committee.	13	1
201401	1197	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You were especially inspiring in the way that you never shied away from using historically unprecedented tools to deal with a historically unprecedented challenge.	13	1
201401	1198	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to thank you for your leadership.	13	1
201401	1199	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1200	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lockhart.	13	1
201401	1201	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1202	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’ll start with some commentary reflecting input from our business contacts and directors over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201401	1203	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Business sentiment improved, on balance, for the second consecutive intermeeting cycle.	13	1
201401	1204	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Most of our directors expect economic growth will either be sustained at the current pace or accelerate over the next three to six months.	13	1
201401	1205	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	They are even more optimistic about the medium-term outlook.	13	1
201401	1206	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The overwhelming majority of our 44 directors believe that the pace of growth will be higher in the next two to three years.	13	1
201401	1207	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Many think the downside risks to growth have diminished and uncertainty has dissipated.	13	1
201401	1208	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	This view and the associated optimism are pretty broad based.	13	1
201401	1209	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We hear more reports of businesses becoming less risk averse, with greater willingness to place bets on capital projects and expenditures.	13	1
201401	1210	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	One small example is that companies that previously elected to rent heavy construction equipment are now beginning to buy the equipment instead.	13	1
201401	1211	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, we did not hear reports of a notable pickup in hiring.	13	1
201401	1212	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Hiring plans remained modest for the most part.	13	1
201401	1213	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Hiring activity in energy and construction appears to be stronger than in other industries.	13	1
201401	1214	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	There continues to be a preference for overtime and automation before any consideration of hiring, and we continue to hear about difficulties finding certain types of skilled and experienced workers.	13	1
201401	1215	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In regard to cost and price pressures, most contacts reported relatively stable input costs.	13	1
201401	1216	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard few reports of wage pressures.	13	1
201401	1217	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Contacts in the construction industry were an exception.	13	1
201401	1218	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In general, our business contacts report little or no pricing power.	13	1
201401	1219	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The inflation expectations of most contacts were unchanged.	13	1
201401	1220	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Overall, I’d say the opinions and anecdotal inputs of our contacts are reflective of the incoming data.	13	1
201401	1221	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I’ll note that public and business optimism has disappeared quickly before.	13	1
201401	1222	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Now to my outlook.	13	1
201401	1223	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In the December SEP submission I had an economic growth forecast for 2014 and the remainder of the forecast horizon of around 3 percent.	13	1
201401	1224	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Even with the increasingly positive reports I’m hearing from region contacts and the recent data that seem to confirm an impressive second-half growth rate, I’m leaving my forecast unchanged.	13	1
201401	1225	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Basically I already had written in a shift to faster economic growth, and I think conditions remain ripe for stronger growth than we experienced, certainly, in the first four years of the recovery.	13	1
201401	1226	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My outlook for inflation also remains one of gradual convergence with the Committee’s target, although a little faster than in the Tealbook.	13	1
201401	1227	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding employment, like the Tealbook, I updated my projections for the unemployment rate, taking on board the drop from 7 percent to 6.7 percent.	13	1
201401	1228	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I now have the unemployment rate reaching the Committee’s stated full employment range of 5.2 to 5.8 percent in 2015, as does the Tealbook.	13	1
201401	1229	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	That said, I have to express concern that the unemployment rate is separating from broader indicators of labor market health and may be losing its utility as it goes lower.	13	1
201401	1230	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Influenced admittedly by anecdotal reports in the business community, I don’t see the declining unemployment rate as the leading edge of a burst of hiring.	13	1
201401	1231	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	When the unemployment rate was a lot higher, we could use it as a policy marker while ignoring the noise in the number.	13	1
201401	1232	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In my opinion, it may be losing value as a communications vehicle as it falls.	13	1
201401	1233	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m increasingly of the opinion that greater attention to wage and price developments may be more serviceable in the Committee’s communications.	13	1
201401	1234	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The outlook I’m presenting is optimistic, but I think we need to see it soon in prices, wages, and income growth.	13	1
201401	1235	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So far there has been no turn in the inflation numbers and little wage and income growth.	13	1
201401	1236	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I want to add my voice to those who thanked David Wilcox and his staff for the innovation of including an alternative view in the Tealbook A, write-up.	13	1
201401	1237	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I found it quite useful because it brings into sharper relief the plausibility of different narratives with some support in the data.	13	1
201401	1238	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In that vein, I worry about what the wage and price data may be suggesting about the actual strength of the economy and the sustainability of the recent improvement.	13	1
201401	1239	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m concerned about an unemployment statistic that doesn’t match up with the broader employment picture— that is, participation, marginally attached workers, and underemployment.	13	1
201401	1240	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’ll let that serve, Mr Chairman, as my commentary on the balance of risks.	13	1
201401	1241	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Like others, I want to thank you for your superb leadership over these years, and it has been a privilege serving with you.	13	1
201401	1242	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1243	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1244	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	Mr Chairman, may I just acknowledge that Andrew Figura is the author of the box, and he is here.	13	1
201401	1245	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	He’ll be in the autograph booth at the conclusion of the meeting and will be pleased to sign your copy of the Tealbook.	13	1
201401	1246	2014-01-29	meeting	WILCOX	[Laughter]	13	1
201401	1247	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Noted.	13	1
201401	1248	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	13	1
201401	1249	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1250	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m going to make a brief comment about my District and then summarize the anecdotal input.	13	1
201401	1251	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m not going to comment on any changes in my forecast, because my views haven’t changed that much from my last statement on that front.	13	1
201401	1252	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Our District, particularly the state of Texas, continues to move forward.	13	1
201401	1253	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We have been growing employment last year at a 2.3 percent rate, and all indicators, of course, whether it’s housing or our export activity, have continued to rise to levels that, frankly, we just haven’t seen before.	13	1
201401	1254	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It does raise some questions about difference in frictions, because it seems to me, from the standpoint of our monetary policy affecting economic activity, certainly we have had a very robust response in Texas.	13	1
201401	1255	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The most startling figure for me was looking at the manufacturing employment numbers for December—they are up 7.95 percent, so 8 percent year over year.	13	1
201401	1256	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That does not include oil and gas extraction or any support services that go around oil and gas.	13	1
201401	1257	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So we are seeing it across the board.	13	1
201401	1258	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Our surveys indicate a growing number of businesses reporting—and this is what our research staff summarizes as—severe labor shortages.	13	1
201401	1259	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We are seeing it for skilled workers, engineers to auditors, interestingly enough, and especially for construction workers, as noted by President Lockhart.	13	1
201401	1260	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We are also seeing it in unskilled areas.	13	1
201401	1261	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You literally have to give, in certain parts of our state, in my District, scholarships to kids—college scholarships—if you want them to work at McDonald’s, because you cannot find people to work at McDonald’s in West Texas, for example, or with roughnecks.	13	1
201401	1262	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	For the first time, we are seeing in our surveys that there is some cost pressure.	13	1
201401	1263	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We are hearing about wage and input price pressures increasing and tentative signs—tentative, I emphasize that—of modest pass-through to final goods prices.	13	1
201401	1264	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	If you look at the Texas manufacturing index and, more broadly, the services index, which includes retail, we are beginning to see a little bit of that, and I think it’s just worth keeping an eye on.	13	1
201401	1265	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So perhaps we have less friction, whatever those frictions might be at the state level, or we may be at a different stage in the business cycle.	13	1
201401	1266	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But at least we are beginning to see a little inkling of that, and we’re going to watch it carefully.	13	1
201401	1267	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	As to the overall corporate context, just a couple of comments.	13	1
201401	1268	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The rails are back to 90 percent of their peak operating capacity, with one exception, Burlington Northern, which this year will surpass its 2006–07 peak operating capacity.	13	1
201401	1269	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It’s pretty much across the board.	13	1
201401	1270	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There are certain sectors in their different business divisions that aren’t quite doing as well as they did before—for example, coal is down, but oil shipments are up.	13	1
201401	1271	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	If you look at them across the board—all of the rails—they are close to being back to peak operating levels.	13	1
201401	1272	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Regarding the express companies, one of the major ones in President Lockhart’s District, despite the reports that were given of UPS’s delivery problems—you can remember I mentioned at the last meeting they were budgeting an 8 percent December—delivered a 15 percent volume increase in December.	13	1
201401	1273	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’ll come back to that in just a second.	13	1
201401	1274	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In terms of the airlines, their advanced bookings are significantly improved looking forward through April.	13	1
201401	1275	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In the words of the largest airline operator, “Sluggish growth is over.	13	1
201401	1276	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	This is—and feels—much more stable.	13	1
201401	1277	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Of course, time will tell.”	13	1
201401	1278	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I mentioned ships—Capesize, bulk shippers, the ones that move big products around the world.	13	1
201401	1279	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Again, the lease rates have come up despite the fact that there is an increase in supply, mainly fueled by the new Chinese building efforts.	13	1
201401	1280	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So when we look at how things are moving around the world, there is a slightly better tone—I was taken by President Evans’s “tentatively bullish”—at least it’s less pessimistic, and I’ll come back to that in a second.	13	1
201401	1281	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	If you talk to the telecoms, one of the most encouraging things you will hear—in addition to what is obvious, which is their broadband hookups, because that is driven by housing—is that for seven straight months now, they are beginning to see what they call “downstream,” which is small business activity.	13	1
201401	1282	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The larger companies are principally driving productivity enhancement, but new engagements are being booked at a “surprisingly robust level,” to use the words of one of the top telecom operators, in the downstreaming of the small business market.	13	1
201401	1283	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	If you look at a not unimportant industry, which is overall tourism, leisure, theme parks—I’ll mention one particular name here:  The CEO of Disney is rather shocked because advance bookings through May are up 15 percent year over year with no discounting.	13	1
201401	1284	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In fact, they have not only removed discounting, they have gone back to slightly more aggressive pricing.	13	1
201401	1285	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The one area that seems to be weak is retail, and it depends on where you are in retail.	13	1
201401	1286	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	A statistic that they claim is accurate—and I haven’t checked it and maybe our staff could—is that only 5 percent of retail sales are sold by these mall operators.	13	1
201401	1287	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In December, 9 percent of retail sales were received through the Internet.	13	1
201401	1288	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We do hear very difficult cases, in the case of Target for obvious reasons, Macy’s, J.C.	13	1
201401	1289	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Penney.	13	1
201401	1290	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That represents 5 percent of total retail sales.	13	1
201401	1291	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	The world has shifted, and I think that’s important.	13	1
201401	1292	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	For the first time I heard reports of shortages.	13	1
201401	1293	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	A significant food producer, in one of its divisions, could not meet demand.	13	1
201401	1294	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Apple actually had a product shortage in one of its divisions, one of the new products that has come forward.	13	1
201401	1295	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Then, also, in the case of one major semiconductor operator, and that’s what I just want to comment on here in conclusion.	13	1
201401	1296	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I have been puzzled, as has President Lockhart and I guess President Evans and others, as to what has happened with the dynamic of employment.	13	1
201401	1297	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	This is not econometric theory, but I go back to “Management 101” and then what I’m hearing from these CEOs who are hands-on managers.	13	1
201401	1298	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	They’ve been having flat top-line growth or lack of growth, flat top-line revenue, for a very prolonged period.	13	1
201401	1299	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	What you would refer to unscientifically as the growth muscle has become quite flaccid.	13	1
201401	1300	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m hearing report after report after report from my contacts, for what they’re worth—not just my board members, but around the country—that they are having to sort of retrain the mentality of their managers to think, to manage, and to budget to greater growth, even though it may not be as robust as we would like to see, but it is a growth mode.	13	1
201401	1301	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That requires a change in the mentality of whether you hire or not, whether you go from temporary to permanent, and, I believe, from what I hear, that this is occurring at the margin.	13	1
201401	1302	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So that would be my report, Mr Chairman, coming from my overall contacts.	13	1
201401	1303	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I just want to make a comment on inflation.	13	1
201401	1304	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I, too, like President Evans, have been wondering, what is the role of monetary policy?	13	1
201401	1305	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We have this massive buildup of reserves.	13	1
201401	1306	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We have enormous amounts of cash lying fallow on the sidelines.	13	1
201401	1307	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Obviously, we all know that what counts are spreads here, and we can move the cost of money, the short end of the yield curve.	13	1
201401	1308	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But one of the things that caught my eye in my particular District is if you look at Comerica, for example, the largest bank operating in my District—not big by New York standards but not insignificant where we’re from—its loan growth for year over year was 1 percent.	13	1
201401	1309	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I’m talking about period loans.	13	1
201401	1310	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Their period loan demand deposits were up 10 percent.	13	1
201401	1311	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There is a discontinuity here.	13	1
201401	1312	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	What do they do?	13	1
201401	1313	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	They park it on our balance sheet.	13	1
201401	1314	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We have $45 billion in total reserves on the Dallas Fed’s balance sheet.	13	1
201401	1315	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Up until 2007, our average ran between $900 million and $600 million.	13	1
201401	1316	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There is a lot of liquidity in the system.	13	1
201401	1317	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	What bankers care about— we just had a little tutorial here from Governor Powell, and he’s correct—is, of course, the spread.	13	1
201401	1318	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	How much can you make off of lending?	13	1
201401	1319	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	That’s what it all comes down to, but that’s a function of demand.	13	1
201401	1320	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Even in a robust District, such as my own, where we’ve had rather astonishing economic growth numbers and employment numbers, and perhaps even at the margin some little cost and wage pressures—I don’t want to overemphasize that—we are still seeing an enormous buildup of reserves.	13	1
201401	1321	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So I, too, like President Evans, would begin to wonder, why isn’t this working?	13	1
201401	1322	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Why isn’t it working its way particularly into the price pressures?	13	1
201401	1323	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1324	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1325	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Williams.	13	1
201401	1326	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1327	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Nearly all of the recent economic data have outperformed relative to our December expectations.	13	1
201401	1328	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most encouraging is the sizable upward revision to real final sales growth in the second half of last year.	13	1
201401	1329	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This pickup in aggregate demand adds to my confidence in the continued improvement and the underlying momentum of the economy.	13	1
201401	1330	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My business contacts also are more upbeat—not just the new billionaires from Twitter and those companies.	13	1
201401	1331	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Their growing optimism has translated into solid plans for hiring.	13	1
201401	1332	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Most of my contacts expect to increase their firms’ employment levels this year, a sentiment expressed in broad national surveys of business executives as well.	13	1
201401	1333	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These hiring plans were especially encouraging because, among the recent data, the one discordant note was struck by last month’s payroll employment release, as a number of people have mentioned.	13	1
201401	1334	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That one month was likely held down in part by severe weather.	13	1
201401	1335	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Still, over the past several years, lackluster gains in employment relative to population growth have been a concern.	13	1
201401	1336	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, demographic changes are the chief cause for the low employment-to-population ratio, but cyclical factors also play an important role.	13	1
201401	1337	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One cyclical channel that has gathered some attention is how the drop in house prices and net wealth during the recession made it much more difficult for small entrepreneurs to finance new businesses.	13	1
201401	1338	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, during the recession and housing bust, employment at new small firms declined much more than at well- established firms.	13	1
201401	1339	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff has looked more closely at how startups have fared during the recovery.	13	1
201401	1340	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They find that through the early part of the current recovery, startup businesses continued to underperform and show tepid employment growth.	13	1
201401	1341	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Because young, small firms usually account for a substantial share of total employment gains during recoveries, their restraining effect on overall job growth was likely significant.	13	1
201401	1342	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The good news here—the data we’re looking at have a lag, but this does echo some comments by President Fisher—is that with house prices and net wealth having risen so much, financial conditions for entrepreneurs are more favorable than they have been in years, and this should support business formation and, in this regard, provide a tailwind for growth going forward.	13	1
201401	1343	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Turning to inflation, overall and core PCE price measures both increased about 1 percent last year, and inflation appears likely to remain below our target for some time.	13	1
201401	1344	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As described in the excellent memo by Board staff, the current low rate of inflation can be traced primarily to three factors.	13	1
201401	1345	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	First of all, while the economy is improving, considerable slack remains.	13	1
201401	1346	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Second, import price inflation has been very low, putting downward pressure on domestic prices.	13	1
201401	1347	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, third, medical care inflation has fallen, with the medical care CPI posting its smallest December- to-December increase since 1949.	13	1
201401	1348	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These three factors holding down inflation should diminish over time.	13	1
201401	1349	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, with inflation expectations remaining well anchored, I expect inflation to start heading back toward our target starting this year.	13	1
201401	1350	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, the Board staff memo also made the point that our understanding of inflation is not very precise.	13	1
201401	1351	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past decade, the largest single contributor to deviations of core inflation from our target is not slack or energy or import price shocks, but the other component, the “kitchen sink” of residual elements.	13	1
201401	1352	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The relative importance of these idiosyncratic factors leads to significant uncertainty and wide confidence intervals around any inflation projection.	13	1
201401	1353	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the key identifiable upside risks to the inflation forecast—that is, one of the known unknowns—centers on the measurement of slack in the economy.	13	1
201401	1354	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I have noted before, I view the unemployment rate as a generally reliable measure of slack.	13	1
201401	1355	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is consistent with a range of other labor market indicators.	13	1
201401	1356	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I am concerned about how to think about the extraordinary number of long-term unemployed today and their effect on wages and prices.	13	1
201401	1357	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We have not seen such a situation since the Great Depression, so it is hard to know how to incorporate this factor into our inflation projections.	13	1
201401	1358	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It may be that the long- and short-term unemployed can be treated as essentially the same for macroeconomic analysis—that is, for measuring slack and forecasting wages and prices.	13	1
201401	1359	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is the baseline Tealbook view, and it’s consistent with the US evidence before the recession.	13	1
201401	1360	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	A different interpretation is given by the Tealbook’s alternative view box, which is an innovation I, too, applaud, and I will have my Tealbook signed by Andrew.	13	1
201401	1361	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have to say, this was incredibly well executed.	13	1
201401	1362	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was very thoughtful.	13	1
201401	1363	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It was fantastic.	13	1
201401	1364	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And it led to a really good discussion at San Francisco, really kind of honing the arguments.	13	1
201401	1365	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m sure that discussion will continue.	13	1
201401	1366	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the box, according to this alternative view, a long spell of unemployment sends an adverse signal to employers.	13	1
201401	1367	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The long-term jobless are largely segregated from wage and labor market dynamics.	13	1
201401	1368	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This has long been the case in Europe, where long-term unemployment has been more prevalent.	13	1
201401	1369	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The European evidence suggests that the long-term unemployed have relatively little influence on wage and price determination.	13	1
201401	1370	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent research papers by Bob Gordon and Mark Watson find that the United States may, in fact, be more like Europe in terms of the effects of the long-term unemployed on wages and prices.	13	1
201401	1371	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Specifically, they find evidence that the NAIRU has risen to between 6 and 6½ percent in recent years when it includes all unemployed workers as a measure of slack.	13	1
201401	1372	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They also find—these are two separate papers and different methodologies—that the NAIRU is relatively stable when one includes only the short-term unemployed, those out of work for less than 27 weeks.	13	1
201401	1373	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They find a NAIRU for short-term unemployed around 4 percent.	13	1
201401	1374	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, other research finds that, once you include data from the past decade in your sample, only short-term unemployment appears to influence inflation.	13	1
201401	1375	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The long-term unemployed have essentially no influence.	13	1
201401	1376	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If true, this suggests that US labor markets may not be as immune to hysteresis as many had previously hoped.	13	1
201401	1377	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It also implies that there is very little slack, at least in terms of the implications for inflation, in the labor market today.	13	1
201401	1378	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The possible uptrend in unit labor costs noted in the alternative-view box is suggestive in this regard, but it is far from definitive.	13	1
201401	1379	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But assuming that short-term unemployment is the most relevant metric for slack, inflation will rise more quickly than projected.	13	1
201401	1380	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Indeed, in this case, inflation will likely overshoot our 2 percent target if overall unemployment comes down as anticipated.	13	1
201401	1381	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not arguing that this hypothesis is settled, but if this hypothesis turns out to be right, it has obvious implications for the appropriate setting of monetary policy.	13	1
201401	1382	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’d just like to add to what President Kocherlakota said.	13	1
201401	1383	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We should be looking at these alternative measures, whether U-6 or other measures, but I think incorporating them into these kind of statistical models is a useful way to analyze them and maybe evaluate them.	13	1
201401	1384	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the other side of the ledger, a downside risk is that we may be underestimating the persistence in the factors that are holding inflation down.	13	1
201401	1385	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I continue to believe in magic in terms of well-anchored inflation expectations, but, potentially, there are risks that some factors that have held inflation down this year could continue.	13	1
201401	1386	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One example that I have talked about in the past is medical prices.	13	1
201401	1387	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They have continued to be soft for some time, as the effects of the Medicare cuts spill over to prices by private insurers.	13	1
201401	1388	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overall, my outlook for the economy and inflation is quite similar to the Tealbook, and I see balanced risks to these projections.	13	1
201401	1389	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1390	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1391	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Pianalto.	13	1
201401	1392	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1393	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	The comments from my business contacts since our last meeting were more upbeat than they have been in quite a while.	13	1
201401	1394	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Coupled with the better tone of the incoming data on the national economy, I am more confident that the economic recovery is on a self-sustaining trajectory.	13	1
201401	1395	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	And, consistent with the Tealbook, I think the economy is in better shape today than it appeared to be in December.	13	1
201401	1396	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In addition, I have lowered my projected path of the unemployment rate, and I continue to expect that inflation will gradually approach our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201401	1397	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	With that preface, I will focus my comments on two elements of the outlook that I believe bear most directly on our policy decision at this meeting—the labor market and inflation.	13	1
201401	1398	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Starting with the labor market, my District contacts report a brighter picture for near-term hiring plans.	13	1
201401	1399	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Compared with a year ago, the number of contacts reporting that they expect to expand employment during the next 12 months increased substantially.	13	1
201401	1400	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	While this information is anecdotal, it leads me to downplay the relatively tepid December employment report, and it increases my confidence that the unemployment rate should continue to fall going forward.	13	1
201401	1401	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Of course, the unemployment rate did decline further since our last meeting.	13	1
201401	1402	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	I recognize that December’s decline in the unemployment rate was associated with another dip in the labor force participation rate.	13	1
201401	1403	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	But the analysis of the participation rates by the Board staff supports my view that most of the recent decline in the labor force participation rate has been driven by longer-term trends, not the business cycle.	13	1
201401	1404	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	While some participants may have dropped out of the labor force in part because of the weak labor market, they also seem unlikely to quickly reenter the labor market.	13	1
201401	1405	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	If this is the case, a moderate pace of job growth will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1406	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Turning to inflation, over the course of the past year, inflation looks to have stabilized at a low level.	13	1
201401	1407	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Translating the December CPI readings to their PCE equivalents, my staff estimates that year-over-year PCE inflation at the end of 2013 was 1.1 percent, both for headline and core, about where they have been since early last summer.	13	1
201401	1408	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Meanwhile, the medium and trimmed mean CPI inflation rates have also stabilized, albeit at a higher level.	13	1
201401	1409	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Looking ahead, it is most likely that inflation will gradually rise, in time, back toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201401	1410	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	But, as was discussed earlier, forecasting inflation is a challenging proposition, and the Board staff memo offers an interesting and helpful summary of the state of knowledge of inflation forecasting.	13	1
201401	1411	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	As the memo highlights, and as David Wilcox emphasized earlier, one of the key drivers of the Tealbook’s inflation outlook is long-run inflation expectations.	13	1
201401	1412	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Research done by my staff supports that long-run inflation expectations can be helpful for forecasting inflation, and the model underlying my inflation forecast includes long-run inflation expectation as well.	13	1
201401	1413	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Over time, inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent should help pull inflation up toward our long- run objective.	13	1
201401	1414	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Longer-run inflation expectations, as measured by surveys, have been relatively stable in spite of recent low inflation readings.	13	1
201401	1415	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Since last spring, inflation expectations from the Cleveland model have moved solidly into the 1½ to 2 percent range.	13	1
201401	1416	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In summary, when I think broadly about the outlook, uncertainty seems to have diminished some.	13	1
201401	1417	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	That is not to say that uncertainty is back to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201401	1418	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Rather, uncertainty seems to be normalizing from elevated levels.	13	1
201401	1419	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Nonetheless, I continue to judge the overall risks to economic growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly balanced.	13	1
201401	1420	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Mr Chairman, I want to conclude my comments by also expressing my gratitude to you for the extraordinary leadership that you have provided this Committee and the Federal Reserve System.	13	1
201401	1421	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	I am one of only four FOMC participants at this table who were here before you became Chairman.	13	1
201401	1422	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Before you took office, you invited each president and each Governor to meet with you to talk about improvements that could be made to the FOMC deliberations.	13	1
201401	1423	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	At the meeting I had with you, you talked about making the meetings more interactive, you talked about improving transparency, and you said that you wanted to depersonalize the Fed.	13	1
201401	1424	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In other words, you wanted to avoid becoming a “rock star.”	13	1
201401	1425	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	I want to compliment you on the many improvements that you have made to the policymaking process.	13	1
201401	1426	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Unfortunately, the financial crisis and your creative and courageous leadership didn’t allow you to escape becoming a rock star.	13	1
201401	1427	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In my view, you have handled your rock star status with great humility, and I have been very proud to have been a member of your band.	13	1
201401	1428	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Again, I thank you for your extraordinary leadership.	13	1
201401	1429	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	It has been an enormous privilege to serve this great institution under your chairmanship.	13	1
201401	1430	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1431	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you very much.	13	1
201401	1432	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Mr Chairman—	13	1
201401	1433	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Yes, sir.	13	1
201401	1434	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	May I note that President Pianalto is on the board of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?	13	1
201401	1435	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	[Laughter]	13	1
201401	1436	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So that is quite a statement that she made.	13	1
201401	1437	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	What do you think?	13	1
201401	1438	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Do you think there’s a chance for me?	13	1
201401	1439	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	We need to get you inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Mr.	13	1
201401	1440	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Chairman.	13	1
201401	1441	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	[Laughter]	13	1
201401	1442	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Bullard.	13	1
201401	1443	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1444	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	As you know, I have largely been a supporter of your policies during the past few years as the FOMC has attempted to navigate policy in the aftermath of the financial crisis.	13	1
201401	1445	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I will be sorry to see you depart, as I think you have provided outstanding leadership during this difficult era.	13	1
201401	1446	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	You may have noticed, Mr.	13	1
201401	1447	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Chairman, that while I have generally been supportive, I have also at times, perhaps too numerous to go into here, offered suggestions for how policy might be improved, either through changes in the statement or through changes in the nature of our policy tools.	13	1
201401	1448	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	In that spirit, Mr Chairman, I felt it would be appropriate to use a few minutes of my time to bestow upon you still more unsolicited advice—this time regarding the book you are rumored to be preparing to write.	13	1
201401	1449	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Startling reports of an alarming nature have reached me, suggesting that the working title of the book is, in fact, “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Decline of the Wealth of the Nation.”	13	1
201401	1450	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Mr Chairman, while I am generally supportive of you writing a book, I believe this title is suboptimal.	13	1
201401	1451	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	First, in the sweep of history, now may not be the most opportune moment to appeal to the genius of Adam Smith.	13	1
201401	1452	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, the effectiveness of the book may be enhanced by taking a cue not from dead economists but, instead, from dead film directors.	13	1
201401	1453	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have in mind, in particular, the altogether different genius of the late Stanley Kubrick.	13	1
201401	1454	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Drawing on Mr Kubrick, my suggested title for your book is “How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Open-Ended Quantitative Easing.”	13	1
201401	1455	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	13	1
201401	1456	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think this title might more appropriately capture the spirit of the times and, thus, allow your book to provide better communication to a mass audience.	13	1
201401	1457	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I hope you will consider this small change in emphasis as I wish you the best of luck regarding your future plans.	13	1
201401	1458	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me now turn briefly to matters of a more factual nature.	13	1
201401	1459	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	While some very recent data concerning the state of the US economy have been less robust than expected, in general, I remain optimistic concerning macroeconomic prospects in 2014.	13	1
201401	1460	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	My confidence stems, in part, from a relatively successful forecasting year concerning the real economy in 2013.	13	1
201401	1461	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The July 2012 St Louis forecast for calendar year 2013 is turning out to be reasonably accurate on unemployment and real GDP growth.	13	1
201401	1462	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	For unemployment, we took the view that labor force participation declines were mostly structural in nature and, therefore, less likely to reverse and inhibit the ongoing declines in unemployment.	13	1
201401	1463	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This viewpoint served us well, as it now appears that we were right concerning the fourth quarter 2013 average unemployment rate.	13	1
201401	1464	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Because this type of forecasting success is a rarity, I wanted to be sure to highlight it for you, so that all of you would not miss it.	13	1
201401	1465	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	13	1
201401	1466	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Similarly, for real GDP growth, during the summer of 2012, the St Louis forecast called for slightly higher than 3 percent growth in 2013.	13	1
201401	1467	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	For much of last year, I labored under the illusion that we were missing badly with this forecast and that growth would come in once again much lower than anticipated.	13	1
201401	1468	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Imagine my relief, then, as data arriving late last year and during the intermeeting period pushed up growth estimates substantially for the second half of 2013.	13	1
201401	1469	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	While it appears that we will still miss this on the high side, our miss is much smaller and perhaps within the realm of reason.	13	1
201401	1470	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, the problem quarter for our 2013 forecast was 2013:Q1, which was quite weak according to current estimates.	13	1
201401	1471	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The general picture that the US economy would improve during the course of 2013 appears to have been vindicated by recent events.	13	1
201401	1472	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The GDP and labor market data, along with other indicators, are largely signaling a continued strengthening of macroeconomic prospects into 2014.	13	1
201401	1473	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	While I note the very recent turmoil in global financial markets, associated mostly with events in emerging market economies, I think this development bears watching but does not constitute a negative factor for the US economy at the current juncture.	13	1
201401	1474	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, anecdotal reports from the Eighth District, especially in the transportation sector, seem to indicate an economy quite a bit livelier than we have observed in the past several years.	13	1
201401	1475	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	A large logistics company, for instance, intended to hire 55,000 temporary workers for the holiday season but ended up hiring 85,000.	13	1
201401	1476	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, they had to offer special incentives to get people to work despite unemployment rates that remained relatively high.	13	1
201401	1477	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	A large transportation firm continues to invest heavily in capital equipment, including trucks, and that’s new compared with the past five years, and it intends to hire as many as 1,500 workers this year.	13	1
201401	1478	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Anecdotal reports also suggest some congestion delay in railroad transportation, which is not the type of thing one hears about in a sluggish economy.	13	1
201401	1479	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Technology firms continue to report booming business and intense competition for skilled workers.	13	1
201401	1480	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Many contacts continue to complain about shortages of certain blue collar and semiskilled workers.	13	1
201401	1481	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The inability of prospective workers to pass a drug test remains a key barrier.	13	1
201401	1482	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	One area in which our forecasts were not successful during 2013 was in the inflation arena.	13	1
201401	1483	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	While the summer 2012 St Louis forecast called for inflation at target in 2013, actual inflation has continued to drift lower.	13	1
201401	1484	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This has been discussed extensively today.	13	1
201401	1485	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciated the staff memo on this topic, which was excellent.	13	1
201401	1486	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think inflation remains a wild card for the Committee during 2014.	13	1
201401	1487	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	My current forecast continues to call for inflation to move back toward target, but I continue to await definitive signals from the data that this is actually occurring.	13	1
201401	1488	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1489	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1490	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	13	1
201401	1491	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1492	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Economic activity in the Third District continued to improve during the intermeeting period, and the tone of our business contacts has turned decidedly more optimistic.	13	1
201401	1493	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It appears that the Third District’s economy is growing pretty much at trend.	13	1
201401	1494	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My staff’s state coincident indicators show moderate economic growth across the tri-state area, and leading indicators point to continued growth over the next six months.	13	1
201401	1495	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Regional manufacturing activity also continues to expand.	13	1
201401	1496	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The Business Outlook Survey’s general activity index posted its eighth consecutive monthly increase in January, rising to 9.4, which again is about at trend level.	13	1
201401	1497	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Six-month-ahead indicators in the survey are well into positive territory, near their trend.	13	1
201401	1498	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Manufacturers remain optimistic about future activity.	13	1
201401	1499	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Firms plan to increase capital expenditures over the next six months.	13	1
201401	1500	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	One very large business in our District indicated that in 2013 it ended up expanding its capital expenditures well above what it budgeted originally, and going forward it is now forecasting even more capital expenditures for 2014.	13	1
201401	1501	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That business is much more optimistic in that regard.	13	1
201401	1502	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Another manufacturer who manufactures and sells products all over the world said that the end of 2013 was one of the strongest periods it had witnessed in the past 10 years, and what it calls its “book” is very large, forecasting—at least for the first eight or nine months of 2014—a very strong year.	13	1
201401	1503	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The December employment report for New Jersey gained some headlines.	13	1
201401	1504	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	There was a very sizable drop of 36,000 payroll jobs in New Jersey alone.	13	1
201401	1505	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	This is a 0.9 percentage point drop on a monthly basis, not an annual basis, and the largest decline since September of 1945.	13	1
201401	1506	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Pennsylvania also saw a decline in employment in December, but a more modest 0.2 percent.	13	1
201401	1507	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Analysis by our staff suggests that a significant portion of this loss is very likely attributable to poor weather conditions in the Northeast, as losses were concentrated in construction and in leisure and hospitality, two sectors that have generally shown stable and growing employment in the region.	13	1
201401	1508	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I am inclined not to read too much into the December payroll numbers.	13	1
201401	1509	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	If we average the monthly numbers and look at employment for the three months ending in December over the comparable year-earlier levels, we see growth of about 0.7 percent in both states, which is somewhat stronger actually than their longer-term trend.	13	1
201401	1510	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Another positive indicator is that the employment index in our manufacturing survey improved in January and is running above its trend rate.	13	1
201401	1511	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Taken altogether, my assessment is that labor market conditions in the District continued to improve in the intermeeting period, and that they are likely to continue to do so going forward into 2014.	13	1
201401	1512	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Other activity in the District also firmed.	13	1
201401	1513	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Commercial real estate activity is picking up.	13	1
201401	1514	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	There are three new major office projects breaking ground in center city Philadelphia, two 47- story mixed commercial and residential structures and one 59-story Comcast innovation center, which will house a Four Seasons hotel as well as Comcast.	13	1
201401	1515	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Net absorption of office space—the difference between new space leased and space added—has been strong enough to drive down vacancy rates over the past few quarters.	13	1
201401	1516	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My read of conditions at the national level is pretty similar.	13	1
201401	1517	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I have made little change in my forecast.	13	1
201401	1518	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	While recent volatility in financial markets—including the emerging market currency swings and equity price declines—could pose a risk if sustained, I have done little to adjust my forecast to reflect that.	13	1
201401	1519	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it is premature to do so, and I hope that we won’t have to.	13	1
201401	1520	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I continue to forecast economic growth at about trend.	13	1
201401	1521	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	My growth forecast for 2013, like that of the St Louis bank, was close to 3 percent.	13	1
201401	1522	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	It was a little high, but it turns out that the fourth-quarter burst is going to bring it closer to that, and I continue to believe it will be about 3 percent going forward in 2014.	13	1
201401	1523	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I haven’t changed that forecast, either.	13	1
201401	1524	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Inflation numbers have been low, but core inflation appears to be stabilizing.	13	1
201401	1525	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Expectations are well anchored.	13	1
201401	1526	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We can keep our fingers crossed.	13	1
201401	1527	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	For all the reasons that other people have discussed, it is a bit of a wild card.	13	1
201401	1528	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	There seems to be accumulating evidence that the headwinds are not as strong as we might have thought earlier.	13	1
201401	1529	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The Tealbook has revised down its path for the unemployment rate and reduced its measure of output gaps and labor market slack.	13	1
201401	1530	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	All but the nominal income targeting rule point to a positive federal funds rate in the second quarter.	13	1
201401	1531	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And note that this includes or recognizes the fact that inflation is below target.	13	1
201401	1532	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	This suggests that we are likely going to have to start pulling back on our policy accommodation sooner than we might have once thought.	13	1
201401	1533	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	If so, we need to start thinking about how to best convey that message.	13	1
201401	1534	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	As we approach the 6½ percent threshold, and we continue to try to provide more accommodation through asset purchases, our communications will become more challenging, and we will have to work on that.	13	1
201401	1535	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The alternative view in Tealbook A, which I applaud and I referenced earlier, makes a plausible case that the economy has nearly recovered from the adverse shock of the Great Recession and has returned to something that looks like steady-state growth.	13	1
201401	1536	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But even if this is not viewed as the modal forecast, I think it reconciles several conundrums in the data.	13	1
201401	1537	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	For example, there have been several discussions around the table at recent meetings about the declines in the labor force participation rate and concerns that we will see a backup in unemployment once the participation rates return to trend.	13	1
201401	1538	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	The analysis by Shigeru Fujita on our staff that I reported two meetings ago has largely been confirmed and reinforced by the Board staff memo that came out during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201401	1539	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That is to say that a large portion of the participation rate decline is not cyclical—not all of it, but much of it is noncyclical.	13	1
201401	1540	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	This means that the drop in the unemployment rate, which is much sharper than many anticipated a year ago, remains a pretty good indicator of labor market conditions.	13	1
201401	1541	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think it would be prudent for us to think about the implications of the alternative view for our policy choices going forward—a topic that I will return to next go-around.	13	1
201401	1542	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Before concluding, I’d like to say what an honor it has been, Mr Chairman, to serve on the FOMC with you.	13	1
201401	1543	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Your leadership has been exemplary through some of the most troubling and challenging times in our nation’s economic history.	13	1
201401	1544	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Of course, we will be making official tributes to you tonight at dinner, but I didn’t want to let this opportunity go by without acknowledging my personal deep gratitude for your service and your leadership.	13	1
201401	1545	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1546	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1547	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President George.	13	1
201401	1548	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1549	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	The 10th District economy held steady overall since the last meeting, and bright spots in the region continue to be housing, construction, and energy.	13	1
201401	1550	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Colorado is doing particularly well, and our contacts there report a fair amount of enthusiasm on two fronts:  brisk sales of a new legalized consumer product [laughter] and the upcoming appearance of the Mile High City’s team in the Super Bowl.	13	1
201401	1551	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Aside from those transitory factors, consumer spending was mixed in late November and December, as automobile sales declined, while retail and restaurant sales slightly increased.	13	1
201401	1552	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Although most District contacts reported sales activity as lower than they had expected, retail sales actually increased compared with the prior month and were higher than at the same time last year.	13	1
201401	1553	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Consumers have continued to pay down revolving debt balances while modestly increasing auto debt.	13	1
201401	1554	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	The District’s unemployment rate, at 5.7 percent, is fairly close to its longer-run average and significantly below that of the nation.	13	1
201401	1555	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Feedback from our business contacts shows net hiring plans moved upward for every industry for which data were collected, with the exception of bankers and mortgage lenders, which is likely because of the slowdown of the refinancing business last year.	13	1
201401	1556	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	When asked to identify the main reason for hiring more workers, respondents most often indicated that they expected more sales in the coming year.	13	1
201401	1557	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finding qualified workers to fill job openings continues to be a common complaint.	13	1
201401	1558	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	My outlook for the national economy is unchanged from December.	13	1
201401	1559	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I continue to expect above-trend economic growth of about 2½ percent in the first half of this year and then rising to 3 percent for the rest of the forecast horizon.	13	1
201401	1560	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Certainly, a reduction in fiscal drag is playing an important role in my forecast for this year, as does, though, continued strength in consumer spending and expectations for business investment.	13	1
201401	1561	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I expect that consumer spending will be supported by an ongoing pickup in nonfarm payrolls moving closer to a 200,000 per month rate this year and next, which is similar to the January Blue Chip consensus, after growing at an average monthly rate of 182,000 last year.	13	1
201401	1562	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Modest wage gains should also contribute to consumer spending.	13	1
201401	1563	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	The January Blue Chip consensus expects the rise in average hourly earnings to increase from 1.8 percent last year to 2.3 percent this year.	13	1
201401	1564	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	These forecasts are consistent with the December Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, which finds that consumer optimism about future income gains continues to rise.	13	1
201401	1565	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I expect investment spending also should edge higher, as policy uncertainty fades and lending standards have eased.	13	1
201401	1566	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Forward-looking indicators are positive.	13	1
201401	1567	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	For example, looking at Duke’s Global Business Outlook Survey, CFOs expect capital spending to grow 7.3 percent over the next 12 months, the highest rate since the first quarter of 2012.	13	1
201401	1568	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Additionally, the fraction of small businesses planning on making capital expenditures in the next three to six months has picked up and is now at its highest level since June 2008.	13	1
201401	1569	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	On inflation:  With measures of inflation expectations holding steady, the labor market continuing to gradually normalize, and import prices stabilizing, I expect inflation to firm next year and move higher over the next few years.	13	1
201401	1570	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1571	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1572	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lacker.	13	1
201401	1573	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1574	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The Fifth District economy has continued to show signs of improvement in recent weeks.	13	1
201401	1575	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Manufacturing continued to expand, according to our January survey released this morning, which showed a third straight month of solid positive readings.	13	1
201401	1576	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Our diffusion index for retail revenues swung from minus 15 in December to plus 18 in January.	13	1
201401	1577	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	In addition to these survey data, news on the housing market in our District was positive; new home sales and construction prices moved higher.	13	1
201401	1578	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Furniture sales are showing some positive momentum again after sagging in December.	13	1
201401	1579	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Commercial real estate was more of a mixed bag, though, with improvement reported for warehouse, energy, and transportation projects, while retail and office construction remained fairly soft.	13	1
201401	1580	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Many of our business contacts are sounding guardedly optimistic.	13	1
201401	1581	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Several bankers have said that credit metrics are improving and loan pipelines are growing.	13	1
201401	1582	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	In their annual canvassing of their loan customers, more of their customers reported a desire to expand this year.	13	1
201401	1583	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	One of our directors told us of a crane company that had its best year ever in 2013, and the largest builder in South Carolina is increasing its credit line.	13	1
201401	1584	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, firms have ample reason for caution.	13	1
201401	1585	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	A large department store chain based in North Carolina had very strong sales in October and November but poor sales in December and is now planning for only 1 percent sales growth this year.	13	1
201401	1586	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Also, a large multilocation auto dealer said that 2013 was its best year ever, but that sales were down in December, especially the last week.	13	1
201401	1587	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	On balance, then, there has been a clear improvement in District economic activity, but we continue to hear notes of caution from our business contacts.	13	1
201401	1588	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	What optimism they do express is, as I said, distinctly guarded.	13	1
201401	1589	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	In the national picture, the surge in economic growth in the second half of 2013 was striking.	13	1
201401	1590	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	A key question is whether that surge will be persistent or whether it will subside this year.	13	1
201401	1591	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The recent data strengthen the case that the Tealbook has been making for some time now that GDP is going to be growing above 3 percent for several years, but I am still not completely convinced.	13	1
201401	1592	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	One of the most encouraging recent developments was the upswing in real consumer spending at the beginning of the fourth quarter.	13	1
201401	1593	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	We have seen similar swings before, though, and they turned out to be less persistent than we had hoped.	13	1
201401	1594	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I would like to see an improvement in income growth to support the pickup in spending growth, but we haven’t seen that yet.	13	1
201401	1595	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Another reason for caution is that so much of the surge in growth in the second half of last year was attributable to inventory accumulation.	13	1
201401	1596	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	These additional inventories are only unwound over two years in the latest Tealbook.	13	1
201401	1597	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	It wouldn’t surprise me to see a much quicker reversal, particularly if consumer spending lost a bit of steam.	13	1
201401	1598	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So I’m hesitant to sign onto a forecast of persistently strong GDP growth, even though much of the latest data have been encouraging.	13	1
201401	1599	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, I’d like to also thank the staff for sharing the details of their framework for producing inflation forecasts, particularly their method for conveying the various components driving that forecast.	13	1
201401	1600	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	What was striking to me was both the importance of inflation expectations to the process and the stability of expectations in recent years.	13	1
201401	1601	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Others have mentioned this as well.	13	1
201401	1602	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Certainly, that stability is a good thing and no doubt is a reflection on our credibility that we have worked hard to earn.	13	1
201401	1603	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The staff notes that it’s essentially impossible to build an empirical model of expectations using data for the recent period in which they have been virtually constant.	13	1
201401	1604	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I think it’s worth noting that we saw significant swings in expectations in the more distant past.	13	1
201401	1605	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Extracting usable lessons from those data is obviously going to be difficult, but I think it’s worth trying.	13	1
201401	1606	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	The sense you get from the historical data, just looking at it roughly, is that dramatic and painful action would be required should expectations become dislodged.	13	1
201401	1607	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Finally, Mr Chairman, I share the sentiment expressed by others around the table that you deserve our enduring gratitude for your dedicated service as Chairman during what turned out to be exceptionally trying times.	13	1
201401	1608	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1609	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1610	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201401	1611	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1612	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My views about the outlook for economic growth have not changed materially since the last meeting, although growth in the second half of the year has been stronger than expected.	13	1
201401	1613	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m pretty much where the Tealbook is; I haven’t really upgraded my forecast for economic growth.	13	1
201401	1614	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m still optimistic that the economy will grow above trend in 2014.	13	1
201401	1615	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think consumption will hold up relatively well, in part because net worth has risen so sharply.	13	1
201401	1616	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Given the level of net worth relative to disposable income, there does seem to be some scope for the household saving rate to decline in 2014.	13	1
201401	1617	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I also take some comfort from the recent news on equipment shipments and orders, today’s report notwithstanding.	13	1
201401	1618	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, business fixed investment has been a puzzle up to now.	13	1
201401	1619	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It has been weaker than I would have expected given the high level of profits, the low level of interest rates, and the large amount of cash sitting on the business sector’s balance sheet.	13	1
201401	1620	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact that it now seems to be on a stronger trend is noteworthy in my view.	13	1
201401	1621	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Before getting too excited, though, we have to recognize that transitory factors are responsible for some of the strength in GDP growth we have seen over the past two quarters, as President Lacker noted.	13	1
201401	1622	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I expect that the very sharp pickup in inventory accumulation in the third quarter and the very large contribution from trade in the fourth quarter will not be repeated.	13	1
201401	1623	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, fiscal drag is still pretty significant in 2014, even though it is less forceful than in 2013, and that still seems likely to blunt some of the economy’s forward momentum.	13	1
201401	1624	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So economic growth slightly above trend, at an annual rate of around 3 percent, still seems like a reasonable forecast.	13	1
201401	1625	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the inflation side, the data seem generally supportive of the view that inflation will drift up gradually over the next few years toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201401	1626	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Core inflation seems to have stabilized, albeit at a level well below our objective.	13	1
201401	1627	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation expectations remain well anchored, and the amount of excess slack in the economy is shrinking.	13	1
201401	1628	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the economic growth side, I expect that the incoming data will provide less of a signal than normal over the next month or two, and I would encourage the staff to do some work on population-weighted heating degree days and how that affects the various economic data.	13	1
201401	1629	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The winter has been unusually cold, and I really do think this is going to play havoc with the seasonal adjustment process, especially in the construction sector, of course, but I think it also could have meaningful effects elsewhere.	13	1
201401	1630	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One issue that I had been thinking hard about is the degree of excess slack in the economy.	13	1
201401	1631	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems that the amount of slack in the economy is shrinking faster than we had anticipated given the rate of economic growth.	13	1
201401	1632	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We have seen the unemployment rate decline quite quickly over the past 18 months, even with a very moderate growth rate.	13	1
201401	1633	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I am not convinced that the relationship between economic growth and the unemployment rate will necessarily go the other way in 2014—that the unemployment rate will flatten out even as growth stays above trend.	13	1
201401	1634	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The fact is that we don’t have a good read on three important factors: what productivity growth will be in 2014, so we don’t know how that growth will translate into labor demand; how participation rates will change if the labor market tightens, so we don’t know how a given growth rate of payroll employment will translate to changes in the unemployment rate; and the level of the natural rate.	13	1
201401	1635	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think the participation trend, in particular, is very difficult to evaluate.	13	1
201401	1636	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Most of the decline does appear to be tied to shifts in the composition of the different age cohorts and secular declines within some age cohorts.	13	1
201401	1637	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But parsing out what is temporary from what is permanent is difficult, and this creates considerable uncertainty about the outlook for the unemployment rate and the degree of slack in the labor market.	13	1
201401	1638	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For me, my uncertainty about how the level of excess slack in the economy will evolve this year, combined with the uncertainty that I have about the growth pace of the economy, makes me pretty uncertain about the ultimate timing of liftoff for short-term rates.	13	1
201401	1639	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I really want to put less emphasis on the modal forecast and talk about the degree of dispersion around that forecast.	13	1
201401	1640	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine we might want to lift off as soon as the first quarter of next year, or many, many quarters later.	13	1
201401	1641	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Given this, I would prefer to shift, although not at this meeting, our forward guidance more toward a formulation based on economic conditions rather than time.	13	1
201401	1642	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think there is too much uncertainty about the timing to continue to formulate it in those terms.	13	1
201401	1643	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to consider how we should adjust the monetary policy statement at the March meeting in light of these considerations.	13	1
201401	1644	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ll talk more about that tomorrow.	13	1
201401	1645	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, two comments, one on financial market developments and another on emerging financial-stability risk.	13	1
201401	1646	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Although the selloff in some of the EMEs has been very sharp in recent days, I am, I think, pretty much where Steve is.	13	1
201401	1647	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would be very hesitant to put too much weight on the importance of this past week’s developments.	13	1
201401	1648	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the selloff has been the sharpest by far in those countries, such as Argentina, with the poorest fundamentals.	13	1
201401	1649	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, if you look at our markets, the adjustments in our equity and bond markets have undoubtedly been exacerbated by market positioning.	13	1
201401	1650	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Going into this year, the consensus is very strong to be overweight in equities and underweight in Treasuries.	13	1
201401	1651	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Whenever the consensus view is well entrenched, there is scope for sharp reversals.	13	1
201401	1652	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, from a US perspective, financial conditions really haven’t changed much and still remain broadly supportive of economic activity.	13	1
201401	1653	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As President Fisher pointed out in his earlier remarks, the declines we are talking about are pretty trivial at this point.	13	1
201401	1654	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the financial-stability front, I just want to briefly flag the Puerto Rican situation.	13	1
201401	1655	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The likelihood of a downgrade by Moody’s to junk status in the near future is quite high.	13	1
201401	1656	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Moreover, the commonwealth apparently has limited access to liquid resources to fund its ongoing operating deficit.	13	1
201401	1657	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This could come to a head as a full-blown crisis relatively quickly, and that could actually lead to contagion through a number of channels, including the monoline insurers that guarantee a significant portion of Puerto Rican sovereign debt and the broader municipal bond market.	13	1
201401	1658	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, my own view is that although such an outcome would be problematic, I think the Puerto Rican situation will be viewed as sufficiently idiosyncratic that the knock-on effects to broader financial stability will be modest rather than severe.	13	1
201401	1659	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But I do think it’s worth flagging because this is something that could come up over the very near term.	13	1
201401	1660	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Mr.	13	1
201401	1661	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Chairman.	13	1
201401	1662	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1663	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Yellen.	13	1
201401	1664	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1665	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve read the limited news that’s rolled in since the December meeting as positive, on net, but there have been some disquieting elements.	13	1
201401	1666	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Most importantly, economic activity appears to be gradually strengthening.	13	1
201401	1667	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s consistent with my expectation in the December SEP and with our Committee’s assessment when we decided to undertake our first measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases.	13	1
201401	1668	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve not yet seen clear signs that inflation is moving back gradually toward our 2 percent objective, but it would be unrealistic to expect such signs to emerge in just a month or so of data.	13	1
201401	1669	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to the labor market, there’s no denying that the payroll side of the December employment report was disappointing.	13	1
201401	1670	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’ve read a fair bit of discussion among the staff and outside analysts concerning the potential effects of bad weather, but I’ve not seen anyone make the case that this factor could explain the entire shortfall relative to expectations of more than 100,000.	13	1
201401	1671	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	In spite of the weak December payroll report and thanks, in part, to upward revisions to November’s gains, the three-month moving average stands around 170,000, a level that clearly is consistent with ongoing improvement in the labor market.	13	1
201401	1672	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	For now, my hope is that the December jobs reading will prove to be a temporary aberration and that payrolls, on average, will post stronger gains going forward.	13	1
201401	1673	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The household survey was more mixed, and I see the main question there as whether to interpret the large decline in the unemployment rate as signaling an equally large reduction in the degree of labor market slack.	13	1
201401	1674	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	This assessment is made more difficult by the accompanying 0.2 percentage point decline in labor force participation.	13	1
201401	1675	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve debated any number of times over the past year or so whether labor market slack is now becoming increasingly manifest in lower labor force participation rather than in measured unemployment, and there are arguments on both sides of this debate.	13	1
201401	1676	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s important for us to refine our thinking on this matter because, after declining about 30 basis points per year, from 2010 through 2012, the labor force participation rate declined a whopping 84 basis points last year.	13	1
201401	1677	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I found the staff memo on the behavior of the participation rate helpful in thinking through various potential explanations.	13	1
201401	1678	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Concerning the role of demographics, the memo rightly highlights the fact that the shift in cohort sizes toward older cohorts with lower participation rates dominates the modest increase in participation rates of older workers.	13	1
201401	1679	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	But we are confronting a difficult identification problem, because these demographic changes coincide with the aftermath of a particularly deep recession.	13	1
201401	1680	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s conceivable that the demographic changes imply a steeper decline in the trend rate of labor force participation than the 0.3 percentage point per year assumed in the Tealbook baseline, but I remain reasonably optimistic that a substantial fraction of the decline in participation among younger cohorts would be reversed in a strong economy with a higher pressure job market.	13	1
201401	1681	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, I’m not at all convinced that many among the younger and prime-age cohorts who currently state they do not want a job would give the same answer if the job market were notably stronger, if, for example, quits and the pace of hiring were closer to normal levels and wages were showing more substantial gains.	13	1
201401	1682	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	While I’m inclined to discount at least a portion of the large decline in the unemployment rate in December, it does seem fair to conclude that the drop signals at least some reduction in slack.	13	1
201401	1683	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	This view seems consistent with job market perceptions in recent surveys and the news we received on growth.	13	1
201401	1684	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The level of real GDP in the fourth quarter is now projected to be 0.6 percent higher than we thought at the time of the December meeting.	13	1
201401	1685	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Some of this upward surprise is due to stronger net exports, which are unlikely to continue making large contributions to economic growth going forward, but private domestic final purchases accounted for about one-half of the upward revision to GDP.	13	1
201401	1686	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The strength we’ve seen in this component is certainly good news, and it suggests that the long-awaited acceleration in household and business spending may have finally arrived.	13	1
201401	1687	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Although the risks to this outlook now seem reasonably balanced, the recent volatility in financial conditions faced by emerging markets bears careful watching.	13	1
201401	1688	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	But, to date, it appears unlikely to derail the generally more positive outlook for the global economy.	13	1
201401	1689	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	While I am hopeful that we’re finally breaking out of the 2 percent growth pattern, I think we should be careful not to get carried away with our progress.	13	1
201401	1690	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s keep in mind that we’ve experienced quite a few false dawns over the past few years, and even if faster growth is now for real, the absolute level of slack in the economy is probably still quite large by historical standards.	13	1
201401	1691	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate provides an incomplete measure.	13	1
201401	1692	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	In addition to the difficult- to-estimate cyclical shortfall in labor force participation, our assessment of slack needs to factor in the unusually large portion of the labor force that is underemployed.	13	1
201401	1693	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons still stands at 5 percent, a level not far below its post-recession peak of 6 percent.	13	1
201401	1694	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, at 2½ percent, long-term unemployment still stands far above its pre-recession level of 1 percent.	13	1
201401	1695	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Furthermore, inflation has been disconcertingly low over the past year, and, at this stage, reversion of inflation toward our 2 percent objective remains only a forecast.	13	1
201401	1696	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	We noted in our statement that low inflation could pose risks to the economy.	13	1
201401	1697	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think a persistent downside miss could also pose risks to our credibility.	13	1
201401	1698	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	On balance, at this juncture, with the unemployment rate falling rapidly, I see our main challenge is finding ways to communicate that we intend to keep policy highly accommodative for quite some time and that we’ll be patient in removing accommodation when the time comes to do so.	13	1
201401	1699	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I, too, Mr Chairman, want to express my gratitude for all of your contributions to the Federal Reserve and to the nation and say what an honor it has been to serve with you.	13	1
201401	1700	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	And I want to mention that the thought of filling your large shoes is a daunting challenge.	13	1
201401	1701	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I am completely confident.	13	1
201401	1702	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201401	1703	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1704	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	When the go-round got to me at the December meeting, I characterized what I had heard to that point as, generally, people having not changed their baseline or modal expectations very much, but having seen a reduction in downside risks.	13	1
201401	1705	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	This time around, up until about the past 15 minutes, I would have characterized those who have gone before me as, again, not seeing much of a change in modal expectations but having had some increase or some sense of perhaps increased upside risks.	13	1
201401	1706	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Beginning with Jeff, though, I think there’s been a little bit more of a line that captures some of what I’m feeling, which is at least a little bit more doubt around that.	13	1
201401	1707	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	A lot of the good news to which people referred was backward looking.	13	1
201401	1708	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	The upping of the second half of 2013’s economic performance was sort of:  It’s good, we had it, but, particularly as Jeff said with things like inventory buildup, there’s not actually a particular suggestion that that’s going to carry through to more momentum.	13	1
201401	1709	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	If anything, it might be slightly less.	13	1
201401	1710	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Taking note of the trio of less-than-uplifting pieces of data that people have mentioned that we’ve seen over the past couple of weeks—the jobs report, housing permits, and durable goods orders—two of those three are forward looking, and the fact that two of the three that are forward looking are not so great gives me at least a little bit of a pause.	13	1
201401	1711	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	The subjective points for optimism, which are people and businesses reporting that they feel better about things, we should probably take note of, but, of course, those are susceptible to a turnaround as well when things in the world aren’t going as positively as expected.	13	1
201401	1712	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	In that regard, I just want to mention a couple of things about external risk—which is to say, the possibility of financial turmoil in emerging markets.	13	1
201401	1713	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I say external, even though one factor is presumably the actual and anticipated rise in US rates with the presumed effects of reversing some of the capital flows to emerging markets that resulted from the search for higher returns over the past several years.	13	1
201401	1714	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t know how great this effect is, but because emerging markets’ financial problems over the past few decades do seem to be, at least generally, correlated with interest rate movements in larger, mature economies, I suspect there is some causal relationship with our monetary policy, as well as with the pullback from some emerging markets by many European banks as they took risk off their balance sheets largely based on non- European asset sales.	13	1
201401	1715	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’m inclined toward the view that Steve and others have already articulated, that the current stress in a number of emerging markets is not likely either to develop into a full-blown and widespread crisis or to have substantial direct effects on the US economy.	13	1
201401	1716	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Important background factors in many important emerging markets have changed for the better since the 1990s, including fewer hard pegs of exchange rates, considerably higher reserve levels, and a greater proportion of debt denominated in local currencies.	13	1
201401	1717	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	But there is at least one other background change—namely, the exponential increase in capital flows to emerging markets over the past decade or so—that may make a crisis more likely because there’s a lot more that could run.	13	1
201401	1718	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’m a little less than totally reassured by some of the grounds given by a number of commentators for believing that the problems will remain muted.	13	1
201401	1719	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Foremost among these is the differentiation point—that is, the notion that Turkey, Argentina, and Ukraine, which are among the most affected economies, are very different and have significant and special issues that don’t apply to the others.	13	1
201401	1720	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	As Steve has already mentioned, in the summer of 1997, Thailand looked a lot different from Indonesia, Korea, and other countries to many observers both within and without the US government.	13	1
201401	1721	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	What seemed in mid-1997 to be problems in these countries in need of attention, but manageable, suddenly became serious vulnerabilities.	13	1
201401	1722	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Eventually investors did draw distinctions among the affected countries, but in the presence of a lot of uncertainty and fear, they tended to run first in a quite undifferentiated fashion in response to developments that didn’t seem logically sufficient to change people’s perceptions of those economies that much.	13	1
201401	1723	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is the impact of something approaching a herd mentality or behavior in the absence of enough information.	13	1
201401	1724	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’ll just quickly mention some other things that are a little bit worrisome about the current circumstances.	13	1
201401	1725	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Several of those countries—Turkey, Argentina, and Ukraine—are also good examples of countries that have really quite bad relationships with the IMF right now for different reasons.	13	1
201401	1726	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Argentina has a 14-year history now of bad relationships.	13	1
201401	1727	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Turkey had a lot of interaction with the IMF for quite a while, but in recent years that’s become strained.	13	1
201401	1728	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	And of course, Ukraine has just got substantial political problems that stop it from having very coherent policies more generally.	13	1
201401	1729	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s important because obviously it makes it less likely that problems that develop in those economies can be reasonably contained with a Fund program if there’s a bad basis on which to build the Fund program in the first place.	13	1
201401	1730	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That leads me to another observation, which I suspect is related to the point about bad relations with the IMF.	13	1
201401	1731	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	In conversations with officials, colleagues, counterparts from some of the emerging markets, I sense more worry in them than I might have anticipated based on the kind of analysis that we’ve been giving one another today and in the past few days.	13	1
201401	1732	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	When you’re on the firing line, of course, things always seem a little bit more dramatic, and so you tend to be a little bit more worried, but some of the countries that people would put in the middle category of vulnerability seem extremely focused on what can be done to move Argentina, Turkey, and some of the other countries in a more stabilizing direction.	13	1
201401	1733	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	A final point of difference is that the United States and other mature economies have way less room to provide some buffering or absorption capacity than we did in either 1994–95 or 1997–98.	13	1
201401	1734	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I mean, people will remember that a turning point of the 1997–98 emerging market crisis came, I think, when our predecessors here reduced the federal funds rate in non-regularly scheduled meetings very significantly in the course of just a couple of weeks.	13	1
201401	1735	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	We’re obviously not in a position to do that.	13	1
201401	1736	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, I’m aware there are a lot of experts out there who have predicted eight out of the last two emerging market financial crises, and, as I said, my guess is that this episode will remain largely contained, but I think the downside risk is actually somewhat greater than has been generally recognized.	13	1
201401	1737	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Then, briefly, switching gears for a second, I also wanted to say something about the labor markets.	13	1
201401	1738	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, I wanted to make one point on the memo, which I agree was very good, although I cannot keep the five hypotheses straight in my mind.	13	1
201401	1739	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	People have been noting that the memo attributes most of the change in labor force participation to structural factors.	13	1
201401	1740	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s correct but a little bit misleading, given our policy decision, because, pre-crisis, the expectation of labor economists was for a declining labor force participation rate because of demographic reasons, the aging of the population.	13	1
201401	1741	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Really, from our point of view, the key should be explaining the delta between what that projection in, say, 2007 or 2008 would have been and what we’re seeing today.	13	1
201401	1742	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I think, when you look at it that way, you probably see a more balanced explanation between structural and cyclical factors.	13	1
201401	1743	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	After several years of very high unemployment and insufficient aggregate demand as well as, perhaps, an acceleration of some preexisting unfavorable secular tendencies, the case for structural effects on the labor market is unfortunately becoming stronger, and the absence of aggressive active labor market policies has almost certainly exacerbated whatever is, in fact, occurring.	13	1
201401	1744	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	But as Charlie Evans and Narayana did, I think it’s useful to focus a bit on what we have seen with respect to wages, because here I don’t think that we’re seeing a lot of evidence that whatever slack does exist is being reduced so rapidly that we’re at the limits of what can be productively done.	13	1
201401	1745	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Some research notes by outside organizations have suggested that wage pressures are building.	13	1
201401	1746	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	These notes have emphasized the year-to-year percentage change in average hourly earnings for production and nonsupervisory workers.	13	1
201401	1747	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s true that this measure of wages has accelerated over the past 18 months or so.	13	1
201401	1748	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Through December, the average hourly earnings series rose 2.1 percent from a year ago, which was a noticeable pickup from what was, after all, a historically low 1¼ percent pace in late 2012.	13	1
201401	1749	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	But the average hourly earnings of production workers is pretty much the only wage series that shows evidence of marked acceleration.	13	1
201401	1750	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Rates of increase in average hourly earnings for all workers and in the employment cost index for private workers are basically unchanged since 2010, with not much evidence of recent acceleration.	13	1
201401	1751	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Compensation per hour for workers in the nonfarm business sector presents a fuzzier picture, but, from what I understand, that series is noisy enough that it’s difficult to draw much inference from the recent movements that we’ve seen.	13	1
201401	1752	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Anecdotal reports notwithstanding, it’s hard to find much evidence of industry-specific wage pressures by looking at aggregate data.	13	1
201401	1753	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Wage gains have been pretty muted across a variety of industries, including those in the service sector.	13	1
201401	1754	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	There are a couple of industries, several of you have already mentioned residential construction, in which there do seem to be more impressive wage gains, but there are nearly always some discrete sectors in which wages are rising well above the norm, and these are not at all necessarily harbingers of more generalized tendencies.	13	1
201401	1755	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	If we’re talking about construction workers, it’s probably worth noting that for the construction sector as a whole—that is, not just residential but nonresidential construction—wages have continued, on net, to decelerate since the end of the recession.	13	1
201401	1756	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	So although I think the questions, as many of you have already noted, about what’s going on in labor markets remain open and contestable and certainly very important for our purposes, I don’t think that, at this point, the case has yet been made for structural explanations dominating cyclical ones to such an extent that it should be affecting near- to medium-term monetary policies.	13	1
201401	1757	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1758	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1759	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Stein.	13	1
201401	1760	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1761	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Let me just first add to what others have said and express my gratitude and admiration for everything you’ve done over the past eight years.	13	1
201401	1762	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Personally, it has just been a great privilege to be your colleague and to have the opportunity to watch you work.	13	1
201401	1763	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	As others have noted, we’ve had some, I guess, modestly encouraging news since our last meeting, most notably the upgrading of second-half GDP growth, along with stronger consumer spending and business investment.	13	1
201401	1764	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Given the generally positive tenor of the data, I guess I was a little bit puzzled, I didn’t quite know what to make of the payroll number.	13	1
201401	1765	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	So, all else equal, I’m inclined to wait and see how the next one or two play out before putting too much inferential weight on it.	13	1
201401	1766	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Now, I don’t mean what follows from here on as in any way a forecast, but just in terms of identifying scenarios that are interesting and potentially challenging for us, the recent news did prompt me to wonder whether something along the lines of the Tealbook’s more optimistic alternative scenario—I guess it was the “Consumer and Business Confidence” scenario—might just be worth spending some time thinking about.	13	1
201401	1767	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Concretely, suppose that the faster growth we’ve seen in the last half of 2013 sustains itself and in so doing actually creates a little bit of positive consumer sentiment or animal spirits and you start getting a little bit of a virtuous feedback.	13	1
201401	1768	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	As a result, economic growth picks up, and, as we move, let’s say, into the middle of this year, we see growth on the order of 3½, 4 percent.	13	1
201401	1769	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	And unemployment continues to come down, but it’s clear that now it’s coming down not just because of weak labor force participation.	13	1
201401	1770	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It’s coming down because the economy is strengthening.	13	1
201401	1771	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Obviously, this is good news.	13	1
201401	1772	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	This is sort of in the category of high-class problems.	13	1
201401	1773	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	But—Simon alluded to this—this is, I think, the scenario in which we might want to start wondering about—like the word you used—an “attack” on the forward guidance or a challenge to our forward guidance.	13	1
201401	1774	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Let me see if I can try to be a little clearer on what I see as the nature of the challenge.	13	1
201401	1775	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	First, there’s sort of a hypothetical baseline.	13	1
201401	1776	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Imagine a situation in which we had idealized forward guidance—that is, we had caused the market to fully understand our reaction function.	13	1
201401	1777	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	We had a mind meld with the market.	13	1
201401	1778	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	In that case, good news would put upward pressure on market rates, but it would do it in a way that we’re perfectly comfortable with because, in other words, it’s just the expectations hypothesis combined with the contingent nature of the data.	13	1
201401	1779	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	The expected path of the short-term rate is going up, and it’s just as much as it should.	13	1
201401	1780	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It’s really kind of the automatic-stabilizer thing.	13	1
201401	1781	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	That’s not the scenario to be worried about.	13	1
201401	1782	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	The harder and more realistic situation is one where the market doesn’t really fully understand our reaction function or some people in the market don’t fully understand, and, importantly, there’s scope for divergence of opinion.	13	1
201401	1783	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Different people think about things differently.	13	1
201401	1784	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Note that once we get below an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent, we’ve said qualitative things, but they’re qualitative, and because they’re not completely unambiguous, there has been some mix of economic contingency and time dependence.	13	1
201401	1785	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	We’ve said things like “well past 6.5 percent.”	13	1
201401	1786	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	On top of that, I strongly suspect that whatever we say, there’s at least a subset of people in markets who like to think of things in calendar terms.	13	1
201401	1787	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Whatever we’ve said, they’ve kind of heard third quarter of 2015, and that’s what’s driving the front end of the curve.	13	1
201401	1788	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Just imagine what might happen if we sort of blow through 6.5 percent pretty soon and if we do so on the back of strong GDP growth.	13	1
201401	1789	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Now you’re going to have an obvious tension between those who have heard kind of a calendar message of mid- to late-2015, and those who are thinking in terms of economic conditionality.	13	1
201401	1790	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Again, to be clear, those who have interpreted the message in terms of the calendar may not have been listening correctly, and they may well be in a minority, but they may be the guys who are actually buying bonds and buying bonds with leverage.	13	1
201401	1791	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	So I think there’s really a direct analogy to what we saw in markets with the so-called “taper tantrum” in June, which is that if you get some sort of a run of surprisingly strong news, it brings forward some notion of a day of reckoning.	13	1
201401	1792	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It sort of crushes the guys who have beliefs that are overly optimistic, however they came by it, and then you worry about there being some upward pressure on rates, upward pressure on term premiums.	13	1
201401	1793	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think that’s not helpful to our policy objectives.	13	1
201401	1794	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	That is to say, I think we’re supposed to happily accept whatever increase in long rates comes from a good understanding of a reaction function combined with legitimate good economic news.	13	1
201401	1795	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I don’t think if we get another 100 basis points on the term premium piled on top of that, that’s something we should be happy to accept.	13	1
201401	1796	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	And I think that’s actually kind of a risk to incipient recovery.	13	1
201401	1797	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I don’t think it’s likely to happen, but I don’t think it’s entirely out of the realm of plausibility.	13	1
201401	1798	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	We got 100 basis points or so on the term premium during the tapering episode, and we’re still below a notion of the long- run average level.	13	1
201401	1799	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	So it seems like we could have something.	13	1
201401	1800	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I just put this on the table not because I have an answer to what we should do, but I think it’s useful to think about how we might respond if we get this kind of an upward spike in term premiums.	13	1
201401	1801	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	What would we do?	13	1
201401	1802	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Presumably, we would want to lean against it in some way as we effectively did after the tapering thing in the summer, and there was a big increase in term premiums.	13	1
201401	1803	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	We surprised the market in September by not tapering.	13	1
201401	1804	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	That was arguably the right thing to do, given the change in financial conditions, and maybe we’d want to do something analogous, which in this case would be, all else equal, relative to your reaction function, you would think about delaying liftoff or moving more gradually post-liftoff.	13	1
201401	1805	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	That seems like the right, logical thing to do if you just think of it as an exogenous increase in term premiums much like an exogenous contraction in fiscal policy.	13	1
201401	1806	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	All else equal, that kind of shifts your outlook back and makes you want to be more gradual.	13	1
201401	1807	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think what makes it tricky is I don’t think we’ve necessarily done a very good job of laying out the premise in this case.	13	1
201401	1808	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	In other words, I think we’ve done a pretty good job of laying out the premise—and others have talked about this—if we blow through 6.5 percent because the unemployment rate is not a good measure of slack, because of weak labor force participation.	13	1
201401	1809	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	There I think we’ve kind of laid the groundwork for going more gradually.	13	1
201401	1810	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Or, if inflation is very low, there I think we’ve laid the groundwork.	13	1
201401	1811	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think we haven’t really thought about laying the groundwork for how we respond to a spike in rates.	13	1
201401	1812	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Again, that’s not a prediction; it’s not close to a prediction.	13	1
201401	1813	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	But, as we start moving toward augmenting the guidance, I think it might be worth thinking about that scenario.	13	1
201401	1814	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1815	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1816	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Powell.	13	1
201401	1817	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	13	1
201401	1818	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I will briefly talk about the near-term outlook and then offer some thoughts on the path forward.	13	1
201401	1819	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I have no significant disagreements with the baseline forecast.	13	1
201401	1820	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The fact that the economic growth estimate for the second half of 2013 has been revised up from 2.6 to 3.75 percent is a remarkable markup and most welcome, although some of it does, particularly imports and inventories, feel a little bit one-timey to me.	13	1
201401	1821	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But, still, I would take it as very good news.	13	1
201401	1822	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think most business people that I’ve known in my life would not understand what this revision says about the difficulty of carrying out policy.	13	1
201401	1823	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s as though at year-end, management gets a set of disappointing results.	13	1
201401	1824	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	They’ve missed their sales budget yet again for the nth year in a row, and, as a result, they reorganize the sales force and maybe make some personnel reductions.	13	1
201401	1825	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Then they come back in early January to be told they’ve got a completely different set of numbers.	13	1
201401	1826	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	It turns out we had a great year in the second half of the year.	13	1
201401	1827	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	They’re wondering, “Wait.	13	1
201401	1828	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We have to get those people back.	13	1
201401	1829	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Where did they go?”	13	1
201401	1830	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I guess there’s a cautionary tale in there somewhere, which is probably that when we know that initial reports of incoming data come wrapped in a label that says “Caution: Very high standard errors,” it really does pay to let policy carry forward with some inertia.	13	1
201401	1831	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	On that theory, I do think it’s wise, for the time being, to look past the December employment report, the market turmoil, and other signs of weakness.	13	1
201401	1832	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Bill Dudley may have a point that the weather has been so awful that we could be looking at a few weeks of people not going to restaurants, not going to movies, certainly not looking at houses, and things like that.	13	1
201401	1833	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Still, I’m left with the thought that the case for 3 percent or better economic growth in 2014 overall feels much more plausible now on the back of the strength that the economy has shown.	13	1
201401	1834	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	It also seems wise and conservative to me to allow the medium-term forecast to remain not too much changed despite a 3¾ percent second half of the year.	13	1
201401	1835	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	David Wilcox and others have mentioned some of the factors—stronger dollar, higher rates, and others—that cause us to want to hold back and certainly not increase that.	13	1
201401	1836	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think the wise thing is to wait and see.	13	1
201401	1837	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	With that, I want to briefly comment on rate policy going forward and, really, the issues that we face as a Committee.	13	1
201401	1838	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The Committee is going to be discussing enhancing forward guidance in March, it sounds like, because there’s a good chance that we’ll pass through the unemployment threshold in the very near future.	13	1
201401	1839	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	In thinking about what to tell the market in the near term, it seems to me that some more-fundamental questions arise.	13	1
201401	1840	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The continuing downward adjustments to aggregate supply and the alternative view box underscore that there is real uncertainty about how close the economy is to potential output.	13	1
201401	1841	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	There are plenty of credible people out there who are discussing and arguing this.	13	1
201401	1842	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	John Williams mentioned a couple.	13	1
201401	1843	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	There was some work along the same lines done by members of the Council of Economic Advisers last summer that they shared with us.	13	1
201401	1844	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	One question that arises, and I think this comes through very well in the inflation memo, is, how would we know if we were closer to potential output than we think?	13	1
201401	1845	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Let’s say that the economy performs about as expected, but the economy is significantly closer to potential than the baseline suggests.	13	1
201401	1846	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Will inflation start to send signals to us, or have disinflationary global forces or well-grounded expectations semipermanently muffled the inflation signal?	13	1
201401	1847	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The whole framework for analyzing wage and price increases seems to me to be in question, and so I wonder how confident one can be that inflation would actually respond as predicted if that were the case.	13	1
201401	1848	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	In a way it’s a two-sided problem.	13	1
201401	1849	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We not only don’t know exactly how close we are to potential.	13	1
201401	1850	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We also don’t know whether inflation will react as predicted in the textbooks.	13	1
201401	1851	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	At that point, would asset prices step in to send a signal?	13	1
201401	1852	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	That may very well happen.	13	1
201401	1853	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know that that signal would tell us anything particularly about potential output, although there’s very interesting staff work on that question going on.	13	1
201401	1854	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But independent of the question of how close we are to potential, it is very possible that keeping rates low for another year can provide too much support for asset prices.	13	1
201401	1855	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We have, after all, been very happy to take credit for strong housing and equity prices, appropriately so, and I don’t see any reason to be shy now about the ability of highly accommodative monetary policy to drive prices much, much higher.	13	1
201401	1856	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I also don’t see why highly accommodative monetary policy, particularly if we do have stronger economic growth, couldn’t produce a damaging asset bubble well before the economy reaches full potential.	13	1
201401	1857	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, I don’t argue that we observe that.	13	1
201401	1858	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We clearly don’t observe that on a broad basis, although it is an interesting fact that, as the Monday morning staff briefing showed, spreads for single-B and triple-C bonds have recently approached 15-year lows, which is to say extremely low, lower even than they were in the pre-financial-crisis bubble.	13	1
201401	1859	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The question of how should the Committee react to a world of solid economic growth, low inflation, but high and rising asset prices, presents itself as a possibility—again, not a forecast.	13	1
201401	1860	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	What should the Committee be saying in its public communications about these things beginning, perhaps, in March?	13	1
201401	1861	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	To me, the danger of financial-stability risks comes now as the recovery strengthens, and I don’t know that the current guidance adequately addresses that.	13	1
201401	1862	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Let me also freely admit that the fact that the inflation signal may be broken, it is also broken on the downside.	13	1
201401	1863	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	What makes it so hard is that it may not be sending a signal we’d love for it to send about increasing slack or a higher level of slack.	13	1
201401	1864	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	In any case, it’s great to have the first, and perhaps the second, taper done.	13	1
201401	1865	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	This next round of issues are going to be no less challenging, and I look forward to our discussions.	13	1
201401	1866	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I want to close, Mr Chairman, by thanking you for your extraordinary leadership of this institution and for the great honor of serving with you.	13	1
201401	1867	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you.	13	1
201401	1868	2014-01-29	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201401	1869	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you all.	2	2
201401	1870	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you very much for an interesting discussion.	2	2
201401	1871	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I will spare you my summary, et cetera, until tomorrow morning.	2	2
201401	1872	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It’s 6:05 pm, so why don’t we adjourn for today and go to the reception.	2	2
201401	1873	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We begin tomorrow at 9:00 am January 29 Session .	2	2
201401	1874	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201401	1875	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you very much, again, for last night.	2	2
201401	1876	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Anna and I really appreciated the sendoff and warm wishes.	2	2
201401	1877	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Again, thank you all.	2	2
201401	1878	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I thought I would start with a quick summary of yesterday’s discussion and add a few comments, and then we can turn to the policy go-round.	13	1
201401	1879	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Incoming data have generally been positive, showing strong second-half economic growth.	13	1
201401	1880	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Many saw growth as likely to continue at or above trend.	13	1
201401	1881	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the other hand, inventory investment and a surge in net exports accounted for some of the recent growth and may not persist, and we have seen false dawns before.	13	1
201401	1882	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Although considerable uncertainty remains, risks appear more balanced with respect to economic growth and employment.	13	1
201401	1883	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In the household sector, consumption spending picked up in the latter part of 2013 and should be well supported going forward by growing employment, wages, and net worth.	13	1
201401	1884	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Housing activity continues to be solid in those Districts that reported, with prices moving higher.	13	1
201401	1885	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Commercial real estate is also picking up in some Districts.	13	1
201401	1886	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The December payroll report was surprising and may have been an anomaly or the result of bad weather.	13	1
201401	1887	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Overall, employment conditions appear to be improving, with surveys more optimistic.	13	1
201401	1888	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Participants continued to debate the usefulness of the unemployment rate as a measure of labor market slack.	13	1
201401	1889	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the one hand, declines in participation and increases in underemployment and long-term unemployment suggest that labor slack is greater than the unemployment rate indicates.	13	1
201401	1890	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Indeed, low rates of inflation in prices and wages are consistent with slack putting downward pressure on labor costs.	13	1
201401	1891	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the other hand, it may be that many of the long-term unemployed and those who have left the labor force did not have the skills needed by employers and, thus, are effectively structurally unemployed.	13	1
201401	1892	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In this case, we may already be near effective full employment.	13	1
201401	1893	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	One factor slowing employment growth has been the absence of startups.	13	1
201401	1894	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	This may be changing as increases in net worth facilitate entrepreneurship.	13	1
201401	1895	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Some business contacts were tentatively bullish, seeing higher growth in the medium term.	13	1
201401	1896	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	There were more reports of increased cap-ex and hiring or plans to hire.	13	1
201401	1897	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Declining policy uncertainty may also be helping.	13	1
201401	1898	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	However, some contacts reported that hiring was constrained by the lack of workers with appropriate skills.	13	1
201401	1899	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Strong activity was reported in a number of industries, including railroads and shipping, airlines, tourism, and marijuana growing.	13	1
201401	1900	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Manufacturing indicators are positive.	13	1
201401	1901	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	There were few references this time to fiscal conditions, although one participant noted that some fiscal drag remains.	13	1
201401	1902	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Recent turmoil in emerging markets does not yet appear to be a threat to the US economy, although it bears watching, as contagion can be hard to predict.	13	1
201401	1903	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Another concern is a potential downgrade for Puerto Rico.	13	1
201401	1904	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In the banking sector, deposit growth is outstripping loan growth, with the difference being made up by reserves.	13	1
201401	1905	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Banks do generally see credit metrics improving, however, and more customers are interested in expansion.	13	1
201401	1906	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Inflation remains below target, though relatively stable at that level.	13	1
201401	1907	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Firms don’t have much pricing power, and cost pressures are low and expected to remain low, with a few exceptions, such as the construction industry.	13	1
201401	1908	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Some transitory factors, including low growth in import prices and low rates of health-care inflation, are playing some role in holding inflation down.	13	1
201401	1909	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Overall, most participants expect inflation to move gradually back to target because of the gravitational pull of well-anchored inflation expectations.	13	1
201401	1910	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	However, the heavy reliance on the stability of inflation expectations is somewhat worrisome, in that we don’t have a good understanding of how expectations themselves are determined.	13	1
201401	1911	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the policy front, upcoming possible challenges include managing the forward guidance as the economy strengthens and we pass through the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold, as well as dealing with possible increases in term premiums or bubbles in asset prices even as unemployment remains high and inflation low.	13	1
201401	1912	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s a quick summary.	13	1
201401	1913	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any reactions or comments?	13	1
201401	1914	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	13	1
201401	1915	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me just make a few comments, which mostly play off things that I heard yesterday around the table.	13	1
201401	1916	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Like everyone here, I am happy to see the stronger economic growth in the second half of last year.	13	1
201401	1917	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the one hand, a number of people noted that there were some temporary components to that—inventories and the like.	13	1
201401	1918	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the other hand, it should be pointed out that the shutdown and government spending reductions were a negative temporary component.	13	1
201401	1919	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If you look at private domestic final purchases, those grew at about a 3½ percent rate in real terms in the second half.	13	1
201401	1920	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s an indicator, I think, that the level is sustainable, and it does suggest that there was some pickup in growth, pending measurement problems, of course.	13	1
201401	1921	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I am hopeful that we might see 3 percent growth in 2014.	13	1
201401	1922	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That would be based mostly on, first, the reduction in fiscal restraint, but primarily on household spending.	13	1
201401	1923	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The Vice Chairman briefly mentioned the ratio of wealth to disposable income.	13	1
201401	1924	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That is currently about 6.2, which is higher than at any time during the 1990s and almost as high as it was prior to the crisis.	13	1
201401	1925	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	With the saving rate high and interest rates low, that does suggest, on the one hand, that there is some potential for consumption to grow more quickly than income for a while, which would, obviously, be supportive of aggregate demand.	13	1
201401	1926	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the other hand, one difference between now and the ’90s and early 2000s is that consumers remain cautious.	13	1
201401	1927	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The most recent Conference Board report before yesterday showed that equal numbers of respondents thought that their nominal income would rise as thought that their nominal income would fall in the next six months.	13	1
201401	1928	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The report yesterday was just a little more optimistic than that, but not markedly so.	13	1
201401	1929	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So we have a household sector that is in reasonably good shape financially but remains cautious.	13	1
201401	1930	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We will see how that plays out.	13	1
201401	1931	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	There wasn’t much discussion yesterday of housing, and I would just like to say that I think there are some concerns there.	13	1
201401	1932	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It’s a little surprising that it’s been as choppy as it has been, given that mortgage rates do remain very low in absolute terms, affordability remains good, and the demographic need for housing, obviously, is strong.	13	1
201401	1933	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I think that bears watching.	13	1
201401	1934	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	One possible concern is that investors played a big role in housing demand in 2013, and they are no longer as interested.	13	1
201401	1935	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So then it’s possible that some of the constraints on borrowing may be beginning to bite more sharply.	13	1
201401	1936	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s an area that I have some concerns about.	13	1
201401	1937	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The labor market discussion was very interesting.	13	1
201401	1938	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Without going into all of the details, let me just draw a quantitative conclusion from the discussion in the box in Tealbook A, about the possibility that we are now already close to full employment.	13	1
201401	1939	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That perspective says, basically, that the long-term unemployed and those out of the labor force are no longer effectively putting any pressure on wages, for example.	13	1
201401	1940	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	A consequence of that, just to put some numbers on it, is that if you add together the number of long-term unemployed with those who are not in the labor force but who say they want a job now—so we are excluding the retired, the disabled, and people currently in school—that comes to about 10 million people.	13	1
201401	1941	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Those same two categories added up to 6 million at the peak of the business cycle, so there are about 4 million additional people now who say they want to be working and, by this theory, are structurally unemployed.	13	1
201401	1942	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s about 2.7 percent of the labor force of 150 million.	13	1
201401	1943	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In addition, the number of people who are working part time for economic reasons has risen from 4.6 million in 2007 to 7.8 million—that’s another 3 million people.	13	1
201401	1944	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So, roughly speaking, an implication of this Tealbook box story is that in the past seven years, somewhere between 2½ and 5 percent of the labor force has become structurally unemployed, which, if true, is a tragedy, of course, as we have lost a huge amount of labor resources.	13	1
201401	1945	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Now, it seems implausible to me that that number of people would become structurally unemployed because of skills mismatch and changes in industrial composition, et cetera, in such a period of time.	13	1
201401	1946	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I don’t think that that’s what’s happening.	13	1
201401	1947	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If there is a case for the Tealbook box, it is that the length of time out of work has led to atrophy of skills and lack of labor-force attachment, and that’s what’s causing the problem, in which case I think that from a policy point of view this cuts both ways.	13	1
201401	1948	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the one hand, if these people really are irredeemable, then there’s not much we can do about it, as sad as it may be.	13	1
201401	1949	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	On the other hand, if the issue really is giving them a chance to get back into work and reacquire experience and skills, that would actually be an argument for more forceful policy.	13	1
201401	1950	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The main point I want to draw here is that this is a very important debate.	13	1
201401	1951	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It does have very important quantitative implications for the labor force and for the future of our economy.	13	1
201401	1952	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I have just a couple more observations.	13	1
201401	1953	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	There was some discussion of our forward guidance and modifications to it, which I’m sure will be a subject of much discussion around this table in coming meetings.	13	1
201401	1954	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I do think that, although our guidance is not the most beautiful thing in the world aesthetically, it is working pretty well.	13	1
201401	1955	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	And the reason I think it is working is that it really has, at this point, three prongs.	13	1
201401	1956	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	First, there is the “well past” the 6.5 percent unemployment rate, and the markets do seem to think of that “well past” as meaning two or three quarters, roughly.	13	1
201401	1957	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That takes you to somewhere in the middle of 2015.	13	1
201401	1958	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Second, there is the inflation criterion, especially if projected inflation remains below target.	13	1
201401	1959	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Given inflation’s continual low level, that is another factor.	13	1
201401	1960	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	And then, finally, there is the pattern we have begun, though we may not continue it, of measured reductions in asset purchases.	13	1
201401	1961	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Given our statement that we will not raise rates until a considerable period after that program has ended, that is also creating an implication of somewhere in 2015.	13	1
201401	1962	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So we have a number of pillars in this guidance at this point, which I think is what’s keeping it pretty well tied down.	13	1
201401	1963	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That being said, obviously, you will want to clean it up and provide additional explanation.	13	1
201401	1964	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	But for the moment, I think it’s working okay.	13	1
201401	1965	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I do have a reaction to comments of Governor Stein and Governor Powell about some of the risks going forward, and particularly the risk of asset bubbles.	13	1
201401	1966	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I am hopeful that we will escape that risk.	13	1
201401	1967	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	In fact, rates have already come up some, and on the current schedule—which, of course, is very tentative—it’s only a year to 18 months before a rate-increase process begins.	13	1
201401	1968	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That being said, I think that one area to which the System ought to be giving more thought is the area of macroprudential tools.	13	1
201401	1969	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We have talked a lot about that as a potential first or second line of defense.	13	1
201401	1970	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Stan Fischer has used some of those tools in Israel.	13	1
201401	1971	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	When he gets here, I am hopeful that that will be something the Committee will look at, because I agree with the premise of Governor Powell’s statement that it would be a shame if financial considerations led us to tighten policy before we attained our macro objectives.	13	1
201401	1972	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So those are just a few observations.	13	1
201401	1973	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If there are no reactions, let me then turn to the next item, which is the monetary policy discussion, and ask Bill English to introduce it.	21	2
201401	1974	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	21	2
201401	1975	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201401	1976	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The top-left panel of page 1 shows the median dealer projection for the path of SOMA holdings from the most recent primary dealer survey (the black solid line) as well as the staff’s projections under the three policy alternatives shown in the Tealbook.	21	2
201401	1977	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The median dealer forecast for total SOMA holdings is now essentially the same as the staff’s projection under alternative B.	21	2
201401	1978	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown to the right, the median dealer path for purchases shifted down some since the December meeting but also extends somewhat further into the fall than in December.	21	2
201401	1979	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Consistent with the “measured pace” language in the December statement, nearly all dealers expect the Committee to reduce purchases by $10 billion (split evenly between Treasury and MBS) at every meeting through September, and a majority see a final reduction from $15 billion to zero at the October meeting.	21	2
201401	1980	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The middle-left panel shows that dealer expectations for the path of the funds rate have edged up a bit since December; however, the perceived probability that the unemployment rate will be less than 6 percent at liftoff, shown in the right panel, also increased, likely reflecting both the lower-than-expected December unemployment rate reading and the enhanced forward guidance in the previous statement.	21	2
201401	1981	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Indeed, with the unemployment rate now close to the Committee’s 6.5 percent threshold, the dealers see significant odds of further changes to the forward guidance.	21	2
201401	1982	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As shown in the lower left panel, dealers see as most likely additional guidance regarding the information the Committee considers relevant to determining the appropriate timing of the first rate hike once the unemployment threshold is crossed.	21	2
201401	1983	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Guidance indicating an increased focus on the importance of inflation in considering possible adjustments to the federal funds rate was a close second.	21	2
201401	1984	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Moving to the right, the dealers see the March meeting as the most likely time for a change in the forward guidance; they seem to think that a change would likely come at a meeting with a press conference, presumably on the view that the press conference could be used to provide additional information about the new guidance.	21	2
201401	1985	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	With regard to the alternatives for this meeting, alternative B, on page 6, announces another modest reduction in the pace of asset purchases, indicates that further measured reductions are likely, and repeats the forward guidance for the funds rate in the December statement.	21	2
201401	1986	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	This combination may appeal to those of you who see the economy evolving largely as you had expected at the time of the December meeting, notwithstanding the recent disappointing reading on payroll employment.	21	2
201401	1987	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative B characterizes growth in economic activity as having “picked up in recent quarters,” while noting that labor market indicators were mixed.	21	2
201401	1988	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	It also points to the acceleration in consumer and business spending and states more emphatically that fiscal restraint “is diminishing.”	21	2
201401	1989	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The second paragraph points to “moderate” economic growth going forward; that characterization suggests that you do not see economic growth picking up further from its pace in the second half of last year.	21	2
201401	1990	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The statement also indicates that risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market are “nearly balanced,” while continuing to note the need to monitor inflation developments carefully.	21	2
201401	1991	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph announces a $5 billion reduction each in the monthly pace of Treasury security and MBS purchases beginning in February.	21	2
201401	1992	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The guidance on future policy decisions with respect to the balance sheet and the path of the funds rate in the fourth and fifth paragraphs is essentially unchanged.	21	2
201401	1993	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Because market expectations appear to be well aligned with an outcome like alternative B, such an announcement seems likely to prompt little reaction in asset markets.	21	2
201401	1994	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Alternative C, on page 8, may appeal to policymakers who judge that continuing asset purchases for as long as envisioned in alternative B would pose unacceptable risks to inflation or financial stability.	21	2
201401	1995	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Accordingly, they may prefer to announce a larger reduction in the pace of purchases at this meeting and to signal that further reductions are likely, while making no change to the forward guidance for the funds rate in the December statement.	21	2
201401	1996	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative C is somewhat more upbeat about the labor market, and it focuses more on unchanged inflation expectations relative to the recent behavior of actual inflation.	21	2
201401	1997	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Paragraph 2 also suggests somewhat less concern about low inflation readings by stating that the Committee “continues to anticipate that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.”	21	2
201401	1998	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph announces reductions of $10 billion each in the monthly pace of Treasury security and MBS purchases beginning in February; the fourth paragraph removes the words “measured steps” from the forward guidance about asset purchases, suggesting that the larger reductions at this meeting could be the norm as you go forward.	21	2
201401	1999	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The forward guidance on the federal funds rate in paragraph 5 is unchanged.	21	2
201401	2000	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Market participants firmly anticipate reductions of $5 billion each in purchases of Treasuries and of MBS at this meeting, and so the adoption of alternative C would be a considerable surprise, particularly in light of the recent volatility in emerging markets.	21	2
201401	2001	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	As a result, investors might come to expect a faster wind-down of the asset purchase program and, given the more upbeat tone of the first two paragraphs, could also pull in the anticipated timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate.	21	2
201401	2002	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Interest rates would likely rise, equity prices decline, and the dollar appreciate.	21	2
201401	2003	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Finally, turning to alternative A, on page 4, some Committee participants may see the recent mixed labor market data and low inflation readings as indicating that it is too soon to conclude that progress toward the Committee’s goals will be sustained.	21	2
201401	2004	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	They may also continue to see downside risks to the economic outlook, perhaps in part as a result of recent global financial developments.	21	2
201401	2005	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Thus, they may not only want to continue the current pace of asset purchases for now, in order to collect additional information on the economic and financial outlook, but also seek to strengthen the post-threshold forward guidance with the addition of a second set of quantitative thresholds.	21	2
201401	2006	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first paragraph of alternative A is similar to its counterpart in alternative B but expresses a little more concern about inflation.	21	2
201401	2007	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The second paragraph notes that risks to the outlook are “nearly balanced,” but it goes on to say that they are “still tilted slightly to the downside.”	21	2
201401	2008	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The third paragraph indicates that the recent information about labor market conditions and inflation led the Committee to judge that a further reduction in the pace of asset purchases was not warranted at this meeting.	21	2
201401	2009	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	However, the fourth paragraph continues to suggest that if the economy develops as the Committee anticipates, then the pace of purchases likely will be reduced in measured steps at future meetings, and again notes that purchases are not on a preset course.	21	2
201401	2010	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The fifth paragraph provides more-specific information on the labor market indicators the Committee will consider when judging how long to maintain the current federal funds rate target after the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, and it offers two options for quantitative post-threshold forward guidance.	21	2
201401	2011	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	The first indicates that the Committee anticipates maintaining the current target for the federal funds rate at least until the unemployment rate declines below 6 percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below 2 percent; the second employs a 5½ percent unemployment rate threshold, but only “so long as” projected inflation runs below 2 percent.	21	2
201401	2012	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	A decision to leave the pace of purchases unchanged and to make further enhancements to the forward guidance at today’s meeting would greatly surprise investors.	21	2
201401	2013	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Interest rates would likely decline and the foreign exchange value of the dollar fall, while equity prices might rise.	21	2
201401	2014	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Draft directives for each of the alternatives are presented on pages 11 through 13 of your handout.	21	2
201401	2015	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	21	2
201401	2016	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	That completes my prepared remarks.	21	2
201401	2017	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	21	2
201401	2018	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any questions for Bill?	22	2
201401	2019	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	22	2
201401	2020	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Seeing none, we can begin our policy go-round with President Rosengren.	23	2
201401	2021	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2022	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I pointed out yesterday, because of the significant uncertainties about how to interpret recent data, a strong case can be made for alternative A.	23	2
201401	2023	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	With inflation low, we have the ability to more quickly reduce the still-very-high unemployment rate by providing significant monetary accommodation.	23	2
201401	2024	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Despite the recent reduction in the unemployment rate, it still takes too long to reach full employment, given that inflation is forecast to be below our target throughout the forecast period.	23	2
201401	2025	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But given the decision at our previous meeting to place us on a path of measured reductions in the purchase program, though I personally would have preferred to wait, I can support alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201401	2026	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, I would note that the fact that we are not pausing despite a weak labor market report, recent correlated stock market declines globally, and persistently low inflation rates implies a very high hurdle for pausing on the path of very gradual reductions in the purchase program.	23	2
201401	2027	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But if there is a very high hurdle for stopping or slowing the taper, there should then be a very high hurdle for tapering more quickly.	23	2
201401	2028	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yesterday I highlighted the uncertainty surrounding the identification of cyclical versus trend movements in the data.	23	2
201401	2029	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Perhaps the most tenuous interpretation involves inflation.	23	2
201401	2030	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Were emerging market problems to more significantly slow the economy, I am worried that our faith in expectations anchoring could be severely tested.	23	2
201401	2031	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We could face a deflationary or near- deflationary environment that would require even-more-aggressive policy responses.	23	2
201401	2032	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In essence, my concern is about risk management.	23	2
201401	2033	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the difficulties in separating trend from cycle in the data and the potential for new shocks emanating from outside the United States, we should be quite sure that the economy is on much stronger footing and that the inflation rate is clearly returning toward target before altering our current path of very gradual changes in our purchase program.	23	2
201401	2034	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2035	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2036	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lockhart.	23	2
201401	2037	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2038	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I support the policy decisions in alternative B and the statement language as drafted.	23	2
201401	2039	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I am comfortable with taking the second tapering step, and I am also comfortable with the conclusion that the public and markets will likely form that $10 billion per meeting is the baseline intention of the Committee.	23	2
201401	2040	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I would like to make a few comments regarding communications challenges ahead.	23	2
201401	2041	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent, I anticipate increasing public pressure for more information on what “well past 6½ percent” means.	23	2
201401	2042	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And considering the proximity of the 6½ percent unemployment marker, we know the statement is going to have to change before long.	23	2
201401	2043	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We can see that coming.	23	2
201401	2044	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We should think now as a Committee about the language to use once we get to 6½ percent.	23	2
201401	2045	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	On those questions, I am reluctant to put down another unemployment rate marker, as in alternative A.	23	2
201401	2046	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I would prefer to keep our explanation of the Committee’s reaction function post-6½ percent more qualitative than quantitative, if that can be done.	23	2
201401	2047	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said yesterday in the economy go-round, I think a falling unemployment rate may be less reflective than we would like of increasingly satisfactory conditions in the labor market when you view it holistically.	23	2
201401	2048	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In my view, we just don’t fully understand the factors driving the decline in the unemployment rate.	23	2
201401	2049	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As the staff memo points out, the data on the inflows to and outflows from the labor market within demographic groups do not speak very loudly on the separation of structural from cyclical factors.	23	2
201401	2050	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As a result, I think there is more uncertainty than usual about the path of the unemployment rate, about how much of the decline reflects reduction in slack, and about what level of the rate per se is consistent with full employment.	23	2
201401	2051	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I recognize that resorting to a qualitative characterization of the conditions that would prompt liftoff carries risks.	23	2
201401	2052	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Reliance on qualitative statements that are open to interpretation, both within and outside the Committee, risks some confusion and volatility in trading markets.	23	2
201401	2053	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	To deal with the risks associated with qualitative guidance, I think we should consider less relative reliance on the statement in communications over the coming meetings and more weight on other communications methods in our arsenal—namely, the SEP, press conferences, and the minutes.	23	2
201401	2054	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think there might be value in reopening the question of enhancements to the SEP.	23	2
201401	2055	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I will also support the suggestion of President Bullard, I believe, and others to go to press conferences every meeting supported by refreshed SEPs.	23	2
201401	2056	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I say that with considerable empathy for our new Chair [laughter], given the singular and concentrated burden of press conferences.	23	2
201401	2057	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The Committee has time to deliberate about the design of a communication strategy around the coming meetings.	23	2
201401	2058	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I am raising the issue now to urge work on these concerns, I hope, well before we get to the “well past” period.	23	2
201401	2059	2014-01-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2060	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well before “well past.”	23	2
201401	2061	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	23	2
201401	2062	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	23	2
201401	2063	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2064	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I can support alternative B today, but I do think, as President Lockhart suggested, and as Governor Stein suggested yesterday, that one of the things that we need to be doing is looking beyond the decision today to the challenges, particularly communication challenges, we are going to face in coming meetings.	23	2
201401	2065	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the challenge is going to be, at least, that there is a reasonable likelihood that our 6½ percent threshold will probably be met sooner than we originally anticipated.	23	2
201401	2066	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	There could be a challenge if we reach that threshold and are still in a position of trying to ease policy by continuing to purchase assets.	23	2
201401	2067	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We will not have completed the asset purchase program by then.	23	2
201401	2068	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that is going to present us with some challenges for communication.	23	2
201401	2069	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	And, indeed, while there are risks that things could turn bad again, there are also risks that things could turn much better faster than we anticipate.	23	2
201401	2070	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think we have to worry about that as well.	23	2
201401	2071	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	To put it a different way, suppose the alternative scenario offered in the Tealbook comes to pass.	23	2
201401	2072	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Suppose the forecast turns out to be somewhat better than the Tealbook forecast.	23	2
201401	2073	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	What kind of policy and communications will we have to engage in at that time?	23	2
201401	2074	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	They could be quite complicated.	23	2
201401	2075	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think that we need to be thinking ahead about how our communications and policies will react in those circumstances.	23	2
201401	2076	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	In particular, I think that if we are still buying assets when we reach the 6½ percent threshold, we face two sorts of problems.	23	2
201401	2077	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Some may say, “Well, there actually is no conflict because we haven’t said we would do anything at 6½ percent, so we will continue to buy assets and we will not raise rates.”	23	2
201401	2078	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But I think the language in the statement is going to prove to be problematic.	23	2
201401	2079	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	We have placed a lot of emphasis in our statements on both the unemployment rate and the labor market in particular.	23	2
201401	2080	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	One of the risks we face is that—as President Williams said yesterday, and others of us have said—if in fact the unemployment rate turns out to be a better summary statistic for labor market conditions than we have been assuming, then we are going to find ourselves in a difficult position where we are putting too much weight on labor market conditions.	23	2
201401	2081	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I actually think that the better argument for keeping rates low longer, so to speak, is low inflation, not necessarily the unemployment problem or the labor markets.	23	2
201401	2082	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So one thing we need to begin thinking about is how to perhaps shift the emphasis in our language about the reasons that we may not want to raise rates.	23	2
201401	2083	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Now, having said that, I would also note that if you look at the various rules put together in the Tealbook, by the second quarter of this year, for all but the nominal income targeting rule, we are no longer constrained by the zero bound.	23	2
201401	2084	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Rates are positive in almost all those rules except for one in the second quarter.	23	2
201401	2085	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I would also add that most of those rules don’t rely on the unemployment rate.	23	2
201401	2086	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	They are looking at the staff’s measure of output gaps.	23	2
201401	2087	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Clearly those are related in some sense, but they are not necessarily driven by the unemployment rate per se.	23	2
201401	2088	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	So I think we will find ourselves in a position in which the rules are telling us we’re not constrained by the zero bound.	23	2
201401	2089	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	How are we going to behave?	23	2
201401	2090	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	That is going to present some communications challenges for us, and even though inflation will be low, the zero bound won’t be binding any longer.	23	2
201401	2091	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Again, I think this will be a communications challenge, and it’s important for us to anticipate now how we will deal with that.	23	2
201401	2092	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Our statement has become very complex, with many moving parts, and I think we need to seriously consider revising the statement going forward.	23	2
201401	2093	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	If the forecast continues to play out as in the Tealbook, or somewhere between that and the alternative scenario, I think we may face a challenge, and I would be inclined to encourage speeding up the pace of tapering if that scenario comes to pass.	23	2
201401	2094	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	To summarize, I want to encourage that we not just think about what we will do if things get worse—we need to think about what we’ll do if things get better than we anticipated and what kind of language we will use or what kind of actions we will take in those circumstances.	23	2
201401	2095	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2096	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2097	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Evans.	23	2
201401	2098	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2099	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2100	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I think a further $10 billion reduction in our purchase rate is appropriate, especially given all of our communications at this point.	23	2
201401	2101	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We will have more data in March, and we can further assess the appropriateness of this measured pace of reductions at that time.	23	2
201401	2102	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Currently, I do expect that we’ll probably continue to make $10 billion reductions at these meetings at least through June.	23	2
201401	2103	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That seems appropriate and consistent with our communications so far.	23	2
201401	2104	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	There should be a high hurdle for pausing, in view of the improvement in economic growth that we’ve seen in the second half of last year.	23	2
201401	2105	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	But I do think that our ultimate focus should be on goal-oriented monetary policy.	23	2
201401	2106	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	As the unemployment rate gradually falls, we need to see inflation increase to the target.	23	2
201401	2107	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We need for it to be more than just a forecast.	23	2
201401	2108	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We need to actually see it begin to increase, and, frankly, I think we probably would benefit from slightly overshooting that inflation objective.	23	2
201401	2109	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That comes out of a lot of economic analyses about the most appropriate monetary policies, and I don’t think that’s something that we should fear.	23	2
201401	2110	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In fact, it could help solidify longer-term inflation expectations at our goal rate of 2 percent.	23	2
201401	2111	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	At some point we’re going to have to actually deliver on that, or else we risk a Japanese-type lack of a relationship between long-term expectations and actual inflation.	23	2
201401	2112	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I think it’s important to demonstrate that our inflation objective is not a ceiling, and, again, a slight overshoot without a lot of dithering about it could help reinforce that.	23	2
201401	2113	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s not a critical element, but it could be beneficial for vanquishing the zero-lower-bound demons that we might be facing.	23	2
201401	2114	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Mr Chairman, I agree with your commentary about the current configuration of our statement.	23	2
201401	2115	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Communications do seem to indicate that the funds rate will most likely stay at zero into 2015.	23	2
201401	2116	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I think that it’s a useful package.	23	2
201401	2117	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Still, as the unemployment rate falls to 6½ percent, we’re going to have more challenges to the interpretation of our forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2118	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We’re going to have to take further consideration of that.	23	2
201401	2119	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	A 6½ percent unemployment rate is certainly better than the 8 percent that we were looking at back in September 2012 when we undertook those actions, but we shouldn’t forget that 6½ percent is still a very high number, associated typically with a nasty, recession-level outcome.	23	2
201401	2120	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So we shouldn’t pat ourselves on the back too much just because we’re getting that, especially when inflation is at 1 percent and it’s been low for quite some time.	23	2
201401	2121	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We need to somehow better describe our reaction-function relationships among inflation, labor variables, and GDP growth.	23	2
201401	2122	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That will continue to be a challenge for us in terms of when the liftoff will be.	23	2
201401	2123	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	As President Lockhart mentioned, I suspect that a qualitative description is probably what we’re headed for as a consensus.	23	2
201401	2124	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I do think that it is going to feel squishy when we get there.	23	2
201401	2125	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	It might be the best that we can do, but we won’t be completely satisfied with that.	23	2
201401	2126	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I want to address a couple of things that were mentioned before my commentary.	23	2
201401	2127	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	On the possibility that we could use SEP enhancements to help provide more guidance on our confusion—communication [laughter]—that was totally Freudian, because it is confused.	23	2
201401	2128	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I think we’re going to be disappointed when we go about trying to enhance our SEPs as a communications vehicle.	23	2
201401	2129	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The consensus-forecast exercise was just thoroughly discouraging to me.	23	2
201401	2130	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s the kind of thing that we would really like to have—a more unified assessment of our forecast—and we could not even agree on the right assumptions that we would jointly carry around in order to get to a forecast.	23	2
201401	2131	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	So I’m not optimistic that we’re going to be successful.	23	2
201401	2132	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	When we have to come back to the appropriate monetary policy assumption, that’s going to garble the different policy assumptions that each of us are making but end up producing similar outcomes, and I’ve never been able to figure out how the public is going to disentangle that usefully.	23	2
201401	2133	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	We really need to do an awful lot of work.	23	2
201401	2134	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Perhaps Stan Fischer, the Board’s incoming vice chair, could help dramatically cut some type of Gordian knot.	23	2
201401	2135	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t know.	23	2
201401	2136	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	And finally, President Plosser mentioned the rules in the Tealbook, and I think that it is quite instructive to always be reminded of what the rules are telling us about monetary policy.	23	2
201401	2137	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Yet I wonder if they are somewhat outdated or exactly how they are relevant.	23	2
201401	2138	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In particular, I think we need to have more discussion about what the intercept term is in those rules, because historically they’ve just been plunked down.	23	2
201401	2139	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	In 1993, John Taylor just said 2 percent for the real rate, 2 percent for inflation, and one-half on weights for the output and inflation gaps.	23	2
201401	2140	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	And it kind of fit, over a short period of time.	23	2
201401	2141	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	But is the equilibrium real rate really 2 percent?	23	2
201401	2142	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Is that the right intercept level?	23	2
201401	2143	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Why is that the case?	23	2
201401	2144	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	The funds rate is really a different object than a longer-term interest rate.	23	2
201401	2145	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Mehra and Prescott told us back in 1985 that part of the equity- premium puzzle was due to the extraordinarily low historical short-term Treasury safe rates that are well under 2 percent in real terms.	23	2
201401	2146	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	I think we just need to understand that rate’s relevance for the current period before we put too much weight on it.	23	2
201401	2147	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Having said that, they are useful benchmarks, and we should always be reminded of them.	23	2
201401	2148	2014-01-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2149	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2150	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Bullard.	23	2
201401	2151	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2152	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I have just a few brief comments on challenges beyond today for this Committee.	23	2
201401	2153	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think the key issue for the Committee, as outlined yesterday in our remarks about the economy, is whether this is a false dawn or not.	23	2
201401	2154	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Obviously we’ve had a lot of stops and starts during the past several years.	23	2
201401	2155	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I thought President Lacker did a good job of outlining the case that some of the economic growth we’ve seen might be temporary.	23	2
201401	2156	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	If it is a false dawn, I think the Committee is actually well positioned.	23	2
201401	2157	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is the mindset that we’ve had in designing current policy.	23	2
201401	2158	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We have a leisurely tapering baseline, I would say.	23	2
201401	2159	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We have expectations of the first increase of the policy rate far in the future, and we have a tapering program that’s state contingent, so we can alter it if necessary.	23	2
201401	2160	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I think we’re well positioned in the case of economic growth slowing from the pace that it hit in the second half of 2013.	23	2
201401	2161	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to concentrate on the other case—What if this is not a false dawn, if it’s the real thing?—and follow up on some of Governor Stein’s comments yesterday and President Plosser’s comments earlier this morning.	23	2
201401	2162	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’re less well positioned for this case.	23	2
201401	2163	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Probably our best response in this case would be to increase the pace of tapering, but this would, in effect, pull up the entire time line of the first policy rate increase.	23	2
201401	2164	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	That would be okay if it was warranted by stronger data, but that’s what we would be doing in that situation.	23	2
201401	2165	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let’s suppose we do not face a false dawn.	23	2
201401	2166	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Instead we face the real thing, a faster economy that is on a sustainable growth path.	23	2
201401	2167	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	My main comment is going to be to outline my version of a key challenge for the Committee in this scenario in 2014, which is the possible emergence of the idea that the FOMC is “behind the curve.”	23	2
201401	2168	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	President Plosser has noted yesterday and today that our suite of Taylor-type rules now suggests that the policy rate should be rising off zero either now or in the near future.	23	2
201401	2169	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to take that as a key fact because I take these Taylor-type rules to describe normal FOMC behavior as characterized by the research literature.	23	2
201401	2170	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So let’s divide the period of a near-zero policy rate into two parts.	23	2
201401	2171	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The first part is the one in which the actual policy rate is near zero and Taylor-type rules also recommend zero.	23	2
201401	2172	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is the world that we’ve been in over the past several years, and this is what we’re used to thinking about recently.	23	2
201401	2173	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	And then there’s a different world, in which the actual policy rate is near zero, but the Taylor-type rules recommend more than zero, which is what we’re entering into now.	23	2
201401	2174	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	In previous discussions around the table here, I’ve called this second part the “Woodford period.”	23	2
201401	2175	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’re now entering this Woodford period, and I see it as a very challenging period for the Committee.	23	2
201401	2176	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	During the pre-Woodford period, we made promises to keep the policy rate lower for longer.	23	2
201401	2177	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	One interpretation of those promises, and maybe the one I favor, is that they did not represent a credible commitment by this Committee to keep rates lower for longer.	23	2
201401	2178	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Instead, these promises were interpreted by financial markets as representing a pessimistic outlook for medium-term macroeconomic prospects in the United States.	23	2
201401	2179	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Financial markets expected rates to remain low, indeed, but only because the economy was expected to remain weak.	23	2
201401	2180	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This created an equilibrium of sorts between the Committee and financial markets.	23	2
201401	2181	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve been in this equilibrium—a word I use loosely here—for some time.	23	2
201401	2182	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Now we’re going to move into the Woodford period, and such an interpretation by financial markets will no longer be possible.	23	2
201401	2183	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Taylor-type rules representing so-called normal Fed behavior will call for a higher policy rate than what’s observed.	23	2
201401	2184	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee intends to keep the policy rate low.	23	2
201401	2185	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee will, exactly at this point—that is, in 2014—begin to gain credibility for its lower-for-longer policy.	23	2
201401	2186	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	This may, in fact, feed a boom in the US economy.	23	2
201401	2187	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The way this is supposed to work in the Woodford model is that you made the promise a long time ago, three years ago, and you got a boom three years ago because you made that promise.	23	2
201401	2188	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m arguing that that promise wasn’t credible.	23	2
201401	2189	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	It was interpreted as a pessimistic outlook for the US economy.	23	2
201401	2190	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	But now, when Taylor rules are diverging from what we’re actually doing with the policy rate, financial markets are going to say, “Well, they really do mean to stay lower for longer,” and the boom will come today instead of when it was supposed to come three years ago.	23	2
201401	2191	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Financial markets’ interpretation of what we’re doing is going to have to change in 2014.	23	2
201401	2192	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Likely what they will do is argue that the FOMC is “behind the curve,” which is a typical thing that occurs in financial markets, and they’ll just point to simple evidence that the Committee isn’t following Taylor-type rules that are calling for higher policy rates.	23	2
201401	2193	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So it’s going to sound like past episodes in which the FOMC has lagged behind where markets thought it should be.	23	2
201401	2194	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think this is possibly a major challenge for the Committee in 2014.	23	2
201401	2195	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee will need to have a story to counteract this.	23	2
201401	2196	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	There are simple stories that can be told.	23	2
201401	2197	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	You can lean against the economic data.	23	2
201401	2198	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	You can argue that the economic data aren’t as strong as they appear to be, that the economy is actually weaker than the markets think it is, and you can have that debate with financial markets.	23	2
201401	2199	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s fine, but that gets difficult at some point if the data really are coming in stronger than anticipated.	23	2
201401	2200	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	There’s only so far you can go in making that kind of argument.	23	2
201401	2201	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Another argument that we could make is that this is a Woodford follow-through.	23	2
201401	2202	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We made a commitment to “lower for longer.”	23	2
201401	2203	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	That means that the reason we’re keeping policy rates low today is to make up for the period when we were constrained by the zero bound.	23	2
201401	2204	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do not see enough consensus on the Committee to make that argument, but that is one argument that could be made.	23	2
201401	2205	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I don’t think we really have a good plan right now about how we’re going to handle this in 2014, and we need to think about this.	23	2
201401	2206	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We need to hone our message during coming meetings to handle this possibility.	23	2
201401	2207	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Of course, this is all under the scenario in which economic growth is actually faster and sustainably faster, not under a scenario in which the economy slows down again.	23	2
201401	2208	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	By the way, I think low inflation is helpful.	23	2
201401	2209	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	It does give us some cover, and that’s a big advantage for us, but I would remind everybody that inflation is actually included in the Taylor- type rules.	23	2
201401	2210	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So the fact that those rules are calling for liftoff already incorporates the fact that inflation is somewhat away from our target on the low side.	23	2
201401	2211	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I just wanted to reiterate that point in a way that I hope was more coherent than I usually am.	23	2
201401	2212	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	And for today, Mr Chairman, I support option B as written.	23	2
201401	2213	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do think we’re on a reasonable course for now, and we’ll await more information to see whether the false dawn scenario yet again haunts us.	23	2
201401	2214	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2215	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2216	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Williams.	23	2
201401	2217	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2218	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2219	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In December, we took our first step on the road toward ending our purchase program, and alternative B continues on this road at a steady pace consistent with the improving economy.	23	2
201401	2220	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Alternative B also follows through on the state-contingent plan we laid out in December.	23	2
201401	2221	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Markets weren’t disrupted by our plan, in part because we successfully communicated that tapering purchases didn’t mean we were in a hurry to raise the funds rate.	23	2
201401	2222	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Market perceptions regarding asset purchases and the future funds rate path are currently well aligned with our own.	23	2
201401	2223	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On specifics of language, I find that in the second sentence of paragraph 1 it’s simply too negative to say that labor market indicators were mixed.	23	2
201401	2224	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, essentially all indicators continue to show improvement.	23	2
201401	2225	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Payroll gains were a disappointment, of course, but the Tealbook discounts their signal while noting that the disappointing gains were nonetheless consistent with, and I quote, “some improvement in labor markets.”	23	2
201401	2226	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I recommend we replace the second sentence with the following: “On balance, labor market conditions have shown further improvement.”	23	2
201401	2227	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it is more accurate, and it avoids the risk of being misinterpreted.	23	2
201401	2228	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like President Evans and many others, I agree with you that our forward guidance has been very successful, but clearly paragraph 5 is about to reach its expiration date in the reference to 6½ percent unemployment.	23	2
201401	2229	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The quantitative forward guidance in that paragraph as amended and bolstered with strong qualitative post-threshold guidance has succeeded in bringing market expectations about liftoff into alignment with our own views, but much of this paragraph is written with explicit or implicit reference to the 6½ percent threshold.	23	2
201401	2230	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And I just want to mention that we could easily reach that threshold very soon.	23	2
201401	2231	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Perhaps we actually already have, once we’ve seen the January data.	23	2
201401	2232	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I think we need to rewrite the forward guidance for the post-threshold world as soon as possible.	23	2
201401	2233	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I agreed with President Lockhart’s comments, but he said “over the coming meetings,” and I don’t think that is realistic.	23	2
201401	2234	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it has got to be between now and March that we really think about this, given that unemployment could be down below 6½ percent very soon.	23	2
201401	2235	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another issue I’d like to bring up is our forward guidance on asset purchases.	23	2
201401	2236	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The unemployment rate is linked to our guidance on asset purchases as well—once the unemployment rate is in the low 6s, it may be hard to understand what we mean by “substantial improvement in the labor market.”	23	2
201401	2237	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it would be helpful to see options around both of these paragraphs, with some analysis, well in advance of our next meeting.	23	2
201401	2238	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	A critical decision in thinking about paragraph 5, of course, is whether we want to refine our quantitative guidance as in alternative A or rely on purely qualitative guidance regarding the future path of the funds rate.	23	2
201401	2239	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And here, like President Lockhart, my view is that with market expectations well aligned with our own, the experience in December suggests that clear qualitative guidance can effectively signal the ongoing need for a highly accommodative stance of policy.	23	2
201401	2240	2014-01-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2241	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2242	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	23	2
201401	2243	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Mr Chairman, when I arrived at the Naval Academy as a plebe in 1969, we were given a book called Reef Points, about this thick.	23	2
201401	2244	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We had to memorize every word in that book, and we were tested constantly.	23	2
201401	2245	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Because I didn’t get a chance to thank you yesterday, I want to pull forward a quote that for the most part is still in my mind since 1969.	23	2
201401	2246	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It was attributed to John Paul Jones, the father of the Navy.	23	2
201401	2247	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It turned out he had a Michelle.	23	2
201401	2248	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	She had actually written it, but nonetheless, it’s attributed to a great leader.	23	2
201401	2249	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	What he said was, “It is by no means enough that an officer of the Navy should be a capable mariner....	23	2
201401	2250	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	He should be as well a gentleman of liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and the nicest sense of personal honor.	23	2
201401	2251	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	He should be the soul of tact, patience, justice, firmness, kindness, and clarity.”	23	2
201401	2252	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t want to kill you with praise, but in my experience of having worked with you the entire time you’ve been here, and having the privilege of having worked with your predecessor, every one of those words applies to the way you have run this Committee.	23	2
201401	2253	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Obviously you’re not only a mega-capable economist, but you have shown punctilious courtesy —I can’t recall a single instance in which you haven’t returned my phone call within a remarkably short period of time—and I don’t know anybody with a nicer sense of personal honor.	23	2
201401	2254	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There’s no one in this town who has humility.	23	2
201401	2255	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You have great power and great influence, but you’ve shown incredible humility, which is an example for all of us and for anybody here in Washington.	23	2
201401	2256	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And as to patience and kindness and also firmness, you have shown those to me personally, and I just want to thank you for it.	23	2
201401	2257	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I honor you like everybody else at this table.	23	2
201401	2258	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	As to the options before us, I support option B.	23	2
201401	2259	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I felt last time that we could have done more.	23	2
201401	2260	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I was happy to see the way the market took in what we said.	23	2
201401	2261	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I know in preparing for the press conference you were probably prepared to give an answer to “How do you feel about the selloff, Mr Chairman?” but we actually saw the kind of reaction I expected.	23	2
201401	2262	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think President Plosser makes a very good point that we should be prepared for the economy perhaps doing better than we are naturally cautious about.	23	2
201401	2263	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I want to keep the book open for doing more as we go through time.	23	2
201401	2264	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We will just have to do this in such a way that we can conclude the program, in my view, as soon as is practicable.	23	2
201401	2265	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I would like to make some comments picking up on what some others have said here with regard to intermediate-term policy implementation and forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2266	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	One of the reasons I think that what we announced was effective was not just because it was an expression of confidence in the economy, but also because we tied it to the forward guidance, and I’ve spoken about that quite a bit.	23	2
201401	2267	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So I’ll just make some brief comments.	23	2
201401	2268	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I very much welcome Bill English and Simon Potter’s promise of additional work on intermediate-term policy implementation.	23	2
201401	2269	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think President Evans raised a very good question about unemployment approaching our 6½ percent threshold—and, to President Williams’s point, we may already be there, or we’re close to it.	23	2
201401	2270	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think it’s important that we give urgent and new and serious thought to the nuts and bolts of the post-liftoff conduct of monetary policy and what our post-liftoff tactics will be.	23	2
201401	2271	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Sandy has been here a little bit longer than me, and Janet has been here longer, but having been around for quite a while, I want to remind the Committee again that our balance sheet is substantially larger and has a substantially longer duration.	23	2
201401	2272	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	It has a substantially higher percentage of non-Treasury securities than many of us thought we would ever see back in September 2008 when Lehman failed or even back in September 2012 when the current program of asset purchases began.	23	2
201401	2273	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I note that banks’ excess reserves now constitute two-thirds of the monetary base.	23	2
201401	2274	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Searching through history, the last time we had anything near that, which was about 40 percent or maybe higher, was during the Great Depression.	23	2
201401	2275	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We have zero experience with conducting interest rate policy in this environment.	23	2
201401	2276	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And I admit to some trepidation, Mr.	23	2
201401	2277	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Chairman, despite our new policy tools.	23	2
201401	2278	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In part that’s because, as we proceed here, I worry that we may find ourselves, depending on what happens to our portfolio, at risk politically as well as public-relations-wise.	23	2
201401	2279	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But of course, we want to get it right for the purposes of the economy.	23	2
201401	2280	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Our chances of successfully negotiating the minefield improve if we have a carefully thought-out, well-articulated post-liftoff monetary strategy.	23	2
201401	2281	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Madam Governor, about to be Chair, this will be our greatest challenge, and we can talk about the Taylor rule and the Woodford period and what they tell us, but I think the key point is that we need to do a great deal of work here, and I have a very open mind about the form that our post-liftoff strategy and forward guidance could take.	23	2
201401	2282	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think there’s plenty of room for more staff analysis, and I agree with President Williams—the sooner the better.	23	2
201401	2283	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	In the spirit of humility—which I referenced when speaking about you, Mr Chairman—I humbly offer a couple of comments and guidelines.	23	2
201401	2284	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	As Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned yesterday, a time path is not a strategy, although Governor Stein reminded us that whether we articulate things in terms of time or not, that’s the way market operators work.	23	2
201401	2285	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Publishing individual or Committee-agreed funds rate projections may have its uses, but I think we have to acknowledge that it’s no substitute for articulating a policy strategy, and I look forward to working with Chair Yellen and with Stan Fischer—and by the way, I have dined out many times or gotten tables using the name Fisher, not spelling it with a c.	23	2
201401	2286	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I will thank Stan for that when I see him.	23	2
201401	2287	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Second, I think we should bear in mind that there are limits to invoking “this time is different” or “under special circumstances” as a rationale for a temporary departure from normal strategy.	23	2
201401	2288	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Invoked for too long, it may erode our credibility, and I think we need to be mindful of that.	23	2
201401	2289	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Even, with all due respect, Governor Yellen, using the term “persistent headwinds”—at some point we have to adjust, and we need to think that through.	23	2
201401	2290	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And then I think we must bear in mind, when we develop a strategy that’s heavily reliant on what we assume to be accurate estimates of potential output, or the natural rate of unemployment, or the natural real rate of interest, that they’re open to question.	23	2
201401	2291	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	These cannot be directly observed.	23	2
201401	2292	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We know that even experts disagree about how these variables ought to be estimated, and that all of these estimates are subject to large after-the-fact revisions.	23	2
201401	2293	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So with those points in mind, I just want to say that I am comfortable with the continuum of choices that was laid out there.	23	2
201401	2294	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I have some quibbles—for example, about the nominal income targeting methodology that was used in the memo—but I very much look forward to that discussion, and I would urge our new leader to press that discussion forward.	23	2
201401	2295	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	And then last, with regard to President Lockhart’s comments about press conferences:  If I recall correctly, it was Artemas Ward who said he loved his brother so much that he volunteered him to go to war in his place.	23	2
201401	2296	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	We love you so much Madam Chair (Ms Yellen) that we gladly volunteer you to give press conferences, if you’re willing, at the end of each of our sessions.	23	2
201401	2297	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Thank you, Mr Chairman, and thank you for your service to our country.	23	2
201401	2298	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you very much.	23	2
201401	2299	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President George.	23	2
201401	2300	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2301	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B and the further reduction in asset purchases at this meeting as an appropriate next step in the direction of policy normalization.	23	2
201401	2302	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	And I see scope for increasing the pace of these reductions if the incoming data are stronger than expected.	23	2
201401	2303	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Even with these steps I remain concerned about the general stance of policy and, as others have noted, how we will communicate going forward.	23	2
201401	2304	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	As the economy continues to expand, our balance sheet also continues to grow, and the market’s ability to price risk and allocate credit remains highly influenced by monetary policy, while the desired influence of policy on business investment, job and income growth, and inflation continues to puzzle.	23	2
201401	2305	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Our forward guidance is now pushing accommodation past the advice of multiple policy rules, as President Plosser and others have noted.	23	2
201401	2306	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Four of the six rules described in the Tealbook prescribe a policy rate higher than the effective lower bound starting in the second quarter of this year.	23	2
201401	2307	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	And although low inflation remains a caution, all of these rates incorporate the 2 percent longer-term goal.	23	2
201401	2308	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I also note the increase in the Tealbook-consistent estimate of r*, which is now above the real funds rate by about 30 basis points.	23	2
201401	2309	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the previous Tealbook, r* was about 20 basis points below the real funds rate.	23	2
201401	2310	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	With a combined 50 basis point swing, it could be argued that policy is now more accommodative than at the time of the previous meeting.	23	2
201401	2311	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Of course, I understand that considerable uncertainty surrounds such estimates, but those kinds of shifts seem relevant to me in terms of assessing the future stance of policy.	23	2
201401	2312	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Changes in the estimate of excess capacity also are relevant to current and future policy.	23	2
201401	2313	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	While economic growth did surprise to the upside in the second half of this year, potential GDP at the end of 2013 was revised down by about 2 percent over the past year.	23	2
201401	2314	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	With the output gap estimated to be 1.9 percent at the end of 2014, a similar revision to potential GDP would put the output gap close to zero at the end of this year.	23	2
201401	2315	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I’m not necessarily expecting that the Tealbook estimate of potential will be revised lower, but my point is that, given the trajectory of labor force participation and the expiration of emergency unemployment compensation, I see such a revision as a risk, and a concerning risk, given that rates are likely to still be at zero at the end of this year.	23	2
201401	2316	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the meantime, our policy settings continue to facilitate incentives that pose potential risks to long-term financial stability.	23	2
201401	2317	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Asset prices and froth in various pockets of the financial sector deserve our ongoing monitoring, particularly in high-yield bond issuance and leveraged lending.	23	2
201401	2318	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	I recognize that identifying these risks to financial stability and quantifying their impact today remain difficult for sure, but we should not underestimate their potential effects or their ability to surprise.	23	2
201401	2319	2014-01-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, Mr Chairman, I want to join others in wishing you all the best and thanking you for your service.	23	2
201401	2320	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2321	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Pianalto.	23	2
201401	2322	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2323	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	I support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2324	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Recent economic data point to a stronger conclusion to 2013 than I had previously expected.	23	2
201401	2325	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	And given the incoming data, I am more confident that economic growth will indeed remain above trend over the next few years, as I have been expecting—or perhaps I should say, as I have been hoping— for some time.	23	2
201401	2326	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In my view, the cumulative progress in the labor market warrants a continued gradual reduction in asset purchases.	23	2
201401	2327	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Nonetheless, with inflation below our objective and unemployment still elevated, policy should remain broadly accommodative for some time.	23	2
201401	2328	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	I anticipate that the first increase in the federal funds rate will not occur until well after I am retired.	23	2
201401	2329	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	[Laughter]	23	2
201401	2330	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	In my view, the first increase will not occur until the projected rate of inflation is approaching As a result, I agree with others that it is important for us to continue to work on our communications and to adjust the forward-guidance language as soon as our March meeting.	23	2
201401	2331	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	And I plan to be here at the March meeting and engage in that discussion.	23	2
201401	2332	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Thank you, Mr.	23	2
201401	2333	2014-01-29	meeting	PIANALTO	Chairman.	23	2
201401	2334	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2335	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Lacker.	23	2
201401	2336	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2337	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Knowing how much, over the eight years we have served together, you must have enjoyed my policy lectures—I mean, statements [laughter]—I gave thought, in honor of your final meeting, to reviewing and recapitulating the highlights of my recommendations and commentary about how to conduct monetary policy.	23	2
201401	2338	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Instead, I have written a throwback statement consistent with the theme evinced by the many throwback baseball caps that were given to you last night.	23	2
201401	2339	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	My policy statement is in the style that was common under your predecessor, when, as our Chair-to-be noted last night, the Chairman spoke first on policy matters and the policy go-round was noted for its brevity.	23	2
201401	2340	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So here goes:  “I support your policy proposal, Mr Chairman.”	23	2
201401	2341	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That was refreshing.	23	2
201401	2342	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Laughter]	23	2
201401	2343	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Better late than never, right?	23	2
201401	2344	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2345	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201401	2346	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am going to deviate from the example set by President Lacker.	23	2
201401	2347	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For today, Mr Chairman, I am willing to support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2348	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As others have noted, with the unemployment rate nearing 6.5 percent, I believe it will be important in the near term to change our forward guidance for the fed funds rate.	23	2
201401	2349	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’ll spend my time talking about potential changes in the language that we could be thinking about for March or April.	23	2
201401	2350	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll be giving some context regarding what I see as the main lessons learned about communication in 2013.	23	2
201401	2351	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this context is important because my lessons learned will deviate from the lessons learned by others around the table, and I think that’s leading us to different conclusions.	23	2
201401	2352	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We had two kinds of communication in place at the beginning of 2013.	23	2
201401	2353	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We had qualitative communication in place about the end of the asset purchase program, with a key marker being described as substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.	23	2
201401	2354	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We also had quantitative communication in place about the evolution of the fed funds rate.	23	2
201401	2355	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, when I look back at 2013, I see that the latter, quantitative communication was more effective.	23	2
201401	2356	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The qualitative communication about the asset purchase program created two significant and related problems for us.	23	2
201401	2357	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, market expectations about the meaning of “substantial improvement in the labor market outlook” evolved in ways that we could not control, and the ultimate size of the program ended up being much larger than most or maybe even all of us anticipated, especially given the fall in the unemployment rate that has actually transpired.	23	2
201401	2358	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Second, and relatedly, the Committee ultimately had to disappoint financial markets.	23	2
201401	2359	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That process led to a very bumpy ride in financial markets in the middle of the year, and I think we were quite lucky that it did not end up having broader economic impacts.	23	2
201401	2360	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In contrast, the fed funds rate communication worked well over the course of 2013 to pin down market expectations.	23	2
201401	2361	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There was a slight blip in fed funds rate expectations in June and July, but I think it’s reasonable to attribute that blip entirely to communications challenges associated with the asset purchase program.	23	2
201401	2362	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we were able to work through that blip and bring market expectations in alignment with our own because we had the quantitative guidance in place to refer to.	23	2
201401	2363	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So over the course of the year, I would say markets remained convinced that we would not raise rates until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2364	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A number of people have expressed concerns about using the unemployment rate as a threshold marker and, I guess, regret having used it in the first place because the unemployment rate is providing an overly optimistic reading of labor market health.	23	2
201401	2365	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is an opinion I have certainly expressed publicly—that it might well be true that the unemployment rate is sending too optimistic a signal.	23	2
201401	2366	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But I think it’s critical to distinguish between thresholds and triggers here.	23	2
201401	2367	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is a very strong argument against using any particular metric, and, in particular, U-3, the unemployment rate, as a trigger for raising the fed funds rate.	23	2
201401	2368	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It underscores the importance and the strength of the threshold approach, where we explicitly retained optionality against exactly this kind of contingency.	23	2
201401	2369	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We didn’t put a trigger in place saying that we were going to raise rates as soon as unemployment fell below 6.5 percent exactly because we were concerned about the possibility that, in fact, the labor markets might not be as strong as that measure indicated.	23	2
201401	2370	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So the lessons of 2013 have convinced me—anew, I would say—that effective monetary policy at the zero lower bound really requires a quantitative approach to forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2371	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I agree with you, Mr Chairman—right now, the qualitative approach that we laid out in December is working effectively.	23	2
201401	2372	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it’s something that is going to work effectively until it doesn’t work effectively, and then we are going to have to try to deal with market volatility and figure out ways to do so on the fly, as we ended up doing in 2013.	23	2
201401	2373	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s better to have a quantitative approach in place that will pin down expectations to begin with.	23	2
201401	2374	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Right now, I think our current communication really ignores what I would consider the lessons learned from 2013.	23	2
201401	2375	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Does “well past the time” mean nine months, as in Tealbook A?	23	2
201401	2376	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Or does it mean until the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent, as in Tealbook B?	23	2
201401	2377	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m concerned that, just as we saw with the LSAP program last year, it is going to be increasingly difficult for us to manage public expectations about the meaning of this statement as the unemployment rate falls below 6.5 percent, as we all begin, in our own separate communications, to opine on what the meaning of that statement is.	23	2
201401	2378	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Okay.	23	2
201401	2379	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I have argued strongly for quantitative language.	23	2
201401	2380	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What kind of quantitative language should we use?	23	2
201401	2381	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The threshold approach definitely has its drawbacks, and if you wanted me to argue on that side, I could point to drawbacks.	23	2
201401	2382	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it is important in communication not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.	23	2
201401	2383	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Market participants have, I think, grown to understand the threshold approach.	23	2
201401	2384	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think it offers us a good mix of commitment and optionality.	23	2
201401	2385	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For these reasons, I think a good starting point for consideration is that, in March, we should be committing to keep the fed funds rate extraordinarily low at least until the unemployment rate falls below some threshold lower than 6.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2386	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m sympathetic to some of the comments that President Plosser made about maybe putting a little more weight on the inflation rate, and I’ll come back to that in a second.	23	2
201401	2387	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, what threshold, exactly, should we be picking?	23	2
201401	2388	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One thing I learned in 2013 is that we are very reluctant to move thresholds downward, which was a little bit of a surprise to me because I viewed that as always an option before us.	23	2
201401	2389	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it is clear the Committee has that sense.	23	2
201401	2390	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So when we do adopt the threshold, it should really be low enough that we don’t see a substantial chance of later wishing it were even lower.	23	2
201401	2391	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the economics go-round, I have argued there are good reasons to have lowered our estimates of the long-run mandate-consistent unemployment rate relative to a year ago.	23	2
201401	2392	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For both of these reasons, I would prefer 5.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2393	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Why wouldn’t we adopt such a commitment?	23	2
201401	2394	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this comes back to where our estimates of the long-run unemployment rate are.	23	2
201401	2395	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Some participants have estimates of the long- run unemployment rate as high as 6 percent.	23	2
201401	2396	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am suggesting keeping the fed funds rate extraordinarily low until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2397	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those participants might be concerned that such a policy stance could lead to undue pressures on inflation or risks to financial stability.	23	2
201401	2398	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So let me talk about how to deal with each of those possibilities in turn.	23	2
201401	2399	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of inflation, I actually think alternative A offers the right way to proceed on this.	23	2
201401	2400	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d say we should be keeping the fed funds rate extremely low until the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2401	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We could lead by saying we are going to be keeping the federal funds rate extraordinarily low at least until one of the following conditions is satisfied, and the first condition could be that the medium-term outlook for inflation—the one- to two-year-ahead outlook—is 2 percent.	23	2
201401	2402	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m perfectly happy to have that as the lead condition, because it fits in with President Evans’s view that one way to explain and articulate policy is through our goals.	23	2
201401	2403	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And we are going to wait until we actually see the outlook for inflation return to 2 percent.	23	2
201401	2404	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That, I think, puts in a guardrail.	23	2
201401	2405	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If you are really worried about inflationary pressures, they should show up in that one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation.	23	2
201401	2406	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second condition would be, as I said, that the unemployment rate falls below 5.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2407	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, the third issue is one that we did not deal with when we laid out our first threshold and that we should be dealing with now, which is that committing to this kind of strategy could lead to undue risks to financial stability.	23	2
201401	2408	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the right way to deal with this is to add a third knockout clause—a third condition that would lead us to consider raising rates.	23	2
201401	2409	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It would essentially be a financial-stability knockout clause along the lines of the Bank of England’s— language that would allow the Committee the option of raising rates if the Committee saw that doing so would produce sufficient benefits in terms of mitigating potential risks to financial stability.	23	2
201401	2410	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So it would be very open-ended and would allow us, essentially on a meeting-by- meeting basis, to talk it through, assess what’s going on in the financial markets, and see if raising rates would be effective in that regard.	23	2
201401	2411	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So that’s my three-pronged suggestion in terms of forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2412	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We can commit to keeping rates extraordinarily low at least until the medium-term outlook—the one- to two-year- ahead outlook—for inflation has gone back to 2 percent, or the unemployment rate has fallen below 5.5 percent, or whatever the financial-stability knockout clause looks like.	23	2
201401	2413	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I agree with what’s been said before—I think we have to move quickly.	23	2
201401	2414	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think March will be a very good time to do this.	23	2
201401	2415	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One last point.	23	2
201401	2416	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am sympathetic to President Bullard’s desire to have a press conference every meeting.	23	2
201401	2417	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Especially given that I am not the one doing it, I think it seems very attractive.	23	2
201401	2418	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in all seriousness, I’m concerned about the governance.	23	2
201401	2419	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think the Committee really should take responsibility for what monetary policy is.	23	2
201401	2420	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The right way to take that responsibility is through the statement.	23	2
201401	2421	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think we should be working to make the statement an effective communication of our collective views.	23	2
201401	2422	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2423	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thank you for your indulgence, as always, in listening to me for so long.	23	2
201401	2424	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I appreciate President Lacker’s foreseeing that I would need his time.	23	2
201401	2425	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2426	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Yellen.	23	2
201401	2427	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2428	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2429	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think it’s appropriate to acknowledge, as alternative B does, that recent labor market indicators have been mixed.	23	2
201401	2430	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I sensed at the previous meeting that many of us consider the appropriate hurdle for pausing the process of winding down our asset purchases to be fairly high, and certainly this one employment report doesn’t cross that bar.	23	2
201401	2431	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Moreover, the information we have received concerning final demand suggests that the strengthening we were expecting is now in train.	23	2
201401	2432	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly hope that the two employment reports over the coming intermeeting period will paint a picture that’s unambiguously supportive of ongoing improvement.	23	2
201401	2433	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	With the inflation news having been roughly neutral since the previous meeting, I think it’s appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases by another $10 billion today.	23	2
201401	2434	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	For this meeting, I also think it’s appropriate to make minimal changes to the statement.	23	2
201401	2435	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	We strengthened our forward guidance in December, and, as you noted, Mr Chairman, that guidance still seems quite relevant and appears to be working.	23	2
201401	2436	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Market views currently seem well aligned with our own, and the dealer survey suggests that no changes in guidance are anticipated in this meeting.	23	2
201401	2437	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	But, as many of you have pointed out, we could, before our March meeting, or at itg—especially if we receive two strong employment reports—easily be in a situation in which the unemployment rate reaches or crosses the 6½ percent threshold.	23	2
201401	2438	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	In that event, we will absolutely need to make changes in our forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2439	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I agree with all of you who have urged that we need to think very hard about how to change the guidance quickly and that we need to be well positioned for either scenario, whether the data end up being disappointing and weaker than we have anticipated or stronger than we have anticipated.	23	2
201401	2440	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	So I definitely think we need to make decisions at our March meeting on how to modify the guidance.	23	2
201401	2441	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	This is obviously going to be challenging.	23	2
201401	2442	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	You see in alternative A today one possible approach, whereby, as we approach the 6½ percent threshold, we would list a broader set of labor market indicators we would be watching, in addition to the unemployment rate.	23	2
201401	2443	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, there are other approaches to consider.	23	2
201401	2444	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I have heard clearly in this discussion, and think it’s a very useful idea, that we could enhance our guidance with respect to inflation.	23	2
201401	2445	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	The current guidance does indicate that projected inflation will factor into our decision on how long to keep the funds rate in its present range, but we could certainly consider ways to enhance our emphasis on how inflation will matter to future policy decisions.	23	2
201401	2446	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	Listening to the discussion, I’ve heard some very interesting ideas during this round.	23	2
201401	2447	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would urge all of you to think very hard about concrete ideas that you have.	23	2
201401	2448	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I plan to reach out to all of you.	23	2
201401	2449	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	I hope you will be in touch with me to offer up ideas that you have about the forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2450	2014-01-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will try to use this intermeeting period to move forward on this, and I agree that work on this is absolutely urgent.	23	2
201401	2451	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2452	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201401	2453	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2454	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B.	23	2
201401	2455	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yesterday I highlighted some of the downside risks to the economy that I saw, but I did that, in part, in an effort to try to balance the discussion, which I thought, at least until Jeff and Bill and Janet began speaking, had a little bit unduly emphasized the upside risks.	23	2
201401	2456	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I do, however, agree that there are upside risks, and so I also subscribe to the Chairman’s statement that risks are broadly balanced right now.	23	2
201401	2457	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I also agree with those of you who have suggested that our action today will solidify market expectations and that there is a pretty high hurdle for departing from a $10 billion reduction per meeting.	23	2
201401	2458	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	I would just add another thought, which is that once we have solidified those market expectations, any deviation from the $10 billion per meeting reductions will, I think, be read by markets as a pretty strong signal one way or another.	23	2
201401	2459	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	So that’s probably a further reason to think from our own perspective that there is a pretty strong presumption going in that this is the path we’re on.	23	2
201401	2460	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s in addition to the reason of relieving ourselves from having to have the discussion at every single FOMC meeting.	23	2
201401	2461	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, finally, of course, I agree with everybody else that we need to focus on the forward guidance issue and need to be ready to roll it out, if not rolling it out, by the March meeting.	23	2
201401	2462	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2463	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2464	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Stein.	23	2
201401	2465	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2466	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I also support alternative B, basically for all the reasons that people have articulated.	23	2
201401	2467	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think we’re on a good path.	23	2
201401	2468	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think policy is appropriately calibrated to the fundamentals.	23	2
201401	2469	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Market expectations are clearly in line.	23	2
201401	2470	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Given where we have been, the homogeneity now is just remarkable.	23	2
201401	2471	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It seems like the market can’t disagree about anything other than maybe whether we’re going to finish with a $15 billion reduction or reduce by $10 billion in October and $5 billion in December.	23	2
201401	2472	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think that to the extent that we can sustain that homogeneity and clarity, it is going to serve us well, because we’ve got all this complicated stuff around the guidance to deal with.	23	2
201401	2473	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	So I think that’s very helpful.	23	2
201401	2474	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I just wanted to reiterate a point that a number of people have made about the bar for changing things being high.	23	2
201401	2475	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	And I want to emphasize that I think that’s a good thing, but it’s a symmetric thing.	23	2
201401	2476	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It’s not hawkish, as if we were saying that we should keep on this path even if the news gets weak.	23	2
201401	2477	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I want to emphatically agree with President Rosengren that if the news comes in stronger than expected, the bar for accelerating should also be very high.	23	2
201401	2478	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	A number of you have alluded to this.	23	2
201401	2479	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Mr Chairman, as you said, right now the mechanical timing of the wind-down is an important pillar supporting our forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2480	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	We are about to possibly remove another one of the pillars as we cross 6.5 percent.	23	2
201401	2481	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	As Governor Tarullo said, there is potentially going to be a lot of signal content.	23	2
201401	2482	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Suppose we got to the next meeting with good news and we accelerated to $20 billion.	23	2
201401	2483	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	All of a sudden, we would have moved forward this mechanical aspect of liftoff by three to six months.	23	2
201401	2484	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I would be very, very reluctant to go down that path.	23	2
201401	2485	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	And I think there’s a sort of symmetry to financial-stability concerns.	23	2
201401	2486	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	If you worry a lot about financial stability, and that makes you careful going in, I think it has to make you careful going out, and you have to keep that balance in mind.	23	2
201401	2487	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	On the guidance, I am in the camp that prefers doing things qualitatively.	23	2
201401	2488	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I just want to put one thing on the table—and I really don’t have a clear view on the merits, but I just want to lay it out there for discussion—which is whether, as we think about this, we want to have in the guidance some explicit conditionality on financial conditions.	23	2
201401	2489	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Again, it’s symmetric in principle.	23	2
201401	2490	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	But the worry I have is that we get to a point where things detach a little bit and term premiums spike.	23	2
201401	2491	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I suspect that, ex post, we would be willing to lean against that to some extent by slowing down the rate of increase of the federal funds rate.	23	2
201401	2492	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Do we want to allude to that ex ante on the possible theory that letting the market know that we would be leaning against that might tamp down the volatility in the first place?	23	2
201401	2493	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I don’t know.	23	2
201401	2494	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	It’s conceptually interesting.	23	2
201401	2495	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I think it’s worth discussing.	23	2
201401	2496	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I don’t have a clear view, but I hope it would be something that we could give a little bit of thought to.	23	2
201401	2497	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2498	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I have made comments like that in press conferences, for example, and it was also one of the rationales for the non-move in September.	23	2
201401	2499	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	I was thinking exactly that was the rationale for the non-move in September.	23	2
201401	2500	2014-01-29	meeting	STEIN	Do we want to just emphasize that a little bit more and hope that it has a bit of a preemptive feature?	23	2
201401	2501	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	23	2
201401	2502	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Governor Powell.	23	2
201401	2503	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2504	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I, too, will support alternative B, and I have a couple of comments on the statement and on the work we’ll be doing for the March statement.	23	2
201401	2505	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	First, I didn’t notice this until President Williams mentioned it, but I do think that saying indicators are mixed in the labor market will perhaps be the headline coming out of this.	23	2
201401	2506	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	It is a signal of concern, and I wonder—we have market expectations right where we want them.	23	2
201401	2507	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t have great certainty about this, but I worry that it will send a signal that the Committee is concerned.	23	2
201401	2508	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I’d rather not do that, so I like John’s suggested change there.	23	2
201401	2509	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Second, as others have observed, the likelihood of passing through 6½ percent is high.	23	2
201401	2510	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	So, obviously, there is going to need to be a pretty significant rewrite of paragraph 5 in this statement.	23	2
201401	2511	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	And I would echo what others have already said: That is not something we should be doing at this point in the meeting in March.	23	2
201401	2512	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think there should be a lot of back-and-forth before then.	23	2
201401	2513	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The purpose, of course, is to enable markets to understand how the Committee will react to changes in the economy and the markets.	23	2
201401	2514	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s important to start by bearing in mind that the markets have got it about right, right now.	23	2
201401	2515	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	There is a “first, do no harm” message in there, it seems to me.	23	2
201401	2516	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t pretend to have all of this figured out by a long shot.	23	2
201401	2517	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But I will just say how I’m thinking about how I would react to developments.	23	2
201401	2518	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s ideal to have a plan that covers most of the probabilities out there—not just a few of them, but really most of them—so that the market can react.	23	2
201401	2519	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The first case is what to do if neither inflation nor financial instability increased materially more than is suggested in the baseline.	23	2
201401	2520	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	If that is the case, then my strong inclination would be to keep going and to lean in the direction of staying lower for longer.	23	2
201401	2521	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	That’s how I think about it now.	23	2
201401	2522	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t know whether that would be reflected in the statement or not, but a strong prior now is that this band of people that the Chairman added up at the beginning of the meeting are out there and could potentially be gotten back by a stronger economy and stronger demand, and if we don’t have financial-stability or inflation concerns, we ought to keep going and see whether that’s the case.	23	2
201401	2523	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	So then the question is, what if inflation reacts?	23	2
201401	2524	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think that in this situation—and this is with financial stability not reacting—I would tend to support a symmetrical approach to inflation.	23	2
201401	2525	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	In a stronger economy in which we were at risk of inflation breaking out—where there was evidence of being near potential and inflation was on a hair trigger—I might well be somebody who would look at 2 percent as a ceiling.	23	2
201401	2526	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t really think that’s where we are.	23	2
201401	2527	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	If you look at the past 15 years, where is it?	23	2
201401	2528	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	And I don’t really expect inflation to react faster than is in the Tealbook, but I don’t know.	23	2
201401	2529	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The case with which I am going to have a harder time is financial instability.	23	2
201401	2530	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I think the most likely case is that we have a reasonably decent economy, inflation doesn’t do much, but the bonfire is burning and asset prices start to move higher and higher.	23	2
201401	2531	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	What do we do then?	23	2
201401	2532	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t come to this with a lot of preexisting faith in macroprudential policies.	23	2
201401	2533	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I can learn that I’m wrong about that—I’m happy to.	23	2
201401	2534	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But it seems to me monetary policy may have to react.	23	2
201401	2535	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Looking at the specific language in paragraph 5 of Alternative A that Governor Yellen cited, I just have a couple of comments, assuming that this is a stab at what it might look like.	23	2
201401	2536	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	First, if we put something in here, we need to be putting it in to tell the market how we are going to react, and I’m not sure I understand what signal we’re sending by including the labor force participation rate in this list of things that we would consider.	23	2
201401	2537	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Is it really that we are uncomfortable with the level of the labor force participation rate—that it says to us that there is a group that is not counted in unemployment, and we are determined to go out and get them, to the extent we can, subject to the dual mandate?	23	2
201401	2538	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Is that what we’re saying, or are we saying that we’ll react to further decreases in the labor force participation rate?	23	2
201401	2539	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The notion would be that if it keeps going down as it has been, which nobody in this room wants it to do, how are we going to react to that?	23	2
201401	2540	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	The first takeaway ought to be that we are actually closer to the natural rate of unemployment.	23	2
201401	2541	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But if it continues to go down, is the suggestion that we would go lower for longer, even though we’re getting a signal that we’re closer to the natural rate of unemployment?	23	2
201401	2542	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m not sure that makes any sense.	23	2
201401	2543	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	On the other hand, if the labor force participation rate flattens out and increases a little bit, that does say that there are people out there who will come back into the labor force, and that’s a very positive message.	23	2
201401	2544	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	That’s a message that, frankly, we’d love to get, and maybe that would provide evidence.	23	2
201401	2545	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	So I’d just say that if we are going to put that in there, we need to know exactly what message we are telling the market to take away.	23	2
201401	2546	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	And the second thing I notice, which I’ll just raise now, is that we don’t talk about wages here.	23	2
201401	2547	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	We talk about inflation pressures, but we don’t talk about measures of employment costs.	23	2
201401	2548	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m sure that was quite deliberate, knowing the process we go through.	23	2
201401	2549	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	But I think that might be something worth considering that if we continue to not see any reaction from wages or from employment cost indexes of various kinds, we would take that into consideration.	23	2
201401	2550	2014-01-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2551	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2552	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201401	2553	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Mr Chairman.	23	2
201401	2554	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I favor alternative B at this meeting.	23	2
201401	2555	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There are a few points I’d make.	23	2
201401	2556	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One is that the data have been broadly consistent with continuing on the course that we began at the December meeting, but that shouldn’t be a surprise.	23	2
201401	2557	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be pretty surprising if we got a set of data in this short period of time that caused us to totally revamp our forecast.	23	2
201401	2558	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s a surprise that we’re staying on the same path.	23	2
201401	2559	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The taper decision in December was very well received by markets.	23	2
201401	2560	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The thing that struck me especially was that the forward short-term rate expectations remained very well anchored, unlike the situation that we saw last summer.	23	2
201401	2561	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Another positive, of course, is that market expectations about FOMC policy now appear broadly consistent with what we actually expect to do over the next year or two, and that really supports the idea of keeping changes to the statement at a minimum at this meeting, which we all seem to favor.	23	2
201401	2562	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with others, though, that in March more substantial changes may be warranted.	23	2
201401	2563	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	First, the statement is quite long and cumbersome, especially paragraph 5.	23	2
201401	2564	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It seems to me that a rewrite that simplifies paragraph 5 would be helpful.	23	2
201401	2565	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Second, as other people have said, there’s a risk that we could get to the 6½ percent unemployment rate threshold by the March meeting.	23	2
201401	2566	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If that were to occur, I don’t think a revamp would be optional.	23	2
201401	2567	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It would be necessary, and so we have to have a contingency plan for that.	23	2
201401	2568	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I completely support what everyone else around the table has said, that we’ve got to start doing the work now so that when we come to the meeting we’re of one mind and we know which way we want to go.	23	2
201401	2569	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The third issue, of course, is that our SEP paths could change in a meaningful way, too, at the March meeting, and that might contradict the timing of liftoff implied by a $10 billion per meeting taper rate and our “well past the time” line.	23	2
201401	2570	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s another risk in terms of how our policy is going to evolve.	23	2
201401	2571	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My own very preliminary thinking is that we should put more weight on inflation in our forward guidance.	23	2
201401	2572	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For example, in paragraph 5 we could have language that was more explicit in saying that liftoff is not likely until after the end of asset purchases, and that the amount of time between the end of asset purchases and liftoff would likely depend to a significant degree on how far underlying inflation was below our 2 percent objective.	23	2
201401	2573	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If it were further below our objective, then we would be more inclined to wait longer than if the gap was smaller.	23	2
201401	2574	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We could do that in terms of actual inflation, or we could do that in terms of our inflation forecast.	23	2
201401	2575	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think those are two things that we need to evaluate.	23	2
201401	2576	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Putting more weight on inflation or the inflation outlook would create an explicit escape route should slack in the economy tighten much faster than we think and inflation head up a little bit faster.	23	2
201401	2577	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the pace of the taper, I agree with people that there’s a pretty high threshold now to go at a different rate than $10 billion per meeting, because the signal from doing so would be pretty strong.	23	2
201401	2578	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But I don’t think that means we should just throw away this tool.	23	2
201401	2579	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If data really come out on a consistent basis suggesting that either we should go faster or we should go slower, I think the tool should still be available.	23	2
201401	2580	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I can imagine that over a period of six months data could accumulate in a way that we really wouldn’t be comfortable with a $10 billion a month pace and might want to go faster.	23	2
201401	2581	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I don’t want to put the thing on autopilot, because it is a tool, and the point people have made is that the tool is actually really powerful.	23	2
201401	2582	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	To say we wouldn’t use a really powerful tool if we needed to seems inappropriate to me.	23	2
201401	2583	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the Taylor rule, I just want to reiterate what President Evans said about not putting too much weight on the Taylor rule’s use of a 2 percent real interest rate intercept.	23	2
201401	2584	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you think about the distance between where we are in terms of the fed funds rate target and the equilibrium real rate, we’re more than 3 percentage points below that supposed 2 percent equilibrium rate.	23	2
201401	2585	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at our forecast, we have economic growth over the next year about 1 percent above potential.	23	2
201401	2586	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I bet if you went back historically and looked at the Taylor-rule relationship between where you were versus that equilibrium real rate and what subsequent economic growth rate you got, you’d find that you would expect to get a lot faster growth than just 3 percent.	23	2
201401	2587	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it would be useful to actually do a little bit more work on this to understand why, if policy really is as easy as the Taylor rule seems to imply, we only have a 3 percent growth forecast.	23	2
201401	2588	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Maybe that would help us tease out President Evans’s point a little bit more.	23	2
201401	2589	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	What is the equilibrium real rate?	23	2
201401	2590	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	To what degree are headwinds afflicting our economy?	23	2
201401	2591	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m worried about this.	23	2
201401	2592	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m worried that people in the market are just going to mechanically pull out the Taylor rule, the 2 percent real rate, and say that the Fed should be lifting off when, in fact, there are very good reasons not to, because the equilibrium real rate is not 2 percent.	23	2
201401	2593	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s considerably lower.	23	2
201401	2594	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I agree with Jeremy that financial conditions are really what we care about, and to emphasize them a little bit more would be useful.	23	2
201401	2595	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If they deviate sharply from where we want them to be, that’s going to be relevant in terms of monetary policymaking.	23	2
201401	2596	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It also feeds into financial-stability concerns, because financial conditions could also deviate in terms of markets getting away from the upside, and we would presumably care about that as well.	23	2
201401	2597	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think getting that into the statement somehow or into our discussion would be useful.	23	2
201401	2598	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, I feel like the labor market indicators were mixed.	23	2
201401	2599	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m comfortable with the language as it is.	23	2
201401	2600	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think how we shade it is a big deal, but my read of the labor market indicators is that they were mixed.	23	2
201401	2601	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Finally, I want to say a few short words about Chairman Bernanke.	23	2
201401	2602	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Winston Churchill once said that “great and good are seldom the same man.”	23	2
201401	2603	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, I think you’re a notable exception.	23	2
201401	2604	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you’re both a good and a great man, and that’s a broadly held sentiment among us.	23	2
201401	2605	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That was evident in last evening’s remarks and in all the comments of everyone around the table over the past two days.	23	2
201401	2606	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So on behalf of myself and the FOMC as Vice Chairman, I want to thank you for your stewardship.	23	2
201401	2607	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You have very much been the right person in the right place at the right time.	23	2
201401	2608	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23	2
201401	2609	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, thank you all for your comments.	23	2
201401	2610	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	We have remarkable unanimity on the statement at this time, but there are a few issues, I think, that we want to discuss.	238	2
201401	2611	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	First is this question of the labor market sentence.	238	2
201401	2612	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Williams suggested “on balance, labor market conditions have shown further improvement.”	238	2
201401	2613	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The status quo is “labor market indicators were mixed.”	238	2
201401	2614	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any preferences?	238	2
201401	2615	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Do we want to take a straw vote?	238	2
201401	2616	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Take a straw vote.	238	2
201401	2617	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Bullard.	238	2
201401	2618	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I like President Williams’s suggestion.	238	2
201401	2619	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do think that, over the past several months, the indicators were coming in pretty strong, even though we got the bad number in the December report.	238	2
201401	2620	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure we want to say “mixed” at this juncture—it might feed into the market turmoil that’s going on right now.	238	2
201401	2621	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	It is a little bit of a concern.	238	2
201401	2622	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	So I think it would be fair to say “on balance.”	238	2
201401	2623	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	238	2
201401	2624	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Plosser.	238	2
201401	2625	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I was going to say I agree with President Bullard and President Williams.	238	2
201401	2626	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	I think the formulation “on balance” doesn’t say anything to suggest that there weren’t differing signals.	238	2
201401	2627	2014-01-29	meeting	PLOSSER	But if it’s a description of what we thought on balance, I’d be inclined to support that.	238	2
201401	2628	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	238	2
201401	2629	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Well, as Bullard is my witness, I had written out one editorial comment that I forgot to mention in my intervention.	238	2
201401	2630	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Oh, okay.	238	2
201401	2631	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it’s anything to die for, but I noticed that Governor Powell and others referred to it.	238	2
201401	2632	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	So I would prefer it, but I don’t think it’s worth dying for.	238	2
201401	2633	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Well, I hope not.	238	2
201401	2634	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Laughter]	238	2
201401	2635	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The staff suggested yet a third compromise:  “Labor market indicators were mixed, but on balance showed further improvement.”	238	2
201401	2636	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Is that it?	238	2
201401	2637	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Can we go with that?	238	2
201401	2638	2014-01-29	meeting	SEVERAL	Sure.	238	2
201401	2639	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	238	2
201401	2640	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Rosengren?	238	2
201401	2641	2014-01-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	That’s okay.	238	2
201401	2642	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	238	2
201401	2643	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So “labor market indicators were mixed,” as stated here, “but on balance showed further improvement.	238	2
201401	2644	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay?	238	2
201401	2645	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Now, the other issue is that apparently we’re having more stress today in the emerging markets, and we asked Steve if he has anything to report on that.	61	6
201401	2646	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Sure.	61	6
201401	2647	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	I will backtrack just to yesterday evening.	61	6
201401	2648	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the evening, local time, in Turkey, the Central Bank of Turkey announced very sharp increases in interest rates, coupled with a commitment to basically be more straightforward in their monetary policy.	61	6
201401	2649	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	That was something the markets had been looking forward to, I think.	61	6
201401	2650	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, the increases in rates are greater than the market anticipated, and the initial response was very positive in terms of the Turkish lira strengthening some 3 to 4 percent against the dollar.	61	6
201401	2651	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	That’s what we were looking at, at the very beginning of this morning.	61	6
201401	2652	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Since then, the Turkish lira has retraced and is now more or less unchanged from where it was yesterday.	61	6
201401	2653	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	The Mexican peso and Brazilian real have fallen in the neighborhood of ½ percent to 1 percent against the dollar this morning.	61	6
201401	2654	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Also, the European stock markets are down about 1 percent.	61	6
201401	2655	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As evidence of flight-to-safety activity, the yen is up ¾ percent against the dollar, as often happens in these things.	61	6
201401	2656	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	And US 10-year bonds are down about 3 basis points.	61	6
201401	2657	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	This is not by itself a particularly dramatic turn of events.	61	6
201401	2658	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	It’s just evidence of continuing reverberations in a context where we might have hoped for more definitive easing of pressures.	61	6
201401	2659	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Again, it’s very hard to predict these things.	61	6
201401	2660	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	It’s actually reasonably typical in emerging market crisis situations for a dramatic move by the authorities to be followed by some positive response, then some retracing.	61	6
201401	2661	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	That’s pretty common.	61	6
201401	2662	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	Now, what’s also true is that subsequently it’s almost as common for the situation to get a lot better as it is for it to continue to get worse.	61	6
201401	2663	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So we don’t know.	61	6
201401	2664	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	We don’t know, and so this is all by way of considering whether you want to put in a short reference in the statement acknowledging that.	61	6
201401	2665	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me just say that a simple thing to do, if we were so inclined, would be just to go back to the old risks language, “having become more nearly balanced,” and not change that.	238	2
201401	2666	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That would be a simple thing to do.	238	2
201401	2667	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	But do you have a language suggestion?	238	2
201401	2668	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	I think we have a couple of possibilities.	238	2
201401	2669	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	One would be, “The Committee currently sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced, but developments in global financial markets bear watching” or “but developments in global financial markets could pose increased downside risks,” depending on how firmly you wanted to point to the risks.	238	2
201401	2670	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	238	2
201401	2671	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would really be reluctant to react to what are pretty small movements.	238	2
201401	2672	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	[Chorus of agreement]	238	2
201401	2673	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just think that then it becomes a matter of the timing of the meeting and the timing of the event.	238	2
201401	2674	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It gets over-weighted.	238	2
201401	2675	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You know, if it happened three weeks ago we wouldn’t even be putting the language into the statement.	238	2
201401	2676	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think it’s too small a move to react.	238	2
201401	2677	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	Can I ask a question, Steve?	238	2
201401	2678	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	What’s happened with the rupee and the real and some of the other midrange emerging market currencies?	238	2
201401	2679	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	In fact, at least as of 10:00 am, the Indian rupee and the Indonesian rupiah are actually up slightly against the dollar.	238	2
201401	2680	2014-01-29	meeting	TARULLO	That argues strongly for Bill’s position.	238	2
201401	2681	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As is the Korean won.	238	2
201401	2682	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	So it is mixed.	238	2
201401	2683	2014-01-29	meeting	KAMIN	As I say, it’s not a great picture, but it’s not a terrible picture either.	238	2
201401	2684	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Fisher.	238	2
201401	2685	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	Mr Chairman, these are very thin markets.	238	2
201401	2686	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I agree 100 percent with Vice Chairman Dudley.	238	2
201401	2687	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think we should be reactive in this fashion.	238	2
201401	2688	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	These aren’t radical moves.	238	2
201401	2689	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	There is the potential of harking back to the Thai crisis, which Governor Tarullo mentioned earlier, but we don’t see evidence of that right now, and I wouldn’t want to appear reactive.	238	2
201401	2690	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The only suggestion I would put out for consideration would be not to actively improve the risk balance—that is, to go back to last month’s existing language on the risk balance.	238	2
201401	2691	2014-01-29	meeting	SEVERAL	That’s fine.	238	2
201401	2692	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But what is the language that we would use, Mr Chairman?	238	2
201401	2693	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If you look at alternative B, we would change the risk balance from “sees the risks as having become more nearly balanced” to “sees the risks as nearly balanced.”	238	2
201401	2694	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The fact is, that is a change, and it’s actually going in the direction of slightly less risk.	238	2
201401	2695	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	You just drop those three words.	238	2
201401	2696	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I’m just putting on the table keeping that unchanged so that there’s not a sense of greater risk, but not a sense of less risk either.	238	2
201401	2697	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Kocherlakota.	238	2
201401	2698	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Sorry.	238	2
201401	2699	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Mr Chairman.	238	2
201401	2700	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t like doing that in response to the news received, but now that you’ve pointed out that that change was made, I think it’s better not to have made it.	238	2
201401	2701	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s good to keep the language the same as much as possible.	238	2
201401	2702	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I’m in favor of that.	238	2
201401	2703	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Vice Chairman.	238	2
201401	2704	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Well, there’s a question about what the meaning is here, frankly.	238	2
201401	2705	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Saying “having become more nearly balanced” means you’re moving in the direction of the risks receding.	238	2
201401	2706	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It means relative to the recent past.	238	2
201401	2707	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I know, but you can read it both ways.	238	2
201401	2708	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I mean, it’s not obvious.	238	2
201401	2709	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I can live with either.	238	2
201401	2710	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I can live with that one, Mr Chairman.	238	2
201401	2711	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I think that’s wise.	238	2
201401	2712	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	238	2
201401	2713	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	May we just go back?	238	2
201401	2714	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	President Bullard.	238	2
201401	2715	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure this is an improvement.	238	2
201401	2716	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	We said at the previous meeting, “having become more nearly balanced.”	238	2
201401	2717	2014-01-29	meeting	BULLARD	Now we don’t want to say that we’ve made further improvement.	238	2
201401	2718	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Right.	238	2
201401	2719	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s my point.	238	2
201401	2720	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it’s going to be noticed.	238	2
201401	2721	2014-01-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It will not be noticed.	238	2
201401	2722	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It won’t be noticed.	238	2
201401	2723	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It will just be relative to earlier statements when we were saying that the risks were still to the downside.	238	2
201401	2724	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t think it’s a big deal one way or the other, Mr.	238	2
201401	2725	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Chairman.	238	2
201401	2726	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	This won’t be noticed, Mr Chairman.	238	2
201401	2727	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	If you want to leave it, I’d leave it.	238	2
201401	2728	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	There’s a paradox here, because the way the language was, it referred to an improvement having occurred.	238	2
201401	2729	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	Repeating that suggests that further improvement has occurred over the intermeeting period, which isn’t the meaning you want to convey.	238	2
201401	2730	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	But now we’re saying we’re already there with the new wording.	238	2
201401	2731	2014-01-29	meeting	FISHER	I don’t think it’s noticeable.	238	2
201401	2732	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I think a lot depends on the reference point, which is vague.	238	2
201401	2733	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	So it would be odd for us to refer to a change that occurred two intermeeting periods ago rather than one.	238	2
201401	2734	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I’d leave it the way it’s written.	238	2
201401	2735	2014-01-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I really don’t think it matters one way or the other.	238	2
201401	2736	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	238	2
201401	2737	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	May I exert executive privilege here and just ask to put it back to where it was the last time?	238	2
201401	2738	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	I don’t think it’s going to be read any way other than as just a repetition of our assessments last time.	238	2
201401	2739	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Are there any other thoughts or considerations?	238	2
201401	2740	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	238	2
201401	2741	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	If not, the only change we have is the second sentence.	238	2
201401	2742	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	“Labor market indicators were mixed”—then how did it go?	238	2
201401	2743	2014-01-29	meeting	LUECKE	“But on balance showed further improvement.”	238	2
201401	2744	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	“Labor market indicators were mixed, but on balance showed further improvement” in the second sentence.	238	2
201401	2745	2014-01-29	meeting	ENGLISH	And we’re undoing the change to the risks statement in paragraph 2.	238	2
201401	2746	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	And we are undoing the change to the risks statement.	238	2
201401	2747	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	All right.	238	2
201401	2748	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Would you call the roll please, Matt?	238	2
201401	2749	2014-01-29	meeting	LUECKE	This vote will be on the language that Chairman Bernanke just indicated and on the directive as found on page 12 of Bill English’s handout.	238	2
201401	2750	2014-01-29	meeting	LUECKE	Chairman Bernanke Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes President Fisher Yes President Kocherlakota Yes President Pianalto Yes President Plosser Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Stein Yes Governor Tarullo Yes Governor Yellen Yes .	238	2
201401	2751	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you.	238	2
201401	2752	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	A statement about the overnight reverse repurchase agreement exercise has just been passed out.	238	2
201401	2753	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Let me ask Simon to say a word about it.	238	2
201401	2754	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	Actually, I think, Lorie—	238	2
201401	2755	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Or Lorie.	238	2
201401	2756	2014-01-29	meeting	POTTER	In her new role.	238	2
201401	2757	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	Given the directive on asset purchases and the resolution passed on the overnight RRP exercise, the Desk intends to release two statements simultaneously with the FOMC statement, and there should be two being circulated at the moment.	238	2
201401	2758	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	The first statement indicates that the Desk will begin buying agency MBS and Treasury securities at the lower $30 billion and $35 billion monthly pace beginning in February.	238	2
201401	2759	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	Further, it notes that the Desk will complete the existing January schedules as previously released, and all other elements of the statement are identical to what we released with the December Desk statement on asset purchases.	238	2
201401	2760	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	238	2
201401	2761	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So that’s just simply the statement.	238	2
201401	2762	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	That’s just the announcement of the asset purchases.	238	2
201401	2763	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	The second statement, which in your handout is titled “Statement to Revise Terms of Overnight Fixed-Rate Reverse Repurchase Agreement Operational Exercise,” notes that the Committee has authorized the Desk to continue the overnight RRP exercise through January 30, 2015, and to modify the terms.	238	2
201401	2764	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	It notes that the maximum allotment cap will be increased starting in tomorrow’s operation, to $5 billion, and that over the coming months it may be increased further.	238	2
201401	2765	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	Last, it notes that the fixed rate on the operations continues to be authorized between 0 and 5 basis points, and that the current fixed rate will be maintained at 3 basis points.	238	2
201401	2766	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	This statement has been adjusted from the one circulated ahead of the meeting in the memo on the overnight RRP, in order to remove a clause in that original draft that noted, “The individual counterparty caps may be lifted altogether with the operations conducted in a full allotment.”	238	2
201401	2767	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	We made that adjustment to reflect the discussion yesterday and to maintain more opportunity for consultation about whether and when to take that last step.	238	2
201401	2768	2014-01-29	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you.	238	2
201401	2769	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	So there’s no reference to full allotment in the statement?	238	2
201401	2770	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	That’s good.	238	2
201401	2771	2014-01-29	meeting	LACKER	I appreciate that.	238	2
201401	2772	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Sure.	238	2
201401	2773	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any questions for Lorie?	238	2
201401	2774	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	1	1
201401	2775	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Any other business?	1	1
201401	2776	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[No response]	1	1
201401	2777	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Okay.	1	1
201401	2778	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	There is coffee available.	1	1
201401	2779	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	You can take as long as you like.	1	1
201401	2780	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Lunch is available here at noon, if you’re still around and would like to socialize, and the next meeting shall be led by Chair Yellen.	1	1
201401	2781	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	It is March 18 and 19, 2014.	1	1
201401	2782	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	Thank you all very much.	1	1
201401	2783	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	The meeting is adjourned.	1	1
201401	2784	2014-01-29	meeting	BERNANKE	[Applause]	1	1
