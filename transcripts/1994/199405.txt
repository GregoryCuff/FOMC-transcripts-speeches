199405	4	GREENSPAN	 Without objection. I'll call on Peter Fisher for a report on foreign currency operations. Peter. 	5	5	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	5	FISHER	 Thank you. Since the Committee's conference call on April 18th, the desk intervened on two days for the accounts of the ESF and the System. From mid-April onward, the dollar steadily declined against the mark. Following the G-7 meetings the weekend of April 23rd and 24th, with market disappointment over lack of official comments on exchange rates, the dollar began to move down quickly against the yen as well as the mark. Then in one hour on Friday morning, April 29th, the dollar lost two pfennigs against the mark in disturbed market conditions. On the 29th, the Desk purchased 500 million dollars against marks and 200 million dollars against yen, divided equally between the ESF and the System. On Wednesday, May 4th, the Desk purchased 750 million dollars against marks and 500 million against yen, evenly split between the ESF and the System, as well as dollars against yen as agent for the Bank of Japan. The Bundesbank purchased dollars against marks and 16 other central banks purchased dollars against either marks or their own currencies. In total, central banks purchased dollars on May 4th. I will try to describe, first, the pivotal reasons for the dollar's weakness in April and, second, how I view the two operations. Analytically, it is easy to observe that we have had too many, rather than too few, explanations for the dollar's decline. But from a market perspective, there are no brownie points for intellectual tidiness: the fact that there are a number of quite different reasons to sell the dollar only increased the momentum of negative market sentiment and of the dollar's decline. I would draw the Committee's attention to three points. First, to many market participants, increased the risk of yen strength against the dollar in both the short-run and the longer-run. In the short-run, this reduced the prospects for progress in bilateral trade talks with the United States and, thus, increased the risk of political pressure on the exchange rate. For the longer-run, continued political haggling within Japan reduced the prospect for government measures to stimulate the economy and, thus, reduced the likelihood that domestic demand might increase sufficiently to stimulate imports. Second, by the middle of April, the Bundesbank had successfully squeezed out of the market expectations for further interest rate reductions and, from this point on, the mark began to strengthen against both the dollar and the yen. Thus, despite the reversal and then the widening of expected, short-term differentials in favor of the dollar over the mark (as indicated in Euro-futures prices) during the last two weeks of April the relatively high rates at the short-end of the German yield curve seemed to offer a safe resting place compared with the United States and Japan. Third, putting these points in a technical perspective, in the three-way race with the mark and the yen, in April the dollar dropped into last place. The dollar can only move in opposite directions against the yen and the mark with an adjustment in the mark-yen exchange rate. With the mark finding very solid support against the yen at 60 yen per mark, and the market preoccupied with the risk that the dollar might drop from 103 to 95 yen or lower, it was very difficult to see what upward potential the dollar could have against the mark. The strengthening of the mark and the yen against the dollar accelerated during the week of April 25th. During the week, the foreign exchange market increasingly focused on weakness in the United States government bond market as both cause and effect of the dollar's weakness. To some, the dollar's weakness against the yen could be used as a guide for selling the bond and, to others, weak bond prices were a reason to get out of the dollar. The details of the two operations are described in my written report. In assessing their impact, I view intervention as an effort to communicate with at least two audiences: first, there are the interbank traders themselves and their current positions and, second, there is a broader audience composed of the traders' superiors in bank management, institutional investors and market analysts. On neither occasion was the overall market short dollars and, thus, in contrast to last August, we did not have a very forceful communication directly with traders, in the sense of causing a sharp adjustment in positions during and immediately after the operation. However, on both April 29th and May 4th, I think the combination of the operations and official statements, particularly by Secretary Bensten, did get through to the second, broader audience and, thus, contributed to an improvement in the market's view of United States exchange rate policy and to a healthier mix of views on the dollar's prospects. On May 4th, market participants -- quite sceptical as to whether any form of international cooperation existed -- were impressed to see 19 central banks put an exclamation point behind Secretary Bentsen's statement that movements in exchange markets had ìgone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals.î Thus, while we did not get a rapid adjustment in exchange rates on either day, perhaps more importantly, the dollar did gain in the four trading days following May 4th, as several large, short-dollar positions were covered and as other market participants began to accumulate dollars. Subsequently, the market has seen the Bundesbank lower official rates by 50 basis points and the Bank of Japan has modestly eased the call money rate. The move by the Bundesbank reflects a concern that continued mark strength and flows into short-term deposits are only compounding their problem with M3. It also reflects a belief that, in order to deal with the high growth in M3, a steeper German yield curve is needed to encourage capital formation. Mr. Chairman, I will need the Committee's ratification for our operations during the inter-meeting period. These include: First, the intervention operations I have described on behalf of the System in which we sold 625 million dollars-worth of German marks and 350 million dollars-worth of Japanese yen over the two days, April 29th and May 4th; and Second, the completion of our sales of the System's non-mark and non-yen foreign currency reserves: During the period, we sold 286 million, 785 thousand, 644 dollars-worth of five different currencies, more than 210 million of which was in Swiss francs. The Desk has also now liquidated the remaining non-mark and non-yen balances of the ESF and, therefore, both the System and the ESF now exclusively hold marks and yen. I would like to inform the Committee that, beginning with my quarterly report for the February-April period, I will be publishing the quarterly, period-end, dollar-equivalent mark and yen balances of the ESF and the System. The System's currency breakdown has not been previously released and the ESF currency breakdown was released only with a six-month lag. I believe that the publication of existing balances with a modest (one-month) lag is an appropriate level of disclosure and that the disposition of the non-mark and non-yen reserves provides a good opportunity to start and the Treasury has agreed. Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to answer questions on my report, on the intervention operations, on our reserve sales, and on my plan to release currency balances. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	6	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Peter? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	7	BROADDUS	 Peter, you mentioned communication. Most of the research I've seen suggests that intervention like this, if it has an effect, it's mainly by way of communicating future likely policy actions. With that in mind, what do you think the prospects for the dollar would be if we did not follow through at this point with pretty strong policy actions? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	59.0
199405	8	FISHER	 The dollar would trade off. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	9	BROADDUS	 Significant downside risk or— 	6	62	0.0	1.0	59.0
199405	10	FISHER	 It's very hard to put a number on that. Let me start by saying that if the Committee does something in the range of what the market is expecting, I'm not sure the dollar will move up very abruptly. I think it will tend to pip up and pip down a little bit as has happened with previous actions of the Committee. I think inaction by the Committee could have a downside risk to the dollar. The market is fairly neutral at this point. In the interbank sense, its position is such that inaction could result in significant dollar sales. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	11	JORDAN	 This is really a follow-up question. A coordinated intervention like the one in which we participated on May 4 carries with it the message that there was communication taking place about fundamentals. Everybody knows there was intervention with coordination. Can you share with us what the nature of that communication was among the central banks and ministries of finance, and whether the market correctly perceived what that communication was about? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	12	FISHER	" I think that the morning of May 4 began with President Tietmeyer's release of his statement that they did not have an interest in seeing the mark overvalued against the dollar. One consultation in which I was engaged was a discussion of the nature of the dollar's reaction to the mark and that it seemed to move awfully quickly and without regard to where people thought interest rates were going in each of the countries. The nature of the disturbance in the exchange market was the focus of my discussions with most of the other countries that I consulted with—I consulted with my counterparts in ﻿ the G-7 central banks and a few others. When I say ""disturbed"" market conditions, I'm referring to April 29 when very seasoned professionals were unable to get business done, unable to get phones picked up, and where the exchange market was not responding to fundamentals in the sense of the direction of interest rates being pretty well laid out for them and they seemed to get caught in other backwashes in the market. "	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	13	TRUMAN	 President Jordan, just to amplify on what Peter said, since you referred to the finance ministries, the principal consultations initially were between us and the Treasury Department, and between the Chairman and President Tietmeyer on the day before his statement. These consultations were followed up by some discussions about whether the Bundesbank felt it was appropriate to join in a coordinated operation. It was only on the morning of May 4 that there were any additional consultations with the Japanese along with the other central banks. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	14	JORDAN	 I assume that market participants don't know the magnitude of the intervention. I don't know how well they can guess at those things, but when I saw the amount that the Germans did and a statement by Mr. Issing, I read that as a lack of enthusiasm for the business. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	15	TRUMAN	 Well, I guess that's right, but I can tell you that the Bundesbank Directorate did discuss this operation. Whether Mr. Issing was present at that discussion I do not know. But both Mr. Tietmeyer's statement—the excerpts from his speech, which were deliberately released early—and the size of the Bundesbank operation were discussed by the Bundesbank Directorate. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	16	GREENSPAN	 Let me just add that I've had a number of conversations with Mr. Tietmeyer. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	17	JORDAN	 There was a press commentary after the May 4 action—I don't remember its precise contents—but people in the Treasury and in the Administration more generally supposedly viewed the action as an alternative to domestic monetary policy actions. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	18	GREENSPAN	 The issue never came up, at least not in my conversations. Governor Lindsey. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	19	LINDSEY	 Peter, given what the Chairman just said, which I agree with, and given what you said—that even if our policy moves along the lines of market expectations, there's not going to be upward movement in the dollar—that opens the question as to what is next and means that we may have another run on the dollar. How long do you expect the latest intervention to hold? I suppose the intervention last August bought us 9 or 10 months. I assume the second intervention will buy something less than 9 or 10 months. Do we have any ammunition left? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	20	FISHER	 With regard to the risk for the dollar going forward, I would again focus on the dollar/yen exchange rate. I think the operation and the action of the Bundesbank last week and whatever the Committee does in the realm of the expected, if I can put it that way, will tend to stabilize the dollar/mark rate. I don't see any big downward potential in the dollar/mark rate on its own terms. The yen, though, will be the locus of attention particularly in the run-up to the G-7 Summit this summer. That puts us back in the political context, and whether the Administration maintains its current formulation or reverses I think is a bigger risk for the dollar. However, if the dollar can get through the G-7 Summit roughly at its current level against the yen, then I may be sticking my head way out ﻿ but I would see slightly greater odds for dollar strength thereafter than dollar weakness. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	21	LINDSEY	 Does the potential reversion, which hopefully we won't have, that you mentioned involve foreign policy issues or does that include monetary policy statements? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	22	FISHER	 I'm not quite reading you. The monetary policy by the Administration or— 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	23	LINDSEY	 Yes, in other words dollar bashing being foreign exchange statements, how about Fed bashing being monetary policy statements. If there were a recurrence of the former, would that be harmful? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	24	FISHER	 That will tend to disturb the foreign exchange market. I think one of the very helpful official statements on May 4 was that by Mr. Altman to the effect that he had no argument with the Fed over interest rates. That really came on the heels of the Tietmeyer comment; that was a very useful setting for the operation. So obviously, yes, if some of that Administration enthusiasm for the current Fed policy were lost, that would tend to be destabilizing to the dollar. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	25	LINDSEY	 How about Congressional statements? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	26	FISHER	 I think they are more expected by the foreign exchange market than Administration statements; they may be in the same vein but I don't think they have the same effect. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	27	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	28	FORRESTAL	 Peter, I have a variation on Al Broaddus's question. As you know, the Europeans have been somewhat concerned about the effect of our actions on their long-term rates. Does the market anticipate or do you yourself think that if we were to take an action today that it would have an upward effect on European rates or have their actions sufficiently decoupled their rates from ours? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	39.0
199405	29	FISHER	 Well, if the history of the last three or four months is my guide, I'd have to say I would expect an impact on their long end. It's hard to imagine there won't be some such impact. I think, though, that we have seen more decoupling in this period— between the last meeting and now—than we saw in previous periods. So, in that sense I can be modestly hopeful that there would not be a negative impact on their long end. I think the Bundesbank's actions last week are probably going to be the most helpful in that regard. After the moves in mid-April had tended to squeeze out expectations of rate reductions, they have been put back in with last week's action and that may help decouple European rates. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	30	GREENSPAN	 Okay, any further questions? If not, would somebody like to move to ratify the actions of the Foreign Desk since the last meeting? 	6	63	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	31	SPEAKER	 (?) . So move. 	6	63	0.0	0.0	999.0

199405	34	LOVETT	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Desk operations were initially geared toward maintaining the slight firming of reserve conditions adopted at your meeting of March 22, consistent with Federal funds trading around 3-1/2 percent. After reserve pressures were firmed again on April 18, funds were expected to trade around 3-3/4 percent. Associated with each of these moves, the allowance for adjustment and seasonal borrowing was increased by $25 million. The borrowing allowance was increased by a similar amount on two other occasions as well to reflect rising seasonal borrowing. Thus the allowance was raised by a total of $100 million, and it now stands at $175 million. Actual borrowing in the period rose more or less in line with the increases in the allowance. We anticipated that the intermeeting period would be marked by large and growing reserve shortages, stemming primarily from seasonal movements in currency and in the Treasury's account at the Fed. The reserve need was expected to peak in early May when tax inflows into the Treasury's account topped out, and then to narrow somewhat as the Treasury balances returned to normal levels. As it turned out, the deepest projected reserve shortages never materialized. Cumulative individual income tax receipts for the April tax date fell well short of expectations, while the capacity of the tax and loan accounts to hold Treasury deposits proved to be unexpectedly high. Both developments limited the buildup in the Treasury's Fed account. The shortfall in taxes is somewhat puzzling, and we won't know the full story for some months. Judging by market commentary, however, we were not alone in our misestimates here. Even with lower Treasury balances, the steady growth in currency left substantial reserve deficiencies to be filled, which we did with a combination of outright and temporary operations. We purchased just over $5 billion of coupon securities in the market on April 12 and were also frequent buyers of bills from foreign accounts, acquiring another $1.6 billion through this channel. These purchases were suspended in mid-April, and plans for another outright market purchase were tabled after it became clear that reserve needs would not reach the proportions first envisioned. Thus, we did not use the expanded leeway you made available to us for the period and, in fact, had an unused cushion on the normal limit. Treasury operations were used to address the balance of reserve needs. The largest operations came in the first half of the period when the reserve shortages were greatest. Widespread market expectations in early May that a firming in policy might be imminent kept funds on the high side on a few mornings, and our market entries then were designed in part to avoid appearing to confirm this speculation. For the period up until April 18, the effective Federal funds rate averaged 3.51 percent. After the slight rise in reserve pressures, it averaged 3.71 percent. In the securities markets, the upward surge in interest rates continued, conditions were often turbulent, and seat belts became standard issue in the marketplace. Treasury coupon yields were up a net of 60 to 100 basis points during the period. Yields were up fairly uniformly across the maturity spectrum over the first half of the period, but since mid-April the yield curve has flattened modestly. Measured from just before the February 4 meeting, rates are up a net 150 to 180 basis points, with the bond yield about 120 basis points higher. The market's inability to find an anchor for itself is certainly a factor in the heightened volatility that has characterized trading over recent months. Views on the strength of the economy seem unusually wide, the assessment of policy ìneutralityî is a fluid one, and there are some worries that ìneutralityî may not be enough. Thus uncertainty premiums have certainly risen. The two nonfarm payroll employment reports released during the period--for March and April-- were both much stronger than generally anticipated and acted as catalysts for a major part of the move up in interest rates. In between these releases, rates also spurted higher after the slight firming in reserve pressures in mid-April; the timing of this move caught most participants off guard. The employment reports indicated to many analysts that inflationary pressures might be building some momentum, and rates across the curve adjusted to expectations that policy would need to move away from accommodation more vigorously than previously supposed. Some other reports on economic activity reinforced these views. However, the price statistics showed no acceleration in current inflation, and this helped to bring yields off their highest levels. A sagging dollar reinforced the trend toward higher yields for a time, although this pressure has abated since the recent coordinated response of central banks. We also continued to hear periodically of heavy selling of intermediate-dated Treasury securities by investors hedging their exposure in other declining markets, especially holders of mortgage-backed securities seeking to offset extension risk. A lot of portfolio adjustments appear to have been made, however, so this activity may have played itself out for now. At the same time though, experience of the last two months has left participants very wary about more esoteric mortgage-backed instruments, and apprehension remains that some large trading losses in these products have yet to come to light. Against this background, the market coped with new supply with mixed results. The Treasury paid down a small amount of bills on balance, but it still raised a net of $21 billion in coupons, despite the absence of a bond at the latest refunding auctions. Dealers often had difficulty gauging interest in fast-moving markets, and the release of some unexpected auction results triggered abrupt market adjustments. In other sectors, some would-be borrowers were warded off by the inhospitable climate, and the corporate and municipal calendars were relatively light. Right now, most analysts seem confident that the economy will retain at least a moderate degree of forward momentum over the remainder of this year. But there remains a considerable diversity of views about how rapidly the expansion will proceed, what the implications are for inflation, and the appropriate degree of policy restraint. Indicative of this, we have heard current quarter estimates for real GDP ranging from 2-1/2 to 6+ percent, with the central point in a 4 to 5 percent range. One thing that is believed with near unanimity is that some firming step will be taken at today's meeting. The debate is one of size. Just after the last employment release, a 50 basis point hike in the funds rate was probably about fully priced into yields. In the wake of the more recent price and sales data, some of that has been backed out as participants now see the possibility of a smaller move. Thus the market is currently priced somewhere between the two. Each option has its proponents and detractors and it is sometimes hard to sort out what the markets think the Fed will do versus what they think it should do relative to their own economic forecasts. A 25 basis point hike would undoubtedly disappoint those who think the Fed is already at risk of falling behind the need to reign in gathering inflationary pressures. Reflecting these worries, longer-term rates could react negatively unless incoming data show an economy clearly losing steam. Many participants have suggested that a larger move could lead to a further flattening of the yield curve, since yields have already come to incorporate expectations of a series of policy tightening steps ahead. However, the experience of the past three months cautions against completely dismissing the possibility that longer-term yields would rise in lock step. A 50 basis point hike would be seen as bringing the funds rate into the range most frequently judged to be ìneutral,î although in the lower end. The market would thus probably continue to expect further moves ahead but maybe not for a while. I should note that expectations of a move on the discount rate are also fairly widespread. 	6	61	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	35	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Joan? Jerry. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	36	JORDAN	 Before February when we started to announce our actions, it was standard practice in the daily program to protest a federal funds rate move away from the intended rate, maybe sometimes going against what you saw as the reserve needs of the current maintenance period. Since February we've announced our decisions three times, but in monitoring the Call over the eight weeks since the March meeting there were at least a couple of occasions where it appeared that you still needed to protest a rate to indicate that policy had not changed even in the absence of an announcement. It sounded like the Street still thinks that there is a possibility that we could change the funds target without announcing the change and therefore your daily program still has to account for that. Is that right? And what would help to clarify the situation for you? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	37	LOVETT	 Well, I think that what really is at stake is that while we have announced the changes that we have made, the market still sees itself as always looking for when we're going to make a change in the future. On occasions when they think we will or we should, they move the funds rate up immediately in the morning well before any kind of an announcement by the Committee would be likely. And the rate sits there until we demonstrate something to the contrary. And so on a couple of occasions where the market thought the data were such that perhaps there was going to be an action in coming days, they moved the funds rate up to reflect that possibility. Part of the theory that seems to be at work there is that if people really believe that the Fed will move, for some it means buying cheap funds relative to what they will be later. Moving the funds rate also is a way of testing the Fed to see what its stance is. And so even though we recently have announced our policy actions, what we respond to is the market moving ahead of our announcement of Fed policy actions. I think that's always going to happen. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	38	JORDAN	 Are there still people out there who think we might change the intervention level on the funds rate without an announcement ? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	39	LOVETT	 Yes, there are some people who still think that's a possibility; it hasn't been ruled out because we have mentioned that these announcements have not necessarily been for all time. I think the market tends to set up for itself a series of time points. It looks for announcements on the discount rate now within a certain period of time in the morning, policy announcements any time after that, but always the possibility of something being signaled ahead of the announcement. Even if that is not forthcoming, there are circumstances when they move the funds rate ahead of the Fed. For example, on the day of the employment data release on Friday, May 6, most people didn't think that the Fed would take action that day, but they still moved the funds rate up on the theory that perhaps the Federal Reserve would do something on the following Monday. And thus the constellation of where the funds rate would be over the balance of the period suggested that it was worth pushing the rate up. ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	40	JORDAN	 If they've come to believe that all increases in the funds rate will be accompanied by an announcement, then the absence of an announcement would seem to lessen the need to protest. A protest action would occur if you saw a need to drain reserves but you felt you had to add reserves because the funds rate was too high. Shouldn't the absence of an announcement, which would indicate that the funds rate target has not changed, have the same effect as your protest move? When you do your protest move you're going to have to wind up taking more back out than you otherwise would. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	41	LOVETT	 Well, I guess it's really their anticipatory moves that we're talking about; it's not the actual Fed moves; it's the market anticipating the Fed moves before they occur. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	42	JORDAN	 Well, what's the difference between our failure to issue a press release and a protest action by the Desk? 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	43	LOVETT	 Perhaps with the passage of time, as people become accustomed to our new disclosure practices, those anticipatory moves will not require our protest actions. But we're always going to have anticipatory moves; I think that's a given. How the market would view our absence from protesting I think would require more experience with our new disclosure practices. I don't think there's enough experience with them now for the market to be confident that, had we stayed out when they pushed the funds rate a point higher, we were not paving the way for the Committee. We're not in the position to pave the way for the Committee. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	44	KOHN	 The day before the March FOMC meeting nobody expected us to change policy that day or to announce a change that day but funds were still high. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	45	LOVETT	 Right. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	46	KOHN	 And if we had not gone in, that would have looked as if the decision somehow had been made ahead of the meeting. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	47	LOVETT	 Or that we were trying to get the market ready for it—to pave the way for a decision. I think that there just has not been enough experience with the announcements for people to feel comfortable in terms of what the timing of those announcements is and so forth. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	48	JORDAN	 I would hope that over time one of the benefits of announcing would be the leeway to allow the funds rate to move on a daily basis over a little wider range without worrying about an incorrect perception of current policy. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	58.0
199405	49	GREENSPAN	 That's one of the advantages of announcing. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	47.0
199405	50	LOVETT	 Yes. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	51	LINDSEY	 Joan, just a quick question. What is your estimate of the Treasury balance shortfall? ﻿ 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	52	LOVETT	 Well, relative to our expectations on the April tax collection themselves, we fell short by $12 billion. And if we take April and May combined there was a big catchup in early May. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0
199405	53	LINDSEY	 Yes. 	6	62	0.0	1.0	54.0
199405	54	LOVETT	 They only fell short by about $9 billion. We had forecast an increase in the April tax take of something in the neighborhood of 25 percent over the level a year ago and it appears to be coming in between 5 and 10 percent above. Everyone seems to have had those same kinds of overestimates, so people are still trying to find out if there will be some offsets in June or whether in fact all these adjustments were made last year and people really did get ahead of the change in their tax liabilities. 	6	62	0.0	0.0	999.0

199405	58	TRUMAN	 The basic thrust of the staff forecast for the external sector at this meeting is little changed from what we have presented for several meetings: recovery in the foreign industrial countries, in the context of slowing United States economic growth, should combine to produce a less negative effect of the external sector on United States aggregate demand as we progress through the forecast period. While the modifications in this basic projection introduced in the May Greenbook were minor, I believe that several issues in the outlook merit comment. First, how are we doing on the projected recovery in the foreign industrial countries? We believe the recovery is on course; if anything, it is slightly stronger than we had earlier expected. Indeed, since late last year [November], the average level of economic activity in the foreign industrial countries projected for the end of our forecast period -- Q4 1995 -- has been raised almost half of a percentage point; a downward adjustment in our forecast for Japan has been more than offset by positive adjustments to our outlooks for the continental European countries. As an aside, I would note that we have scaled back modestly our projection for the developing countries in light of weaker prospects for Mexico and China and in response to higher long-term interest rates in the industrial countries. This brings me to my second issue: How has the global increase in long-term interest rates influenced our thinking? First a few facts: Since the end of 1993 [December average], foreign [G-10] ten-year interest rates have risen about 100 basis points on average, while United States rates have risen about 150 basis points; increases in individual foreign countries have ranged from less than 50 basis points (Italy) to more than 175 basis points (United Kingdom and Canada). Over the same period, foreign three-month rates have declined 25 basis points on average, while United States rates have risen almost 150 basis points; changes in short rates abroad have ranged from a reduction of 175 basis points in Belgium and 100 basis points in Germany to no change in the United Kingdom and Sweden and an increase of more than 250 basis points in Canada -- quite a diverse experience at the short end. Our interpretation of these developments is tentative; it combines elements general to all countries and many specific to individual countries. Focusing on the general elements, we believe that there has been a substantial improvement in confidence about prospects for economic activity in most foreign industrial countries; this can be seen in the modest upward revision in our own outlook even with the rise in long-term rates. However, the increase in foreign rates seems larger than can be explained alone by better prospects for aggregate demand. We believe some of the increase is a temporary phenomenon sparked by the rise in dollar interest rates and by an overcorrection following the bond-market rallies of late last year. Against this background, we anticipate a reduction in long-term rates abroad by about 50 basis points on average -- about the same adjustment as Mike has assumed for United States long rates, but the foreign adjustment is assumed to occur mostly before the end of this year. Meanwhile short rates abroad are assumed to edge off about another 25 basis points on average. This brings me to my third issue: the dollar! Why has it not risen? As I noted, while United States dollar interest rates (short and long) have risen, foreign long rates have moved up as well; long-term interest differentials tend to have a stronger statistical relationship with exchange rates than do short-term differentials. The more restrained rise of the long-term differential may explain why the dollar has not risen as much as might otherwise have been expected, but it does not explain why the dollar has depreciated. As Peter has noted, we do not lack explanations for the dollar's depreciation: trade tensions between the United States and Japan, an increase in relative inflation expectations, a failure of short-term dollar interest rates to rise as rapidly as expected, and expanding United States external deficits are only four plausible candidates. However, none of the individual stories nor their sum is particularly satisfying. Thus, when it came to constructing an exchange rate projection to use in our forecast, we were confronted with additional uncertainty on top of our usual humility. We chose to lower the path of the dollar that had been incorporated in our past several forecasts by about 3 percent; the reduction is about in line with the decline of the dollar over the past several months, and we are projecting no further change from that lower level. As was explained in the Greenbook, this is a mugwump projection that can be thought of as an average of two scenarios. In one scenario, the rise in United States short-term interest rates assumed in our basic forecast, combined with the modest continued decline in rates abroad and some unwinding of the other influences behind the dollar's recent decline, convinces the market that the dollar should appreciate over the next couple of years -- this would be consistent with many forecasts of exchange rates. In the alternative scenario, interest rates also behave as the staff assumes. However, the rise in dollar interest rates is substantially less than the market expects, and this disappointment, along with other economic, financial and political developments, contributes to further downward pressure on the dollar. Take your pick! This brings me to my last issue, what difference does our projection for a lower dollar make in our forecast? At the margin, the three-percent downward adjustment in the path for the dollar contributes to a somewhat less negative external sector. For example, our projection of real net exports of goods and services in the fourth quarter of 1995 is about $10 billion stronger than in the January Greenbook. At the same time, higher import prices and a diminished drag from the external sector contribute to potential inflation. If the United States economy were not as close as it is to capacity, a downward adjustment in our forecast for the dollar would not have very profound implications for the overall staff forecast. However, we now are in a situation in which if a few elements of our forecast break the same way, the consequences would be not only somewhat stronger economic activity in the short run, but a pronounced pick-up in inflation pressures in the period beyond. Thus, I thought it might be useful to remind the Committee how we calibrate the risks to our forecasts that might be associated with a considerably weaker dollar. Based upon staff econometric models, an additional 10-percent depreciation of the dollar in the second half of this year, with United States short-term interest rates unchanged from our baseline, would add about one percent to the level of real GDP in the fourth quarter of 1995 and an equal amount to the price level. The unemployment rate would be about 1/2 percent lower. Mike Prell will continue our presentation. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	59	PRELL	 As Joan noted, a bit more diversity has recently begun to creep into private economic forecasts. To some extent, the emerging differences reflect uncertainty about Fed policy; but they also reflect differing opinions about the underlying strength of the economy, about the likely response of demand to higher interest rates, and about what circumstances might precipitate a significant pickup in inflation. I'm going to address these three issues. First, on the underlying strength of activity, there was a rash of comments last week from Wall Street types to the effect that the economy might not be quite so robust as had been contemplated in the prior consensus forecast. The seeds of doubt probably were sowed a couple of weeks earlier by the surprising, low GDP figure in BEA's initial first-quarter report, which also showed final demand flagging and inventories surging. Then, last Thursday, that doubt was reinforced when the advance estimate of April retail sales showed a considerable decline. On the other side, though, are the advocates of the strong growth view, who are saying that the economy is in the midst of a powerful capital spending boom, and that consumers are feeling better and will be spending freely. Some of the more ebullient forecasters are looking for GDP growth this quarter of 5 percent or more, also as Joan noted. We probably fall somewhat above the median with respect to the current pace of activity. Recent data indicate that the increase in inventories in the first quarter was much smaller than BEA assumed, and stock-building probably will be a plus in the near term. And, from our perspective, it is more sensible to view the April softness in retail sales as a minor pause after two whopping monthly increases. But the most compelling evidence that the economy is still doing well is the labor market data. The average monthly increase in payroll employment thus far this year has exceeded the earlier pace, and the workweek has lengthened. Even allowing for the likelihood of a marked slowing of productivity growth in the wake of the late '93 surge, the strong increase in aggregate hours would seem to support our projection of better than 3 percent GDP growth over the first half. Is stronger growth possible this half? Sure it is. But we think that we've already built in a healthy rebound in construction after the winter dip. We are anticipating a strong gain in outlays for business equipment. We are looking for a firming in federal purchases and a smaller decline in net exports. And we expect to see a decent increase in consumer spending, despite some inhibition to auto sales from the limited supply of popular domestic models. I should underscore that last point about autos, for it seems to us that a key argument against a still bigger increase in GDP this quarter is the likely 1-1/2 percentage point drag from the decline, on a seasonally adjusted basis, in motor vehicle production. This morning, we received one more piece of information on how the economy is doing: the April data on housing. Total starts fell 2-1/2 percent. Most important, single-family starts dropped 4-1/2 percent, to 1.21 million units. That rate is appreciably above the first-quarter pace, as we expected in light of the winter delays, but it is also well below the fourth-quarter average. This is consistent with our view that higher mortgage rates already have begun to put a damper on residential investment. This brings me to the broader issue of the response of economic activity to past and prospective increases in interest rates. As I'm sure you are aware, the range of interest rate forecasts is very wide right now. At the low end are the bond market bulls who, though perhaps abandoning their earlier call of ì5 by '95î for the 30- year Treasury bond yield, are still predicting a steep decline in rates by year-end. From their viewpoint, the run-up in long-term rates is unjustified by fundamentals and reflects a combination of unwarranted inflation fears, temporary selling pressure exerted by weak holders such as hedge funds and naive mutual fund investors, and an added risk premium related to temporary market volatility and illiquidity. At the other end of the spectrum are those who believe that, before the Fed has reined in the cyclical forces in the economy, short rates will have risen several more percentage points and the yield on the long bond may approach double-digits. On the bearish side, one will find many people who adhere to the view that aggregate demand is extremely interest-inelastic when the economy has gotten up a head of steam, and that monetary restraint only becomes effective when banks and other lenders are not only raising their rates but also are closing their windows to potential borrowers. In the bear camp one will, of course, also find those who are pessimistic about the longerrange prospects for inflation, because they think that the Fed lacks either the will or the skill to achieve its stated objective. Again, we find ourselves somewhere between the extremes, acknowledging sympathies with bits of both these analyses. As you know, we've changed our own interest rate forecast a good deal since the September meeting, which was just before the bond market started to weaken. Long rates currently are about 1-3/4 percentage points higher now than we anticipated at that time, and our projected levels in the latter part of 1995 are about a point higher. The upward revision reflects not only the fact of what has happened to rates in the interim, including a Fed tightening that we had not assumed, but also our interpretation of the incoming economic news. The surge in GDP late last year, and the apparently sustained momentum thus far in 1994, has persuaded us that the underlying strength of aggregate demand at given interest rate levels is greater than we had anticipated. Our projection of a downward movement in bond yields by next year does share some common ground with the bullish view I portrayed a moment ago; we do think that rates will tend to fall as some calm returns to the markets and inflation fears are proven excessive. And we can easily conceive of long rates coming down more over time than we've projected. But we also think that, if a major rally were to occur in the near term, it might result in inadequate financial restraint to produce the slowing of GDP growth we've projected. While we think that the recent behavior of housing, for example, demonstrates that the economy does respond to higher interest rates, we agree that the interest-elasticity of demand overall is not great in the short run. And we recognize that, far from closing their windows, banks have been moving toward more aggressive lending postures. I might offer, parenthetically, a conjecture in that regard, however: If rates were to continue rising, and bank securities portfolios were to suffer further capital losses, the combination of market-value accounting and the new regulatory penalties for weakened capital ratios might impose some constraints on the lending capacity of at least some institutions. Having wandered a bit, let me sum up our bottom line on the interest rate issue: first, we think that recent long rates should be high enough to slow the expansion appreciably; second, a further rise in short rates would buttress the restraint by raising the cost of short-term credit, and it likely will be needed to maintain the present level of long rates when the extra term premiums associated with recent market turbulence shrink; and third, we think the risks may be tilted toward having to do more tightening of money market conditions than we've assumed, rather than less. Now, all of this analysis has taken as given that a deceleration of activity on the order of what we've projected is needed to at least hold the line on inflation through 1995. I don't think this would be questioned by the majority of private forecasters, who generally see inflation rising noticeably above 3 percent by next year, with real GDP growth just fractionally faster than we've projected and an unemployment rate declining further. But there is a counterview in some circles that, either because there is still a good deal of slack in the economy or because the way the world works has changed, there is no looming inflationary risk. Let me just offer a few observations that seem to me to caution against relying on the more optimistic view. First, as you know, sensitive industrial materials prices have been rising for a while now. And, in the case of consumer prices, the core CPI has risen at a 3.0 percent rate over the past six months, versus 2.5 percent in the prior six. We do not think that the inflation trend has turned upward, and these data are somewhat reminiscent of last year's scare; but it is also true that, when a turn does occur, it could well start with numbers just like these. Moreover, these price data are not inconsistent with a variety of signals--statistical and anecdotal--that also are sounding a cautionary note. On the statistical side, resource utilization has increased substantially of late, and, by our reckoning, the economy has at least neared the point where wage and price pressures might be expected to mount. Certainly, they did when similar levels of resource use were reached in 1987-88, though the circumstances differ in some important respects. Notably, back then, oil prices had recently rebounded, the dollar had depreciated, and poor crops were pushing up food prices. We at least hope that these events will not repeat themselves in a significant way. On the anecdotal side, I've recently heard a number of industrial economists speak of their companies' booming sales, growing backlogs, and customers on allocation; while they said that competition is fierce, and that management is still stressing cost reduction and reluctant to undermine customer relationships by raising prices, they also spoke of renewed ìpricing leverageî and ìpricing flexibility,î and admitted that price increases had been taken or scheduled. They then said, ìBut, Mike, don't get worried, because these are just relative price changes,î or ìnormal cyclical developments.î I gather many of you have heard similar remarks from Reserve Bank directors. The point I'm making is that there has been a change in tone from what we've witnessed heretofore in this expansion. I don't think that we've had a shift yet to pervasive inflationary psychology. But, these anecdotes are compatible with our view that the economy has used up much of its room for above-trend growth. 	11	11	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	60	GREENSPAN	 Questions for either gentleman? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	61	PARRY	 Mike, I have a question about the inflation numbers: Last year at this time we had an unpleasant inflation surprise. This year it seems, if you look at the year-over-year comparisons at least, that the consumer inflation numbers are coming in somewhat below the forecast. Part of that is probably due to recent changes in the seasonal factors for the CPI, but that probably is not a complete explanation; I don't think it is. Is there some perspective as far as that development is concerned that ought to be brought into this discussion? I know you cited the 6-month inflation rates and they don't look quite as favorable. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199405	62	PRELL	 Well, clearly, I was trying to suggest that for someone who wanted to look for evidence that things were not going so well. We do still regard these longer trends in the indexes as quite relevant to gauging the behavior or the direction of inflation. Last year, to be sure, the spurt that we saw was, it appears now, considerably a matter of seasonal adjustment problems. Looking back now, things don't appear quite so bad. Our recent experience has been a shade better than we anticipated a few months ago. The very latest data aren't any better than anticipated. If there has been some good news recently, it's been on the labor cost side. The employment cost index in the first quarter was considerably lower than we had anticipated, and in our view that sets the world right in a sense. As you know, we had wondered a bit about why ECI increases had leveled out last year in the face of unemployment rates considerably higher than they are now, the substantial reduction in the current inflation, and to some degree in shorter-run inflation expectations. So, we give some credence to those numbers and it has led us to trim a little off ﻿ our wage forecast or our total compensation forecast on the benefits side going forward. And so we are reasonably comfortable that, if the economy follows the path we're talking about, the inflation trend will remain stable to perhaps a shade lower. But I did want to highlight some risks and certainly to underscore our view that the room to maneuver here in terms of faster growth than we're projecting seems to us rather limited, if one really is concerned about inflation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	63	PARRY	 Did you say that the very latest data are in accord with expectations? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199405	64	PRELL	 Current CPI. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	65	PARRY	 Well, the thing I'm thinking about is that the 2.4 percent change in the total CPI over the past 12 months and the 2.7 or 2.8 percent change in the core rate over the same period are a little better than expectations. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199405	66	PRELL	 Yes, for the total over recent months, we're doing somewhat better. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	67	PARRY	 Okay. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	45.0
199405	68	GREENSPAN	 Governor LaWare. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	69	LAWARE	 Mike, you indicated that you thought there might be some significant revision in the first-quarter GDP number when we get the revision. Will that be at the end of this month? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	50.0
199405	70	PRELL	 Yes. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	71	LAWARE	 Would you share that with us? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	50.0
199405	72	PRELL	 Well, I can address this on two levels. One is simply the arithmetic of plugging in the actual data that are now available in place of the assumptions that the BEA had made. And this is primarily data that have changed on inventories, retail sales, and construction. On net, those numbers would seem to chop a good percentage point off of the 2.6 percent GDP growth rate that was estimated initially. Now, we're anticipating that some of the incoming data, particularly on trade, perhaps will come in better than BEA had assumed. And ultimately, perhaps on the next round of revisions when there are some further changes, for example, in construction, we may get closer to the 2.6 percent. So, notionally, in framing this forecast we've been thinking that GDP in the first quarter was probably a little less than the 2.6 percent, probably 2 percent plus rather than what the incoming data just mechanically would suggest. And then we made an estimate of, in essence, the best change for the second quarter, and that's what gives us an estimate of something over 3 percent for the first half. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	73	LAWARE	 Thank you. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	50.0
199405	74	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	75	BOEHNE	 There has been a fair amount of discussion about capacity—how much of it we have left before we have inflationary pressures—and about the growth potential of the economy. Most of ﻿ these estimates, particularly the growth potential, can change with seemingly small changes in assumptions, like labor force participation rates, productivity increases, and that sort of thing. I presume that you are thinking of a capacity growth rate of maybe 2-1/2 percent or maybe 2-1/2 to 3 percent. Do you have a view as to whether we're likely to be on the high end of a range like that or on the low end, given the recent trends in labor participation and what appears to be fairly strong capital spending, especially equipment spending? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	33.0
199405	76	PRELL	 Our working assumption is that, in the near term, potential output growth is about 2-1/2 percent. I think one might take a more optimistic view of the underlying productivity trend- assign more of the increase we've seen over the past few years to perhaps sustainable underlying trend growth, as opposed to the normal cyclical component. But we think that's going out on a limb a bit at this point. We've already assumed a considerable pickup in trend productivity growth from what we were experiencing prior to the 1990s. On the labor force side, we haven't seen much lift yet in labor force participation and the population trends are very hard to read. It's conceivable that the trend in labor force growth isn't even quite so strong as we've anticipated, which is not robust by historical standards. We feel that the 2-1/2 percent potential is a reasonable working assumption. We don't advocate that the Committee take that number as gospel and make its policies on that assumption and close its eyes to the incoming evidence. But we think that's a reasonable estimate for now. I must say that, for example, in a recent Business Week article there was much talk about how the world was changing in terms of productivity growth, and I think high-tech investment is one of the elements in that story. In quantitative terms, the net investment from that kind of equipment isn't very large because it's rather short-lived; it turns over relatively rapidly. So the capital stock in that sense isn't growing very rapidly. But if you believe that it is affording firms the opportunity to reorganize in major ways the way they do things and is really creating disproportionate efficiences in a sense, then I think you can make a case for stronger growth. The other thing I found puzzling in that article was that it said because of all of this, one needn't worry so much about inflation. And the key argument it made was that if there were pressures, firms would just ship production abroad. Well, that's a rather puzzling argument. It says basically that you can avoid inflation by sucking in imports, but that doesn't really enhance domestic economic growth in the GDP sense. So, I think there's some loose thinking behind some of the more optimistic stories. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	77	GREENSPAN	 President Jordan. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	78	JORDAN	 First, to follow-up on Bob Parry's question about the inflation statistics, the first four months of 1993 were initially reported as averaging 4.3 percent. We use a thing that we call the median CPI as an alternative to the CPI less food and energy to try to monitor what these numbers are telling us as the year unfolds. We were getting 3.6 percent for those first four months versus the official 4.3 percent. Now that they've revised the seasonals, they're reporting the first four months of last year at 3.4 percent; that brought it back close to where we were. For the first four months of this year, we're getting 2.9 versus the 2.3 percent. ﻿ So as an exercise as to what the seasonals did, I had the staff apply last year's seasonal factors to the first four months of this year, and that would have produced a 3.1 percent rate for those months, the same range as where the median is. That tells me that .8 would have to be redistributed over the subsequent eight months of the year if we were still operating with the last year's seasonals. Now, I don't know whether the new seasonals are truth or not, but I do know that other things the same in the raw component, the final eight months of the year will have a higher inflation rate, and I don't know which months the seasonals stole from. But it biases me toward saying that it's more likely for higher inflation numbers to get reported rather than lower from this point. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	79	PRELL	 Well, President Jordan, let me just say that we have no reason to think that this hasn't been a distinct improvement in the seasonal adjustment. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	80	JORDAN	 Right, I don't disagree; it's closer to the median, though. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	81	PRELL	 Well, actually, the median generally has been running very close to the regular core inflation number over the past year. They are almost identical on a 12-month basis. But the key here is that I don't see on technical grounds a reason to be very concerned at this point that, in essence, the recent data have been overstating the degree of deceleration and that we're going to get a vast surprise later on simply because the adjustment in the seasonal factors has been overdone. The methods seem to us to be reasonable: We consulted with them during the process of their revisions, and don't believe that they really are missing significant residual seasonalities. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	82	JORDAN	" Well, I think that the median and the so-called ""core"" track very well, within a couple of tenths, most of the time and furthermore over longer periods of time the median and the actual CPI come out to be virtually identical, but the median for these four months currently is running 2.9, and I have more confidence in that than I do in the 2.3 that was reported for the first four months because the core is 2.7 for those months. "	12	12	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	83	PRELL	 Yes, but that's splitting hairs in terms of the measurement accuracy. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	84	JORDAN	 Well, not quite because remember last year we got the dip in the latter months of year as initially reported; those got revised, too. If the median is telling the truth and we have had four months of 2.3 and it's really going to average out 2.9 over the year, then it's going to have to be running a few months up in the range of 3.3 to 3.4. We just have to expect that that's the way the numbers will work out. This is not saying what's right or wrong but that this is the way the statistics were kept. The other question is about the Greenbook. I try hard to assess what I think about the economy versus what the Greenbook says and use the latter as a starting point to understand the logic of how policy plays into the numbers that you provide us with. And I have gotten sort of comfortable with the familiar reversion pattern that whatever happens—the surprises in the fourth-quarter of 1993 and the ﻿ fourth-quarter of 1992 were on the up side but we had a weak first half of last year—there's a tendency for real output to revert over some period or horizon to some idea of potential capacity. And that goes in both directions; it's symmetrical. The CPI projections tend to revert to something under 3 percent out there someplace, so that gives us nominal. As I read this Greenbook the logic of the policy linkages seemed to be clear, but I want your response on two things. One, am I getting it right? Second, where is the vulnerability? That is, increases in short-term interest rates hold down, you say, bond and equity prices which in turn influence real output, namely investment spending including residential and nonresidential investment spending. And as people see the effects of that long rate on output, that influences inflation expectations as the economy converges on potential, and that finally influences what actual CPI inflation turns out to be. So is that a correct characterization of the linkages and, if so, where is it vulnerable? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	85	PRELL	 Well, I think it's pretty close with the minor exception that I would suggest that, in terms of the inflation forecast, the behavior that we're predicting is not simply a function of expectations but also of our judgment that the output path producing the unemployment rate and capacity utilization rates leaves a modest amount of slack in the system. So that force is tending to tamp down wage and price increases. In terms of the risks in this outlook, they are so numerous and disparate that it's hard to know where to begin. That isn't particularly different from any other forecast. This may be one of the reasons why the markets seem so unsettled and volatile; and like many other forecasters we have a hard time, in light of the dramatic reversal of the bond market, judging where the equilibrium may be. The market movements have been very fast and very large, and judging what the impact will be as we move forward several months or quarters is a very tricky business. As I suggested, there are considerable differences of opinion among private forecasters and we think they mirror some of these uncertainties. On the one hand, there is a view that we are in the midst of what will be a dramatic and very well sustained capital spending boom that will interact in some sense on the trade side where we will be very competitive. In that view, as these foreign economies pick up, we will see tremendous increases in exports, and this kind of lift will provide the income to support a healthy rate of consumer spending right on through 1995. On the other side, there are those who are beginning to find some hints of weakness here and there; they think the higher rates that we have, assuming they are sustained, will have an even more serious damping effect on the housing sector and that consumer demand will be damped not only by that but also by the effects of the tax increases beyond what we had anticipated. They see that saving is already at a low level, that we've already seen increases in debt and probably will have more ahead, so consumers may feel more constrained down the road. And certainly even with the recent better news there are those who are skeptical about how quickly the foreign economies will come on and thus what kind of impetus we'll be getting in the next few quarters from a diminished drag on the trade side. So that's sort of a range of some of the thinking that I see, and there certainly are elements of risks in those directions in our view. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0

199405	87	HOENIG	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question has been answered. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	56.0
199405	88	GREENSPAN	 President Broaddus. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	89	BROADDUS	 Mike, in the same vein as Jerry's question, it seems to me that much of the overall profile of the projection depends on the idea that the recent run-up in long rates is going to restrain the economy in the future. In that context—I know you think that most of the recent increase has been real—I would be interested in knowing particularly with regard to the 30-year Treasury bond rate, which is currently about 7-1/2 percent, roughly how much of that you think is real. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	59.0
199405	90	PRELL	 Well, if I take the base as last October's low when the rate was about 5.8 percent, that's an increase of some 17 0 basis points, if I've done my arithmetic correctly. I would judge that more than half of that is real. That's a seat of the pants judgment and I can't point to any clear-cut analytical support for it. I certainly see nothing in changes in inflation forecasts going out the short distance for which most professional forecasters' results are available; and nothing in the household surveys indicates that the longer-range inflation expectations have risen dramatically. Looking at stock market behavior and trying to intuit something about what may have happened to the real returns that are built in there, I see a significant element that must have been real as opposed to inflation. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	91	BROADDUS	 I'm just trying to pin it down a little more. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	59.0
199405	92	PRELL	 In looking at the behavior in the housing market, as limited as the evidence is at this point, people have not on the evidence dismissed these higher rates as being simply a reflection of higher inflation in terms of what they might expect for their wages or for house prices going forward. We wouldn't have seen as much effect as we have perhaps if there really had been that kind of inflammation of inflation expectations. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	93	BROADDUS	 But would you say that currently, taking the 3 0-year bond rate, that maybe 4 percentage points of it is real? Am I doing my arithmetic right? 	12	12	1.0	1.0	59.0
199405	94	PRELL	 Well, looking out over a 5- to 10-year span, I guess I would be more comfortable asserting that market expectations would be on the order of 4 percent inflation. They could be a little lower, but that would leave the real rate a little lower than it has been. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	95	KOHN	 The backward-looking survey indicators contained in the financial indicators package put real rates at 3 to 4 percent. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	96	BROADDUS	 Wouldn't 4 percent be on the high side historically for the longest real rate? That's really what I'm trying to get at. 	12	12	1.0	1.0	59.0
199405	97	KOHN	 Yes, except for the 1980s; the rate is about where it was for much of the 1950s and 1960s. ﻿ 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	98	BROADDUS	 But by longer-term standards, it would be quite high I think. I tried to figure that out in the current— 	12	12	1.0	1.0	59.0
199405	99	PRELL	 Indeed, that's one of the reasons, given our assumption that there will be at least mild fiscal restraint and that inflation expectations will be going down, I think there is a discernible downside risk to our bond yield forecast; we have it really not getting much below 7 percent by the latter half of 1995. 	12	12	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	100	GREENSPAN	 Further questions for the gentlemen? If not, would somebody like to start the Committee discussion? 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	101	HOENIG	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our District continues to be healthy. Housing has remained very strong, although many now expect that perhaps some slowing will come with higher interest rates. Manufacturing continues to improve. Our auto plants are still producing at very high levels. The energy area remains mixed but natural gas activity is still good. Farm income may be hurt a little by some fall in cattle prices, but grain prices should be good, and therefore income should be reasonably good overall. An executive with one of the larger rail lines in our region that goes to the West told me that activity has never been this high. Not just whole shipments to fill backlogs but intermodal transportation volumes are at record highs, and shippers are increasing their prices and the increases are sticking. The banking industry has not been this strong in our District in three decades. Our classified asset levels are as low as they've been since the data have been collected. We had the lowest number of banks losing money since the '70s, and earnings are above 1.3 percent on assets. Loan-to-asset ratios have risen from a low of about 48 to over 50 percent. Loan demand, judging from what bankers tell us, is picking up. There is this issue that was mentioned earlier with some interest rate rises—the FASB rule and what it might do to the banks and their level of activity. That has not been a major concern to date. Capital ratios at our banks are averaging over 8-1/2 percent. So things are generally good in the region. As far as the national outlook, we have differences with the Greenbook in some individual areas, but overall we are fundamentally in line with the Greenbook growth projections. We do have a little higher inflation projected than does the Greenbook, partly because of basic natural rate of unemployment issues and those sorts of things. Other than that we're in line with the Greenbook. That concludes my comments. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	56.0
199405	102	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	103	KEEHN	 In terms of the District, the underlying level of activity, which of course has been strong, just continues to gain momentum. The auto industry, for example, which directly and indirectly so dominates our area, continues to exceed our earlier expectations. Second-quarter production schedules were set at 12 percent over last year, and since retail inventories are at relatively low levels, even if there is a fall-off in sales this ought not to affect the production schedules. The third quarter at this point seems a long way off; nonetheless, the early expectations are that the production levels will be up very substantially over last year. And, ﻿ of course, the third quarter is normally a very slow quarter. While the April auto sales were down a bit from the first-quarter level, some of that reduction results from the shortage of the better selling models. Production capacity constraints really are getting to be an increasing problem. In this environment, the steel business continues to be excellent; the raw production side of the industry is operating essentially flat out. And it's more than just autos. The appliance business is also very strong, as is the demand for other housing- related steel products. There is, though, a little capacity available in the finishing end of the steel business, and the majors will be increasing their purchases of semi-finished steel products from foreign sources to fill out that available capacity. An activity that I haven't mentioned in years because it's been so absolutely moribund is the rail car manufacturing business. There also has been a decided pickup in demand as the fleet has gotten a lot older. While people in the industry do not expect that deliveries will be quite as high as some of the published reports that you've seen, nonetheless, we are told that shipments of 35,000 to 40,000 cars annually over the next few years seem reasonable. Not surprisingly, prices of rail cars are being increased this year, and there is a more substantial price increase scheduled for next year. The heavy-duty truck business has been even stronger since the last meeting. The Class 8 sales forecast has been raised again, this time to 195,000 units, and the sales level will be constrained by capacity limitations as will the sales of medium-size trucks. GM, for example, would like to add a third shift to one of their medium truck production facilities, but they just can't get the qualified workers. Offsetting this somewhat, retail sales so far in May are reported to be a little slower than earlier in the year, but I think this is a comparative issue, not one of weakness in market conditions. Sales of some items, such as home appliances, continue at a very fast pace. A very large retailer told me the other day that their sales of appliances, for example, in April were 25 percent over the sales level of last year. In the ag sector, so far the planting has been going well. Corn and soybean acreage is expected to be up this year, and both the corn and soybean plantings, as of last week at least, were well ahead of the normal schedules. It is, of course, a long, long way to harvest. Nonetheless, we are off to a good start with what are regarded as generally good moisture conditions. Sales of ag equipment are well ahead of last year, with sales of large tractors some 18 percent higher than last year,- and last year was, in a comparative sense, quite strong. All of this strength certainly gives a very positive tone to the District, but I do think there are some worrisome signs on the pricing front. In the steel business, I've mentioned at a past meeting or two that there is a $10 a ton price increase scheduled for July 1, and at this point virtually everybody expects that to stick. In addition, the majors are adjusting discounts and pricing for extras, which will have the effect of raising steel prices by about another 2 percent. Aluminum manufacturers are reducing their production to firm up the prices. Admittedly the latter are at low levels, but the reduced production levels nonetheless have resulted in higher prices, and I am told that the Russians are cooperating with this effort. One very large user of aluminum told me the other day ﻿ that they are forecasting about a 17 percent increase in the price they will pay for aluminum next year. Many other manufacturers report an upward shift in the cost of their raw material and component purchases. By no means is this a dramatic shift, but it indicates just a different attitude and a different tone out there than has been the case in the past. Some, of course, are finding ways to pass these increases through in the form of higher prices for their products. For example, although their heavy truck prices won't be increased this year, one very large manufacturer is planning a pretty significant price increase next year. Of course, retail auto prices are being increased as we go along here. Despite all this, so far there does not seem to be any upward pressure on the wage front. Though everybody we talk to says there is a shortage of qualified labor, so far at least it has not resulted in higher wage rates; but I just wonder how long that can continue to hold. With regard to the national economy, our numbers are essentially in line with those of the Board staff. I do think that at this point the risks, both in terms of growth and inflation, are on the up side. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	35.0
199405	104	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	105	PARRY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Part of the Twelfth District continues to show very strong growth. Outside of California, the growth of employment between March 1993 and March 1994 was 3.3 percent. And over that period three states--Nevada, Idaho, and Utah- ranked first, second, and third in the nation in terms of job growth, and Arizona ranked seventh. In the Pacific Northwest, we see economic growth that is best characterized as being pretty solid, but at a less spectacular pace than in the other states that I mentioned. I might note that I had an opportunity to meet with the head of a major construction company based in Oregon; he's been in the business for 3 0 years and he said this is the strongest period that he has ever seen. His biggest client is Intel, and they have a huge project going on in Albuquerque, another one likely to start soon in Arizona, and another one in Oregon itself. One of the interesting things is that these projects are not all for the Pentium chip. As a matter of fact, they're building plants for the next generation--which are still in the design phase. But in any case, these are major projects. Hawaii's economy remains weak and the job losses continue in that state. On a mildly positive note, though, the visitor count seems to be up from what it was a year ago. California appears to have hit the bottom of its long down cycle, but the current pace of activity seems to be improving very slowly. If you look at the California employment data—and they seem to be revised very frequently--they show a trough in December but job growth between December and April is up only 1/2 percent at an annual rate. Other broad-based measures such as state tax revenues, retail sales, and personal income show basically no trend. I'd say the only area in California where there are convincing signs of significant improvement is real estate and other construction. Existing home sales, housing permits, and nonresidential construction awards all improved very significantly during the last two quarters compared with the same levels in early 1993. ﻿ Turning to the national economy, our policy assumptions are very similar to those in the Greenbook, and we come to similar conclusions about what is likely to happen in the economy. However, we do seem to have a somewhat different view on the responsiveness of the economy to interest rates. In our model, that responsiveness appears to be a little larger. Consequently we have a little weaker economy in the second half of this year, and next year we have a little stronger growth because we have long-term rates coming down a bit more than in the Greenbook. With regard to inflation, with the small amount of unused capacity in the economy, we do not see the prospect for improvement in inflation from this point on, and we certainly don't rule out the possibility that the inflation numbers could begin to look even worse in 1995. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	45.0
199405	106	GREENSPAN	 President Broaddus. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	107	BROADDUS	" I've been reporting for several meetings that the tone in our District is pretty positive and nothing has changed. I've been in this business for about 20 years now, and I would have to say that I can't remember a time when the anecdotal information we hear in our District was any stronger than it is now. There are very few weak spots—that we hear about anyway. I think it's fair to say that most people that we talk to are broadly optimistic about prospects for the near term, at least for growth of jobs. A lot of noteworthy things have happened but I guess the single most noteworthy development in our region recently has been the enormous improvement in commercial real estate activity. Activity in this sector appears to be increasing sharply. I don't think there has been a great deal of actual new construction yet, but vacancy rates are declining, prices are rising, rents are rising, and markets seem to be tightening in a number of our communities. Just a couple of examples: The Raleigh-Durham market in North Carolina was described at our last board meeting as being as tight as it has been in about a decade, and it has been a pretty good market through this whole period. We also are hearing a number of reports that things are improving in this sector here around Washington. We get reports that the northern Virginia, D.C., and the Baltimore/Washington corridor markets are tightening, rents are up, prices are rising at least to some extent, and that of course was one of the worst situations in the country. More broadly, we're told that there is substantial domestic and international investment demand for commercial real estate properties in our region despite the recent backup in long-term rates. So the news on the real estate front is bullish in our area, and that's refreshing because it wasn't very long ago that people were talking about a 15-year real estate depression in this part of the country. Elsewhere, we are still hearing, as I reported earlier, a lot of anecdotal comments suggesting increased concern about the outlook for prices and inflation. I think it's fair to say that these concerns are not restricted to bankers and financial people. When our small business and agriculture advisory committee met a few weeks back, we polled them on their inflation expectations and the vast majority expect some worsening in that situation. They see the economy strengthening; they see labor markets tightening; they didn't use the term shortages of skilled labor but they said there were shortages of ""good"" labor. And they talked about tightening in a number of other markets. So a clear majority of these people are expecting inflation pressures to rise, and I think that's the general ﻿ attitude not just in that group but across my region broadly. So that's the District situation. As far as the national outlook is concerned, as I understand it, the staff is now assuming that the funds rate is going to rise to about the 4-1/2 percent level sometime around fall, and that an increase of that magnitude will be sufficient to hold the growth of real GDP to about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year and through 1995 and also keep the core rate of inflation at about 3 percent over that period. Now, moderate GDP growth like this might not be a great outlook in all circumstances, but my feeling is that it wouldn't be a bad outcome right now, given where we are and what is happening. After all, it would follow a year of solid growth in which we have moved much closer to full employment. I think it would lay a nice foundation for sustained growth out beyond the projection period. We don't talk about this too much at non-Humphrey- Hawkins meetings, but there may even be a little further progress toward our longer-term price stability goal. But I have to say that I'm concerned about what I see as the generally accommodative policy we've followed up to this point. I still think that may give us more thrust in both real GDP growth and nominal GDP growth, at least through the end of 1994, than the Greenbook envisions. And I don't think it's by any means assured that a 4-1/2 percent funds rate is going to get us the relatively moderate inflation and real growth that the Greenbook is projecting for next year. In short, it seems to me that there are substantial upside risks in these projections on both the real side and the inflation side, and we need to give the upside risks some careful weight when we discuss policy later in the meeting.

199405	108	GREENSPAN	 President Forrestal. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	109	FORRESTAL	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Conditions in the Sixth District are also very, very good and the expansion is pretty broadly based and relatively balanced. Let me just tick off some of the sectors of the economy. In the retail sector, sales did taper off a little in April although the activity in recent months has exceeded retailers' expectations by a sizable margin. Many of them are planning to add to their inventories. Auto sales are still quite strong in most parts of the District. The interesting thing to me is that the dealers are expecting continuing growth, although at a somewhat more moderate rate, in this area through the rest of this year and into next year. Tourism, as I've reported before, is a source of considerable strength in the region. There has been a fall- off in European travelers but that's being taken up by domestic travelers and also by people from the Caribbean and Latin America. I won't say anything about the casino gambling again because we all know about that. I'm going to bet that it will continue! On the production side, our survey in April for industrial production suggests that there has been some leveling off in output. But the expectations for future activity are above those seen at this time last year. There was some effect on production from the Teamsters strike, so that cut down activity a little, and suppliers to the automobile sector are running at near capacity in the District. Textiles, particularly in the household area and apparel fabrics, also are sources of strength. The only weakness on the production side is in defense and aerospace. ﻿ On the real estate side, sales of single-family homes remain quite strong throughout the District. Many realtors are reporting that the recent increases in mortgage rates have actually spurred buying on the part of people who were sitting on the fence, as it were. Inventories of homes remain quite tight in many areas, and realtors are reporting increases in prices as well. Builders are reporting strong increases in the number of homes under construction, although speculative activity is practically nonexistent. Traffic through the subdivisions is quite heavy, and that's in contrast to the assertion in a letter that I read this morning that you received, Mr. Chairman. On the multifamily side, markets continue to improve, too. Building permits were up 50 percent over a year ago in the first quarter. Nonresidential real estate is also doing better. Commercial real estate agents are more positive now about future activity than they have been in a long time. On the financial side in the states, budgetary pressures that were in existence a while ago have practically disappeared due to the new growth. On the price side, in contrast to some of the comments I've heard today, we're finding that price pressures are practically nonexistent, with the exception of construction and perhaps a little bit now in textiles. Lumber prices have stabilized in the last few months, but the costs of other building materials have increased and we are also seeing some wage pressures for skilled labor in the construction industry. Wage pressures are basically fairly quiet in other sectors. Retailers are telling us that intense competition is keeping a lid on prices. In the banking sector, I would echo what Tom Hoenig said, in that banking in our District is quite strong; loan demand is up, particularly in the consumer sector. So, Mr. Chairman, I think that is probably as positive a report as I've been able to make in quite a long time. It's hard to find any weaknesses in our area. With respect to the national economy, I must say that I've been impressed by the strength of the data we've gotten since we last met, notwithstanding the lower-than-expected first quarter. I had at the last meeting tended to downplay the rather bullish expectations for growth in our forecast, but I've become a little more convinced that the upsurge in the fourth quarter may continue to play out for a little while longer. So, our forecast for GDP is somewhat stronger for 1994, fourth quarter over fourth quarter, although we do show a deceleration in 1995. Also, we don't see inflation reaching a peak until 1995. I won't go into the various differences in the forecast and I wouldn't want to make too much of the differences because while our forecast does differ from the Greenbook in the near term, the forecasts converge in 1995. What I think comes out of both of those forecasts as far as I'm concerned is that some additional move in policy as contemplated in the Greenbook probably is needed and in time will cause inflation to moderate. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	39.0

199405	111	MINEHAN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Things are clearly in recovery mode in New England. Payroll employment has grown for the region as a whole in each of the last three months and jobs overall ﻿ are about 2 percent above a year ago. This improvement is broad- based. With the sole exception of durable goods manufacturing, all major industry categories had more jobs than a year ago. On a geographic basis, only Connecticut continues to show job losses. The New England unemployment rate declined for the third straight month to 5.6 percent, well below the rate for the nation as a whole. Other indicators are also positive; average weekly hours in manufacturing reached a new post-recession high, help wanted advertising rose in March, and per capita income growth of 3.7 percent exceeded the national pace slightly. All this good news should not obscure the fact that the region as a whole has gained back only about a quarter to a third of the ground lost during the recession, no matter what data are used to measure progress, although one could question whether we want to go back to the late 1980s in terms of how heated up things were in New England. Companies continue to report that competition is very keen and that their own quality and efficiency improvements are the primary determinants of survival, not rising overall demand. There's no rising tide to carry them all to prosperity. On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any remaining undertow either. Several contacts, including some on our board, complained that the Fed is raising interest rates just as the economy finally shows some signs of life. In response to our questions, however, a number indicated that they were seeing attempts by suppliers to increase prices, but these attempts were being resisted. Retailers saw strong growth in March but a fall-off more recently. Cautious optimism may be the best way to express the New England viewpoint almost across the board. On the national scene, we too believe that growth will be somewhat stronger than projected by the Greenbook. We've been impressed by the degree of tightening in labor markets recently, but on the other hand our projections of the NAIRU are at the low end of the range that seems to be used by Board staff, and we are a little more optimistic about potential GDP growth. While our sense of the components of the picture varies from those in the Greenbook, we do agree with projections of low inflation, at least in the near term. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	62.0

199405	113	MCTEER	 The economy in the Eleventh District continues to grow moderately, about in line with the national growth rate, possibly a little weaker. Our expansion is broadly based, with the exception of energy and defense-related sectors. Construction in particular is very strong; it moves from strong to booming in some areas that are benefiting from relocations from other parts of the country. Median prices of existing houses are up 6 to 10 percent depending on what market one is talking about. Construction is going on all around me, and my house is the only one that I know of that has not gone up in estimated value. I just got that in the mail. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	53.0
199405	114	SPEAKER	 Maybe it's because of the residents! 	13	13	1.0	0.0	999.0
199405	115	MCTEER	" It's a big mystery. The gains in nonresidential construction are also significant, matching those in housing. Retail, warehouse, and industrial buildings are strong throughout the District. Even commercial property is beginning to rise in price, although there is still a lot of excess commercial property in the ﻿ major metropolitan areas, including an old Reserve Bank building in Dallas that is still on the market. As I've indicated, we are benefiting a good bit from relocations. We are benefiting from being in what we refer to as the low-wage, low-cost center of the North American free trade area now. We've been asking our directors and Beigebook contacts questions about pressures on prices and wages for some time. We are getting some indications that price pressures are beginning to appear, and some wage pressures have been mentioned. This is the first time since 1985 that people in our area are mentioning upward pressure on wages. I don't really have anything of value to add about the national economy except that it seems a lot stronger than the first- quarter GDP numbers would indicate, especially the real final sales number. Then the April retail sales number brings to mind a Richard Pryor comment, ""Who are you going to believe, me or your own lying eyes?"" There seems to be a conflict between those numbers and the feel of the economy out there. When I talk to people about policy, there seems to be a difference of opinion on whether we're ahead of the curve, too far ahead of the curve, or behind the curve. There's more uniformity of opinion, though, that we need to do what we're going to do quickly and get it behind us. I often hear that we're creating uncertainty with small steps, and they urge us to do what we need to do. As a matter of fact, last week we had a vote in our board meeting on a discount rate recommendation. dissented from the vote, but even he said whatever you do don't do it piecemeal. Thank you.

199405	117	BOEHNE	 The District continues clearly to be a part of the Northeast—its growth trend is positive but somewhat slower than the nation. Manufacturing continues to grow, but the pace of growth has flattened out some. The bookings for the future also have gone up rather substantially but that too seems to be flattening out. I suspect it may have to do with some capacity constraints. A major railroader in our District reports what others have said in the railroad business: they're operating flat out. They can't get cars fast enough to ship the goods. Residential construction has made a good-sized rebound, although I think some of that is clearly seasonal. Once that part is out, I think we will have moderate growth. Nonresidential construction is mixed. Some areas are still dead and likely to be that way for some time. Other areas are beginning to show some signs that there will be additional construction, probably more so next year than this year. Retail sales clearly have picked up. The automobile business is strong, and it's clearly a seller's market at this point except for a few lines. Bankers, who heretofore have not seen a whole lot of growth in commercial lending, are now reporting modestly rising demand. Business loans, both to finance inventory accumulation as well as capital equipment, and consumer and real estate lending continue to pick up. In our labor markets the rate of unemployment for the District as a whole is about the same as for the nation, although it varies quite widely around a relatively small District. However, the growth in new jobs has been on the sluggish side despite the improvement in the economy. Consequently, wage pressures are well contained. On the price side, there clearly ﻿ is a desire and a wish to raise some prices, but I'm still hearing mostly that it's very difficult to make those increases stick. As far as the national economy goes, I don't have a lot to add. I think at this point in an expansion the risks tend to be for faster growth rather than slower growth. Perhaps it's just my own District and the influence that that has, but my sense is that the odds pretty strongly favor moderate growth and that there is not a lot more upside risk to the economy than downside risk. On monetary policy, because the District is improving but not as fast as the nation, the increasing interest rates and our actions have been more justifiable on a national basis than a District basis. I am running into what has just been echoed across the table: Do what you have to do and get it out of the way so that we can get this uncertainty behind us. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	33.0

199405	119	STERN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The District economy continues to be very healthy. The only exception to that is the energy sector, which of course is not very large in the District; otherwise, things continue to do very well. I think people are becoming increasingly optimistic, and that's starting from, at this point, a fairly optimistic base. A few anecdotes, some of which I've reported before, which I think are interesting and relevant: I've heard a number of reports over the last several months about lean inventories, with the clear implication that people expect some attempt to step up production and build inventories over the next several months. I would expect that to occur. Continued reports about labor shortages, particularly of skilled labor in many markets, do not seem to have translated into a broad-based increase in wage pressures, although in the Twin Cities market it does appear that wage increases—this is from the panel that we work with in trying to plan our own compensation—turned out to be larger in 1993 than those that had been planned. Exactly what was going on there I don't know, although we face a pretty tight labor market. On the banking side, there are reports of increases in loan demand and some preliminary indications that banks are starting to bid a little more aggressively for funds through small time deposits- something we haven't seen for quite some time. As far as pricing and price pressures go, it's very hard to find any broad-based indications of acceleration of inflation, but what I am hearing is that discounts are diminishing and the frequency of sales is diminishing. It's very hard to quantify, but that does seem to be occurring. With regard to the national economy, I must say the logic of the Greenbook forecast does appeal to me. It seems to me that the increase in interest rates, particularly in long rates, may work as that forecast envisions, that is, growth in real GDP will slow once again--whether it occurs in the third quarter or somewhat later remains to be seen. That may succeed in stabilizing the rate of inflation about where it has been. Although I must observe that in the last couple of expansions—coming out of the 1980-82 recession and the 1973-75 recession—once the economy built up momentum, those expansions seemed to go on longer and to be stronger than we, certainly, had anticipated. Now, some of that may be the fact that, ﻿ of course, the momentum is not independent of the policies we pursued; and maybe we just reacted too late. But at least a naive reading of those expansions suggests to me that once the economy starts to develop some momentum, that tends to go on for a while. Some numbers that I was looking at raise questions in my mind about what we might be able to say about the inflation outlook. These numbers suggest, though I guess it's a little too early to even call this analysis, that the relationship between labor market conditions and the performance of wages or compensation seems to have deteriorated in the early 1980s—around 1983 and 1984—and hasn't been reestablished. This suggests that we can't conclude very much from labor market conditions and what that might imply for wage pressures. Similarly, there seems to be deterioration in the relationship between utilization rates and consumer prices that occurred about the same time. I don't take much comfort from that; it raises uncertainty in my mind, if nothing else, about the price outlook, and it forces me to rely a little more on my intuition. My instincts at this point are that the risks of inflation certainly are on the up side, particularly because we're not indifferent to errors in that direction. In other words, we're not terribly concerned if we undershoot inflation. We might be a lot more concerned if we overshoot. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	41.0
199405	120	GREENSPAN	 President Jordan. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	121	JORDAN	" Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our District is performing in a fashion much more similar to the Seventh District than the Third District. It's a pattern of fairly uniform strengths that are getting stronger. The ag sector is looking forward to a third very good year overall. It's early to tell whether they will meet that expectation, but they've had two good years and there certainly is a lot of optimism in the ag sector and the ag banks. In processed foods especially, capacity is up a lot. One county on the western side of Ohio reports an increase of 7 million ""layers"" in the past year—turkey processing plants. That means a lot of new capacity. Motor vehicle plants are going flat out, and a lot of them are running above what would be sustainable long-run capacity. But a lot of new capital spending is occurring, a very significant amount by the major manufacturers. That is adding a lot of optimism to people's assessment of the current situation. Capital goods overall are booming; and the return of the machine tool industry, notably the higher value, high-tech end, is especially encouraging to people in such major communities as Lexington, Cincinnati, and Pittsburgh; all are reporting that the high-tech firms are doing quite well. The one sector that I would note where there is consistent weakness and talk about layoffs or cutting back is health care. We have some very large health care operations in the District, and they continue to be pessimistic. I might note a couple of anecdotal things that need to be paid attention to going forward. One is the continued strike at Allegheny Ludlum Steel; they've been on strike since before Easter. This is a governance kind of issue: Management is saying that they are going to see this through and tends to talk in terms of months rather than days or weeks before it is settled. It's important nationally because they provide the stainless components for the exhaust systems for General Motors. There is no alternative ﻿ domestically at this time. General Motors has indicated that they are now preparing to go to Japanese stainless steel by month end if they can get it. The other alternative would be to go to carbon steel components and promise buyers that they will subsequently recall the vehicles and put in the stainless components. GM says that they are not going to shut down production based on this labor stoppage. The other thing that stainless steel is critical for is transformers and electric power operations. There are no alternative sources. So, Allegheny Ludlum has— "	13	13	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	122	GREENSPAN	 There used to be a big stainless high alloy industry in this country, but it has evaporated. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	123	JORDAN	 Yes, and it's a tough one for us, and it's adding a degree of pessimism to the Pittsburgh area especially. The other more or less anecdotal report relates to residential housing. What we are hearing in the District is that the problem is not the cost or availability of funds but the cost and availability of building materials. The Ohio Trade Council Union has become a developer of medium- and low-income housing and complains about escalating costs of production and that is what he sees as the source of inflation, not the cost of funds. Turning to the national economy, my reading is certainly influenced by conditions in the District. It's not a question of encountering any kind of head winds; rather, it's the buildup of tail winds that I think is of increasing concern. I no longer feel that it's a case of simply backing further off the accelerator but that we may have to start contemplating tapping on the brakes fairly soon. I don't know where neutral is, but I think that we are well shy of a neutral policy and getting there may not be enough. The Greenbook projections depend critically in my assessment on the deceleration of nominal GDP growth. It's the nominal spending where I have my concerns rather than the decomposition of that into its real and price components. In 1992 we had growth of over 6-1/2 percent for the full four-quarter period and that was more than had been expected. There was some deceleration in 1993, even with the robust fourth quarter, thanks to the weakness in the first half of the year, but growth for the year still was 5-1/2 percent. Growth this year is looking like another 5 to 5-1/2 percent. But for the forecast to work, it is important for nominal GDP to decelerate to under 4-1/2 percent in the next 18 months. I don't see what will make that happen. I have no confidence that the kind of policy assumptions in the Greenbook or the linkage of working through long-term bond yields are going to produce that deceleration of nominal GDP. The way I now tend to think about where we are is not that we are entering the fourth year of the expansion, but rather that we are someplace in the first year of a classic expansion. As it looks to me, the period of about 2 or 2-1/2 years after the end of the Gulf War was one of economic restructuring in a lot of sectors and a lot of regions. The talk about it being an anemic recovery was because it wasn't a recovery, in a sense, but rather a period of restructuring. Some time during the course of last year we entered into what would be more of a classical recovery from recession. If that interpretation is right, then we should be thinking in terms of a year to six quarters of 5 to 6. percent real GDP growth. Yet, most of us are saying that we don't see that the economy has the capacity to handle that many quarters with 5 or 6 percent real ﻿ GDP growth without way overshooting. If that's an accurate assessment of where we are, then monetary policy is well behind the curve. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	58.0
199405	124	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	125	MELZER	 Thanks, Alan. The national economy continues to expand rapidly and its momentum appears, at least to me, to be building. Industrial production, for example, grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate for the four months ending in April, faster than the 4.6 percent rise in 1993. Payroll employment rose at a 2.7 percent rate in the four months ending in April, following a 1.9 percent rate of increase in 1993. The unemployment rate fell about a full percentage point over the past year when comparable methods are used to measure it. Despite efforts by businesses to build inventory in the first quarter of this year, the inventory-to-sales ratio fell sharply as sales boomed. In the Eighth District, economic activity has also expanded rapidly in recent months. Many firms report expansions, additions to payrolls, and increases in sales. The District continues to grow faster than the nation as a whole, as best we can determine. For example, during the past quarter nonagricultural employment increased in all District states by a significantly larger percentage than the national average, namely by 7-1/2 percent at an annual rate versus 2.1 percent nationally. Increases in employment are occurring in nearly every major manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sector. District reports reveal that the Eighth District's expansion is spreading to parts of the District such as southern Illinois that had until recently been sluggish. Particularly noteworthy developments are occurring in the transportation sector. Increases in auto production, which Tom Hoenig and Si Keehn have mentioned, are expected to boost auto employment in St. Louis to the highest level since 1989. Commercial aircraft orders also are rising considerably. The District's real estate sector remains strong as evidenced by double- digit increases in building permits and continuing anecdotal reports that homes available for sale are in short supply. Relatively strong loan demand, especially by businesses, is also indicative of the strength of the Eighth District's economy. The momentum of the economic expansion, as I mentioned before, seems to me to be building. I am not comfortable with the Greenbook outlook that nominal and real GDP are poised to slow down in the second half of this year. Such a slowing appears to be based on a cutback in interest-sensitive sectors, especially housing. Housing affordability, even with today's mortgage rates, in my view is very favorable. And reports at last week's Business Roundtable meeting expressed strong doubts that interest rate increases are retarding spending to any degree at all or are likely to do so in the near future. The continuing strong performance of the District and national economies reinforces my concerns about the inflation outlook. In the Eighth District the prospects for increased cost and price pressures have been boosted by low-levels of farm inventories and new houses for sale, and more broadly by substantial job growth and relatively low unemployment rates. Nationally, both consumer and producer price increases have accelerated over the past seven months from their pace over the previous five months. In addition, ﻿ inflationary expectations have increased as well, which is reflected in declines in both bond prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar since our last meeting. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	42.0
199405	126	GREENSPAN	 Governor Kelley. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	127	KELLEY	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm essentially the same place I was in March, so I'll try to be a little brief today. We have moved policy considerably, three times now, which I think has been entirely appropriate. The reason that I feel particularly comfortable with that comes largely from the fact that I think interest rates were too accommodative for present conditions and needed to be changed. And probably we haven't completely eliminated that yet and we do have a little more to go. Consequently, I would expect to support a policy move action in the second half of this meeting. My comfort doesn't primarily arise from an especially high level of concern that we are near full capacity and on the cusp of some type of an inflationary flashpoint. I certainly do recognize that there's considerable strength out there and we get confirmation of that from the consistent reports—and I'm sure they're correct — from around the Districts that there is a good deal of momentum. Consequently, there surely is the possibility that the economy could overheat. But I think there's reason for at least a bit of skepticism that that is going to happen. A brief recitation, if I may; I did this the last time we were here and most of these things have been referred to in one form or other already this morning. I won't talk further about interest rates; we know how much they've gone up. Their restrictive impact is just beginning to be felt. Mike Prell made reference to housing in particular. Second, one factor that I think is important that we haven't talked about much is the impact of unit labor costs. We've done very well in that regard recently. In fact, it has been getting meaningfully lower now for some four straight years. Staff tells me that in the case of the unit labor cost index, which has been decreasing substantially and consistently, that that impacts the economy with a six-quarter lag. This means that we've got a lot more favorable impact to come from the restraint that is already in place. On the productivity side, we've recently been looking at a 2 percent increase. Staff has raised its estimate of trend to 1-1/2 percent, but if I understand correctly, they are only expecting 1 percent over the remaining part of the forecast period. All the private sector conversations I've had suggest that we might continue to do quite well in that regard rather than fall back. If that turns out to be the case, it does two things for us, obviously. First of all, it holds down cost pressures; and secondly, it extends the amount of capacity that the economy has available before it gets itself into difficulty. In the area of consumer spending, we've talked before about the very high level of debt that was built up through the 1980s; that plateaued for a while but did not come down, and now it has begun to rise again. This leaves me with a considerable question in my mind as to how long the legs under consumer expenditures may be. Indeed, if they're very long, I would worry about that a lot because we're in a new territory now in terms of consumer debt. Not unrelated to that is ﻿ the fact that autos have been a part of the push so far and that probably has approximately peaked. We've talked about foreign economies; I won't go into that any more but their weakness impacts on us here. And then, of course, fiscal policy continues to be mildly contractionary, at least over the rest of the forecast period. All in all, I have considerable confidence that there's a lot of underlying strength in the economy, a lot of good solid momentum, and that things look very favorable. I believe that the economy can keep growing despite whatever constraints are out there and that our recent policy actions as well as those restraints give us good prospects for keeping inflation well in check. Thank you. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	48.0
199405	128	GREENSPAN	 Vice Chairman. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	129	MCDONOUGH	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Second District's economy appears to be advancing at a rather nice pace this spring. Preliminary March reports indicate that establishment job growth was strong in most sectors of the economy. Tax receipts suggest that personal income grew at a reasonable pace. Retail sales surpassed the optimistic expectations of the merchants, with actually some problems in April because inventory levels are lower than the merchants would like them to be. The commercial real estate market is showing considerable signs of revival except in the lower part of Manhattan Island. The anecdotal information for April and the first part of May suggest that this growth is continuing. And consumer price inflation is quite subdued in the District. There is something of a malaise around the financial services industry because of the difficult markets in the first four months of the year and because of some concerns about individual firms and problems related to them—for example, the case of Kidder Peabody and the death of Lazard and then the New York Times article on Sunday regarding what would appear to be some questionable relationships among firms in the municipal finance area. On the national level, we differ somewhat from the Greenbook in having a little slower growth in the second quarter and a little higher growth in the second half of the year, but the net result is that we are just 0.1 percent above for the Q4 to Q4 period. We also have a slowdown in 1995 to 2.4 percent growth in GDP, which is just about where the Greenbook is. However, we're not quite as optimistic about the CPI. We've got it up 3.1 percent whereas the Greenbook has it up 2.8 percent. I would not be very satisfied with an upturn in inflation as something that we would anticipate. So that raises the question of what really is going on in the economy and what if anything the Federal Reserve can do about it. We think that growth has to be slowed down because we think that, certainly by the end of the year, potential GDP will be fully used up. We will be at or very close to the NAIRU and at the use of manufacturing capacity that has historically given rise to cost and therefore price pressures. One of the things that those who don't want to find inflation, especially among journalists, are looking to is the possibility that the capacity availability outside the United States will help us avoid inflation. We looked at that quite carefully and find very little solace there. In the area of interest rates, one of the things that's most difficult to forecast—and it has been discussed by Mike Prell both in the Greenbook and in his oral presentation and then by various members ﻿ of the Committee this morning—is to try to figure out just how much the policy that we have put in place so far and its effect on medium- and longer-term interest rates will slow the economy down. In the very sensitive areas of, say, the 7- to 10-year maturities, it's difficult to figure out exactly what has caused that increase in interest rates, but we've done a rather large amount of work on the relationship between the Treasury market and therefore interest rates in general and mortgage-backed securities; Joan Lovett referred to that rather briefly in her presentation. But quite clearly, as interest rates go up and the duration of any mortgage portfolio increases, the hedging requirement moves out the yield curve. And we think that has a fair amount to do with the considerable increases in interest rates in the 7- to 10-year area, especially in the 10-year note itself. If that is so, it means that we've got a closer linkage than we have had historically between short-term interest rates that the Fed directly can control and the medium- and longer-term rates that have a rather direct effect on the interest-sensitive sectors. I think all of us would have to agree that we are not quite sure exactly how that will play out in the future. Another area that we find has to be looked at very closely is the attitudes and therefore the likely spending habits of the consumer. The consumer is a good deal more confident than he or she was a couple of months ago. But it's very difficult to find out exactly what they are so confident about except that the increase in employment would seem to have lowered the anxiety level about losing jobs. Still, one hears enough about layoffs especially in the white collar sector to wonder how consumer confidence that is a large part of all of our economic forecasts, and which Governor Kelley discussed very well I thought, is going to affect the future. So we're in a situation I think where we have policy actions that need to be taken, but it seems to me that at this particular time the question marks are rather larger than usual--although as Mike Prell pointed out, all economic forecasts have question marks—and therefore make decisions on policy that much more difficult. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	61.0
199405	130	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Governor LaWare. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	131	LAWARE	 I've grown considerably less comfortable since the last meeting with the consensus view that we have a solid economic expansion under way. Not only was the announced GDP growth rate in the first quarter way below staff expectations, but staff now expects a further downward revision of the 2.6 percent number that was announced. That, combined with recent statistics on auto sales and production, industrial production, retail sales, and a modest reversal of consumer expectations, has convinced me that the psychological tone of the economy is very fragile. I attribute that fragility to job security anxiety, fueled by continued corporate re-engineering with the accompanying layoffs combined with worries about household cash flow, debt levels, and impending changes in the health care system and its costs. Nonetheless, the reduction in slack in the economy certainly feeds my concern that there remains some prospect for growth well in excess of potential, and I expect that further absorption of slack will come from the export sector. As United States products become more competitive because of dollar rates, technical improvements, higher quality, and the recovery of European and Canadian economies as well as a higher level of growth in Mexico, the growth in exports will ﻿ exceed staff expectations and stimulate a higher growth rate than in the Greenbook forecast. All in all, I believe that events already in train will tend to heal the fragile psychology of the economy, all of which suggests that additional restraint may be in order. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	50.0
199405	132	GREENSPAN	 Governor Phillips. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	133	PHILLIPS	 Thank you. It appears that the strength of the expansion is deeper and wider than we have seen previously, based on some of the comments made here today. This is partially due I suspect to job creation and acceptance by employees of moves to different jobs—thus more churning in the labor market. Confidence continues to be reasonably strong both on the business side and on the consumer side even in the face of a slowdown in the first-quarter GDP. Credit demand has increased and the United States economy appears to be adapting better to changes than our competitors—such changes as technology, labor conditions, balance sheet adjustments, and so on. I find myself with an analysis very similar to Mike Kelley's and John LaWare's in that I see this strength as sustainable and don't see a runaway growth outlook. We still have an environment of re- engineering and emphasis on cost savings and productivity. This question of job quality I think is continuing to put pressure on income levels generally. We're also not through the downsizing of the defense industry. The deficit is going to continue to limit fiscal policy initiatives. The low saving rate that we have seen I think is going to limit long-term investment opportunities. The capital market volatility and stock and bond price declines do increase the cost of capital. The volatility itself raises the cost of capital, and the wealth effects that are felt by individuals may start to be seen in reduced consumption and investment. On the inflation front, as we've heard in some discussion around the table, the recent history is quite good. I do think that there are vulnerabilities, for example in commodity prices including oil. And although farmers are optimistic at planting time, that's when they're the most optimistic. That seems to be a universal truth in the ag community. But we do have low carryovers, so this is a fragile time going into this planting season. One thing that hasn't been mentioned as much was the faster increases in the producer price index in the first quarter of this year. Although the April report was better, the index is still up about 9 percent on an annual basis for 1994. We still have health costs as an uncertainty, and the strength of the economy generally I think is increasing the chances that inflation could start to heat up. I think both the appearance and the actuality of the stronger economy coupled with the realization that there are checks on this growth are feeding some of the uncertainty that is reflected in the wide range of forecasts for GDP, inflation, capacity constraints, and interest rates. We see a little more diversity of opinion than we ordinarily do on the forecast front, and this is feeding into the capital markets. They remain volatile and fragile. I think we're still facing a continuation of the sorting out process that was begun in February. At that time many people were on the same side of the ﻿ market and positioned for more of the same—slow growth, with long- term interest rates expected to come down, and inflation expected to be under control. So when the jolts hit the market we saw more of an effect than might have been anticipated. Those jolts, of course, were precipitated by the initial Fed tightening but also were supported by reports of stronger growth more generally. People were having to fully assess whether or not real rates should be higher. Then, of course, we have domestic political uncertainties, Japanese trade pressures, China, Korea, one can go on. Traders also have very short time horizons and they tend to think in terms of up or down, and neutral was really throwing them a curve. That, I think, enhanced the uncertainty in the markets. This portfolio unwinding that we've been going through is not an instantaneous process because the portfolios are complex. We also are faced with internal firm risk management constraints. The markets are efficient but they're not complete. As Bill McDonough mentioned, there has to be a searching for hedge opportunities as people seek to unwind. We have seen some market liquidity constraints as near substitutes have been sought and traders are trying to reduce exposures. In sum, I don't think the turmoil is over. And in terms of the risks generally, while some people seem to think that they are more on the up side, I see some countervailing forces to those upside risks that are feeding the fragility and the uncertainty. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	57.0
199405	134	GREENSPAN	 Thank you. Governor Lindsey. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	135	LINDSEY	 Mr. Chairman, what struck me most at the table today was the talk of inflation. I've heard more on that than I've heard in all the meetings I've attended in 2-1/2 years. That was a surprise to me. I don't think that the concern we have in the analysis is really on the demand side. I think the staff is right on target. We have moderately expanding demand. We have what would otherwise be robust demand being checked this year by fiscal policy contraction, by a rising yield curve, and by a deteriorating international situation. That's moderate. What we don't know, really, is what is happening on the aggregate supply side. Governor Kelley mentioned a very, very positive scenario, one in which productivity is improving as a result of substitution of capital for labor over the past few years. If he's right, then we have room for a very extended expansion. And, Mike, you have a surprising ally in my former colleague, Jim Medoff—I don't think we've ever agreed in the past—who sent me from the Center of National Policy an analysis of the normalized help wanted index against the unemployment rate. He concludes that the NAIRU is more like 5-1/2 percent because of the changes you've mentioned. I think that assumes that it is positive technical change that has driven the substitution of capital for labor. If, on the other hand, what has caused this substitution is a rise in the relative cost of labor to capital because labor is more expensive, perhaps because of government mandates or what have you, then really what we've had is a supply shock. And that may explain why I hear so much talk about inflation here in spite of the fact that the help wanted index is at the same level as it was at the depths of the 1982 recession. That surprised me; no one is demanding labor, yet we're hearing about inflation all the time. ﻿ We're going to have to see, and fortunately this is not the meeting where we are going to find out whether we have to go to something more restrictive. I think that President Jordan was right on target. The thing that we have forgotten is that during an expansion the mix in nominal GDP between inflation and real growth tends to worsen. In the Greenbook forecast, it's not worsening; it's staying at about 50/50. That probably isn't going to happen. If Governor Kelley is right, maybe it can last for a while longer; but history says otherwise and my bet is that in three months or six months we're not going to be talking about neutrality. But fortunately we can wait for three to six months for that to change. 	13	13	1.0	1.0	54.0
199405	136	GREENSPAN	 Thank you, Governor, and that brings us to our coffee break. Let's take five, seven minutes. [Coffee break] 	2	2	1.0	1.0	47.0
199405	137	KOHN	 Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The issue for the Committee at this meeting would seem to be not whether to tighten policy, but rather by how much. In light of the Committee's announced strategy of moving away from its previous accommodative policy posture, doing nothing would startle markets and raise questions about why tightening had stopped short of common estimates of policy neutrality. Such questions might be especially intense against the background of what is perceived by most analysts to be a robust trend in output and employment, when Committee members have emphasized that little weight should be put on incoming price data because they are lagging indicators. Either a 25 or 50 basis point increase in the funds rate would be consistent with the staff forecast, which assumes a federal funds rise to the vicinity of 4-1/2 percent by the fourth quarter. In that forecast, such an increase is sufficient to bring the economy in at around its level of potential--the proverbial soft landing--with inflation remaining just below 3 percent, though not decelerating appreciably further. A quarter-point increase in the funds rate would maintain the recent measured pace of policy tightening. Now that the markets have gone through a period of considerable volatility and portfolio adjustment, there would seem to be much less reason to choose this alternative out of concern about cascading reactions in financial markets to a half-point funds rate increase. Indeed, many market participants expect a 50 basis point move, though not all do. The case for remaining on the gradual path would seem to need to reflect more the Committee's judgment that there was an appreciable risk of aggregate demand falling short of the market's implicit expectations, and perhaps the staff forecast as well, and the Committee therefore wished to await further data to assess whether to tighten past 4 percent. This year's substantial rise in intermediate- and long-term rates are probably the most important source of such risk. As Mike discussed, the reasons for and consequences of this increase are far from clear. Survey data, though mostly dated, do suggest that a considerable portion of the rise in rates has been in the real component; and if, as we often assume, inflation expectations are based on experience, given recent price data these survey results may not be too badly misleading--at least with regard to the expectations of household and business decision-makers. Of course, any increase in real rates could simply be a needed counterweight to much stronger aggregate demand. But if the Committee thought that markets might have over-estimated that strength, or that the effects of skittish investors and additional expected volatility have pushed up liquidity premiums, then long-term rates might be higher than needed to allow the economy to run at potential. To some extent, if this is true, it will be self-correcting-- long-term rates will fall as weaker aggregate demand becomes apparent, as the staff has assumed in its forecast. But a downward adjustment in long-term real rates would be speeded and encouraged by a shallower trajectory of tightening than seems to be embedded in the term structure. If the Committee were concerned about possible shortfalls in demands, that might include 25 basis points now, rather than 50, and considerably less additional restraint later than given by the path of forward rates. Ultimately this shallower trajectory would cause market expectations to revise and feed through to lower longer-term rates--in nominal as well as real terms as inflation remained subdued. A half-point increase in the federal funds rate could seem justified if the Committee saw policy still as appreciably more accommodative than consistent with its inflation objectives. That would be the case if the Committee thought slack was limited, and that aggregate demand was likely to be strong enough at a configuration of rates built on a 4 percent funds rate to erode fairly quickly remaining spare labor and capital capacity. Some of the restraining effects on spending of higher rates in capital markets are being offset by more aggressive loan-seeking behavior by banks and other lenders. In addition, the weaker dollar, whatever its cause, adds to price and output pressure and truncates a source of restraint the Committee might have expected from its previous firming actions. Finally, some of the increase in interest rates does seem to have been related to rising inflation expectations in financial markets, and it would be important to keep these from becoming embedded in wage and price decisions. A more aggressive action than the recent quarter-point increases might be seen as all the more needed if the Committee thought aggregate demand was even stronger than in the staff forecast, or it wanted to keep inflation tilted down in coming years. As to the effects on bond yields of a 50 basis point increase in the funds rate, the staff can see a number of conflicting influences. On the one hand, increases in short-term rates usually provoke increases in long-term rates, especially, as now, when the full extent of the immediate increase has not been built into the rate structure. And, the pass-through has seemed to be magnified in recent months, though, to be sure, other forces have been at work. Moreover, any pass-through might ordinarily be expected to be amplified by an accompanying discount rate action, which would underline the Federal Reserve's expectation that rates needed to be higher for some time to come. But these have not been ordinary times in financial markets. Our announced intention to move away from accommodation has seemed to interact with incoming data to create considerable uncertainty about the pace and extent of System tightening. It is possible that a half-point increase in the funds rate accompanied by a discount rate increase would produce a sense of closure on the move to ìpolicy neutralityî. Depending in part on the wording of a discount rate statement, markets might then expect policy to be on hold for a while, with subsequent tightenings probably to be less rapid than in recent months and keyed to economic developments. Under these circumstances, some of the uncertainty about near-term policy actions might be reduced, and with inflation concerns also assuaged to an extent, investors might find longer-term assets more attractive. Helping to damp inflation expectations under this alternative should be a little stronger tone for the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The effects in those markets might be especially sizable if the tightening were associated with a discount rate increase and were also interpreted as part of a coordinated effort with foreign monetary authorities to bolster the dollar. There are potential costs, however, to allowing a sense of having reached neutrality to become embedded in market thinking. If incoming data seemed to warrant further tightening, but it was thought that the Federal Reserve might be slow to move beyond existing funds rate levels, inflation expectations and market instabilities could revive. The staff expects slow growth in various measures of the money supply to accompany either of the alternatives. M1 has been particularly weak in recent months, in part reflecting the effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs. These effects would be amplified, holding down M1 growth, and some special factors, including the depressing effects of declining mortgage refinancing, are expected to continue. Thus, the strengthening of M1 growth under the 50 basis point hike of alternative D is projected to be only to a 3 percent rate over April to September, implying increasing velocity. Since we don't foresee major further increases in long-term interest rates, we are not expecting a continuation of the flight from bond funds that has been boosting M2 despite rising interest rates. We do think that investors will be more cautious about shifting funds to capital market instruments than they were in the environment of persistent capital gains of recent years. But the effects of higher interest rates and opportunity costs also should restrain M2 and boost its velocity, though by less than for M1, And, we expect overall credit growth to remain on a moderate track, albeit more concentrated at banks than it has been for most of the expansion. Especially if the Committee chooses to raise the funds rate to 4-1/4 percent, it may want to consider its tactics going forward. With this increase, the Committee will have accomplished an upward ratcheting in rates to levels less obviously accommodative. This shift, while not independent of incoming data on the economy, was not keyed to the precise nature of that information. It may take even higher rates to meet the Committee's objective, but the speed and extent of additional tightening may not be as clear as was the need to move away from the stance previously in place. In these circumstances, the Committee might want to return to its previous practice of giving greater weight to incoming data on the economy and financial markets and their effect on the outlook in judging further actions. The Committee's attitude toward subsequent actions may influence its choice of language governing intermeeting changes in reserve conditions. An asymmetrical directive could be favored on the grounds that the risks are still tilted more toward the need for additional tightening. With the economy probably close to potential, the Committee may see the costs of allowing inflation to accelerate as greater over time--and harder for policy to deal with--than the costs of unexpectedly sluggish growth. An asymmetrical directive also would convey a sense that the Committee did not see itself necessarily as finished with tightening and might help to counter any impression to the contrary conveyed by funds within a broad neutral zone. A symmetrical directive, on the other hand, would be more consistent with a cautious attitude toward any additional actions before the next meeting. With the risks better balanced than before, and given the extent of tightening already undertaken, the Committee might not want to react very quickly to data unless they seemed to suggest a very major deviation from expected conditions. With regard to implementing either strategy in conjunction with a discount rate increase, the staff has suggested the type of wording for the directive that has been used the last few times when decisions at FOMC meetings and changes approved by the Board in discount rates were coordinated. In those cases, the directive was worded to give the amount of tightening or ease the FOMC wanted to show through to reserve markets, and the discount rate was mentioned in a ìtaking account ofî phrase. The wording may be a bit obscure, but the understandings have been spelled out in the Minutes of the meeting and the role of the Committee could be mentioned in the press release of any discount rate change as well. 	21	21	2.0	0.0	999.0
199405	138	GREENSPAN	 Questions for Don? 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	139	MELZER	 Don, I just wanted to ask about the April tax payments and whether you think there is any peculiar behavior occurring that may be depressing Ml in the short run. A year ago we had a similar experience but you didn't mention that in terms of— 	22	22	2.0	1.0	42.0
199405	140	KOHN	 It's hard to parse this, President Melzer. In fact, April tax payments were up considerably from last year while last year they were low relative to the year before. It is true that this year's payments were less than we and everyone else had expected. So it's a little difficult to know exactly what seasonals were built in. Before we got this surge in early May, it looked as if the shortfall was bigger, and the low level of tax payments in April was one of the factors we were citing as a reason why Ml might have been slow in April because people hadn't built up their balances in order to pay taxes. That explanation didn't seem to have as much weight after the extra billions came in in early May and the tax receipts over the April-May period looked as if they were about 10 percent higher than last year. There might still be something in there since Ml growth this year is still low relative to its growth before the last year. It's very difficult to know what seasonals are implicitly calling for. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199405	141	GREENSPAN	 President Jordan. 	22	22	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	142	JORDAN	" Don, I read the Bluebook as saying a 4-1/2 percent funds rate is neutral and here's an attempt to produce that kind of policy stance. All of your commentary was in terms of the ""C"" versus ""D"" alternatives, a 1/4 point versus a 1/2 point increase. You didn't discuss the pros and cons of going immediately to 4-1/2 percent, assuming that that is a neutral policy stance, nor did you discuss the possibility that 4-1/2 percent is too low rather than too high. A lot of your remarks were in terms of: ""Well, we're not sure it's 4-1/2 percent; it might be 4-1/4 percent and there's even a possibility it might be 5, 5-1/2 or 6 percent."" Even if we went to 4-1/2 percent immediately, or in the next six months, and if there were no movement at all in bond yields, no effect at all, you'd still ﻿ have 300 basis points between the funds rate and long rates. What historical experience would lead you to believe that a 300 basis points upward slope in the yield curve is a neutral monetary policy? "	22	22	2.0	1.0	58.0
199405	143	KOHN	 Well, a couple of points. First, as between the 4 and 4-1/4 percent, I had assumed that those were the two options on the table. To be sure, moving eventually by more can't be ruled out— 75 basis points or even more. I tried, but perhaps it didn't come through in my remarks, to raise the issue that 4-1/4 percent certainly might not be enough; and I expressed some concern that we not get stuck calling this neutral and therefore find it hard to rise beyond that. I agree that the Committee certainly needs to keep its options open—that 4, 4-1/4, even 4-1/2 percent may not be sufficient. As to the slope of the yield curve, I think that's been a sometime thing in predicting economic activity. The yield curve was extraordinarily steeply sloped for several years in this current expansion before the expansion seemed finally to have gotten under way in a self-sustaining sense. It's certainly true that the markets have built into this spread more tightening than the staff forecast. I think it's a question of judgment as to where the implied economic strength is. Moreover, in judging the yield curve one has to take account of uncertainties and liquidity premiums. With all the uncertainty and higher volatility, some of the level of long-term rates is reflecting liquidity premiums, not necessarily expected movements in funds rates. But I don't disagree with the the overall thrust of your comment, which is that 4 or 4-1/4 or even 4-1/2 percent may not be high enough. I think Mike came to the same conclusion. 	22	22	2.0	0.0	999.0
199405	144	GREENSPAN	" If there are no further questions, why don't I begin? One of the interesting aspects of this whole period has been the extraordinarily parallel pattern of movement between dollar-denominated long-term rates and the deutschemark and the whole series of other currencies, despite the fact that there are no very persuasive reasons why all of these rates should be fundamentally coupled. You have to ask yourself under what conditions you get a coupling of rates for noneconomic reasons, or for reasons other than the basic type we usually see. The answer essentially lies in the notion, at least in my hypothesis, that if there is a risk premium out there which is generic, its impact will tend to be relatively the same depending not on what currency is involved but whether there is uncertainty about long-term commitments in financial markets and price stability in the markets. If we hypothesize that there has been a very significant increase in international portfolio holdings of many currencies, then if you get a major element of uncertainty—for example, if I'm a portfolio manager and I have long commitments in United States Treasuries on the expectation that prices are going to go up, and the markets go against me—what has happened is that my whole sense that ""I know what it's doing"" has collapsed. And the tendency, whenever uncertainty of that nature arises, is for human beings to disengage from whatever they're doing, to pull back. And pulling back in the United States Treasury market means going from 10-, 15-, and 3 0-year issues into the short end of the market, tilting the yield curve back up. But it also presupposes that any element of speculative uncertainty which exists in the holdings of long-term deutschemark relative to short-term deutschemark also induces an adjustment by sales of longer-term ﻿ securities and purchases of shorter-term. This adjustment obviously can spill over into all sorts of portfolio holdings, provided there's a large amount of communication. It is just very difficult to know why it is that United States dollar- denominated issues have so dominated the markets, and indeed why we at the central bank, by tightening, have obviously dislodged a lot of positions while creating a concept which is analogous to a generic risk premium that explains not the intercurrency movements but the movements from speculative positions—that is, from longer-end price- sensitive positions back to the shorter end. It also explains in part the nature of the financial bubble that we obviously have run into. This is a very interesting phenomenon because what we see is a very large increase in implied volatility in the long end of the market coming off the options, but only a very modest increase in the yield spreads of a number of the different types of instruments we use to measure credit risk. We've gotten a very small rise in the rate on six-month commercial paper over six-month Treasury bills; BAA corporate yield increases have been very small relative to United States Treasuries during all of this period. Junk bond yield spreads are not moving up, which is another way of saying that the concerns about the economy as such are not being undermined by all of this financial instability. What we come up against here is that there is a great deal of uncertainty and a lot of nervousness. And indeed some of it is purposeful on our part because if we are going to pierce the bubble, the only way we're going to pierce it is essentially to create a degree of uncertainty. The issue of uncertainty as being helpful or unhelpful is really not clear-cut. We experienced periods of relative certainty in the latter part of 1993 which everybody just looked at as though the markets had no downside price risks; everyone was committed. The yield spreads were very marginal, and indeed they had all been coming down dramatically from the 1987 peaks after the stock market crash, and there was an element of euphoria that really gripped the markets. You could see that in huge increases in mutual funds, both stock and bond funds. In fact, what we were dealing with largely was a situation in which there was very little uncertainty. That clearly was a very unhappy state of affairs; the mere fact that uncertainty did not exist was not a good; it clearly was a bad. And our endeavor to break that pattern, which we had to do even though it turned out to be a much bigger problem than we suspected, was a very purposeful endeavor to create a degree of uncertainty and readjust holdings from weak hands into firmer hands as far as speculative securities are concerned. As a consequence we have taken a very significant amount of air out of the bubble. We had discussions in this Committee not on the desirability of raising rates and tightening the markets because the economy needed it—I think that was a universal view—but there have been differences here about how much the financial system could take before its tensile strength broke. And I think what we have reached in conclusion at this particular point is the defusion of a good part of the bubble. I think there's still a lot of bubble around; we have not completely eliminated it. Nonetheless, we have the capability I would say at this stage to move more strongly than we usually do without the risk of cracking the system. I think the economy is probably stronger than we suspect, partly for reasons that I raised back in February; the inventory ﻿ situation just strikes me as too tranquil, and before this is all over I think we've got to get something moving on the inventory side. Look at the lead times on deliveries of materials; they've just moved up modestly. Slowdowns in promised deliveries have clearly moved up and that's far more than an issue of the weather in the month of February. So there are the makings here of stronger inventory changes than I think we recognize. The most interesting aspect of the economic outlook as I see it is that this far into the recovery—and it's almost immaterial whether or not you take Jerry's view that in effect we're only in the first year of the recovery--the actual inflation rates, wage rates, and the like are lower than one would ordinarily expect. This raises the question, which I've raised in earlier meetings, as to whether the lack of financial tinder is a relevant consideration here in holding inflation back. The truth of the matter is that it almost doesn't matter, because as Gary Stern said—and I think quite legitimately—we may not know what the future looks like but we do know at this particular stage, with the relative lack of imbalances that exist in the economy, that the chances of overdoing a tightening of monetary policy and creating a cascading down in economic activity are really not very large. If we overdo it, what we will do is push economic activity farther out. The chances of our breaking the back of the economy at this point—with inventory levels as low as they are, capital goods markets still with significant momentum, and the orders as strong as they are--have to be pretty low. The obvious problem is that errors on allowing inflation to take hold, even if the data raise questions as to whether it will, involve another type of risk altogether. As a central bank we obviously can't take that kind of risk. The sentiment of the Board of Governors, as you probably know, is to move the discount rate, as nearly all the Reserve Banks have requested, by 50 basis points today. And the implicit view of the Governors is to request of the Committee that we allow all of the increase to pass through. There is a balance of concerns as to how we should state that, but if we are going to act, I do think we should indicate that we are taking out a substantial part of the degree of accommodation that existed through the 1993 period. But I'd leave open the issue of any further moves; while we may pause for markets to interpret that, we ought to make adequate leeway to move should events require that we do so. My own impression is that we probably will not have to move before the next meeting if we do 50 basis points now. I find it unlikely that we are near the end of this pattern, but I do think we are now becoming more data dependent. There really are two credible economic scenarios that we have to keep in mind. One is something quite similar to the Greenbook forecast and, if that scenario evolves, the inflationary pressures on the system will come down. If it doesn't evolve, if we still have momentum in the system, I think the pressures are going to pick up on us to move--not immediately, but sooner rather than later. The crucial issue as far as I'm concerned, however, even though it's not a critical matter in the forecast, is to watch what's happening to the financial system— what's happening to bank loans, to credit extensions, to the degree of financial tinder that is either not moving or moving. We need to be very careful about this very large risk premium that exists in the financial markets, which basically says that this bubble is a bigger ﻿ one than we had anticipated. We've caused a good part of it to dissipate, maybe even most of it, but it's very obvious from the implied volatility numbers we're getting out of the options that these markets are not about to simmer down very quickly. So, I merely have put the issue out on the table. I have a particular view, were we to move 50 basis points, on whether we should go symmetric or asymmetric. My preference is symmetric, but frankly I don't think it means very much because if the economy accelerates we'll be holding special Committee discussions, with or without symmetry in the directive language. My own inclination would be to go symmetric at this stage, but I don't feel very strongly about it. With that I open this issue up. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	145	FORRESTAL	 Mr. Chairman, as you know, I've been a proponent of gradualism, but I believe we're at the point where we need to take more aggressive actions. I think the gradualistic approach may have created some uncertainty in the market. I've heard some of the same comments as were reported earlier. People have suggested that if we are going to do something, we ought to take strong action. So, I'm really supportive of that action. I think there is considerable momentum in the economy. Our forecast, as I indicated earlier, is for stronger growth than the Greenbook forecast, and even building in 50 basis points we see the inflation numbers in 1995 as unacceptable. So, I think that there ought to be a 50 basis point pass-through to the market, and I would prefer a symmetric directive as well. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	39.0
199405	146	GREENSPAN	 President Parry. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	147	PARRY	 I, too, would support a 50 basis point move and I prefer a symmetric directive. I must admit I'm not convinced at this point that our gradual approach was the wrong one, and it still may serve us well in the future. But I do think 50 basis points is appropriate at this time. The other point I'd like to make is that I hope any public statement we make doesn't convey either the impression that we are likely to do anything in the near term or that we are likely to rest on our oars for a while. I think that — 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199405	148	GREENSPAN	 Excuse me, I'll just read you a very preliminary draft. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	149	MINEHAN	 Which you just happen to have! 	23	23	2.0	1.0	62.0
199405	150	GREENSPAN	" I just happen to have it here! This implies that we move on both the discount rate and the funds rate. ""These actions, combined with the three adjustments initiated earlier this year by the FOMC, substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation which prevailed throughout 1993. As always, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor developments in the economy and financial markets to judge the appropriate stance of monetary policy."" I think that captures where we want to be. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	151	PARRY	 Good. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	45.0
199405	152	GREENSPAN	 President Melzer. ﻿ 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	153	MELZER	 Alan, I would endorse what you recommended. I'd like to briefly state my reasons. First of all, as you know I've viewed the stance of monetary policy as having been very accommodative for some time, which I think will lay the basis for an acceleration in inflation. Over the last three years, for example, our net open market purchases of government securities have totaled over $100 billion, which is a staggering number. This expansion in base money has fostered a tremendous increase in liquidity, with the narrow money stock, Ml, increasing by one third over this period. Secondly, I don't think we've gained credibility in financial and foreign exchange markets with respect to our resolve to contain inflationary pressures, let alone achieving or moving further toward price stability. With respect to the risk of overdoing it, I would agree with what you said. One of the things I looked at in that connection is the prevailing forward rate structure, which is cited in the Greenbook; it anticipates about 150 basis points of increase in short-term rates before the end of the year. So, as I say, I don't think this move is overdoing it. In fact, if we don't keep up with sustained increases in market interest rates, I think we run the risk of a policy that continues to be accommodative and will simply increase the inflationary pressures down the road. With respect to the statement that you read, I would be concerned about anything that was interpreted as our having reached neutrality, because I don't think we really know. I'm a little concerned that maybe those words—I don't have an alternative suggestion--too strongly suggest that we've reached a neutral stance. I just don't know what that is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199405	154	GREENSPAN	 Neither do we. President Broaddus. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	155	BROADDUS	 Needless to say, I support your proposal enthusiastically, but I share Tom Melzer's feelings. When I heard the statement I had the same kind of feelings that you had, Tom—that it may tend to suggest that we've reached a plateau or reached neutrality. Maybe we can work on it a little bit. Also, along those lines, I don't have really strong feelings about the language of the directive, but I think a symmetric directive would tend to create the impression that we have reached a plateau. So, while I would accept a symmetric directive, I have a preference for an asymmetric directive. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	59.0
199405	156	GREENSPAN	 President Boehne. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	157	BOEHNE	 I support a 1/2 point increase, the symmetric directive, and I like the draft statement the way it is. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	33.0
199405	158	GREENSPAN	 First Vice President Minehan. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	159	MINEHAN	 I agree with President Boehne. We support the 50 basis points; we support the symmetric directive, and the wording of the statement. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	62.0
199405	160	GREENSPAN	 President Stern. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	161	STERN	 I support the proposal in its entirety. I am a little concerned--somebody mentioned this earlier—about the comments we get from time to time that we ought to take whatever actions we're going to take and then pause. I don't think the statement gives the ﻿ impression that we're necessarily locking ourselves into that for any extended period of time. I guess what I'm concerned about is a view in the markets now, and I don't know why it should arise now, that we are more clairvoyant than we are—that we somehow know where we're going and when we're going to stop. And I think we ought to be careful and try not to convey that impression. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	41.0
199405	162	GREENSPAN	 President Hoenig. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	163	HOENIG	 I endorse the proposed moves, both of them. The economic case continues to exist for this move and I think we do have a window of opportunity for making it. I support symmetric language. I am a little concerned about the statement giving the impression that we are satisfied or that this pause may run a while, although I can't think of a better way of saying it. That's the only concern I have, Mr. Chairman. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	56.0
199405	164	GREENSPAN	 President Keehn. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	165	KEEHN	 Well, Mr. Chairman, I certainly support the proposal. The only question I have is a technical one. Is this a single announcement today and is it going to be announced by you or announced by the Committee or— 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199405	166	GREENSPAN	 It's going to be announced as a part of the discount rate announcement. In other words, there's no need to make two separate announcements. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	167	KEEHN	 Okay. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	35.0
199405	168	GREENSPAN	 It's not by me; it will be by Joe Coyne. Governor LaWare. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	169	LAWARE	 Mr. Chairman, I'm very pleased to support your recommendation, and I think the elegance of the language permits the interpretation that was intended--that we may still be probing, that we are not sure that we are at neutrality, that we have taken a significant step forward, but we're not at all committed to standing pat. I just think the language is beautifully composed. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	50.0
199405	170	MELZER	" One suggestion, I'm sorry to butt in, but maybe the phrase ""significantly reduces"" rather than ""substantially removes."" I don't know whether that— "	23	23	2.0	1.0	42.0
199405	171	GREENSPAN	 We played with that. I think it's a tricky issue and I'm trying to avoid—if we ever tried to write a communique around this table we would be here for a good six months! President McTeer. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	172	MCTEER	 I support your recommendation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	53.0
199405	173	GREENSPAN	 Governor Phillips. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	174	PHILLIPS	 I also support your recommendation. It seems to me that it is appropriate to go ahead and make our statement in the market, and I think this proposal would do so. When we started this series of moves of 25 basis points, we talked about the notion that ﻿ when we think the series of moves should come to an end we should so signal. I don't think— 	23	23	2.0	1.0	57.0
199405	175	GREENSPAN	 It was at the point when we thought that the structure of the financial markets could take more. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	176	PHILLIPS	 Right, right. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	57.0
199405	177	GREENSPAN	 At the very beginning we were concerned that we would be hitting the markets too hard. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	178	PHILLIPS	 I don't know whether we're at neutrality or not. There is an argument that we may well be at neutrality because we may be getting more of a kick from our tightening actions as a result of the increase in long-term rates. So, in any case, I support your recommendation. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	57.0
199405	179	GREENSPAN	 President Jordan. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	47.0
199405	180	JORDAN	" Your initial remarks I think are very important. We can learn a fair amount if we think more about what's going on with relative yields. Normally when we think about a relative move it's either by quality spreads, by currency denomination, or by maturity. At one time I studied the behavior of interest rates in periods of crisis atmosphere relating to an international event: Suez, the Bay of Pigs Cuban missile crisis, the Yom Kippur War, Iraq in 1990, and so on. The yield curve always steepens very sharply as portfolio managers shorten their horizons. As the uncertainty dissipates the yield curve flattens. That's quite different from the cyclical behavior of the yield curve as an expansion matures. I think that we're closer to conditions of 1978 than we are to some other historical episodes. In April 1978 President Carter said that there was no danger that excess demand would spill over and raise prices just when the latter were about to explode. And through 1974, 1975, and 1976, as you recall, the economy was fairly tranquil; wages were fairly well behaved. Some of this started to change a little in 1977, but nobody saw it coming. At least I certainly didn't. The Administration had misread the situation in 1978 because they looked at things like wages; they looked at a lot of things and said there was no problem with inflation, and they were wrong. They never saw it coming. And I'm concerned that we may be wrong again. It struck me in the go-around earlier that at least some of you looking at the world from inside the beltway—Governors Kelley, LaWare, and Phillips --have a different feel of the economy than what I sense from the other twelve of us. Certainly I thought this was a marked difference, and I'm not sure quite what to make of that. I'm not troubled with the idea of saying we're at neutral and we're on hold. If a very powerful move had to be made, we would act anyway. None of us is going to know in advance whether any 25 basis point difference is significant or not, whether it's to 4-1/4 or 4-1/2 or 4-3/4 percent. But to me it's quite different to say we're at 4-1/2 percent and we think that it's just as likely the next move is down as up sometime out in the future. Being neutral implies an equal probability that the next move will be down as up; we never know this. If this group walks out of here today saying we're at 4-1/4 percent and most people's commentary is, as it has been after the last couple of meetings, that we've got more to go, I would find that troubling. ﻿ I would much rather if everybody walked out and said we're at 4-1/4 percent and we don't know whether the next move will be down or up. To me that's a lot different than the majority of people responding in the weeks ahead, as we get queries about this, saying: ""Well, we're not quite at neutral; we've got more to go."" That adds uncertainty to the bond market that I don't view as constructive. I would rather have a stronger statement that we don't know when we're going to move again and if we do, it might be down or up. If people are not comfortable with that 4-1/4 percent, let's go to 4-1/2 percent and do a full point on the discount rate. I'd rather do more than less. "	23	23	2.0	1.0	58.0

199405	182	MCDONOUGH	 I support the 50 basis point increase in the funds rate and the symmetric directive. I think it is going to be seen as a very powerful action by the marketplace both inside the United States and out. I do think that we have to make a statement. There will be people whose only view of the world is based on their own trading positions who will be disappointed by our not saying the word of God is that this is it for some extended period of time. We can't say that and shouldn't say that, but I think we should be aware that it is not a sure thing that this action plus the statement, which I think makes a great deal of sense, will necessarily stabilize the financial markets. I hope it does, and it probably will after a couple of days, but it need not happen in the hour or two or even a day or so after the meeting. I believe it will be very well received outside the United States where attitudes are to a substantial degree affected or influenced by our fellow central bankers. The Chairman was at the last BIS meeting and, if I may say so, did an unusually good job of explaining the United States position, and I don't think anybody who attended that meeting will have any doubt that this is a very firm, decisive action. And I think we will be very much applauded by our fellow central bankers in many of the countries around the world. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	61.0

199405	186	LINDSEY	 I support the statement, Mr. Chairman. I think we will be coming back. I thought President Jordan made a very good point, and probably nine days ago I was about where he is. But I think this is the right move for right now and I don't know if I can pick any number where I could go out and say that the probabilities of moving up or down are equal. There's a level of uncertainty about the economy and about the financial markets that causes me to express some uncertainty about my interest rate objective. I think the statement is very well written, and I support it. 	23	23	2.0	1.0	54.0
199405	187	BERNARD	" I'll be reading from page 15 of the Bluebook. ""In the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to increase somewhat the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible increase in the ﻿ discount rate. In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration of economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly greater reserve restraint or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with modest growth in M2 and M3 over coming months."" "	23	23	2.0	0.0	999.0
