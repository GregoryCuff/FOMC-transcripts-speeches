201504	0	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Good afternoon, everyone.	5	5
201504	1	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to welcome back First Vice Presidents Holcomb and Prichard, who will again be representing Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively.	5	5
201504	2	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On a sad note, my understanding is that this is the last FOMC meeting for New York First Vice President Chris Cumming.	5	5
201504	3	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Chris has attended 92 FOMC meetings, 70 of which she attended as an alternate voter.	5	5
201504	4	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, as all of you know, Chris has been involved in a wide array of System work over many years in all facets of what we do and has been a very wonderful colleague.	5	5
201504	5	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Chris, I really thank you for your service and want you to know that you will be very much missed.	5	5
201504	6	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Applause]	5	5
201504	7	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Next, I’m pleased to let you know that Brian Madigan has agreed to return to the Board’s Division of Monetary Affairs as deputy director, reporting to Thomas, effective June 1.	5	5
201504	8	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think all of you know that Brian served as director of the division and as FOMC secretary from 2007 to 2010.	5	5
201504	9	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Since he retired from the Board, Brian has been a visiting professor in the Department of Economics at Georgetown University.	5	5
201504	10	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, as I think many of you know, in recent years, the job of director of the Division of Monetary Affairs has become increasingly burdensome.	5	5
201504	11	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It has entailed serving as the Committee’s chief monetary policy advisor, as secretary of the FOMC, and as leader of a large organization with critical responsibilities.	5	5
201504	12	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	As part of a strategy to create a more sustainable situation, Brian will have oversight responsibility for the FOMC Secretariat and will play a key role in the production of the minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings.	5	5
201504	13	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Obviously, these are things he has done superbly well in the past and for which he is eminently well qualified.	5	5
201504	14	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Accordingly, I intend to propose that Brian be appointed by the FOMC as its secretary.	5	5
201504	15	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Unless there are objections, I will ask the FOMC Secretariat to send out a request in early June for notation votes to select Brian as our secretary.	5	5
201504	16	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Under this arrangement, Thomas will continue to serve as the Committee’s primary advisor on monetary policy and will also be able to dedicate more of his energy to ensuring that the Division of Monetary Affairs fulfills its critical role in supporting our monetary policy and other responsibilities.	5	5
201504	17	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	5	5
201504	18	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, the first two items on our agenda today will be considered in a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, and, accordingly, I need a motion to close the Board meeting.	5	5
201504	19	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	So moved.	5	5
201504	20	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	5	5
201504	21	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Without objection.	5	5
201504	22	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our first item is financial developments and open market operations, and let me call on Simon to deliver the Desk report.	61	6
201504	23	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201504	24	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Lorie and I will split the briefing into three parts.	61	6
201504	25	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	First, I will review financial market developments.	61	6
201504	26	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Next, Lorie will review Desk operations.	61	6
201504	27	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Finally, I will discuss staff work on enhancing the calculation methodology for the federal funds effective rate.	61	6
201504	28	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, domestic financial conditions eased following more-accommodative-than-expected US monetary policy communications and weaker-than-expected economic data, including the March employment report.	61	6
201504	29	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	On net, nominal Treasury rates declined by as many as 25 basis points, the S&P 500 index gained 2 percent, and the DXY dollar index decreased nearly 3 percent.	61	6
201504	30	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	A substantial portion of these changes came around the time of the March FOMC events, which were characterized as being more accommodative than expected despite the removal of “patient” language from the statement.	61	6
201504	31	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Investors pointed, in particular, to the large downward shift in the target federal funds rate projections in the SEP and, to a lesser extent, the downward revisions to Committee participants’ projections of inflation, GDP growth, and the longer-run unemployment rate.	61	6
201504	32	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The left column of your top-left panel shows that nominal and real interest rates declined in the one-hour window around the statement and SEP releases, while measures of inflation compensation rose, equity prices increased, and the dollar weakened.	61	6
201504	33	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the right column of the table, the absolute magnitudes of these moves were very large relative to changes in one-hour windows around FOMC statement releases over the past decade.	61	6
201504	34	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	One hypothesis for seeing moves of this magnitude could be decreased market liquidity.	61	6
201504	35	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, late in the trading session outside the window used to measure these FOMC announcement effects, there was a very large move in the euro‒dollar currency pair.	61	6
201504	36	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The move pushed the intraday trading range for the currency pair to over 4 percent, a 5 standard deviation move over the period since 2004, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201504	37	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The size of the move is comparable to the 6 standard deviation range in the 10-year Treasury yield on October 15, both of which took place amid very high volumes.	61	6
201504	38	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The March FOMC events shifted out expectations for the timing of liftoff according to the Desk surveys, as shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201504	39	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The “flash” survey, taken three business days after the March FOMC meeting, suggests that most of the shift occurred in response to the meeting and the large price moves in the hour following the March FOMC statement release, therefore likely reflecting shifting policy expectations as opposed to outsized liquidity effects.	61	6
201504	40	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Since the flash survey, soft domestic economic data and speeches from Federal Reserve officials appear to have further solidified this shift in policy expectations.	61	6
201504	41	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The April surveys also showed a notably slower expected pace of policy normalization after liftoff.	61	6
201504	42	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The middle-right panel shows that the probability distribution for the pace of tightening in the first year after liftoff, assuming no return to the zero bound, shifted toward a slower pace over the period, the first notable shift in these views since the question was originally asked last September.	61	6
201504	43	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	A similar shift occurred in the distribution of the expected pace of tightening in the second year after liftoff.	61	6
201504	44	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	In considering when the Federal Reserve will begin to normalize monetary policy, market participants are particularly focused on the outlook for inflation and the Committee’s reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective.	61	6
201504	45	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We asked survey respondents to score the importance of various factors they believe the Committee will use in assessing whether reasonable confidence in the inflation outlook has been achieved.	61	6
201504	46	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, respondents assigned the most importance to a further improvement in the labor market and the absence of weakening in realized core inflation.	61	6
201504	47	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, market-based measures of inflation compensation increased alongside higher energy prices and a weaker US dollar, as shown in the bottom-right panel.	61	6
201504	48	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Forward measures of inflation compensation increased at both shorter- and longer-dated horizons but remain below levels at the end of 2013.	61	6
201504	49	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The increases over the period were attributed to the March FOMC communications, somewhat higher-than-expected realized inflation, the increase in oil prices, and positioning dynamics in the TIPS market.	61	6
201504	50	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Longer-term inflation expectations from Desk surveys were little changed over the period.	61	6
201504	51	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Meanwhile, front-month Brent crude increased nearly 22 percent but remains more than 40 percent lower since the end of 2013.	61	6
201504	52	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As I noted, the DXY dollar index declined nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period but is over 20 percent higher since the end of 2013.	61	6
201504	53	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Despite the depreciation over the period, market participants expect the exchange value of the US dollar to continue its broad appreciation amid ongoing monetary policy divergence across major economies.	61	6
201504	54	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Desk dealer survey respondents reported that dollar appreciation seen since last summer has prompted them to revise lower their forecasts for 2015 growth and inflation, with the median markdowns to 2015 GDP growth and core PCE inflation of roughly 40 basis points and 20 basis points, respectively.	61	6
201504	55	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	A key factor contributing to broad dollar strength has been widening global interest rate differentials, especially between the United States and the euro area.	61	6
201504	56	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	These interest rate differentials became more pronounced as euro-area sovereign rates have traded increasingly negative and yield curves have flattened substantially.	61	6
201504	57	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The top-left panel of your next exhibit shows the extent of negative rate trading by country and maturity.	61	6
201504	58	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Red indicates that 100 percent of the bonds in that category trade at a negative yield, while green indicates that none trade negative.	61	6
201504	59	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Despite the continued decline in euro-area rates and the increasing universe of securities trading at negative yields, there have been few market-functioning issues, and the ECB has stated that it has had little trouble achieving its purchase targets thus far.	61	6
201504	60	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Even so, it is possible that market functioning strains will emerge over time, and to help address such strains, the ECB unveiled details of an augmented securities- lending program aimed at supporting bond and repo market liquidity.	61	6
201504	61	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The declines in euro-area rates, coupled with the very large currency depreciation and increase in equities, have substantially eased European financial conditions since President Draghi’s remarks at the Jackson Hole symposium last August.	61	6
201504	62	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	It is interesting to compare the asset price reaction with recent LSAP programs.	61	6
201504	63	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Using the price changes from when asset purchase expectations began to form until three months after the purchase programs were announced, the ECB’s PSPP and BOJ’s QQE, shown in the left and middle columns of the top-right panel, respectively, contributed to significant currency depreciation and meaningful equity price increases.	61	6
201504	64	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The ECB’s program resulted in large declines in German nominal forward rates, but it has not been accompanied by an increase in longer-dated forward inflation measures.	61	6
201504	65	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	In comparison, Japanese policies supported a large rise in forward inflation compensation and a pronounced increase in equities, perhaps stemming from the focus on reaching the new higher inflation target.	61	6
201504	66	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	By contrast, US asset price reactions to LSAP3 were more limited, as the right column shows— though it did have a large effect in the mortgage markets, which is not included in the panel.	61	6
201504	67	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	One potential flashpoint for financial markets is the highly fluid situation in Greece.	61	6
201504	68	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	While Greek asset prices have responded sharply to recent developments, the broader market reaction to perceived downside risks in Greece has been relatively muted and perhaps a bit complacent.	61	6
201504	69	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Market participants attribute the lack of spillovers to institutional improvements in the euro area, reduced private-sector exposure to Greece, and the effects of ECB asset purchases.	61	6
201504	70	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Reflecting the mounting liquidity pressure from deposit flight and bank funding strains, Greek banks have also increased their borrowing via the emergency liquidity assistance program to €76 billion in April from €69 billion in March.	61	6
201504	71	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As would be expected, Greece’s Target2 liability, which represents balances owed to others in the Eurosystem, rose in March, shown in the middle-left panel.	61	6
201504	72	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	This level is near Greece’s prior peak Target2 liability in June 2012.	61	6
201504	73	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	It is uncertain how long the Greek government will be able to meet its debt obligations.	61	6
201504	74	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants still expect an agreement between Greece and its creditors to be reached but only after a high-stakes game of brinkmanship.	61	6
201504	75	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Steve will further discuss Greece in his briefing.	61	6
201504	76	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Shifting to emerging markets, there has been a very sharp increase in Chinese equities over recent months, shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201504	77	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Over the intermeeting period, mainland Chinese and Hong Kong equities rose by 23 percent and 16 percent, respectively, and, over the past year, the Shanghai Composite has more than doubled.	61	6
201504	78	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Mainland equity outperformance came despite a worsening domestic economic outlook and probably involved some speculative dynamics, though it was supported by expected and actual monetary policy easing.	61	6
201504	79	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	During the intermeeting period, the People’s Bank of China cut their reserve requirement ratio by a larger-than-expected 100 basis points; most contacts expect additional cuts to reserve requirements or decreases in lending and deposit rates in the near term.	61	6
201504	80	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Equity prices in other emerging markets also increased, and, as shown in the bottom-left panel, broader EM asset prices rose, partially retracing prior period declines.	61	6
201504	81	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The moves were supported by the accommodative March FOMC communication as well as a moderate abatement of risks in a number of countries, including Brazil and Russia.	61	6
201504	82	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	This partial retracement of emerging market asset prices came despite continued markdowns of expected growth in several countries.	61	6
201504	83	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	These markdowns and recent US dollar strength have contributed to a broader trend of emerging market currency depreciation since the May 2013 JEC testimony or so- called taper tantrum.	61	6
201504	84	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Some market participants are concerned that taper tantrum–like volatility in emerging markets could materialize as the Federal Reserve approaches normalization.	61	6
201504	85	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Recall that implied volatility in emerging market currencies rose sharply with US interest rate implied volatility in spring 2013, shown in the bottom-right panel, and has recently moved back to similar levels.	61	6
201504	86	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Decelerating emerging market growth and rising corporate leverage, as well as volatility in commodity prices may make emerging markets vulnerable as normalization nears.	61	6
201504	87	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	However, these risks are somewhat offset by lower emerging market asset valuations and reportedly more cautious positioning from emerging market investors, as discussed in the special QS memo.	61	6
201504	88	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Volatility in emerging markets is only one part of broader financial market volatility that some worry could ensue from expected Federal Reserve normalization.	61	6
201504	89	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Indeed, a senior IMF official recently warned of a “super taper tantrum,” in which negative term premiums would be rapidly decompressed as domestic policy rates are increased; Thomas will comment more on this risk in his briefing.	61	6
201504	90	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Given the punctuated bouts of recent realized volatility in the very deep and liquid markets I discussed earlier, financial market volatility during normalization could be even more challenging for relatively illiquid markets.	61	6
201504	91	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I will now take questions before turning to Lorie.	61	6
201504	92	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	No questions?	61	6
201504	93	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Lorie.	61	6
201504	94	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201504	95	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	I’ll start with exhibit 3 and provide an update on MBS reinvestments, discuss testing of normalization tools, and conclude with the staff recommendation to extend the existing central bank liquidity and swap arrangements.	61	6
201504	96	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk’s MBS reinvestment operations continue to go smoothly, and MBS market liquidity remains stable.	61	6
201504	97	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The continued trend toward higher prepayment speeds in March was largely an ongoing result of the low mortgage rates witnessed earlier in the year and has pushed the current monthly reinvestment amount up to approximately $40 billion, as shown in the top-left panel of your third exhibit.	61	6
201504	98	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Despite the increased size of reinvestments, we do not anticipate having any issues with the execution of MBS operations, but we have increased the frequency of our operations to accommodate their larger size.	61	6
201504	99	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Testing of the Federal Reserve’s overnight and term RRP operations continued over the intermeeting period.	61	6
201504	100	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Patterns of total RRP demand remained broadly consistent with recent experience, as shown in the top-right panel.	61	6
201504	101	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The additional 25 counterparties that began participating in operations on March 16 have only modestly affected overall RRP usage.	61	6
201504	102	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For broader perspective on the Federal Reserve’s involvement in reverse repo activity, this panel also includes reverse repos conducted with foreign official institutions, known as the “foreign RP pool,” shown in gray.	61	6
201504	103	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The size of the foreign RP pool is notably above its pre-crisis levels, largely a reflection of central banks’ desire to hold greater dollar liquidity buffers, while at the same time they are tightening their counterparty risk-management frameworks.	61	6
201504	104	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Increases in the foreign RP pool this period, and since the beginning of the year, have been primarily driven by a single customer who has sought to increase the liquidity profile of its FX reserves due to precautionary financial-stability motivations, in part by raising its cash balance held at the Federal Reserve.	61	6
201504	105	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The Desk conducted two term operations over March quarter-end, the first a $75 billion, 14-day operation and the second a $125 billion, 7-day operation, summarized in your middle-left panel.	61	6
201504	106	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	This $200 billion offering in term RRPs reduced the Federal Reserve’s overall RRP offered amount spanning quarter-end to $500 billion, down from the $600 billion offered at year-end.	61	6
201504	107	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, the reduction did not appear to have an adverse effect on markets or meaningfully change participation, likely because the amount offered was perceived to still provide ample headroom above expected demand.	61	6
201504	108	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The 14-day operation was modestly oversubscribed, with $81 billion in propositions and a stop-out rate of 9 basis points, a slightly higher rate than was expected.	61	6
201504	109	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The 7-day operation conducted on March 30 was undersubscribed, with $101 billion in propositions submitted and a stop-out rate at the max offering rate of 10 basis points, similar to the rates on the undersubscribed operations held closer to year-end.	61	6
201504	110	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Substitution between overnight and term RRPs and the breakdown of counterparty demand at the March term operations were broadly similar to behavior observed in December.	61	6
201504	111	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in your middle-right panel, the Desk’s RRP operations continued to provide a soft floor under short-term interest rates, even around quarter-end.	61	6
201504	112	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The federal funds effective rate averaged 12 basis points over the period and printed at 6 basis points on quarter-end.	61	6
201504	113	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	While rates and volumes in unsecured markets over quarter-end were broadly in line with expectations, temporary funding pressures in secured markets were much larger than expected, with the overnight GCF repo index for Treasury collateral, shown in the dark blue line, printing at 45 basis points.	61	6
201504	114	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Further, the dispersion in repo rates increased notably.	61	6
201504	115	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For example, the spread between rates on overnight Treasury GCF repo and triparty repo widened considerably on quarter-end.	61	6
201504	116	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	This spread, shown in your bottom-left panel, reached 30 basis points on quarter-end.	61	6
201504	117	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	While all the factors that drove the larger-than- expected widening between repo rates are not fully understood, institutions with stable access to triparty repo funding appeared to demand increased compensation to intermediate between triparty cash lenders, like money funds, and GCF borrowers, such as smaller or less creditworthy dealers.	61	6
201504	118	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	It should also be noted that the spread between GCF and triparty repo rates has been gradually widening over the past several months even outside quarter-end.	61	6
201504	119	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	This trend is likely partially driven by financial institutions modifying behavior in response to regulatory changes and associated higher costs to intermediate between triparty and GCF repo markets.	61	6
201504	120	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Looking forward, pursuant to the resolution adopted at the March FOMC meeting, the staff proposes conducting term RRP tests over June quarter-end.	61	6
201504	121	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For the June quarter-end, we suggest a slightly different approach to the public communication about the term RRPs than was used in December and March.	61	6
201504	122	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	As outlined in your bottom-right panel, the Desk proposes to release a statement shortly after the April FOMC meeting minutes on May 20 that would note the tentative intention to offer at least $200 billion of term RRPs in addition to capacity of overnight RRPs for the June quarter-end.	61	6
201504	123	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Based on our experience with the March term operations, we believe that $200 billion in term RRP capacity over June quarter- end, in combination with at least $300 billion capacity in overnight RRP, should provide sufficient headroom on total RRP availability, assuming no change in the target range.	61	6
201504	124	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Further, we would propose noting in the statement that the Desk would release the remaining details on Monday, June 22—that is, after the June FOMC meeting.	61	6
201504	125	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	We would thus come back to the Committee with a recommendation of the exact size and maximum offering rate for each operation at or shortly after the June meeting.	61	6
201504	126	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	This communication approach could be replicated in future quarter-ends and should provide the market with confidence in available supply around quarter- ends, but, importantly, retain some flexibility to adjust the specific parameters of the operations should the Committee decide to lift off.	61	6
201504	127	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	In order to maintain operational readiness with the TDF—both within the Federal Reserve and among banks—the staff is developing plans to resume a routine, every- other-month testing schedule that would be similar to that employed prior to the series of special larger test operations conducted over the past year.	61	6
201504	128	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Offering rates, counterparty limits, and other terms of these operations would be set so that the scale of such testing operations would be modest.	61	6
201504	129	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The tentative plan is to announce and resume the routine periodic testing beginning next month.	61	6
201504	130	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, the work on implementing changes to the methodology for calculating interest payments is proceeding according to schedule.	61	6
201504	131	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Comments on the Federal Register notice are due by the middle of May.	61	6
201504	132	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	If there are no major issues raised by those comments, the staff should be in a position to implement the new methodology before the June FOMC meeting as planned.	61	6
201504	133	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Your fourth exhibit begins with the focus of some market participants over the intermeeting period on the discussion of normalization tools that appeared in the March FOMC minutes.	61	6
201504	134	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Contacts specifically highlighted the discussion concerning temporarily elevated capacity for the ON RRP facility.	61	6
201504	135	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	In the Desk’s April surveys, respondents were asked to provide their expectations for both the level of the daily aggregate cap and level of ON RRP demand around the time of liftoff.	61	6
201504	136	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-left panel of your final exhibit, 10 respondents expected there to be no cap on the ON RRP facility immediately following liftoff.	61	6
201504	137	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Among those respondents expecting a cap at liftoff, the median expectation was a cap of $500 billion, and all anticipated that ON RRP demand would be at or below the cap.	61	6
201504	138	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Across all respondents, regardless of whether they expected a cap, the median expected level of ON RRP demand immediately after liftoff was $300 billion, unchanged from the March survey.	61	6
201504	139	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	However, many respondents did update their expectations for ON RRP demand from the previous survey—both immediately after liftoff and one- and three-years ahead.	61	6
201504	140	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Expectations shifted in both directions, with a number of participants moving their expectations by several hundred billion dollars, perhaps pointing to significant uncertainly about the likely level of take-up.	61	6
201504	141	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Respondents were also asked about their expectations for the variation in ON RRP demand over various time horizons.	61	6
201504	142	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	They expected the variability of the ON RRP demand around the time of liftoff to be more elevated than recent experience, largely due to uncertainties over the mix of overnight and term RRPs as well as how regulatory reforms might affect money markets when rates rise from the zero lower bound.	61	6
201504	143	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	In terms of the expected levels of money market rates at liftoff, the median estimate across respondents for the level of the federal funds effective rate was 35 basis points—very close to the center of the expected target range.	61	6
201504	144	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The April surveys also asked respondents for the probability they attach to the level of the effective rate averaging within certain ranges during the month following liftoff.	61	6
201504	145	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	As shown in the top-right panel, respondents assigned very high probabilities to the effective rate being within the target range and only a negligible probability to the effective rate being outside the range.	61	6
201504	146	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Finally, as discussed in the memo sent to the Committee on April 15, we would like to ask the Committee to vote on the authorization to renew for another year the standing liquidity swap arrangements with foreign central banks and NAFA swap arrangements.	61	6
201504	147	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	While the liquidity arrangements were authorized for an indefinite period in October 2013, the FOMC has the ability to unilaterally terminate its participation with six months’ notice.	61	6
201504	148	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	This is similar to the NAFA swap arrangements with Mexico and Canada, which are renewable annually on or before December 15 of each year and require six months’ notice to terminate.	61	6
201504	149	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The use of liquidity swap lines recently has been sparse, as shown in the middle- left panel, with demand limited to regularly scheduled seven-day dollar auctions held by the Bank of Japan over year-end and March quarter-end.	61	6
201504	150	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	While this is consistent with relatively calm conditions in dollar funding markets, we believe the swap lines are an important liquidity backstop, helping to maintain stability and confidence in global funding markets.	61	6
201504	151	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Additionally, liquidity swap and NAFA swap arrangements are tangible and constructive signals of cooperation among central banks, and their attendant costs are minimal.	61	6
201504	152	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Liquidity swap arrangements also support the approach that the Federal Reserve along with other major central banks have endorsed that there are “no technical obstacles” to central banks’ capabilities to provide liquidity quickly to a systemically important financial market utility.	61	6
201504	153	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	Therefore, the staff recommends that the Committee vote to renew the liquidity swap lines and NAFA arrangements.	61	6
201504	154	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	I will now turn back to Simon to discuss the calculation methodology for the effective funds rate.	61	6
201504	155	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Thanks, Lorie.	61	6
201504	156	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As detailed in a memo circulated in advance of the meeting, the staff has assessed that there might be some merit in changing the calculation methodology underlying the federal funds effective rate concurrent with the change in data source to the FR 2420.	61	6
201504	157	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We are interested in the Committee’s initial feedback on this assessment.	61	6
201504	158	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As you are aware, the federal funds effective rate is currently calculated as a volume-weighted mean.	61	6
201504	159	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	That is, each observed transaction rate is weighted by the share of total volume transacted at this rate, and the effective rate is the sum of these weighted rates.	61	6
201504	160	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The distribution of volume by rates for a particular day from the FR 2420 data is shown in the middle-right panel.	61	6
201504	161	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The staff’s assessment is that it may be more appropriate to calculate the effective rate as the median (that is, the 50th percentile) of the distribution rather than its mean.	61	6
201504	162	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As shown in the bottom-left panel, the volume-weighted median generates a statistic that is the same as, or very close to, the mean at most times except for the crisis period.	61	6
201504	163	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	However, on those occasions when the mean and median do differ significantly, the staff’s preliminary analysis shows that the median is typically a better measure of broad money market conditions across a wide range of situations.	61	6
201504	164	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Moreover, the median is much more robust to invalid data.	61	6
201504	165	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	In general, for an invalid transaction to affect the median, it must have a large volume attached to it, while the mean can be moved by an invalid transaction that has a more typical volume and rate.	61	6
201504	166	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The staff believes this characteristic of the median would enhance both the integrity of the effective federal funds rate as a reference rate as well its credibility as a monetary policy instrument.	61	6
201504	167	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We look forward to your views on this subject, and, based on your feedback, the staff may present a plan to move forward at the June meeting.	61	6
201504	168	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	61	6
201504	169	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	That concludes our remarks.	61	6
201504	170	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	61	6
201504	171	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions or comments, particularly in response to Simon’s request for comments on the federal funds rate?	62	6
201504	172	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201504	173	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201504	174	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I found that the staff memo and also the memo to Reserve Bank research directors made a pretty good case, to my mind, for using the volume-weighted median.	62	6
201504	175	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s a better measure of financial conditions for all the reasons that you went through, Simon.	62	6
201504	176	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In addition, it’s more difficult to manipulate.	62	6
201504	177	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	What I mean is, in theory, any trade moves a mean, whereas to move the median, it either needs to be further away or bigger.	62	6
201504	178	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Anyway, I think it is a good case, and I guess I have two questions relating to when we do “socialize” this to the public, which we may not have the answers to today.	62	6
201504	179	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	One is, will a median versus a mean have a differential effect on existing contracts, of which there are many trillions?	62	6
201504	180	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Two is, I’d be interested to hear how market participants react to this mean–median thing.	62	6
201504	181	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I think that the potential cost that’s laid out in the memo is that of successfully communicating it to the public.	62	6
201504	182	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t really see that as an insurmountable concern.	62	6
201504	183	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I mean, very few people even know what the effective federal funds rate is in the first place, and the kind of people who know that are probably able to tell the difference between a volume-weighted mean and a median if they want to and need to.	62	6
201504	184	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I don’t see that as a big thing, but I would certainly be sensitive to the views of market participants on that.	62	6
201504	185	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	In terms of the contracts that are written on the effective federal funds rate, if we were to pursue this, there would be a long lead time during which the market participants would know that the change is coming.	62	6
201504	186	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We would have to weigh the effect that that would have, and it would have some effect because the median is not always equal to the mean, but many of these contracts average over a long period of time.	62	6
201504	187	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	So occasions on particular days when we do see differences are probably not going to have a large effect on those contracts.	62	6
201504	188	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	What they will be perhaps more interested in is the level of rates that you’ll be setting in the future.	62	6
201504	189	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	If you think about a contract in 2016, that’s going to be very heavily influenced by where they think you’ll be setting the target rate.	62	6
201504	190	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The kinds of issues to do with the gap between the mean and the median are very second-order, compared with that.	62	6
201504	191	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	They also have to think of things like, “Where would the effective federal funds rate be trading in the range?,” and so on.	62	6
201504	192	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I don’t believe this change is anything of first-order importance for a contract, and it’s pretty typical for the uncertainty that market participants face overall in terms of trading in the federal funds market, which we know some large participants have left and some other participants could leave in the future, affecting where the federal funds rate trades in the range.	62	6
201504	193	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	On the market participants’ knowledge of this, I agree that many people probably don’t know that much about the detailed calculation of the effective federal funds rate.	62	6
201504	194	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Those who do would find it pretty understandable, I believe, that we switch from a volume-weighted mean to a volume-weighted median, partly because one of the things that we do know is that the mean is quite heavily influenced by a small transaction at a rate that is far away from where most of the volume is.	62	6
201504	195	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	That’s helpful.	62	6
201504	196	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any other comments?	62	6
201504	197	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	62	6
201504	198	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201504	199	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	In the LIBOR case, the issue about really small changes in LIBOR from what was perceived to be a correct LIBOR pricing was considered a big issue.	62	6
201504	200	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Here you’ve got a picture of a 20 or 40 basis point difference.	62	6
201504	201	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It gives me a little bit of pause that the people who are contracting on this might be upset by this change.	62	6
201504	202	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	In the crisis period, particularly as the balance sheet got larger, we didn’t have that much control over the federal funds rate, and that was an event that really was exogenous to the calculation method.	62	6
201504	203	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Whichever calculation method we would have used, there would have been more variance at that time.	62	6
201504	204	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	If, arbitrarily, the Federal Reserve had turned up on one day and said, “We are going to change that calculation method,” without any kind of forewarning, that would make payments flow differentially to what people expected.	62	6
201504	205	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The plan here is, if there is support for moving forward with this, it will be clearly communicated well in advance, and it will be the type of consideration that all market participants should have to take into account when pricing contracts.	62	6
201504	206	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	62	6
201504	207	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any other comments?	62	6
201504	208	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	62	6
201504	209	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Well, I have a question now.	62	6
201504	210	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	This refers to the expectations about the size of the ON RRP facility post-liftoff.	62	6
201504	211	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	This is anecdotal, but it sounds like there’s a systematic difference between buy-side participants, who tend to be predicting a larger facility, and primary dealers, who are predicting something more in line with what the Committee has been thinking of saying.	62	6
201504	212	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Is that accurate?	62	6
201504	213	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	We do see some distinction between the two.	62	6
201504	214	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	The median for the dealers is $190 billion at liftoff for demand.	62	6
201504	215	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For the buy side, it is $350 billion.	62	6
201504	216	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	There is some variation, but there is variation within the dealer estimates as well.	62	6
201504	217	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	But I think you are correct that the buy side is skewed a bit higher.	62	6
201504	218	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	There is variation within the same firm.	62	6
201504	219	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Are we inclined to attribute more or less weight to the buy side?	62	6
201504	220	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	I don’t think there’s anything in the commentary that would suggest the buy side has some better analytics of understanding that from what we’re reading in the commentary.	62	6
201504	221	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	As Simon said, even within firms, we’re hearing the numbers to be quite different.	62	6
201504	222	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	In the survey, we did find that some firms had produced written reports that had different expectations than those who filled out the survey, so I don’t think there’s any additional knowledge or analytics that the buy side is drawing upon.	62	6
201504	223	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201504	224	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions or comments?	62	6
201504	225	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201504	226	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201504	227	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to swap arrangements.	62	6
201504	228	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have a proposal to renew both the NAFA swap arrangement with Canada and Mexico and a proposal to renew the liquidity swap arrangements.	62	6
201504	229	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me first ask whether there are any questions or comments on these proposals.	62	6
201504	230	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	62	6
201504	231	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	62	6
201504	232	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’d like to respectfully dissent again on the foreign swap arrangements.	62	6
201504	233	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The Richmond Reserve Bank has dissented on these swap lines going back 20 years on the grounds that they facilitate inappropriate actions by the Federal Reserve.	62	6
201504	234	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	One is sterilized foreign exchange operations, which are inappropriate for reasons I spoke about in January.	62	6
201504	235	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The other is channeling intergovernmental assistance to our NAFA partners, among others, who may be well deserving of such assistance, but that constitutes fiscal policy that’s best left to fiscal authorities, in our view.	62	6
201504	236	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	62	6
201504	237	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any other comments or questions?	62	6
201504	238	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	62	6
201504	239	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	62	6
201504	240	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Hearing none, seeing none, we need two separate votes.	62	6
201504	241	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’d like to first ask—and this is an FOMC vote—on the renewal of the NAFA swap arrangements with Canada and Mexico.	63	6
201504	242	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63	6
201504	243	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201504	244	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201504	245	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Opposed.	63	6
201504	246	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker is opposed.	63	6
201504	247	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201504	248	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think that passes, and, second, I’d like to ask for a vote on the liquidity swap arrangements.	63	6
201504	249	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	All in favor?	63	6
201504	250	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Chorus of ayes]	63	6
201504	251	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201504	252	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Opposed.	63	6
201504	253	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	63	6
201504	254	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201504	255	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We need one more vote to ratify domestic open market operations.	63	6
201504	256	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Is there a motion?	63	6
201504	257	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So moved.	63	6
201504	258	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any opposed?	63	6
201504	259	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	63	6
201504	260	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	63	6
201504	261	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will consider those approved as well.	63	6
201504	262	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Next, I think we’re going to move to our second topic, which is normalization procedures, and I’m going to call on Ellen Meade to provide a briefing.	96	9
201504	263	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	264	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	I will be referring to the handout labeled “Materials for Briefing on Governance Issues Associated with Liftoff.”	96	9
201504	265	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	When you commence the normalization process, the Committee will set the stance of policy by announcing the new target range for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201504	266	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	In addition, as you’ve discussed previously, the Committee and Board will set the administered rates—the IOER rate will be set to the top of the new target range and the ON RRP rate will be set to the bottom of the new target range.	96	9
201504	267	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The Federal Reserve will also announce the details associated with the capacity of the ON RRP facility and the discount rate, which will be set at a spread above the top of the federal funds rate target range.	96	9
201504	268	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Earlier this month, you received a memo outlining possible arrangements for enhanced reporting of market developments and the governance of decisions on operational adjustments to the administered rates around the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	269	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	In the early days after the liftoff announcement, it may be somewhat difficult to get a clear picture of how normalization is proceeding because it may take several days for some participants in money markets to adapt to the new market environment.	96	9
201504	270	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	For example, money market participants may need to revise investment guidelines, counterparty limits, or other restrictions on their allocation of funds so that they are able to engage in the arbitrage opportunities available after liftoff.	96	9
201504	271	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Even if the federal funds rate initially lies below the Committee’s new target range, you may judge that the prudent course is to monitor developments while giving money markets some time to adjust.	96	9
201504	272	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	During these early days, you may find it useful to prearrange briefings during which the staff could provide updates on market developments and assess the effectiveness of policy implementation, and you could ask questions.	96	9
201504	273	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	For example, you could schedule daily briefings for perhaps the first two weeks following the liftoff announcement; such briefings could be held via audio or videoconference.	96	9
201504	274	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	These briefings would not be FOMC meetings, so no transcripts or minutes would be prepared.	96	9
201504	275	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Should you wish to express your views about market developments or discuss whether to adjust the target range or the administered rates, the briefings could be readily converted into joint meetings of the Committee and Board.	96	9
201504	276	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	If the liftoff process does not proceed as planned and the funds rate is persistently outside its new target range, then you would presumably wish to discuss the timing and course of possible policy actions, and the scheduled briefings would be replaced by joint videoconference meetings.	96	9
201504	277	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	As discussed in the memo we sent you, the FOMC and Board may also wish to establish decisionmaking procedures that would govern small operational adjustments to the administered rates after the first two weeks or so following the liftoff announcement.	96	9
201504	278	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Adjustments to these administered rates could be helpful if the effective federal funds rate were persistently outside its new target range.	96	9
201504	279	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The memo did not discuss the advantages or disadvantages associated with adjusting the IOER and ON RRP rates, either separately or together, relative to the new target range for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201504	280	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The memo focused on the governance of any such adjustments, and we provided two approaches for you to consider.	96	9
201504	281	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Under the first approach, each adjustment would be approved by a vote of the Committee or Board.	96	9
201504	282	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The Chair could convene a joint FOMC and Board meeting via videoconference at which you could discuss potential changes to the administered rates; all policymakers would be involved in the discussion of changes to the IOER and ON RRP rates.	96	9
201504	283	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Following that discussion, the FOMC would vote on any change to the ON RRP rate, while the Board would approve any change to the IOER rate.	96	9
201504	284	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	A variation on this approach would involve policymakers using SDS to submit comments on proposed adjustments to one or both of the administered rates, with approvals for changes to the ON RRP rate and/or IOER rate recorded via notation votes by the FOMC and Board, respectively.	96	9
201504	285	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	While this would be operationally less burdensome than holding a meeting, and would not require the preparation of transcripts and minutes, it would not allow for an interactive discussion and, as a result, might be most appropriate for relatively straightforward adjustments that the Committee had previously discussed.	96	9
201504	286	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Under the second approach, you would delegate to the Chair authority to adjust the ON RRP and IOER rates, subject to limitations established by the FOMC and Board.	96	9
201504	287	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	If the first couple of weeks of the normalization process had proceeded smoothly and you felt comfortable with the delegation approach, one of the staff briefings could be converted to a meeting at which you would formally take the decision to delegate authority.	96	9
201504	288	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	You might prefer this approach to ensure that the Federal Reserve is able to respond quickly should market conditions warrant.	96	9
201504	289	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	This delegation would allow the Chair to make small adjustments to the administered rates if deemed necessary to keep the federal funds rate trading in its new target range.	96	9
201504	290	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	As an example, the memo suggested that the Chair could be authorized to make adjustments of perhaps 5 or 10 basis points in the administered rates and also indicated that policymakers could determine in advance whether they preferred to address such a situation by adjusting the IOER rate, the ON RRP rate, or both rates in parallel in order to maintain a constant spread between them.	96	9
201504	291	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	There may be some communications advantages associated with the delegation scenario in that it would clearly separate your decisions on the stance of policy—the target range for the federal funds rate established by the FOMC—from small technical adjustments to the administered rates necessary to achieve that policy stance.	96	9
201504	292	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The final page of your handout lists the questions that were distributed with the memo for today’s go-round on governance issues.	96	9
201504	293	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Another memo that was distributed at the same time concerned the setting of the primary credit rate.	96	9
201504	294	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The lending rate for primary credit was originally set in 2003 at 100 basis points above the Committee’s target for the federal funds rate.	96	9
201504	295	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The spread was reduced twice during the financial crisis, and has stood 50 basis points above the top of the federal funds rate target range since February 2010.	96	9
201504	296	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The memo discussed two options for the setting of the primary credit rate spread:  maintaining that spread at 50 basis points above the top of the Committee’s new funds rate target range at the time of liftoff and for some period thereafter, or raising the spread to 100 basis points at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	297	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	During the go-round, you may also wish to share any views you might have on that issue.	96	9
201504	298	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Thank you; this concludes my prepared remarks.	96	9
201504	299	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	300	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Before we turn to questions for Ellen and our go-round, I would like to just make a few remarks of my own.	96	9
201504	301	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	At the outset, I want to emphasize that although our policy tools, by law, have different governance structures, the overall conduct of monetary policy is obviously the purview of the FOMC.	96	9
201504	302	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The governance issues before us this morning really don’t concern the determination of our intended stance of monetary policy.	96	9
201504	303	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Rather, this discussion pertains to the narrow issue of how to make tactical adjustments to our policy tools to deliver the intended stance of policy.	96	9
201504	304	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have spent a great deal of time and effort in devising our framework for normalization, and I am highly confident that it will work.	96	9
201504	305	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But it is clear that when the time comes to raise the federal funds rate, we will face unprecedented uncertainties, and we need to stand ready to make adjustments, if needed.	96	9
201504	306	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It is important that we agree on an approach for managing both the initial phase of liftoff and the process for subsequent adjustments that may conceivably be needed once that initial phase is complete.	96	9
201504	307	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The staff memo proposed that, for the first two weeks or so after liftoff, we set aside time on our calendars to receive frequent market updates and, if necessary, hold meetings to make adjustments to our tools through the Committee and Board votes.	96	9
201504	308	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	During this time, the FOMC may need to reconsider the setting of our tools, including the administered rates, parameters of the overnight RRP facility, and the use of term tools.	96	9
201504	309	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I just want to make clear that, in my own view, decisions during this initial period should not be delegated to me.	96	9
201504	310	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The FOMC and Board should vote on adjustments that are deemed necessary after debating the relevant policy considerations and alternative approaches.	96	9
201504	311	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	For example, if the funds rate is trading soft relative to the target range, the Committee should decide whether to raise both rates, keeping the IOER‒ON RRP spread constant, or to instead adjust only one of the rates.	96	9
201504	312	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	These decisions are not entirely tactical or routine.	96	9
201504	313	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	My expectation, however, is that after some initial period, which the memo is guessing might be two weeks, we will have a reasonably good sense regarding how our approach is working, and only minor adjustments, if any, might be subsequently needed to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.	96	9
201504	314	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Assuming that our approach works roughly as expected, such intensive monitoring on the part of the Committee shouldn’t be necessary beyond this initial phase.	96	9
201504	315	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We ought to be able to settle into an arrangement in which, at most, modest adjustment to our tools, especially to the administered rates, will be called for to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.	96	9
201504	316	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I hope that such adjustments, if they prove necessary at all, can be made in a simple and efficient manner.	96	9
201504	317	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	From a practical perspective, I tend to favor an approach in which authority is delegated to me as Chair to make modest adjustments, perhaps up to 5 or 10 basis points, to the IOER and overnight RRP rates to help maintain the federal funds rate in the Committee’s target range.	96	9
201504	318	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	These adjustments would be in accordance with a strategy pertaining, for example, to the spread that had been decided by the Committee.	96	9
201504	319	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	In such circumstances, I would, of course, keep the Committee fully apprised of ongoing developments.	96	9
201504	320	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	If any problems in implementing policy emerged, clearly we would need to convene a meeting.	96	9
201504	321	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would expect the Committee to decide on any such delegation only at a time when we feel we have a good sense for how our approach is working and not at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	322	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Of course, if many of you are not comfortable with such an arrangement, we will have to, as Ellen indicated, work out a method for holding Committee and Board votes, likely by notation voting, and possibly on short notice, to make these potential modest adjustments once the first couple of weeks after liftoff have passed.	96	9
201504	323	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Regardless of the approach we agree on, it will be important that it serves to reinforce rather than undermine market confidence and our normalization approach.	96	9
201504	324	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me stop there.	96	9
201504	325	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I very much look forward to hearing your views.	96	9
201504	326	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We have now scheduled a full go-round, so—Vice Chairman Dudley.	96	9
201504	327	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I am going to make a forecast that we are all going to agree that, at least for the first few weeks, we are going to want to have some sort of a discussion if the funds rate is trading outside the target range.	96	9
201504	328	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If we are going to do that, I have a couple of questions of the staff.	96	9
201504	329	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	At what time of day would it be most appropriate to have those meetings?	96	9
201504	330	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	How would it work in terms of having the meeting, making the decision, notifying the markets— what would the timeline look like as you are carrying that forward?	96	9
201504	331	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Because the memo didn’t really get into the mechanics of how you would actually implement this.	96	9
201504	332	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I was just curious if there is any thought given to that at this point.	96	9
201504	333	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	I think that we were trying to be optimistic when writing the memo.	96	9
201504	334	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	So we were thinking about the first couple of weeks or so as being briefings and not being about decisionmaking.	96	9
201504	335	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Let’s say they were about decisionmaking.	96	9
201504	336	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	When will you know enough in the day to have a meeting, to have decided?	96	9
201504	337	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	When would you have to announce it to the market?	96	9
201504	338	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We are still looking at when some of the volume is transacted and also scheduling, because not everyone is in the same time zone.	96	9
201504	339	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I think we believe that later in the afternoon will work.	96	9
201504	340	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	And that will give us enough time to then announce to the market that evening what the changes would be.	96	9
201504	341	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Okay.	96	9
201504	342	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The other choice is to announce very early in the morning.	96	9
201504	343	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I guess I would say that, if we agree on this, we should nail that down pretty soon, because, in principle, this could happen as early as June, and it would be helpful if people actually had the time blocked out on their calendar.	96	9
201504	344	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we need to figure out the time slot.	96	9
201504	345	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We are working on it.	96	9
201504	346	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other questions before we begin the round?	96	9
201504	347	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	96	9
201504	348	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	349	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Just to clarify your proposed approach, any adjustment in the first two weeks of the overnight reverse repo rate would be an FOMC meeting.	96	9
201504	350	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201504	351	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I know the memo used two weeks.	96	9
201504	352	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I am thinking there is an initial period.	96	9
201504	353	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Until things settle down, basically.	96	9
201504	354	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201504	355	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	When we are figuring things out, and if we have to make adjustments, we need to meet, we need to discuss it, and during that phase, until we decide further things are—let me just call them “routine”—there would be FOMC votes.	96	9
201504	356	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We would probably be having videoconference briefings that would be converted to meetings, and both groups would be voting.	96	9
201504	357	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Only after whatever that initial period is when things have settled down would we agree that now we have fallen into a rhythm, and any adjustments, if they are needed at all—I mean, I think in the most likely case, we are not going to need any further adjustments—but if we do, those things will be routine, and then we are talking about delegating.	96	9
201504	358	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s see.	96	9
201504	359	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, President Lacker, then President Rosengren.	96	9
201504	360	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	In this initial period, would you envision all meetings, or a mix of briefings and meetings?	96	9
201504	361	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	My understanding is the idea is that we are going to preschedule these times.	96	9
201504	362	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	When we start the video meeting, we will have some sense of whether things are going smoothly, and we really don’t have decisions to make, in which case the staff could be relieved of the burden of doing transcripts and so forth.	96	9
201504	363	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I would call that a briefing.	96	9
201504	364	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But clearly, if things are not going very smoothly and we need to deliberate, we would convene that as a meeting right from the outset.	96	9
201504	365	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, I suppose, even in the middle, if something began as a briefing, and we decided in the middle of that briefing, “Look, we need to discuss something.”	96	9
201504	366	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Is that fair to say?	96	9
201504	367	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Yes.	96	9
201504	368	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We could then say, “Look, let’s convert this now to a joint Board and FOMC meeting.”	96	9
201504	369	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	96	9
201504	370	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I ask because it has been a while since this group gathered in a briefing format.	96	9
201504	371	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think we did it back during the crisis.	96	9
201504	372	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	There are some rules about not saying something that matters, or has substance, or—	96	9
201504	373	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we can’t deliberate.	96	9
201504	374	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	That’s not quite—	96	9
201504	375	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We can’t deliberate.	96	9
201504	376	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	It is really a distinction, I believe, between asking questions and discussing among yourselves.	96	9
201504	377	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If we have something to say, like “I think this means we should do X,” then we have to convert it to a meeting to say that?	96	9
201504	378	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Well, you could pose it as a question.	96	9
201504	379	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Like in Jeopardy!  You have to ask a question.	96	9
201504	380	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	[Laughter]	96	9
201504	381	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I see Scott Alvarez is fretting back there.	96	9
201504	382	2015-04-29	meeting	ALVAREZ	A briefing is an interaction with the staff, and you can ask questions, and it is for the purpose of disseminating information.	96	9
201504	383	2015-04-29	meeting	ALVAREZ	If the Committee wanted to have a discussion in which they are deliberating about a decision, that would be a meeting itself.	96	9
201504	384	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Okay.	96	9
201504	385	2015-04-29	meeting	ALVAREZ	We could set it up so that it could start as a briefing and be converted into a meeting, if that seemed to be the direction the Committee wanted to go in.	96	9
201504	386	2015-04-29	meeting	ALVAREZ	We can, as the Chair says—I think the thought process is that we will have a pretty good idea before we set it up whether there is going to be a discussion, and we will just start from scratch as a meeting if that’s the case.	96	9
201504	387	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201504	388	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Just a follow-up to Vice Chairman Dudley’s question.	96	9
201504	389	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	For how many of the short-term credit markets is it important to know about the closing in Europe?	96	9
201504	390	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As we think about the timing of the meetings, are there a bunch of short-term instruments that would make it relevant to act in the morning, because of when Europe closes?	96	9
201504	391	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For the repo markets, most of that is going to be US activity, and that is going to be early in the morning.	96	9
201504	392	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	For unsecured federal funds and Eurodollars, there is going to be some very active trading in the early morning hours from Europe.	96	9
201504	393	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	We saw this during the crisis when there was a lot of volume done early, and then there is some late-day volume as well in the United States.	96	9
201504	394	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	It is going to be a mix.	96	9
201504	395	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	We are going to do more analysis on the full pattern of volume data in the unsecured markets before we recommend a time of 3:30 or 4:00 or 4:30 in the late afternoon.	96	9
201504	396	2015-04-29	meeting	LOGAN	But you can think of the unsecured markets as having two trading periods, and the repo as being mostly very early in the morning.	96	9
201504	397	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	398	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201504	399	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I was looking for a clarification.	96	9
201504	400	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the context, the memo offers that both the IOER or ON RRP rates might be subject to these technical adjustments if we delegate them.	96	9
201504	401	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	When I go back and look at the normalization principles, as they are described, they talk about IOER as being the primary mechanism by which we will move the funds rate into the target range.	96	9
201504	402	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Let’s say we delegate on a technical adjustment basis the ON RRP rate.	96	9
201504	403	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	That seems to take care of itself.	96	9
201504	404	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	But by delegating some adjustment to the IOER rate, does that signal a change in policy stance in any way?	96	9
201504	405	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Or will it be understood that you are trying to move the spread in lockstep?	96	9
201504	406	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I have gotten this question quite a few times in public.	96	9
201504	407	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I use an idea that Jamie came up with, which is that everything we are doing in terms of the mechanics of lifting rates comes from interest on excess reserves.	96	9
201504	408	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We are trying to keep the overnight RRP as small as possible, and that means it is just trying to get better trading in the arbitrage relationship in which you are getting interest on excess reserves.	96	9
201504	409	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I view it as the primary way we are lifting rates.	96	9
201504	410	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	But it is not really a measure of the stance of policy.	96	9
201504	411	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	The stance of policy is the federal funds target range.	96	9
201504	412	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Okay.	96	9
201504	413	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the context of these basis points we have talked about, it would be understood these are technical moves, and that—	96	9
201504	414	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The Committee has set the target range and decided to make small adjustments to keep the funds rate there.	96	9
201504	415	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	All right.	96	9
201504	416	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201504	417	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201504	418	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Yes.	96	9
201504	419	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is just a logistical question, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	420	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Do I understand correctly that what you anticipate doing is, if we agree with the concept of having these prearranged briefings, that all of our calendars will need to be kept open for two weeks following each of the next I-don’t-know-how-many FOMC meetings?	96	9
201504	421	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	I think we were thinking initially about the liftoff meeting.	96	9
201504	422	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	Oh, well, yes, of course.	96	9
201504	423	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Unless you know something I don’t know.	96	9
201504	424	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You’d have to prepare for the earliest meeting you might liftoff for, right?	96	9
201504	425	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose—I mean, people will have some conflicts, right?	96	9
201504	426	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	They have major ones.	96	9
201504	427	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We can’t for the next whatever meetings—I mean, we can try to block out those times.	96	9
201504	428	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But some people will have trips presumably that they can’t—I suppose if somebody can’t participate—	96	9
201504	429	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	There are already a number of international meetings that several of us on the Board, I think, are going to have—and Vice Chairman Dudley will have conflicts with as well.	96	9
201504	430	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s my point.	96	9
201504	431	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’d prefer to get this nailed down sooner rather than later, so we can block out the time as efficiently as possible.	96	9
201504	432	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be my preference.	96	9
201504	433	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe we can call in—I mean, we normally have videoconferences, but conceivably we can call.	96	9
201504	434	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In the old days, we had telephone calls, right?	96	9
201504	435	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes.	96	9
201504	436	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe we could have some telephone calls that people could take from—	96	9
201504	437	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	As long as they were secure.	96	9
201504	438	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	That would be the issue.	96	9
201504	439	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201504	440	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, we need to work this out for sure.	96	9
201504	441	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201504	442	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	This is just from a communications point of view.	96	9
201504	443	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Would we communicate at the outset that the FOMC is going into the mode of daily briefings with the possibility that they could take intermeeting action?	96	9
201504	444	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Or would we simply be silent on that until such time as we found it necessary to take an action?	96	9
201504	445	2015-04-29	meeting	MEADE	The minutes of this discussion will reflect that you have discussed some of these issues.	96	9
201504	446	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I take your question as, “Let’s be very careful,” and I agree we should be very, very careful.	96	9
201504	447	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Maybe we want to think hard about how this is described, because we don’t want everyone thinking every day the FOMC is meeting at 4:00 pm, and we are waiting for this thing to come over the wires about what the rates are going to be the next day.	96	9
201504	448	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	That is probably not—	96	9
201504	449	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This is contingency planning.	96	9
201504	450	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Yes.	96	9
201504	451	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	This is a contingency plan.	96	9
201504	452	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	This is contingency planning for something that doesn’t work as well as we think it is going to work.	96	9
201504	453	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we want to present it in that manner.	96	9
201504	454	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201504	455	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201504	456	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	My question is in terms of contingencies—do you anticipate that we could do this by notation vote?	96	9
201504	457	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Possibly, if there was a conflict and you were traveling, you missed the videoconference and maybe a staff member was sitting in—they could give you a quick executive summary and then the notation vote could be done by a BlackBerry anywhere, right?	96	9
201504	458	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Again, we would have to look at the timing exactly and tell you what that window is, because the meeting could go quite long.	96	9
201504	459	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Then we would still have to put out the announcement or switch to 7:00 am in the morning or something.	96	9
201504	460	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	You anticipate making an adjustment in the middle of the day—I mean, for the market.	96	9
201504	461	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	No, no.	96	9
201504	462	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	After the meeting, it is probably pretty good practice to announce the decision.	96	9
201504	463	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	I would feel more comfortable announcing quite soon after the conclusion of the meeting, rather than waiting, but—	96	9
201504	464	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That does put a premium on the turnaround.	96	9
201504	465	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	—you could have some time gap there and instead do it early in the morning.	96	9
201504	466	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	To Governor Brainard’s question, there are a lot of complications—if this is the way you want to go—that we would need to describe to you, so you understood exactly which way you wanted to go.	96	9
201504	467	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably, Simon, you would want to announce this the day before, because the money market trading starts very early they need to have this information, so they can digest it.	96	9
201504	468	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	We are actively checking so you have the full information to make that choice.	96	9
201504	469	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	96	9
201504	470	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let’s begin the go-round.	96	9
201504	471	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201504	472	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	473	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the first question, my answer is “Yes.”	96	9
201504	474	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s as simple as that.	96	9
201504	475	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On the second question, regarding approaches, I actually think you laid out the approach we should take really well in your comments just a moment ago.	96	9
201504	476	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We hope we won’t need to do any of this, but having a serious meeting to discuss what is causing the funds rate to trade outside the target range, understanding what the effects of moving the two different administered rates would be, and having FOMC/Board of Governors decisions seems like the right approach.	96	9
201504	477	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But once things have—I think “settled down” is the phrase you used—I think it would be completely appropriate to delegate to you any further tweaks, plus or minus 10 basis points, say, to the two administered rates.	96	9
201504	478	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I fully support the approach that you laid out today.	96	9
201504	479	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do view this as representing prudent contingency planning more than something that I would expect to happen.	96	9
201504	480	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I am still pretty confident that we won’t have problems keeping the federal funds rate within the range, but I think it is good planning.	96	9
201504	481	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I do think that one of the issues that came up in the questions asked in the past minute or two is really important, and that is about the communications in connection with this.	96	9
201504	482	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One of the Committee’s long-standing principles is that, to the extent possible, policy decisions regarding monetary policy really should be separated from technical issues associated with the implementation of policy.	96	9
201504	483	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m thinking back to the good old days when the Desk had wide latitude to adjust the amount of reserves in the System in order to achieve the target federal funds rate.	96	9
201504	484	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think it would be very useful, if we can—and this is going to be the challenge—frame the communications regarding these adjustments to the administered rates so that we indicate that these are just mostly technical decisions reflecting, of course, the decisions of the FOMC and the Board of Governors on the policy decisions, but really communicated as technical means to achieve the policy goals that we have agreed on.	96	9
201504	485	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We really want to avoid this perception that moving around these administered rates reflects some kind of shift in the stance of policy or creating some noise in connection with that.	96	9
201504	486	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we are doing prudent planning.	96	9
201504	487	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is April now.	96	9
201504	488	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thinking through these issues now makes a lot of sense.	96	9
201504	489	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, I support the approach that you laid out.	96	9
201504	490	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	96	9
201504	491	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	492	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	96	9
201504	493	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	494	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am in favor of delegating to the Chair certain tactical decisions that ensure that we attain the policy goals voted on by the FOMC.	96	9
201504	495	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is consistent with the FOMC setting strategy but delegating tactical implementation of monetary policy.	96	9
201504	496	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, determining the scope and timing of that delegation should wait until we have a better understanding of how the constellation of short-term interest rates will respond to our setting of IOER and overnight RRP rates at, and immediately following, liftoff.	96	9
201504	497	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am still somewhat uncertain about how successfully we will be able to target the federal funds rate and other short-term rates at liftoff.	96	9
201504	498	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, I could imagine a wide variety of adjustments that may be necessary following liftoff.	96	9
201504	499	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the federal funds rate and other short-term rates may be comfortably bounded by the IOER and overnight RRP rates, I can easily imagine situations in which that is not the case.	96	9
201504	500	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I can also imagine circumstances in which some market rates do not adjust as expected to changes in our policy rates.	96	9
201504	501	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, it is difficult to predict how variable policy or market rates will be at liftoff.	96	9
201504	502	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	My preferred approach, in light of my concerns, would be to have frequent briefings, initially following liftoff, along with the flexibility to turn those into joint FOMC‒Board meetings, if necessary.	96	9
201504	503	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once the relationship of the funds rate and other market rates to our tools, as well as the variability of those rates, is better understood, we could agree on the appropriate delegation of tactical decisions to the Chair.	96	9
201504	504	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Predetermining our arrangements for delegation at this time serves little purpose, if they are quite likely to change after liftoff.	96	9
201504	505	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I recommend being humble about how much we know now about liftoff and plan appropriately to have significant consultation and adjustments as we develop a more practical understanding of the challenges of lifting interest rates from the zero lower bound.	96	9
201504	506	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, it is probably premature to determine the normal relationship we expect for the primary credit rate.	96	9
201504	507	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The current spread of 50 basis points above the IOER rate seems an appropriate spread at liftoff.	96	9
201504	508	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We can decide to alter the spread once it is clear where the federal funds rate and other short-term rates are likely to trade relative to our policy tools.	96	9
201504	509	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, I suggest a highly flexible policy that is highly consultative.	96	9
201504	510	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Once relationships are better understood after liftoff, we can discuss delegation of tactical decisions for achieving our goals.	96	9
201504	511	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	512	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	513	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	96	9
201504	514	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	515	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I am comfortable with a governance approach that involves prescheduled staff briefings for a period of time after liftoff and then, after the initial period when things appear to have settled down, delegating authority to the Chair to make small technical adjustments to the ON RRP and IOER rates between FOMC meetings.	96	9
201504	516	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	These technical adjustments would be for the purpose of keeping the funds rate from moving persistently outside the FOMC’s target range.	96	9
201504	517	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	If the Committee agrees on the delegation governance structure, then this delegation of authority should be communicated at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	518	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	It is important that the Committee be aware of the developments in financial markets and the effectiveness of policy implementation after the liftoff announcement, and the briefings would be very useful in that regard.	96	9
201504	519	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Whether two weeks is the appropriate time for the initial period isn’t clear to me at this point.	96	9
201504	520	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	If we opt to prearrange daily briefings for two weeks, we might also prearrange a weekly briefing for the remainder of the intermeeting period.	96	9
201504	521	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, the briefings could be converted to meetings, if necessary.	96	9
201504	522	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I do believe it is important that we demonstrate after liftoff that we have the tools to bring the federal funds rate into our target range.	96	9
201504	523	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	That may necessitate making modest changes in the ON RRP rate or IOER rate in a nimble way.	96	9
201504	524	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Delegating the decisions for these technical changes to the Chair seems appropriate.	96	9
201504	525	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I believe we should treat the IOER rate and the ON RRP rate symmetrically with respect to delegation.	96	9
201504	526	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	That is, if we delegate to the Chair, we should delegate the authority to make technical changes in both rates.	96	9
201504	527	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Changes that are strategic policy decisions should remain under the purview of the full Committee.	96	9
201504	528	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	These would include decisions to deploy the auxiliary policy tools, like term deposits and term RRPs, as well as making larger changes in the IOER and RRP rates and, of course, changes in the federal funds rate target.	96	9
201504	529	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Particularly if liftoff doesn’t go as planned and the funds rate is trading persistently outside its target range, the full Committee needs to be responsible for making those hard choices and helping to communicate them to the public.	96	9
201504	530	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Chair shouldn’t have to go it alone.	96	9
201504	531	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Committee hasn’t had a full discussion of what constitutes successful liftoff.	96	9
201504	532	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	This will help inform whether a technical adjustment is needed.	96	9
201504	533	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Let me offer the view that liftoff will be successful if the federal funds rate is within the target range on most, but not necessarily all, days.	96	9
201504	534	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In my view, successful liftoff does not require that the funds rate be at the midpoint of the range.	96	9
201504	535	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	We plan to operate with a target range of 25 basis points because we don’t expect to have precise control over the funds rate.	96	9
201504	536	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Under those conditions, I don’t think we should require the funds rate to be close to the midpoint of the range.	96	9
201504	537	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Communication of any technical adjustments is an issue.	96	9
201504	538	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	We have indicated to the public that at liftoff we will continue to target a range for the funds rate that is 25 basis points wide and set the IOER and ON RRP rates at the upper and lower bounds of the funds rate target range, respectively.	96	9
201504	539	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	If we find that adjustments are necessary to keep the funds rate in the target range, we must depart from these plans in one way or another.	96	9
201504	540	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Presumably, this can better be handled if, at the time of liftoff, we acknowledge to the public that technical adjustments to the two rates might be necessary and that, as we proceed with liftoff and normalization, the Board of Governors and FOMC have delegated authority to the Chair to make those adjustments, and also that any technical adjustments would not constitute a change in policy.	96	9
201504	541	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	542	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	543	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	96	9
201504	544	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	545	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I am comfortable prescheduling the staff briefings during the first few weeks following liftoff.	96	9
201504	546	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They can be canceled if they are not needed—all is working smoothly, for example, and the federal funds rate is trading within its target range—or they could be converted to joint FOMC‒Board meetings if adjustments to the overnight RRP and IOER rates are needed to keep the federal funds rate in its target range.	96	9
201504	547	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Obviously, we have to retain some flexibility about how long this period lasts, depending on what our experience is.	96	9
201504	548	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning to the governance approach beyond this initial period, I very much favor distinguishing between changes that are tactical, such as small shifts in the overnight RRP rate and the IOER rate to achieve the federal funds rate target selected by the Committee and changes in policy, which are shifts in the target federal funds rate—this goes to President George’s question.	96	9
201504	549	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think there is a long history that tactical changes needed to implement the monetary policy stance that has been selected by the Committee can and should be delegated either to the Chair or to the Desk.	96	9
201504	550	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you consider how policy was implemented prior to the crisis, the Desk, in close consultation with Board staff, decided how much in reserves to add or drain each day in order to keep the federal funds rate close to its target.	96	9
201504	551	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	For many years, presumably as a governance measure, there was also one FOMC member on the call, essentially to keep an eye on the proceedings.	96	9
201504	552	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The decision on the amount of intervention and the means of intervention was left during normal times to the staff, the New York Desk, and the Division of Monetary Affairs at the Board.	96	9
201504	553	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In unusual circumstances—for example, August 2007—the staff consulted closely with the Chair in making those reserve adjustment decisions.	96	9
201504	554	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The issue in my mind is whether changes in the overnight RRP and the IOER rates that are small and designed to keep the federal funds rate in its target range meet this tactical criteria, and I think they do.	96	9
201504	555	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The changes contemplated would be to implement the monetary policy stance that had already been mandated by the Committee.	96	9
201504	556	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So this argues for delegation.	96	9
201504	557	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	One could even argue for delegation to the Desk and the Division of Monetary Affairs staff, but I don’t see any reason to go this far.	96	9
201504	558	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would favor delegating it to the Chair to make clear that it is receiving the attention it deserves by senior policymakers.	96	9
201504	559	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, delegation to the Chair might be more appropriate in this particular case, because such decisions are about the level of interest rates offered on our facilities rather than as in the past, on the amount of reserves we might add or drain.	96	9
201504	560	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	To implement this after the initial period, I would give the Chair the discretion to move the overnight RRP rate up or down by as much as 10 basis points, so a range of 20 basis points, and the IOER rate up or down by as much as 10 basis points as needed to keep the funds rate within its target range.	96	9
201504	561	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The adjustments could either be in tandem to maintain a constant spread, or the spread could be widened or narrowed subject to those criteria.	96	9
201504	562	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast to the delegation of modest IOER and overnight RRP rate changes to the Chair, I think any other changes—such as implementing the time deposit facility and things like that or changing the size of the cap on the overnight RRP facility—should be left to the full Committee.	96	9
201504	563	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the overnight RRP cap, this is pretty consequential because it will affect the composition of money market flows, and also it is unlikely that changes in the overnight RRP cap are going to be needed on a day-by-day basis.	96	9
201504	564	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So having the Committee make these changes is not going to be particularly arduous; they will probably be made on a much more irregular basis, if at all.	96	9
201504	565	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	566	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	567	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	96	9
201504	568	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	569	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes, I’m comfortable scheduling a bunch of briefings that can be converted at short notice to meetings.	96	9
201504	570	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think that adjustment of the IOER or the overnight RRP rates in the first few weeks following liftoff should clearly require an FOMC meeting.	96	9
201504	571	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I would point out that it took us almost a year to figure out how we wanted to set the IOER and the overnight RRP rates relative to the funds rate.	96	9
201504	572	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Committee members brought different considerations to the tradeoffs involved, and the initial settings involve a compromise among different views about those tradeoffs.	96	9
201504	573	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	New information about performance of those settings after liftoff is likely to inform Committee members’ views about those tradeoffs and likely require recalibration of that compromise.	96	9
201504	574	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	For me, it’s hard to imagine a routine adjustment.	96	9
201504	575	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The analogy has been drawn to the Desk’s draining and adding reserves through open market operations.	96	9
201504	576	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’d point out that it has taken decades for those to become as routine as they did.	96	9
201504	577	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	And at times when the FOMC has changed its operational regime, those things have been tricky at first, and the Committee has likely, in many of those instances, been very involved.	96	9
201504	578	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m thinking about the early 1980s and times in the 1970s, when the instructions to the Desk were very different.	96	9
201504	579	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s going to take a while for changes to the IOER or overnight RRP rates to be seen as routine or technical rather than something like: “All right, we’ve set up a new regime, we’re trying to calibrate the settings of these things,” and the Committee needs to be involved.	96	9
201504	580	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	What I’d advocate is that we plan to make all the decisions at meetings until the first meeting at which a decision that is made appears, in hindsight, to have been clearly routine; from then on we can delegate the routine of changing it.	96	9
201504	581	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think routine changes are likely, to my mind.	96	9
201504	582	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If you think about it, what’s at stake here is the spread: the arbitrage margin between the funds market and the IOER rate.	96	9
201504	583	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It seems like 20 basis points, 15 basis points, somewhere in there.	96	9
201504	584	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	That doesn’t seem like something that’s likely to fluctuate the way the need for adding or draining reserves fluctuated on a daily basis.	96	9
201504	585	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If it fluctuates, that’s big news if it goes to 30 or 40 basis points.	96	9
201504	586	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’d be kind of surprised about that, and I think we’d want to get to the bottom of it.	96	9
201504	587	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think we have an understanding of those markets in which it looks like, yes, they should routinely fluctuate by 10 or 20 basis points.	96	9
201504	588	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’d urge us just to plan on making these decisions at meetings.	96	9
201504	589	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’m happy to delegate if it comes to pass that these turn out to be routine decisions that the Committee feels like delegating.	96	9
201504	590	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Let’s go and make one of those decisions at a time like that and then delegate thereafter.	96	9
201504	591	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I also wanted to talk about the discount rate spread.	96	9
201504	592	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The discount rate spread is 50 basis points, and it’s irrelevant to monetary policy right now in the sense that it doesn’t limit spikes in the federal funds rate when reserve supply is unexpectedly shortened.	96	9
201504	593	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s not going to be relevant to monetary policy implementation in that sense until—2020, I think, is the latest staff projection.	96	9
201504	594	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Its relevance now is basically for small banks that come up short on reserves due to poor planning or some unforeseeable contingency that they could claim is outside their control but probably isn’t.	96	9
201504	595	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, large banks have a ton of reserves that insulate them against shocks, and they don’t come to the window.	96	9
201504	596	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Right now, in our current situation of large reserve balances, this is basically about giving the incentive to small banks to manage their accounts sensibly.	96	9
201504	597	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think our old normal spread of 100 basis points would provide a more appropriate incentive, given the amounts of money involved if you actually do the overnight calculation.	96	9
201504	598	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think we should move back to 100 when we lift off.	96	9
201504	599	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I would favor that.	96	9
201504	600	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It was there.	96	9
201504	601	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	We set that in 2002.	96	9
201504	602	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	We did some analysis.	96	9
201504	603	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	There was some thought given to the tradeoff involved.	96	9
201504	604	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think it makes sense.	96	9
201504	605	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It would also signal normalization in a way that would be useful.	96	9
201504	606	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	When you talk about discount window borrowing, the word “stigma” inevitably comes up, and the idea is advanced that, well, keeping the primary credit rate low helps reduce stigma.	96	9
201504	607	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	That is certainly true in the only model we have of stigma and discount window lending, but the survey research we’ve done as part of the a group looking at discount window issues—they did some survey work on stigma, and what they found is that it is not a relevant consideration for small banks.	96	9
201504	608	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Small banks don’t feel stigmatized.	96	9
201504	609	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Maybe they feel stigmatized already, but they don’t feel as if stigma inhibits their borrowing from the window.	96	9
201504	610	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It’s just a big bank or a too- big-to-fail bank kind of issue, and large banks don’t borrow now.	96	9
201504	611	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	In the last crisis, we lowered the primary credit rate when it looked as if there was a rationale for big banks borrowing at the window.	96	9
201504	612	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It turned out they were getting all of the money they needed from Federal Home Loan Banks anyway, so it didn’t seem to be particularly relevant to large banks either.	96	9
201504	613	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I don’t think stigma is a reason to keep the discount rate spread at 50 basis point rather than 100.	96	9
201504	614	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	That’s the import of that.	96	9
201504	615	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	616	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	617	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	96	9
201504	618	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	619	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	My reaction to the questions posed is that they’re really matters of pragmatism.	96	9
201504	620	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I agree that planning for daily briefings with the option of invoking an FOMC meeting is sensible and workable.	96	9
201504	621	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m certainly fine with that.	96	9
201504	622	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I’m also comfortable with the approach that you laid out, with the Committee and Board making the decisions the first two weeks, and then after that, the delegation of small adjustments.	96	9
201504	623	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’m comfortable in both cases.	96	9
201504	624	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	There are some details yet to be worked out, and under certain scenarios, we may have time to work them out.	96	9
201504	625	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We could hear a second version of this possibly down the road.	96	9
201504	626	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I haven’t given a lot of thought to the discount rate question, but I’m glad that President Lacker raised it and talked about it a little bit.	96	9
201504	627	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	With regard to trying to figure out what that spread should be, I want to throw out one thought, and that is a recollection that during the crisis, the Federal Home Loan Banks became a sort of surrogate discount window.	96	9
201504	628	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And the relationship of our setting of the rates to their operations and their settings may be relevant for us to consider.	96	9
201504	629	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Those are my thoughts.	96	9
201504	630	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	631	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	632	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	96	9
201504	633	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	634	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I’m entirely comfortable with the approach described by the staff and yourself to be used for informing the FOMC on the effectiveness of policy implementation during the initial period after liftoff.	96	9
201504	635	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I’m also entirely comfortable with the approach described as that to be used for delegating authority to the Chair on tactical matters once we have declared victory on a successful liftoff.	96	9
201504	636	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	As it concerns the spread between the IOER rate and the discount rate, I think it’s actually probably best to quiesce and minimize the variability at, and immediately after, liftoff.	96	9
201504	637	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	My preference would be to stay with the 50 basis point spread until we have some separation of these events.	96	9
201504	638	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I think the number of moving parts at the time of liftoff could work against us, especially as we try to understand all of the different things that could be happening, and one more change, I think, that isn’t necessary might best be saved for later.	96	9
201504	639	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I will add to the earlier discussion on the median and midpoint—a behavioral issue that I would just like the staff to consider to the extent that we talk about changing the definition of the federal funds rate.	96	9
201504	640	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I don’t know what the behavioral reaction to that would be.	96	9
201504	641	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	It seems like when we whisper, people think we shout.	96	9
201504	642	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I just don’t know whether people would make more of that than is needed, again, at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	643	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I understand we’re not contemplating the definitional change then, but even announcing the plan of a change could have a behavioral effect.	96	9
201504	644	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	645	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	646	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201504	647	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	648	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, with respect to the meetings and briefings, I guess I’m having trouble seeing what the utility of daily briefings for a couple of weeks would be in the circumstance that we think is likely to obtain, which is that there’s a reasonably successful liftoff.	96	9
201504	649	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me more likely that we would want a briefing or a meeting on the Friday following liftoff.	96	9
201504	650	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thereafter, I’m just not sure how much there will be to say unless things are going wrong, in which case, as everybody says, we’re going to actually need meetings and not just briefings.	96	9
201504	651	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I just note that in passing.	96	9
201504	652	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I know this Committee can fill up virtually any meeting that is set with questions and conversation, but I’m just not sure how much there will be to say other than getting emails from Simon and Lorie telling us what has happened on day three.	96	9
201504	653	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	With respect to governance, like everybody, I think, who’s spoken on this point, I favor giving discretion to the Chair, but actually I think I would go further than the staff though.	96	9
201504	654	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Indeed, I’m going to disagree with the Chair in the interest of giving her more discretion than she asked for.	96	9
201504	655	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I guess I don’t quite understand why we wouldn’t give her discretion for this kind of modest change in the IOER rate or the ON RRP rate or both, even in the immediate post-liftoff period.	96	9
201504	656	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It is new, but we have spent most of the past year talking about how important it is to have a smooth and credible liftoff.	96	9
201504	657	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, notwithstanding my substantial uneasiness with the potential medium-term effects of a large ON RRP facility, I’ve joined the consensus that our dominant goal should be that smooth and credible liftoff, and presumably that smoothness and credibility are going to be most important in the immediate post-liftoff period, which is to say the first couple of days.	96	9
201504	658	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me that if we regard the adjustments as fine-tuning in pursuit of a particular federal funds target rate range, it would be useful to give her the discretion in that first couple of days to make such adjustments in an effort to get, as Loretta says, to at least the bottom of that range.	96	9
201504	659	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	If there’s a major problem with liftoff, we’re going to need another full FOMC meeting.	96	9
201504	660	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But suppose, for example, there’s a little bit of softness in the floor on the first day or two after the announced liftoff, and that softness might be firmed by a modest adjustment in the IOER rate.	96	9
201504	661	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	A quick action of that sort might actually buttress the credibility of our tools and intentions right from the outset and thereby make the whole process smoother.	96	9
201504	662	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think, in any case, it represents a policy change, because we can talk about it beforehand.	96	9
201504	663	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, it’s possible that markets might read such a quick adjustment as indicating that we lack confidence in the efficacy of the decision we had just made a day or two before.	96	9
201504	664	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But that’s a judgment that the Chair could make in consultation with those best able to discern what market sentiment and intentions may be.	96	9
201504	665	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Just by indicating that nimbleness is a desideratum, I think I’ve already explained why an FOMC decisionmaking process won’t do the trick.	96	9
201504	666	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I just think the logic of what we’re talking about here argues for giving the Chair this kind of very limited discretion to adjust those two rates that we’ve been talking about and we will set at the time of liftoff in the period in which they might be most efficacious in changing or shaping perceptions of how this whole process is going to go.	96	9
201504	667	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As to communication, it does seem to me proper to indicate in advance that small, operational adjustments might be made in the IOER and ON RRP rates between meetings.	96	9
201504	668	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Characterizing those as operational adjustments beforehand and contemplating them, I think, helps reinforce the sense that these are technical changes rather than policy changes.	96	9
201504	669	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The suggestion that any actual changes be noted by the Desk, as opposed to the Chair or the Committee as a whole, also seems to me a good idea since it would reinforce the fact that these rates are more or less operational changes rather than policy changes.	96	9
201504	670	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the primary credit rate spread, I thought President Lacker’s comments were very interesting.	96	9
201504	671	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Notwithstanding the fact that they are interesting and we should think about them, particularly this difference between small and large bank stigma when we do discuss this, I personally would prefer to wait until the staff thinking about stigma effects and perhaps other elements of the discount window are done and maybe a more fulsome memo has been produced and circulated so that we can have a discussion of that.	96	9
201504	672	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It seems to me we’ve got plenty on our plate right now, and we might usefully put that conversation off just a bit.	96	9
201504	673	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I want to end by saying I hadn’t thought about it this way, but I fully endorse what Loretta said about the criteria for success in how we regard the meeting of the target range post- liftoff, and I think if we all subscribe to that, it would be useful for us, through appropriate mechanisms, to get that expectation out as well so that we’re being evaluated by commentators and markets in a manner consistent with what our actual intentions and aims are.	96	9
201504	674	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Like President Mester, again, this is another reason why I think these little adjustments even right after liftoff are fine for the Chair to make.	96	9
201504	675	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And, like President Mester, I think using any of the other tools is something that should involve the entire Committee.	96	9
201504	676	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	677	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	678	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Did I see a two-hander?	96	9
201504	679	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	96	9
201504	680	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	681	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Like Governor Tarullo, I came to the meeting prepared to support delegation in the first two weeks.	96	9
201504	682	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I interpreted your earlier suggestion as, one, respect for governance in a critical period and, two, maybe a desire to have more of a group decision than an individual decision.	96	9
201504	683	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Could you maybe speak more for another moment or two on what your thinking is regarding that?	96	9
201504	684	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I feel that in the days after liftoff, if things are not going exactly as we intend, and the funds rate is drifting outside the range, I do really think it’s appropriate for the entire Committee to meet, discuss what is happening, try to get to the bottom of what the problem is, and decide on what the approach is.	96	9
201504	685	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Now, we could make the decision that this is no big deal, the funds rate is just fluctuating around relative to the target range by more than we had anticipated and this is the “new normal.”	96	9
201504	686	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	If we wanted to address it not by moving the band or changing the spread, but by moving one or more rates around to deal with this when we see persistent movements outside the range, and early on the Committee says, “Let’s just do this.	96	9
201504	687	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s not that big of a deal.	96	9
201504	688	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s the way to address this”—and at that point you regard those adjustments as essentially routine, and it’s early, and then you want to delegate it along the lines of what Governor Tarullo said, I am perfectly comfortable with that, and, of course, that makes life easier.	96	9
201504	689	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But I think the Committee needs to feel comfortable that we have established procedures that have been determined by the Committee that we think are workable and appropriate.	96	9
201504	690	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	96	9
201504	691	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	692	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	On the staff briefings issue, I say by all means they should be useful and perhaps important.	96	9
201504	693	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	If it should turn out that between the regularly scheduled FOMC meetings the funds rate begins to trade frequently below the overnight reverse repo rate for a reasonably sized ON RRP facility, I support the Chair having limited discretionary authority to restore funds rate control by raising both the IOER and the ON RRP rates while maintaining the spread between the two rates.	96	9
201504	694	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I agree with Governor Tarullo that this could be within the first days as well.	96	9
201504	695	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That these rate changes are not to be subject to a vote would signal that they are technical adjustments designed simply to implement previously- agreed-upon policy.	96	9
201504	696	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The main focus would stay on the target band for the federal funds rate set by the FOMC.	96	9
201504	697	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The simplicity of a system in which the IOER and the ON RRP rates are set equal to the top and bottom of the target funds rate band, respectively, is appealing and easily communicated.	96	9
201504	698	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Deviations from that simple system should be temporary with reserve-draining tools, like term deposits and term RRPs, being brought to bear when systematically greater interest rate control is required.	96	9
201504	699	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I understand that we are entering uncharted territory and may need to act nimbly.	96	9
201504	700	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Therefore, a good solution is for the FOMC and the Board to give the Chair discretionary authority to adjust the IOER–ON RRP band relative to the funds rate target range between meetings while maintaining the width of the band at 25 basis points.	96	9
201504	701	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	96	9
201504	702	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	703	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	96	9
201504	704	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	705	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The staff has laid out a perfectly reasonable plan for prescheduled briefings during the first two weeks after liftoff.	96	9
201504	706	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I expect the process will go smoothly and these will end up like routine morning calls.	96	9
201504	707	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	If problems arise, I am comfortable with turning the briefings into formal teleconference meetings to handle any policy decisions we may have to make.	96	9
201504	708	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	After the initial burn-in period—perhaps two weeks—I also favor the Board and the Committee delegating authority to the Chair to adjust the IOER and ON RRP rates by up to 5 to 10 basis points, if necessary, to keep the funds rate within the target range.	96	9
201504	709	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I am comfortable delegating this authority as early as you’d like.	96	9
201504	710	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Even at the outset would be all right with me.	96	9
201504	711	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Basically, these are efficient ways to tweak the dials as necessary, and I see a communications advantage to this approach, as it reduces the odds of small technical adjustments to the IOER or the ON RRP rates being misread as changes in the stance of policy.	96	9
201504	712	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I completely trust that if any major issues arise, the Chair will not hesitate to bring us in on the decisionmaking process.	96	9
201504	713	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I did have a question.	96	9
201504	714	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I can’t remember if this was in the documents or other people have mentioned this, but at the time of the first liftoff, would we be comfortable preannouncing that we have no intention of adjusting the stance of monetary policy before the next policy meeting so that any intermeeting adjustments would be seen as nimble adjustments, just technically to get the funds rate in the range?	96	9
201504	715	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I mean, I can’t imagine that we would really think that we are going to have to have a policy tightening in between the first and the second meeting.	96	9
201504	716	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But it would be unusual, I understand that.	96	9
201504	717	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Certainly, we should make clear that we have an intended target range that reflects policy and stand prepared to make adjustments in the administered rates, and that we may need to do that.	96	9
201504	718	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	You can say that in your press conference rather than it finding its way into the statement.	96	9
201504	719	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	720	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201504	721	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes.	96	9
201504	722	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	723	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m not entirely comfortable with the pre-commitment approach that President Evans outlined.	96	9
201504	724	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the Vice Chairman talked about in some of the remarks he made publicly in the intermeeting period, we don’t know exactly what is going to happen to financial market conditions necessarily at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	725	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we saw a very abrupt tightening in broader financial market conditions, there might be a reason for the Committee to think about retracing the steps they have taken, even within the intermeeting period.	96	9
201504	726	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought it was an interesting idea, but I, myself, wouldn’t be comfortable with that.	96	9
201504	727	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	96	9
201504	728	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	96	9
201504	729	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	730	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I would be happy to set my calendar for prescheduled staff briefings during the first two weeks to offer some insight, and I would be equally happy to remove them [laughter] if the staff judges that everything is going smoothly and there is nothing to report.	96	9
201504	731	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I am also comfortable delegating to the Chair a degree of authority to make technical adjustments, and I think we will know whether those are technical or more substantive as we go along.	96	9
201504	732	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	On the issue of the discount rate spread, my comments here really are along the lines of President Lacker’s—I think this issue doesn’t have much effect right now on overall financial market conditions.	96	9
201504	733	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	But we did make changes to the discount rate during the crisis to narrow the spread and then widened it to its current 50 basis points.	96	9
201504	734	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Smaller banks do regularly use this facility, and Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks are required to make recommendations about the rate.	96	9
201504	735	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	It seems worthwhile to me to clarify how this rate is going to work as we contemplate normalization so that we minimize confusion and perhaps even mixed signals at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	736	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	96	9
201504	737	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	738	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	96	9
201504	739	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	740	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I appreciate the thoughtful analysis and the memos that discuss the intermeeting governance of the IOER rate, ON RRP rate, and other policy tools during the early weeks of liftoff.	96	9
201504	741	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that the approach described of scheduling daily staff briefings during those first few weeks is prudent and should meet our needs initially, given that we could convert them to official meetings as needed.	96	9
201504	742	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One thing I would note is that it might not always be clear what it would mean to “settle down,” so if liftoff takes place, say, in mid-June or mid-September, things might settle down after the passage of quarter-end and then you might have this issue of whether that is really settling down from the point of view of being able to deal with quarter-end.	96	9
201504	743	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You might want to have staff briefings, again, scheduled for the end of the following quarter, which I guess, if we raised in September, would be at the end of December.	96	9
201504	744	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think just the passage of time is not necessarily going to tell you that this is going to be working and working fine.	96	9
201504	745	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think that is something to keep in mind as we go forward.	96	9
201504	746	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff memo noted that there are quorum rules for the Committee.	96	9
201504	747	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Those might be useful in the context of these staff briefings.	96	9
201504	748	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Not everyone needs to be here for every meeting, and the Committee still can operate.	96	9
201504	749	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That might come up in this situation.	96	9
201504	750	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I didn’t say this at the very beginning, but I should say that I am very confident that this is all about contingency planning.	96	9
201504	751	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I am confident the tools are going to work.	96	9
201504	752	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think these meetings are going to become boring very quickly.	96	9
201504	753	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is going to be like the call.	96	9
201504	754	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Not to say that’s boring, but—	96	9
201504	755	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[laughter]—I misspoke.	96	9
201504	756	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But it will become routine, at least.	96	9
201504	757	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s our baseline scenario, but I do think it’s useful to engage in this contingency planning.	96	9
201504	758	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think I am going to be in the minority on my next point, which is, can we transition to a situation in which we simply delegate so-called technical decisions to the Chair?	96	9
201504	759	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I am not supportive of that delegation, and my answer there is shaped by three considerations.	96	9
201504	760	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	First, when my staff and I thought about the context in which increases in the ON RRP rate would be considered, we weren’t sure that those situations would be that technical per se or tactical.	96	9
201504	761	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It seemed like those would be situations in which the effective federal funds rate would be below the bottom of the target range, and that seemed likely to occur in conjunction with the cap on the ON RRP volume being binding.	96	9
201504	762	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Then there would be some interaction, at least, in your discussion about raising the ON RRP rate, and also discussion about raising the cap.	96	9
201504	763	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, the cap is a big deal.	96	9
201504	764	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We have talked about that at length.	96	9
201504	765	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Committee certainly has strong views about that.	96	9
201504	766	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It just immediately seemed to bring substantive issues into play.	96	9
201504	767	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The second consideration is that, as I listen to people talk about analogies with the past, if we were talking about delegating to the staff, I would almost be more comfortable with that than delegating to the Chair.	96	9
201504	768	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	96	9
201504	769	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I say that because I think if it is routine enough to be delegated to staff, we can delegate it to the staff.	96	9
201504	770	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is clearly not routine enough to delegate to the staff.	96	9
201504	771	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is about the Committee deciding that a decision, which is not sufficiently routine to delegate to the staff, is being delegated to the Chair instead.	96	9
201504	772	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That is not something I feel as comfortable with.	96	9
201504	773	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Third, basically, there is an issue here of precedent.	96	9
201504	774	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This is not about this Chair.	96	9
201504	775	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I feel perfectly comfortable with you, Madam Chair, and your discretion in this matter.	96	9
201504	776	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But future Committees may not have that level of comfort with future Chairs in related situations.	96	9
201504	777	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Getting together for meetings is hard and challenging.	96	9
201504	778	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It is always easy to delegate, and I think we want to fight that tendency, especially in view of how easy modern technology makes it to pull together a quorum of the Committee for substantive discussion and deliberations.	96	9
201504	779	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For these reasons, Madam Chair, I recommend that the Committee not delegate authority for intermeeting adjustments to the Chair.	96	9
201504	780	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Again, this is all about contingency planning, but I think the Committee could make contingency plans to vote, as needed, between scheduled meetings, be it by telephone, videoconference, telepresence, secure lines—all of the other suggestions that are out there.	96	9
201504	781	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	A quick comment on the primary credit spread.	96	9
201504	782	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought the idea of doing more research and work on this was a very interesting one.	96	9
201504	783	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	At liftoff, especially if we are going to be doing liftoff in the near term, the June–September time frame, I would favor keeping the 50 basis point primary credit spread at that time, then continuing to do work on the issue before we decide.	96	9
201504	784	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	96	9
201504	785	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	96	9
201504	786	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I just want to mention that there has been some loose talk about comparing the timing of these briefings to the morning call, and I am not in favor of tying them to the morning call.	96	9
201504	787	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me be clear on that.	96	9
201504	788	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Notice when I was faced with that, I devised a way to end the requirement that—	96	9
201504	789	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I call that leadership by—	96	9
201504	790	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	791	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Laughter]	96	9
201504	792	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	So it can be done?	96	9
201504	793	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s what you’re saying?	96	9
201504	794	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It can be done.	96	9
201504	795	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It only took 50 years, but—	96	9
201504	796	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It can be done.	96	9
201504	797	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	96	9
201504	798	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	799	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Generally speaking, I’m comfortable with the prescheduled staff meetings.	96	9
201504	800	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Based on the discussion here, I’m wondering whether we need one every day.	96	9
201504	801	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Maybe twice a week—I’m picking up on some of the comments of Governor Tarullo.	96	9
201504	802	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not sure how much information you’re going to get from Tuesday to Wednesday.	96	9
201504	803	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You could probably review this a couple of times a week.	96	9
201504	804	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Also, picking up a little bit on themes Vice Chairman Dudley was talking about, could you do this with a subcommittee of the FOMC?	96	9
201504	805	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Do you really have to have the entire Committee reviewing what is supposed to be a technical issue?	96	9
201504	806	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You could bring the whole Committee in, if necessary, but if everything’s going okay, it seems that it could be done by subcommittee.	96	9
201504	807	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s something to think about.	96	9
201504	808	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On the governance approach, the first part was, should we have a vote of the FOMC to adjust ranges?	96	9
201504	809	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I view this as pretty cumbersome for something that’s supposed to be a technical issue.	96	9
201504	810	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It sounds nontechnical.	96	9
201504	811	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It makes it sound like it’s a policy change regardless of what we say, and so I see that as a difficult way to go.	96	9
201504	812	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Now, for the Chair’s authority of 5 or 10 basis points, first of all, I think that moving these ranges should be subject to a high bar.	96	9
201504	813	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s one of my main comments.	96	9
201504	814	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You really don’t want to do this unless you really have to because of the communications issues that we’re going to encounter.	96	9
201504	815	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The payoff to doing this is ultimately pretty low.	96	9
201504	816	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	For instance, maybe the federal funds rate is trading a few basis points below the range, and now you make this move.	96	9
201504	817	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Now the federal funds rate moves into the bottom part of the range.	96	9
201504	818	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So you’ve gained a few basis points, but at the expense of markets asking, “What are you guys doing?	96	9
201504	819	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Are you changing policy?”	96	9
201504	820	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Another question I have that has not come up yet is the authority to go 5 to 10 basis points over what time horizon.	96	9
201504	821	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Would you be able to go 5 basis points and then the next week another 5 basis points, and the next week another 5 basis points?	96	9
201504	822	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I don’t think that’s the intent, but that’s something you’ve got to think about here.	96	9
201504	823	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	And if you went the full 10 basis points and it didn’t work, then I guess the whole Committee would have to come in at that point.	96	9
201504	824	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I see a core problem here, which we’ve talked about before in our discussions.	96	9
201504	825	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Committee insists on saying that the federal funds rate is the policy rate, but relatively few trades are occurring at that particular rate.	96	9
201504	826	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	According to the Committee, the IOER rate is not the policy rate, but, on the other hand, that is the rate that affects the largest banks in the country, and it affects their funding costs.	96	9
201504	827	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	And, in other contexts, we have said IOER is our workhorse rate.	96	9
201504	828	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	And then you’ve got overnight RRP, which we’re also saying is not a policy rate, but which is for a market that has many traders and that is potentially large at the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	829	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So we might say that the policy rate is the federal funds rate, but what does that mean to markets?	96	9
201504	830	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s really the markets that are saying what the policy rate is, and if they think moving these other rates is more important than where the federal funds rate is trading, then we’ve changed policy in a macroeconomic sense.	96	9
201504	831	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So, I think this is a conflict, but that is part of the situation we’re in, given the way we’ve decided to do this.	96	9
201504	832	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think it does have potential to sound like a policy move to people inside financial markets even though we’re saying, well, the federal funds rate range has not changed and so we haven’t done anything different.	96	9
201504	833	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that I am worried about communications issues.	96	9
201504	834	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Because of that, I don’t think you want to do this unless it’s absolutely necessary.	96	9
201504	835	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You know, overall I would say 5 to 10 basis points per intermeeting period is okay with me.	96	9
201504	836	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I would agree with President Rosengren that it might be premature to decide on this today.	96	9
201504	837	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You could make the delegation decision later around the time of liftoff, if necessary.	96	9
201504	838	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me finish with one story that old-timers here around the Federal Reserve will remember from the early 1990s.	96	9
201504	839	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I am going to mention “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,” who is former Chairman Alan Greenspan.	96	9
201504	840	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	At the time, it was considered that the Chairman had 25 basis points on the federal funds rate target and that the Chairman could make that adjustment during an intermeeting period without consulting the Committee.	96	9
201504	841	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	And the Chairman at that time made a bunch of those moves and then came into the meeting and said, “Now that I’ve made the move, now we don’t have to move at the meeting.”	96	9
201504	842	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This was extremely hot and divisive on the Committee in the early 1990s.	96	9
201504	843	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t want to get into any kind of situation like that, and I know that’s not your intention, but it is a bit of a slippery slope:  What’s going to be delegated?	96	9
201504	844	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Who’s agreed to it?	96	9
201504	845	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	How much have you agreed to?	96	9
201504	846	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Under what circumstances?	96	9
201504	847	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It is a very tricky issue, and it has been a situation in the past on this Committee that has been problematic from a collegiality perspective.	96	9
201504	848	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I know we’re not really thinking about anything like that, but I think it is a bit of a slippery slope.	96	9
201504	849	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You’ve got this issue about what rates really matter versus what rates we are calling the policy rate, and you’ve got this precedent in the past when it didn’t go so well.	96	9
201504	850	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	851	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	852	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	96	9
201504	853	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	854	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m comfortable with the governance approach in the first two weeks of scheduling daily staff briefings, but I assume that we’ll quickly work out whether we need them every day and we can probably unschedule a few of them within a day or two.	96	9
201504	855	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	So I think there’s some flexibility there.	96	9
201504	856	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to the governance approach for technical adjustments in the IOER or ON RRP rates, I don’t know about previous Chairmen.	96	9
201504	857	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’ve only had one Chair in my life on the Board, and my experience with that Chair is that if there is going to be any question about a need for discussion, she will call for it.	96	9
201504	858	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I haven’t detected her trying to get around the FOMC or the Board, and I think we can rely on that.	96	9
201504	859	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	So I’d be perfectly willing to give the Chair an adjustment up to 10 basis points.	96	9
201504	860	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I agree that we need to specify that the discretion would be granted between meetings.	96	9
201504	861	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure about the wisdom of constraining the gap between the ON RRP and IOER rates to 25 basis points.	96	9
201504	862	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We may find reasons why we need to move one without moving the other, and my general approach is, don’t constrain yourself if there’s no need to constrain yourself, because the law of unintended consequences is very powerful.	96	9
201504	863	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	On the primary credit rate, I agree with those who think we should try to minimize the number of adjustments we make at the time of liftoff, and that this issue is sufficiently important for banks to which we give a lot more attention than their size would imply.	96	9
201504	864	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’m not sure why we would want to start by raising the cost of borrowing by 50 basis points for the smaller banks who do borrow at that rate, and we’d need to look at what would happen when we raise the rate.	96	9
201504	865	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And so, for both reasons, I favor examining that after liftoff.	96	9
201504	866	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	867	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	868	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	96	9
201504	869	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	870	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I’m very well aligned with the Chair’s original comments and additional comments and response to Governor Tarullo’s and President Lockhart’s points, and with many others around the table as well.	96	9
201504	871	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	As for the briefings, I think it is fine to schedule them, and if we have them I’ll attend them, but I think the only case in which we would actually want to have them is if things are really not going well.	96	9
201504	872	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	And I don’t expect that that is likely at all in a world in which we have taken the cap off the overnight RRP or, for that matter, put a very high cap on.	96	9
201504	873	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	As far as delegation is concerned, if the test is adjustments that are routine or technical in nature, I completely trust the Chair’s instincts on that.	96	9
201504	874	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I will say that if what we’re dealing with is a very difficult and failed liftoff situation, I don’t think, in real time, that’s going to feel either routine or technical.	96	9
201504	875	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I think it’s going to feel like something that all of us ought to be involved in and accountable for.	96	9
201504	876	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I also would not constrain ourselves by holding this space between the IOER and the ON RRP rates at 25 basis points.	96	9
201504	877	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	It might make sense to do something different, again, in real time.	96	9
201504	878	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	So, for all of that, I think it’s essentially impossible to anticipate all of these things, and I would just say that I will do what is reasonable at the time.	96	9
201504	879	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In terms of the primary credit facility, it is an interesting subject on which we can have a lot of debate.	96	9
201504	880	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I wouldn’t touch it until well after liftoff.	96	9
201504	881	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In my view, it’s just not a complication that we, in my view, need to be taking on right now.	96	9
201504	882	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	883	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	884	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	96	9
201504	885	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	886	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I support the proposal.	96	9
201504	887	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s very important for us as Committee members to take responsibility for actively being engaged in assessing the effectiveness of monetary control and the relative roles of the IOER and the ON RRP rates in maintaining the federal funds rate in the target range for some initial period.	96	9
201504	888	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The length of that period, I think, should be determined by events.	96	9
201504	889	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	My guess is that if the decision to lift off is made coincident with a meeting with a press conference, as seems very likely, I would expect that period of active involvement to span that quarter-end, but beyond that, I think it would be unwise to be too prescriptive at this point.	96	9
201504	890	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	When market functioning has settled down, it will be appropriate to delegate to the Chair the authority to make the necessary changes to the levels of the IOER and the ON RRP rates, or possibly to the spread between them, in order to maintain effective monetary control.	96	9
201504	891	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think the Committee can make that decision once it judges that the frequent briefings and meetings no long serve their purpose, along with the parameters of the delegation.	96	9
201504	892	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s very important that we carefully manage communications regarding the heightened vigilance and possible activity of the Committee and the Board during those initial weeks so that our communications bolster confidence in the normalization process and contribute to smooth market functioning.	96	9
201504	893	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	With regard to the appropriate level of the primary credit spread, I would be open to a recommendation from the staff as to returning it to pre-crisis levels.	96	9
201504	894	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But like many others around the table, I would want to put some distance between the timing of liftoff and the timing of possibly changing that spread so as not to further complicate our already challenging communications around the time of liftoff.	96	9
201504	895	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	96	9
201504	896	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	96	9
201504	897	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think this has been a very useful discussion.	96	9
201504	898	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me say the Board meeting is now adjourned.	96	9
201504	899	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’re ready to go on to item 3, and I suggest we have the economic briefings and then we’ll take a coffee break before going into our round.	96	9
201504	900	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me turn things over to Bill Wascher.	11	1
201504	901	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201504	902	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll be referring to the top exhibit on your pile, which is labeled “Material for the US Outlook.”	11	1
201504	903	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The data on spending, production, and hiring that we received since the March Tealbook were all weaker than we expected.	11	1
201504	904	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	On the spending side, the February PCE data and March retail sales report led us to make a sizable reduction in our estimate of first-quarter real PCE growth.	11	1
201504	905	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	This downward revision to consumer spending accounts for much of the downward revision to first-quarter real GDP growth shown in panel 1 of your forecast summary exhibit.	11	1
201504	906	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In addition, a number of other categories of spending— particularly business investment and residential construction—have also surprised us to the downside in recent months, as have the incoming data on factory output.	11	1
201504	907	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I would note that after the April Tealbook was closed, we received the advance report on capital goods orders and shipments for March, which was also weak but broadly in line with our expectations.	11	1
201504	908	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	One of the crucial questions that we faced—and that you face as well—was how to interpret this batch of disappointing news, and whether, in particular, it is best seen as just another hiccup in a recovery that fundamentally remains on track toward achievement of your policy objectives, or the leading edge of a more serious slackening in the pace of recovery.	11	1
201504	909	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	For the most part, we have leaned toward the former interpretation.	11	1
201504	910	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Accordingly, our projection calls for near-term real GDP growth to return to a pace that is not too different from our March forecast.	11	1
201504	911	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In particular, although it is difficult to quantify their influence precisely, we believe that several transitory special factors—including unusually severe winter weather and production disruptions related to labor disputes at West Coast ports—were a small drag on first-quarter real activity.	11	1
201504	912	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In addition, we think that measured first-quarter GDP growth will be held down a bit by seasonal adjustment issues that affected estimates of state and local construction spending and by a distortion in the BEA’s translation of retail sales to PCE associated with the steep decline in gasoline prices and the increased share of gasoline sales at large retail establishments such as Wal- Mart.	11	1
201504	913	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	We do not judge any of these factors to be exerting a large influence on their own, but as a group, our back-of-the-envelope calculations put the effect at about ¾ percentage point.	11	1
201504	914	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	That said, we have not completely discounted the weaker-than-expected incoming data.	11	1
201504	915	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Specifically, we trimmed our estimate of consumption growth in the second quarter a bit as a result of the weaker-than-expected March retail sales report, and we made a noticeable downward revision to our projection of near-term residential construction activity in response to the lack of a significant pickup in starts and permits in March.	11	1
201504	916	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	We also lowered our forecast for nonresidential structures spending, as the latest data on drilling activity suggest that the recent drop in oil prices is having a larger effect on drilling and mining investment than we had previously anticipated.	11	1
201504	917	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Because we believe that the fundamentals underpinning household spending remain solid, we continue to expect that real GDP will rise at a pace that exceeds our estimate of potential output growth over the remainder of the year.	11	1
201504	918	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Even so, the level of real output at the end of this year is almost ½ percent lower than in our March forecast.	11	1
201504	919	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	As a way of providing another perspective on the near-term outlook, panel 2 presents the results from the Board staff’s dynamic factor model.	11	1
201504	920	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	This model uses the information from a large number of activity and price indicators to generate forecasts of near-term real GDP growth, and it was among the specifications we showed you in the April Tealbook box on nowcasting models.	11	1
201504	921	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see, using the data that we had available when the April Tealbook was closed, the model also predicts a very low GDP growth figure for the first quarter followed by a modest pickup in the current quarter.	11	1
201504	922	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Of course, the model does not know about any of the special factors that we think will unwind and provide an additional boost to growth this quarter.	11	1
201504	923	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	And I would note that the range of predictions for first-quarter growth coming from the various nowcasting efforts across the System is quite wide, underscoring the uncertainty surrounding the interpretation of the pace of activity last quarter.	11	1
201504	924	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	To wrap up the discussion of the near-term spending data, I would remind you that we will receive the BEA’s advance estimate of first-quarter real GDP tomorrow morning.	11	1
201504	925	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Given how low our current point estimate is—and in light of the relatively large degree of uncertainty that surrounds these estimates, even on the eve of a release—it would not be especially surprising from a statistical point of view if we were to see either a small decline tomorrow or a noticeably stronger increase than we have penciled in.	11	1
201504	926	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	And, of course, the BEA’s initial estimate is itself subject to substantial revision over time.	11	1
201504	927	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Moving to the middle panels, the labor market has continued to improve, but here, too, the data point to somewhat less momentum than we had anticipated in our previous forecast.	11	1
201504	928	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In the establishment survey, March total nonfarm payroll employment growth was considerably weaker than the very strong pace that we had expected.	11	1
201504	929	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Incorporating revisions to previous months, the average monthly change in payroll employment over the first quarter now stands at about 200,000, which is 70,000 less than we had written down in the March Tealbook.	11	1
201504	930	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The news from the household survey also came in a little weaker than we had anticipated:  The unemployment rate held steady at 5.5 percent in March—we had expected it to tick down one-tenth—while the participation rate, which we had expected to hold steady, edged lower.	11	1
201504	931	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	To summarize the information from the various pieces of labor market data that we have received, panel 3 shows our labor market conditions index, or LMCI.	11	1
201504	932	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the inset box, the LMCI was basically flat last month.	11	1
201504	933	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	For the first quarter as a whole—the rightmost bar in the main chart—the index did increase, but at a slower pace than what we have seen in recent quarters.	11	1
201504	934	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Just as we did with the spending data, we took a modest signal from the incoming labor market news and reduced our projected pace of monthly payroll job growth by about 40,000 over the current quarter.	11	1
201504	935	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	We also nudged up our forecast for the unemployment rate in coming months.	11	1
201504	936	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Over the remainder of the medium term, our projection of real GDP growth is little revised from March.	11	1
201504	937	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The main conditioning factors that we built into the baseline forecast this round—particularly, the lower projected path for the exchange value of the dollar—are, on net, expected to be slightly more supportive of real activity.	11	1
201504	938	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	By the end of the medium term, the effects of these changes offset roughly half of the downward revisions we put through to the near term, leaving the level of real GDP just a little lower relative to our March projection.	11	1
201504	939	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Although it had only a small effect on our projection regarding real activity, I would point out that we now assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound in September, one quarter later than in our previous forecast.	11	1
201504	940	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Our revised liftoff assumption is broadly consistent with both the “flash” primary dealer survey that was taken after the March FOMC meeting and the latest dealer survey, and it is more consistent with the timing suggested by financial markets.	11	1
201504	941	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In addition, as best we can tell, a September liftoff date does not appear to be sharply at odds with FOMC participants’ March SEP submissions, in which the median participant pointed to the third quarter as the most likely quarter for liftoff.	11	1
201504	942	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	After liftoff—and consistent with our usual practice—the projected path for the funds rate is set by mechanically applying an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) policy rule.	11	1
201504	943	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Panel 4 gives our projected path for the unemployment rate.	11	1
201504	944	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	With the level of real GDP at the end of the medium term only a little lower relative to March—and with no change to our supply-side assumptions this round—the unemployment rate is expected to be 5.1 percent at the end of 2017.	11	1
201504	945	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	This is one-tenth higher than its level in the March Tealbook and one-tenth below our estimate of its natural rate.	11	1
201504	946	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The slow pace of decline in the unemployment rate reflects both the modest pace of GDP growth projected over the medium term and our assumption that the strengthening labor market will draw more individuals back into the labor force.	11	1
201504	947	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Panels 5 and 6 summarize the inflation outlook.	11	1
201504	948	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The incoming data on price inflation have been a touch above our expectations and support our projection that both total and core inflation will step up in the second quarter.	11	1
201504	949	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Further out, the inflation projection is little revised.	11	1
201504	950	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	As in previous Tealbooks, we expect that inflation will gradually move higher as resource slack diminishes, energy prices rise, and prices for imported goods turn up again.	11	1
201504	951	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Finally, I wanted to call your attention to a change we made this round to how we characterize forecast uncertainty in the Tealbook.	11	1
201504	952	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Specifically, we have revamped the methodology that we use to compute confidence intervals based on our historical projection errors and have also reworked our presentation of these intervals to include a comparison with the historical range of key forecast variables.	11	1
201504	953	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The new intervals are typically a little wider than the ones we reported previously, and they tend to show more asymmetry, which is most noticeable in the prediction interval surrounding the unemployment forecast.	11	1
201504	954	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	When we miss big on unemployment, it tends to be because unemployment turns out to have been much higher than expected, not much lower.	11	1
201504	955	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Additional details on this new methodology were presented in a box and associated technical appendix in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the Tealbook and in Jeremy Nalewaik’s pre-FOMC briefing.	11	1
201504	956	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	These new intervals complement our other methodology of using stochastic simulations from the FRB/US model to produce confidence intervals around our projection, and we intend to show both sets of uncertainty measures in future Tealbooks.	11	1
201504	957	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I would note that the confidence bands shown in my exhibit today continue to use the FRB/US measures, but our intention is to eventually extend the new methodology to compute confidence intervals around our quarterly forecasts as well.	11	1
201504	958	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Steve will continue our presentation.	11	1
201504	959	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Thank you, Bill.	11	1
201504	960	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	The harsh weather we endured last winter left many potholes in US roads and, as Bill Wascher has described, helped create one large pothole in US GDP growth.	11	1
201504	961	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Interestingly, as shown in panel 1 of my presentation on the international outlook, a pothole also appears in the path of foreign growth in the first quarter.	11	1
201504	962	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Incoming data have been surprisingly weak in countries as diverse as Canada, which shared our harsh winter; China, which was actually warmer than usual; and Malaysia, which arguably has no winter at all.	11	1
201504	963	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 2, the downturn was also evident in global trade, suggesting some underlying malaise that was sweeping the globe.	11	1
201504	964	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As indicated by the yellow bars in panels 1 and 2, we faced a very similar picture exactly a year ago, with US growth, foreign growth, and global trade all turning down in the first quarter of 2014.	11	1
201504	965	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, I went back and looked at my remarks for the April 2014 FOMC meeting for lessons that we might apply here.	11	1
201504	966	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, I found that I used the same tired pothole metaphor a year ago.	11	1
201504	967	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11	1
201504	968	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Second, at that time, I also predicted that foreign economic activity would clamber out of its pothole and resume moving along the path to recovery, just as Bill Wascher did for the United States.	11	1
201504	969	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Unusually enough, we both turned out to be right, and we are making the same call today.	11	1
201504	970	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Certainly, the fundamentals favor a return to solid growth abroad:  Monetary policy is generally very accommodative, oil prices remain low, and most currencies have weakened considerably against the dollar since last summer.	11	1
201504	971	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Moreover, many of the factors that pushed down global growth in the first quarter appear to be transitory.	11	1
201504	972	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Canada’s economy is estimated to have flatlined on account of unusually harsh winter weather and a step-down in oil investment, but with oil prices bottoming out, growth should bounce back in the coming quarters.	11	1
201504	973	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Mexican output is estimated to have decelerated sharply in the first quarter along with US manufacturing, and we anticipate that the projected rebound in US activity will boost growth in Mexico as well.	11	1
201504	974	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	China also accounts for some of the pothole in foreign growth, but its situation is more complicated.	11	1
201504	975	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown in panel 3, GDP growth fell from 7 percent in the fourth quarter to only 5.3 percent in the first, well below expectations, as exports and industrial production dropped sharply.	11	1
201504	976	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	It is difficult to parse out how much of the first-quarter shortfall reflects reduced external demand, how much reflects the ongoing correction in the property sector, and how much reflects longer-term developments such as the rebalancing of the economy and decline in potential output growth.	11	1
201504	977	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	In any event, the authorities had been easing monetary policy even before the weak GDP reading, and they have now stepped up this stimulus, including reducing the required reserve ratio 100 basis points.	11	1
201504	978	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	In our projection, the combination of heightened policy stimulus and rising external demand pushes growth back up to over 7 percent later this year before it edges down thereafter.	11	1
201504	979	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Like the booming Chinese stock market, however, this forecast is somewhat speculative, and we have revised down our projection a bit in response to the recent weakness.	11	1
201504	980	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Ironically, nearly the only bright spot in the global economy has been the euro area, for which strengthening industrial production, retail sales, and PMIs point to a rise in first-quarter GDP growth to 1¾ percent (panel 4).	11	1
201504	981	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Notably, financial conditions are becoming more of a positive for the economy, in part reflecting the ECB’s asset purchase program.	11	1
201504	982	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Bank lending standards are loosening, credit to nonfinancial corporations is finally picking up a bit, interest rates are extremely low, and the real trade-weighted euro is at its weakest level since 2001.	11	1
201504	983	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we see euro-area growth firming to 2¼ percent in the next few years, provided that spillovers from Greece’s crisis remain contained, as we assume in our baseline.	11	1
201504	984	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	That, however, is a big “if.”	11	1
201504	985	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	The Greek government is struggling in its efforts to negotiate additional financial assistance from European authorities and the IMF, even as it is running arrears to suppliers and raiding the accounts of local governments in order to stay afloat.	11	1
201504	986	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	More than €10 billion in payments on its medium- and long-term debt are coming due in the next four months.	11	1
201504	987	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Although the Greeks have reshuffled their negotiating team in an apparent effort to ease tensions with their creditors and strike a deal, there is still a good chance that the government could miss one or more of these payments.	11	1
201504	988	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Such an event could trigger a run on Greek banks, and unless the ECB stepped up its liquidity support by a substantial margin, the government would have to declare a bank holiday and impose capital controls, with a much-heightened chance of Greece eventually exiting the euro area altogether.	11	1
201504	989	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Had such developments occurred at the height of the euro crisis in 2012, spillovers to the rest of the euro area would have been very destructive.	11	1
201504	990	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, as Simon noted, the region’s financial, institutional, and policy framework has strengthened in recent years.	11	1
201504	991	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Accordingly, we are building into our euro-area forecast only a small drag due to spillovers from Greece’s intensifying crisis.	11	1
201504	992	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Nevertheless, we recognize that, as described in the Tealbook, far more dire scenarios are possible, not just for the euro area but for the global economy more generally.	11	1
201504	993	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	While the pace of economic activity abroad remains quite unsettled, two key external drivers of US economic prospects have been a bit more quiescent of late.	11	1
201504	994	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	First, oil markets have not yielded any big surprises.	11	1
201504	995	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	To be sure, spot prices, shown in panel 5, are up more than $8 per barrel since the time of the March Tealbook, as falling rig counts and other signs of declining investment have led markets to expect lower US oil production.	11	1
201504	996	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, prices for futures contracts further out on the curve are up by less, so that our projected path for Brent prices has been raised just a bit and remains well below levels prevailing last summer.	11	1
201504	997	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Second, for the first time since last July, the dollar has come down over the intermeeting period, as shown in panel 6.	11	1
201504	998	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	This depreciation likely reflected weak data and the fall in expected policy rates here in the United States.	11	1
201504	999	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, I would like to remind you that, starting with the March Tealbook, we decided to deviate from our standard random-walk-oriented model and projected a further rise in the dollar.	11	1
201504	1000	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	That also must have contributed to the dollar’s subsequent decline.	11	1
201504	1001	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	[Laughter]	11	1
201504	1002	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	In the event, from its lower starting point, we assume the broad real dollar will still move up some 2¼ percent between now and the end of the year as the US economy bounces back and markets refocus on the policy divergences among major central banks.	11	1
201504	1003	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Your next exhibit puts movements in the dollar and their implications for economic growth into broader perspective.	11	1
201504	1004	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown by the black solid line in panel 1, even at its projected peak early next year, the broad real dollar would be well below its previous two peaks.	11	1
201504	1005	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	The black solid line in panel 2 shows the contribution of net exports to real US GDP growth.	11	1
201504	1006	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	We project it at negative ¾ percentage point this year and next.	11	1
201504	1007	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	This is the largest drag on growth since the early 2000s, and it almost entirely reflects the appreciation of the dollar.	11	1
201504	1008	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	It may seem strange that the dollar should depress the net export contribution to such an extent when it remains so far below its previous peaks.	11	1
201504	1009	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	However, what matters for the contribution of net exports to GDP growth is not the level of the dollar but how much it moves, and the dollar has appreciated sharply since last summer.	11	1
201504	1010	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, the share of trade in the US economy has grown over time, amplifying the effects of dollar movements on net exports and growth.	11	1
201504	1011	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Were the dollar to rise further than we are currently projecting, it would exert even stronger effects on the economy.	11	1
201504	1012	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Returning to panel 1, the dashed line shows the 10 percent rise in the dollar described in the “Stronger Dollar” scenario in the Tealbook.	11	1
201504	1013	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As shown below, the contribution of net exports to GDP would fall to its lowest level since the early 1980s.	11	1
201504	1014	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Additionally, as indicated in panel 3, core inflation would fall below 1 percent on a four-quarter basis before rebounding.	11	1
201504	1015	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Josh will now continue our presentation.	11	1
201504	1016	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Thank you.	FS	FS
201504	1017	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	My material is titled “Financial Stability Developments.”	FS	FS
201504	1018	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	My remarks draw on the recent QS financial stability report.	FS	FS
201504	1019	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In sum, valuation pressures in asset markets have increased since the January assessment and remain notable.	FS	FS
201504	1020	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In addition, vulnerabilities related to maturity and liquidity transformation remain moderate, but leverage in both the financial and the nonfinancial sectors, overall, remains relatively low.	FS	FS
201504	1021	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Taken together, we think that conditions in the financial sector are moderately prone to amplify shocks.	FS	FS
201504	1022	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	I begin with valuations in fixed-income markets.	FS	FS
201504	1023	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The yield on the 10-year Treasury note—the blue line in the upper-left panel—and term premium measures— the red and black lines—have remained quite low since the January financial stability briefing.	FS	FS
201504	1024	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The possibility that term premiums will move up sharply remains a focus of staff analysis.	FS	FS
201504	1025	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	I will return to this issue near the end of the briefing.	FS	FS
201504	1026	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In corporate bond markets, yield spreads to comparable Treasury securities have moved down a bit in recent months.	FS	FS
201504	1027	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As shown by the red line in the panel to the right, the far-term forward spread for high-yield corporate bonds—one measure of risk premiums—remains near the middle of its historical range, which suggests that valuations are reasonable—relative, that is, to seemingly richly valued Treasury securities.	FS	FS
201504	1028	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In addition, as shown by the light blue bars in the middle-left panel, issuance of high-yield bonds, a nonprice measure of hot markets and thus valuation pressures, remained robust through the first quarter of the year.	FS	FS
201504	1029	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Somewhat in contrast, issuance of leveraged loans—the dark blue portion of the bars—has declined, on net, in recent quarters.	FS	FS
201504	1030	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Although supervisory analysis of completed deals suggests a modest improvement in underwriting quality, fairly lax nonprice terms were reportedly still prevalent in recent deals.	FS	FS
201504	1031	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Moving to the stock market, the expected real return on corporate equities—the black line in the middle-right panel—has fallen significantly since the previous stability briefing, as stock prices have advanced and expectations of corporate earnings have been revised down.	FS	FS
201504	1032	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The low expected return suggests that valuations are quite high.	FS	FS
201504	1033	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The equity risk premium, which is the difference between the expected return on stocks and the expected real yield on the 10-year Treasury note, shown in teal, has also moved down sharply, though it remains closer to the middle of its 30-year range.	FS	FS
201504	1034	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Our overall assessment is that equity valuations are somewhat more stretched now than they were just a few months ago.	FS	FS
201504	1035	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	A variety of changes in the structure of fixed-income markets may add to the volatility of interest rates, and, perhaps, to the volatility of volatility.	FS	FS
201504	1036	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	First—and I’m not referring to any panel quite yet—increased electronification of the Treasury market could contribute to occasional and surprising spikes in volatility, such as that which occurred on October 15 of last year.	FS	FS
201504	1037	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In addition, the continued decline in intermediation by dealers—as illustrated by gross and net dealer borrowing, shown in the lower-left panel—is consistent with anecdotes that new regulations have made dealers less willing to provide marketmaking liquidity, even in normal times.	FS	FS
201504	1038	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	A bond market selloff could also be temporarily amplified if investors in bond mutual funds rush for the exits, forcing funds to sell into an illiquid market.	FS	FS
201504	1039	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The rapid growth in assets under management at such funds—shown in the lower-right panel—including funds that hold less-liquid assets, suggests that the scope for such an amplification has increased in recent years.	FS	FS
201504	1040	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The first panel of the next exhibit shows an estimate of the level of “runnable” private money-like instruments.	FS	FS
201504	1041	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	This measure of maturity and liquidity transformation includes cross-holdings of money market instruments, such as when a money fund holds repo.	FS	FS
201504	1042	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	It is therefore an indicator of the vulnerability of the financial system through intermediation chains that rely—at one link or more—on short-term funding.	FS	FS
201504	1043	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The level of these runnables has been fairly stable at a relatively high level during the past two years, as growth in uninsured deposits—the light blue region—has offset a decline in repo—in red—which suggests that the financial system remains moderately vulnerable to runs.	FS	FS
201504	1044	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	A fairly bright—or should I say, green—spot on the financial-stability map is leverage in the banking system.	FS	FS
201504	1045	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As can be seen in the upper-right panel, capital cushions at bank holding companies, as measured by both the Tier 1 common equity ratio—in black—and the leverage ratio—in red—have increased notably.	FS	FS
201504	1046	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	This reflects both Basel III requirements and the resilience required in annual stress tests.	FS	FS
201504	1047	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As you know, no CCAR bank fell below the stress test’s quantitative benchmarks in the most recent round, although three firms had to adjust their planned capital distributions.	FS	FS
201504	1048	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As far as we can tell—which, admittedly, is not very far—leverage in the nonbank financial sector continues to be a vulnerability.	FS	FS
201504	1049	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As summarized in the middle-left panel, overall margin credit has moved down in recent months but remains quite elevated, and hedge funds appear to be using a fairly large amount of portfolio margining from prime brokerages to lever up in equity markets.	FS	FS
201504	1050	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	In addition, responses to the March SCOOS provided some evidence that counterparties have been demanding more leverage to fund non-agency RMBS, high-yield corporate bonds, and securitized CRE loans.	FS	FS
201504	1051	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Unfortunately, leverage embedded in derivatives is hard to measure, so it remains difficult to assess the overall leverage of hedge funds, mutual funds, and other investment vehicles.	FS	FS
201504	1052	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Moving to the private nonfinancial sector, the middle-right panel provides the big picture for households: Modest increases in household debt continue to be driven mostly by prime borrowers—the orange line—though debt of subprime borrowers— the black line—ticked up in the fourth quarter.	FS	FS
201504	1053	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Student loans and subprime auto lending have remained rapid even as delinquencies on these kinds of debt have moved up.	FS	FS
201504	1054	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Although we do not currently consider student and subprime auto debt to be direct vulnerabilities for the financial system, we are alert for potential spillovers to other debt markets.	FS	FS
201504	1055	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As can be seen in the lower-left panel, the debt-to-assets ratio for all nonfinancial corporate businesses—the black line—and for high-yield and unrated firms—the red line—moved up further in the fourth quarter, which suggests a continued buildup of the vulnerability of this sector.	FS	FS
201504	1056	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	The lower-right panel provides a very brief roundup of the potential shocks to the financial system that appear most proximate.	FS	FS
201504	1057	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	A sharp rise in term premiums could precipitate a sudden drop in a variety of asset prices, especially for those with stretched valuations.	FS	FS
201504	1058	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Moreover, for reasons mentioned previously, these shocks could be temporarily amplified if liquidity were to deteriorate just when it is needed most or if bond mutual funds were to experience large and disruptive outflows.	FS	FS
201504	1059	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	That said, the risk of a sustained amplification is mitigated by the apparently modest amount of leverage in the financial system.	FS	FS
201504	1060	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	We are also attuned to the possibility of damaging spillovers from a rate spike here to emerging market economies.	FS	FS
201504	1061	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	As we concluded in a special memo, although blowback to the United States through financial connections would likely be limited, a significant EME recession and a presumed increase in risk aversion would damage the US economy as well.	FS	FS
201504	1062	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	It is worth noting also that term premiums could, instead, stay low for longer than anticipated.	FS	FS
201504	1063	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Such an outcome would be a shock to investors who have positioned themselves for rising yields and could also lead to a further buildup of vulnerabilities if investors are driven to “reach for yield.”	FS	FS
201504	1064	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Other potential shocks of note that have been around for a while include a disorderly Greek exit from the euro zone, significant geopolitical disruptions, or distress at a large global financial firm brought about by, say, legal penalties.	FS	FS
201504	1065	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	I will conclude my prepared remarks by noting a few policy initiatives that the staff are pursuing related to specific financial vulnerabilities, which appear at the top of the final exhibit.	FS	FS
201504	1066	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	With regard to interest rate risk, the staff are independently measuring the risks at banks and working with those banks to manage their exposures.	FS	FS
201504	1067	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	On market liquidity, the staff are undertaking a variety of projects to better understand changes in the structure of bond markets, including increased electronification, and are working with other agencies to prepare a public report on the Treasury market.	FS	FS
201504	1068	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Regarding asset managers, the staff have begun evaluating the potential for the growth of managers’ activities, perhaps through the use of leverage and liquidity transformation, to contribute meaningfully to systemic risk and whether reforms are needed.	FS	FS
201504	1069	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Finally, on leveraged loans, supervisors continue their monitoring efforts and will begin a more comprehensive Shared National Credit review in May.	FS	FS
201504	1070	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	Thanks.	FS	FS
201504	1071	2015-04-29	meeting	GALLIN	That concludes my remarks.	FS	FS
201504	1072	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	FS	FS
201504	1073	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Questions for any of our presenters?	12	1
201504	1074	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201504	1075	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201504	1076	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m looking at exhibit 2, “Alternative Scenario:  Stronger Dollar.”	12	1
201504	1077	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	What are the confidence bounds around these dotted lines?	12	1
201504	1078	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Well, the simulations come from a DSGE model, but it’s not an estimated model.	12	1
201504	1079	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	So we don’t compute those, although I assure you that an estimated version of SIGMA that would allow us to compute those is on our long-term work agenda.	12	1
201504	1080	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	The most tenuous thing is whether or not you will actually get a 10 percent additional rise in the dollar.	12	1
201504	1081	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	As you can tell from the chart, that’s not a common occurrence.	12	1
201504	1082	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	That’s something that, broadly speaking, we think there might be a 1 in 10 chance of for a couple of years.	12	1
201504	1083	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	So that, in some sense, is the most tenuous.	12	1
201504	1084	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	In terms of thinking about the effects on net exports and then on US real GDP, that’s actually a little bit more straightforward in the sense that the results from SIGMA—particularly for what I’m showing here, which is the net export contribution—are broadly consistent with our estimated trade models, and those don’t give you very different results.	12	1
201504	1085	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	So the effect of a higher dollar on exports and on imports is relatively straightforward, and obviously there are errors, but they’re probably not subject to huge errors.	12	1
201504	1086	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	A larger area of uncertainty comes in when translating the effect of the change in net exports into GDP, because there is some uncertainty there about the multipliers.	12	1
201504	1087	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	And there’s also some uncertainty about to what extent you want to build in a monetary policy response and what impact that has.	12	1
201504	1088	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	So, for the net export contribution itself, I would guess that, relatively speaking, is not a huge confidence error.	12	1
201504	1089	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	The confidence errors would rise as you then translate that through to real GDP growth.	12	1
201504	1090	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me follow up with a slightly different question.	12	1
201504	1091	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Over the past 25 years, firms have become more globalized and have learned how to handle global currency fluctuations.	12	1
201504	1092	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	They adopt hedging strategies, and they put production in various countries and switch production in response to currency movements.	12	1
201504	1093	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	In light of those changes, should we be estimating effects of real exchange rate movements using data for the 1980s and 1990s?	12	1
201504	1094	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Well, that’s an excellent question.	12	1
201504	1095	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	Let’s just say we periodically do revise our import equations, and we do look for signs of parameter instability.	12	1
201504	1096	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	So we’re alert to that issue, and we haven’t found any strong evidence of these changes in coefficients.	12	1
201504	1097	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	There are other factors that, of course, are naturally parsed in.	12	1
201504	1098	2015-04-29	meeting	KAMIN	They kind of correlate with what you mentioned, which is that, over time, the share of trade in the US economy has grown, and that is fully taken into account in our estimations because our models do incorporate the fact that, as the dollar changes exports and imports, those have a larger effect on GDP.	12	1
201504	1099	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you.	12	1
201504	1100	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks.	12	1
201504	1101	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Any other questions?	12	1
201504	1102	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	12	1
201504	1103	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201504	1104	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I have a question for Bill Wascher related to the Tealbook inflation outlook.	12	1
201504	1105	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I think in your presentation you mentioned that the inflation outlook is trending up because—I think you said—energy prices are going to be going up, resource slack will be diminishing, and maybe imported goods prices—I can’t recall the entire list.	12	1
201504	1106	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Could you refresh my memory on the contribution of changes in longer-term inflation expectations for delivering that increase in inflation?	12	1
201504	1107	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	So, over the medium-term forecast, our view is that the underlying rate of inflation is 1.8 percent, and that serves as an attractor for the inflation rate.	12	1
201504	1108	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Inflation expectations, is that—	12	1
201504	1109	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Yes.	12	1
201504	1110	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	We call it underlying inflation, but in some sense you may think of it as inflation expectations over the medium term.	12	1
201504	1111	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Over the longer run, that drifts up to 2 percent because the FOMC says the target is 2 percent, and because tightness in the labor market is pushing inflation up.	12	1
201504	1112	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	So it does serve as an attractor, as one reason inflation moves back up toward 1.8 percent in the medium term and toward 2 percent in the longer run.	12	1
201504	1113	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	But, in addition, these other factors are important in getting there over the medium term.	12	1
201504	1114	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	All right.	12	1
201504	1115	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s helpful.	12	1
201504	1116	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That is different from the way I was remembering it.	12	1
201504	1117	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I thought that underlying inflation was pegged to your assessment of longer- term inflation expectations, and that they were still about 1¾ percent, but you’ve got a—	12	1
201504	1118	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	That’s right.	12	1
201504	1119	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I think that’s right.	12	1
201504	1120	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	But maybe I’m not quite getting your question.	12	1
201504	1121	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Over the longer run, we have those inflation expectations drifting up from 1¾ percent to 2 percent.	12	1
201504	1122	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Right.	12	1
201504	1123	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you.	12	1
201504	1124	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	12	1
201504	1125	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Yes, I want to compliment the staff on the new charts on uncertainty.	12	1
201504	1126	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I think they are very helpful in thinking about the uncertainty associated with the forecast.	12	1
201504	1127	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Now, going on from what President Evans was asking, maybe, the PCE inflation in Tealbook A, page 69—if I look at that, it looks, from the way the errors look on that forecast, like the staff has been underestimating PCE inflation.	12	1
201504	1128	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Should I interpret this as being that we have upside risk to the staff’s inflation forecast?	12	1
201504	1129	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Which chart are you looking at?	12	1
201504	1130	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The top one?	12	1
201504	1131	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I’m looking at PCE inflation.	12	1
201504	1132	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	That’s largely because of the energy price run-up in the mid-2000s.	12	1
201504	1133	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I think we didn’t project that, and I think that’s why the solid line, the median, is above the data there.	12	1
201504	1134	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	But even the distribution looks like—	12	1
201504	1135	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Yes.	12	1
201504	1136	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Again, I think that’s because of the energy price shock.	12	1
201504	1137	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	This is a relatively short sample with which we calculate standard errors around for PCE inflation, for two reasons.	12	1
201504	1138	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	One is, we don’t have data going back a long way, and two is, we think that this is a period over which inflation had different properties—it was more stable recently than in previous periods.	12	1
201504	1139	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	So, because of that, I think the influence of energy prices is more prominent here than it might be in the longer run.	12	1
201504	1140	2015-04-29	meeting	ENGEN	If I could add just one thing that amplifies that point, if you look in the middle right at core PCE, the median and the projected paths are virtually on top of each other, which is another way of showing that the total is being influenced by the run-up in energy prices and how it feeds into total inflation.	12	1
201504	1141	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you.	12	1
201504	1142	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	12	1
201504	1143	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.	12	1
201504	1144	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I wanted to follow up on President Evans’s line of questioning.	12	1
201504	1145	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	During the intermeeting period, President Rosengren suggested the possibility of raising the inflation target.	12	1
201504	1146	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If the FOMC were to introduce a new inflation target that was higher, would that have a higher gravitational pull in the staff’s model that we’d be pulled back to that higher target?	12	1
201504	1147	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In terms of modeling and the way we do it in the FRB/US model, I think the answer is “yes,” because we do have a small term that reflects the FOMC’s stated target relative to current underlying inflation.	12	1
201504	1148	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I think it would be gradual, but I think in the FRB/US model, it would be a stronger attractor than a 2 percent target.	12	1
201504	1149	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Also, if I used the Taylor rule, I think it would imply a much easier policy as well.	12	1
201504	1150	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s true, a different reaction function.	12	1
201504	1151	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thanks.	12	1
201504	1152	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	12	1
201504	1153	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	2	2
201504	1154	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suggest we take a break for 15 minutes to get some coffee.	2	2
201504	1155	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	When we return, we have a few people who would like to comment on financial stability, and then we’ll go to the economic round.	2	2
201504	1156	2015-04-29	meeting		[Coffee break]	2	2
201504	1157	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We now have an opportunity for people to comment on financial stability, and three people have indicated they would like to.	FS2	
201504	1158	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren, do you want to start us off?	FS2	
201504	1159	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201504	1160	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	When I talk to asset managers in Boston, the biggest concern raised is the problem of liquidity in the secondary market for corporate bonds.	FS2	
201504	1161	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	They worry that when we begin to raise rates, a rush to sell positions in corporate bonds will occur, and a crowded exit with few buyers could lead to a rapid increase in the yield on corporate bonds.	FS2	
201504	1162	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	At least some elements of this concern probably deserve greater attention.	FS2	
201504	1163	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, the average size of trades in corporate bonds has fallen significantly relative to the average size of trades prior to the financial crisis.	FS2	
201504	1164	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This may reflect an actual or perceived difficulty in transacting large trades due to weakened liquidity in the market.	FS2	
201504	1165	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This raises the concern that if a significant portfolio rebalancing were to occur, it may be difficult to sell large positions in a timely manner.	FS2	
201504	1166	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, there has been a significant decline in the corporate bond holdings of broker- dealers.	FS2	
201504	1167	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	According to the SEC’s FOCUS reports, while J.P.	FS2	
201504	1168	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Morgan held $29.5 billion in corporate securities in 2007, those holdings had plummeted to only $11.3 billion by the end of 2014.	FS2	
201504	1169	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, Credit Suisse held $30 billion in corporate securities in 2007, and their holdings collapsed to only $4.4 billion by the end of 2014.	FS2	
201504	1170	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Such sizable declines in corporate securities holdings among these key liquidity providers lends some credence to the concern about potential liquidity problems in this market.	FS2	
201504	1171	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, bond mutual funds—which were shown in the earlier charts on financial stability—and bond exchange-traded funds have grown significantly since the financial crisis.	FS2	
201504	1172	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The exchange-traded funds pose a particular problem if investors view them as highly liquid.	FS2	
201504	1173	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	At the end of 2008, assets under management at exchange-traded bond funds totaled $57 billion.	FS2	
201504	1174	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	By the end of February this year, assets under management at exchange-traded bond funds had soared to $320 billion.	FS2	
201504	1175	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If investors assume that the corporate bond market is liquid and, more specifically, that their exchange-traded fund shares will always be liquid, and if they choose to sell as we tighten, they may be surprised at the price at which they transact.	FS2	
201504	1176	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, the concerns with corporate bond market liquidity as we approach liftoff bear watching.	FS2	
201504	1177	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The degree of movement out of bonds is likely to be highly sensitive to the projected pace of tightening as well as to the timing of tightening.	FS2	
201504	1178	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	An oversized reaction in this market could result in a bumpy exit from the zero lower bound.	FS2	
201504	1179	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201504	1180	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201504	1181	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	May I ask Eric a question?	FS2	
201504	1182	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, sure.	FS2	
201504	1183	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Eric, can you take it a step further and say what the implications of your concerns are for policy?	FS2	
201504	1184	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Is it for monetary policy?	FS2	
201504	1185	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Are you advocating a relaxation of capital requirements?	FS2	
201504	1186	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	No, I am not advocating a relaxation of capital requirements.	FS2	
201504	1187	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I didn’t think so.	FS2	
201504	1188	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think it highlights that how we communicate around the time of liftoff actually is critically important for whether people decide that this is something they need to do—to rebalance their portfolios quite quickly.	FS2	
201504	1189	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I think the way that financial stability interacts with monetary policy is, it highlights that the communication issues become pretty important.	FS2	
201504	1190	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	That’s helpful.	FS2	
201504	1191	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thanks.	FS2	
201504	1192	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Also, if it happens, we can say we talked about it.	FS2	
201504	1193	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	All right.	FS2	
201504	1194	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	FS2	
201504	1195	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201504	1196	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to thank the staff for the excellent assessment of financial stability.	FS2	
201504	1197	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s my reading that the assessment again indicates that current policy has not produced any material signs of financial instability.	FS2	
201504	1198	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Indeed, it appears that the main financial-instability consideration for monetary policy at the moment is that a near- term increase in the target range for the federal funds rate could lead to financial instability.	FS2	
201504	1199	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As the report says, “Term premiums in benchmark US and other advanced economy bond yields are again near historical lows reached before the taper tantrum, raising the risk of similarly outsized market reactions at liftoff.”	FS2	
201504	1200	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The staff also identified a vulnerability that could propagate this shock from the increase in rates.	FS2	
201504	1201	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Specifically, page 4 of the assessment notes that changes in the structure of the Treasury market could amplify the effects of an initial rate move and lead to sudden swings in prices and liquidity.	FS2	
201504	1202	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, how can we best mitigate this risk?	FS2	
201504	1203	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	President Rosengren, I think, highlighted one way to think about this, which is through communication, but I have a slightly different perspective on the answer to this question.	FS2	
201504	1204	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	To answer this question, I think we have to understand why long-term rates might rise dramatically in response to a small increase in short- term rates.	FS2	
201504	1205	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And here I believe that a key consideration is the policy signal associated with such a move in the near term.	FS2	
201504	1206	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Raising the federal funds rate in the near term would mean they’re initiating liftoff when inflation is far below target and the growth outlook has been weakening.	FS2	
201504	1207	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Liftoff in such an environment would indicate that the FOMC is considerably less willing to provide accommodation to respond to adverse shocks than financial market participants currently anticipate.	FS2	
201504	1208	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As a result, they would expect less accommodation in general but especially so in bad times, and this expectation of higher interest rates and lower bond prices in bad times translates directly into higher term premiums.	FS2	
201504	1209	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, it’s tempting to conclude that we can somehow mitigate this potential financial instability only through reassuring verbal communication at the time of liftoff, but I think it’s difficult for words to trump the communication content of our actions.	FS2	
201504	1210	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So, in my view, we can best mitigate this financial stability risk by ensuring that our actions are always clearly connected to our pursued, declared objectives.	FS2	
201504	1211	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the current context, that would mean deferring liftoff until the economic data clearly indicate that raising interest rates is necessary for the FOMC to achieve its declared objectives of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment over the medium term.	FS2	
201504	1212	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll say more about what this conclusion means for our policy deliberations tomorrow.	FS2	
201504	1213	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	FS2	
201504	1214	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	FS2	
201504	1215	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	FS2	
201504	1216	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to pick up on the same topic that President Rosengren introduced and President Kocherlakota discussed.	FS2	
201504	1217	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	However, I will not be expressing my views on monetary policy at this time.	FS2	
201504	1218	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	FS2	
201504	1219	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think Governor Tarullo asked a great question: What do you do with this information?	FS2	
201504	1220	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to go a slightly different direction based on something Josh said, which I found very interesting.	FS2	
201504	1221	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I was struck by two sentences on page 17 of the QS report.	FS2	
201504	1222	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They are right after each other.	FS2	
201504	1223	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is that large banks’ liquidity ratios continue to improve.	FS2	
201504	1224	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The next sentence is basically that there is less liquidity in markets.	FS2	
201504	1225	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These two sentences are right next to each other, and immediately, when I read this, I said, “What’s the connection here?	FS2	
201504	1226	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To what extent is the liquidity requirements or the capital requirements, for that matter, affecting the willingness of broker-dealers to basically make markets and provide market liquidity, especially in a stressed environment?”	FS2	
201504	1227	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But it also led me to what Josh pointed out, which is that this is apparently a longer-term research project about market liquidity and understanding what’s happening there, and how much amplification we may see, whether it’s in corporate bond or Treasury bond markets, in response to shocks.	FS2	
201504	1228	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My comment is that I think this is a really important subject not just for thinking about our policy decisions or policy communication, but more generally, to understand what’s happening in those markets and understand to what extent it is changes in regulation, changes in technology, or other things.	FS2	
201504	1229	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Really, my comment is wanting to see more on that sooner, because I think this is a key issue, as others have mentioned.	FS2	
201504	1230	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	FS2	
201504	1231	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	FS2	
201504	1232	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Does anyone else want to comment?	FS2	
201504	1233	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	FS2	
201504	1234	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Seeing no hands, let us begin the economic go-round with President Mester.	13	1
201504	1235	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1236	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Fourth District economy continues to expand.	13	1
201504	1237	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In April, the diffusion index of business contacts reporting better versus worse conditions was 23 percent, up from 18 percent in March.	13	1
201504	1238	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Retail freight and both residential and commercial construction firms reported improved conditions.	13	1
201504	1239	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	All manufacturers and energy firms reported worse conditions.	13	1
201504	1240	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Anecdotal reports suggest some slowing in the pace of growth in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1241	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Factors cited by contacts reporting slower growth earlier this year include the harsh winter weather, spillovers from the West Coast port strikes, declining energy prices, and the appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201504	1242	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The effects of weather and the strike are transitory.	13	1
201504	1243	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Almost all of our contacts reported that the effects of the winter weather have now passed, although I should note that it snowed in Cleveland last week.	13	1
201504	1244	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The effects of the port strike are expected to dissipate by the fourth quarter.	13	1
201504	1245	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The fall in oil prices continues to challenge firms engaged in energy development or extraction as well as their suppliers, like steel producers.	13	1
201504	1246	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Suppliers of raw materials that use petroleum-based products report a falloff in orders as customers run down their inventories in anticipation of further price reductions.	13	1
201504	1247	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	My business contacts believe that oil prices have likely bottomed out, and that the effects of lower oil prices are likely to be temporary for most exposed sectors.	13	1
201504	1248	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, that remains to be seen.	13	1
201504	1249	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Conditions in District labor markets continue to follow national trends.	13	1
201504	1250	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The District’s unemployment rate, at 5.2 percent, is below the national rate of 5½ percent and below the 5.7 percent District average over the 2001–07 expansion.	13	1
201504	1251	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Contacts in all sectors except energy reported increasing staffing in the previous six to eight weeks, although, except for construction, the additions were somewhat smaller than previously reported.	13	1
201504	1252	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	So far, wage pressures remain limited to occupations such as trucking, skilled construction trades, and quantitative white collar jobs.	13	1
201504	1253	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Prices of finished goods continue to be stable despite more businesses reporting declining costs for nonlabor inputs.	13	1
201504	1254	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Turning to the national economy, we have received a number of disappointing data reports since our previous meeting across several sectors, including manufacturing, business fixed investment, and consumer spending, and including the employment report for March.	13	1
201504	1255	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	As was the case last year, there was very harsh winter weather, but this year we also had the port strike, the sharp drop in oil prices, and the sharp appreciation of the dollar.	13	1
201504	1256	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Similar to last year, we have seen a growth slowdown in the first quarter, and we are trying to extract the signal about future growth from the incoming data.	13	1
201504	1257	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	This is difficult to do in real time.	13	1
201504	1258	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	A good case can be made that this is a temporary setback, just as it was last year, and that is forecast in the Tealbook.	13	1
201504	1259	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The effects of bad weather and the West Coast port strike are transitory.	13	1
201504	1260	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Using a Bayesian VAR model augmented to include weather indicators, my staff estimates that the unusually cold weather reduced GDP growth by 0.9 percentage point, and there will be some rebound in the next couple of quarters.	13	1
201504	1261	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	We have seen the negative effects of lower oil prices on energy-related firms but not much positive effect on consumer spending, although that is likely to come, and oil prices appear to be stabilizing.	13	1
201504	1262	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Dollar appreciation has been a drag on exports and the profitability of firms with multinational operations.	13	1
201504	1263	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	But as the rate of appreciation slows, the drag can be expected to diminish as well.	13	1
201504	1264	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The slower growth seen in our trading partners might be a reflection of the slower growth in the United States.	13	1
201504	1265	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	If our growth picks up, it could be that theirs will as well.	13	1
201504	1266	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In addition, not all of the incoming data were negative.	13	1
201504	1267	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The rate of job openings reached another cyclical high, and initial claims are very low, just below the trough reached in the last economic expansion.	13	1
201504	1268	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	These indicators suggest that the weakness in payroll jobs in March could be temporary.	13	1
201504	1269	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Although the Conference Board’s consumer confidence measure was down in April, consumer sentiment came in high, and underlying fundamentals for consumer spending, including improved balance sheets, remain quite good.	13	1
201504	1270	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The news on inflation was also a bit better over the intermeeting period.	13	1
201504	1271	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Core inflation is modestly firming.	13	1
201504	1272	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Both headline CPI and core CPI increased 0.2 percent in March for the second month in a row, and core CPI inflation edged up to 1.8 percent on a year-over-year basis.	13	1
201504	1273	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Cleveland Fed’s median CPI measure, which helps predict headline inflation over the medium term, has remained near 2¼ percent since April of last year.	13	1
201504	1274	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Federal Reserve Bank ofCleveland’s measure of the 10-year expected inflation rate was essentially unchanged in April.	13	1
201504	1275	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	So this is the positive view of things.	13	1
201504	1276	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, there is also the possibility that the slower growth will be more persistent and inflation developments will worsen.	13	1
201504	1277	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I don’t believe we have enough information right now to reach a firm conclusion today, and we don’t have to.	13	1
201504	1278	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	We can remain agnostic until we see more data over the next couple of months.	13	1
201504	1279	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Incoming data will help us determine whether the slowdown in the first quarter is proving to be temporary, like it was last year, or whether it is pointing to something more fundamental.	13	1
201504	1280	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In particular, we are going to get two employment reports before our June meeting.	13	1
201504	1281	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	These are going to be quite important in my own thinking about the economic outlook.	13	1
201504	1282	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1283	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1284	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	13	1
201504	1285	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1286	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Recent economic data have had a distinctly weaker tone since our previous meeting.	13	1
201504	1287	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The March employment report indicated little overall improvement in labor markets, the unemployment rate was unchanged, and payroll employment growth was surprisingly weak.	13	1
201504	1288	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, wage and price data have yet to show a clear trend toward our 2 percent inflation goal.	13	1
201504	1289	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While some of the weakness can be attributed to the severe weather in some parts of the country, many of the higher-frequency data before and after the harsh winter weather have also been on the soft side.	13	1
201504	1290	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As a result, in my view, neither of the conditions for liftoff articulated in the March FOMC statement has been sufficiently met at this time.	13	1
201504	1291	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The March Summary of Economic Projections reflected some significant changes in longer-run variables.	13	1
201504	1292	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The central tendency of the longer-run unemployment rate has slipped from a range of 5.2 to 6 percent in June 2012 down to 5 to 5.2 percent in March.	13	1
201504	1293	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Similarly, participant estimates of the long-run equilibrium federal funds rate have declined.	13	1
201504	1294	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The central tendency in June 2012 ranged from 4 to 4½ percent, but now it is down to only 3½ to 3¾ percent.	13	1
201504	1295	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our assessment of these key variables has changed significantly, which, in retrospect, is not surprising, considering changes in demographics and productivity since the financial crisis.	13	1
201504	1296	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While I and many other participants have lowered our estimates of one of our dual mandate goals—the natural rate of unemployment—we have not engaged in any comprehensive discussion of our other goal, the inflation target.	13	1
201504	1297	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	That target has remained unchanged at 2 percent since it was adopted in 2012.	13	1
201504	1298	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We have learned a great deal about conducting monetary policy in a low-inflation environment since 2012.	13	1
201504	1299	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am fully aware that we should have a high threshold for changing our inflation target, as frequent changes would undermine its usefulness.	13	1
201504	1300	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the accumulated weight of economic experience suggests, in my view, that a reexamination of our inflation target is warranted for several reasons.	13	1
201504	1301	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	First, the choice of an inflation target was largely based on research both here and abroad, indicating that the likelihood of reaching the zero lower bound and the cost of being at the zero lower bound was small.	13	1
201504	1302	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This research suggested a relatively low probability of reaching the zero lower bound, typically below 5 percent, and relatively brief spells at the lower bound once reached, usually a couple of quarters.	13	1
201504	1303	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In part, this optimistic read could have been based on faith in the efficiency of alternative monetary policy tools.	13	1
201504	1304	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	However, the experience of the past decade has been less favorable.	13	1
201504	1305	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Today most major developed countries are at the zero lower bound, and, despite employing alternative policy tools, none has yet exited, even though we are now more than six years past the financial crisis.	13	1
201504	1306	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In short, the research on the expected cost of hitting the zero lower bound has not been consistent with the economic outcomes we have observed.	13	1
201504	1307	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Second, we have revised our assessment of variables that should affect the probability of hitting the zero lower bound.	13	1
201504	1308	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most obvious example is the lowering of the equilibrium federal funds rate.	13	1
201504	1309	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	With the same inflation target, a decline in the equilibrium federal funds rate should increase the probability of hitting the zero lower bound.	13	1
201504	1310	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The most recent SEP submissions, for example, report a decline in the equilibrium real rate of more than 50 basis points, and this assessment is echoed among private forecasters and market participants.	13	1
201504	1311	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If one of the rationales for setting a positive inflation target is to reduce the frequency of hitting the zero lower bound, a lower equilibrium real rate implies the need for a higher inflation target to reduce this probability.	13	1
201504	1312	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	On a practical note, the fact that Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe, and the United States have each hit the zero lower bound and have remained there for a very long time should make us wonder whether the global convergence to a value of 2 percent for the inflation target was misguided.	13	1
201504	1313	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Third, we have learned more about the cost of being at the zero lower bound.	13	1
201504	1314	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	After more than six years, we have still not returned to the 5 to 5.2 percent unemployment rate range that the SEP central tendency currently indicates is consistent with longer-run unemployment rates.	13	1
201504	1315	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	While the new tools of quantitative easing—purchasing mortgage-backed securities and lengthening the maturity of our holdings—have resulted in growth faster than we otherwise would have experienced, we have missed both elements of our mandate for more than six years now.	13	1
201504	1316	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This is not an acceptable outcome.	13	1
201504	1317	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The consequences of not being able to exit the zero lower bound more quickly have been a long period of underutilized resources and below-target inflation that risks eroding the credibility of the central bank.	13	1
201504	1318	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	A higher inflation target would surely have given us more room to lower real interest rates using our conventional policy tools, likely saving hundreds of thousands of jobs.	13	1
201504	1319	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Despite our willingness to alter other variables, we have not recently had a comprehensive review of our choice for the inflation target.	13	1
201504	1320	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In light of the accumulating evidence that inflation targets globally may have been set too low, this choice may have resulted in a great cost to the global economy in terms of lost economic output and employment.	13	1
201504	1321	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thus, we should have a fuller discussion of our choice for the inflation target before we set our longer- run strategies at the beginning of next year.	13	1
201504	1322	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition to the longer-run implications of the inflation goal for monetary policy, a higher inflation goal would have more immediate policy implications.	13	1
201504	1323	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Entertaining a higher inflation target would imply an even larger inflation shortfall, compelling us to wait even longer before lifting off.	13	1
201504	1324	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	A weaker version of this proposition suggests both that we should delay liftoff until we see clear evidence that inflation is increasing, and that we should be willing to entertain an inflation rate that exceeds our current target.	13	1
201504	1325	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	This strategy would, of course, be akin to price- level targeting, a notion that President Evans and others have previously discussed.	13	1
201504	1326	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In summary, we should recognize that the economy’s performance over the previous six years has a bearing not only on our estimates of full employment and the equilibrium federal funds rate, which many of us have adjusted in the SEP, but also on the inflation target.	13	1
201504	1327	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I understand the concern with shifting an inflation target that we set after years of deliberation and following years of success in bringing inflation down.	13	1
201504	1328	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But our failure to hit either of our mandated goals for six years and running demonstrates the potential cost of an inflation target that is too low.	13	1
201504	1329	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Recognizing the many complications that a change in the target would entail, I believe we should have a more fulsome discussion about what the previous decade of economic history has taught us about the optimal inflation rate.	13	1
201504	1330	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Should we be willing to entertain an increase in the inflation goal, this would, of course, have implications for the timing of liftoff, which we will be discussing tomorrow.	13	1
201504	1331	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1332	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201504	1333	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would like to ask President Rosengren a question.	13	1
201504	1334	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You are implying that the only margin for adjustment is on the inflation target rate.	13	1
201504	1335	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Presumably there is another margin for adjustment, taking a lot of steps to make a future financial crisis of the type that we experienced in 2007, 2008, and 2009 less likely, right?	13	1
201504	1336	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Because you could argue that one reason why we are in this position is because we had a really, really bad financial crisis.	13	1
201504	1337	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So, in principle, one could take steps to make the probability of a financial crisis lower, and that would presumably lessen the need to change the inflation target.	13	1
201504	1338	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	How do you think about that?	13	1
201504	1339	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If you think you can significantly change the probability or amplitude of those shocks, then you are right.	13	1
201504	1340	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	But the equilibrium federal funds rate has come down quite a bit.	13	1
201504	1341	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Our own internal estimates of what that implies for how frequently we will hit the zero lower bound are that it is substantially higher given that most of the time the equilibrium federal funds rate that many of those models were estimated on was 4½ percent.	13	1
201504	1342	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	We are now at 3½ percent—I actually think you could make an argument that it is lower than 3½ percent.	13	1
201504	1343	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	So if you have an equilibrium federal funds rate that is lower, the implication is that you hit the zero lower bound more frequently unless you think you can dramatically alter either the frequency or severity of having the kind of shocks that we experienced.	13	1
201504	1344	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Isn’t it the case that some of the steps we would take to reduce the odds of a financial crisis—strengthening capital and liquidity—may actually, by raising the cost of intermediation, lower the equilibrium real rate?	13	1
201504	1345	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, I think that’s right.	13	1
201504	1346	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But my point is just that the room you need depends on the size of the shocks that you are dealing with.	13	1
201504	1347	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And if you do other things and reduce the size of shocks, that also should be a factor.	13	1
201504	1348	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I don’t really disagree with a lot of the points that you made, but it seems to me that that’s not the only potential margin—	13	1
201504	1349	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	13	1
201504	1350	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I’d just raise one other countervailing argument that, certainly, the experience around October 15 of the very sharp movement in financial markets at a time when no real economic news was occurring makes me wonder—I am not convinced yet that all of the actions we have taken have necessarily, dramatically changed the probability or likely severity of shocks in the future from what we experienced before.	13	1
201504	1351	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In that shock, though, implications for the real economy were trivial.	13	1
201504	1352	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In that case.	13	1
201504	1353	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Madam Chair?	13	1
201504	1354	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201504	1355	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I appreciate your bringing this up, President Rosengren.	13	1
201504	1356	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Just one comment about your rhetoric on this.	13	1
201504	1357	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Missing the inflation target over six years—if you look at headline inflation year over year, it was above target in 2011 and 2012, and it came back down.	13	1
201504	1358	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I know you like to think in terms of core inflation, but I think this is an issue for that piece of the puzzle.	13	1
201504	1359	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	When you evaluate the Committee over that kind of a time frame, I think you have got to look at headline.	13	1
201504	1360	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Yes.	13	1
201504	1361	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I would say that hitting an inflation target temporarily because of an oil price shock is a Pyrrhic victory.	13	1
201504	1362	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	You care more about the underlying rate of inflation.	13	1
201504	1363	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	These are the prices people pay.	13	1
201504	1364	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201504	1365	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	No doubt we will return to this.	13	1
201504	1366	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	13	1
201504	1367	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Moving right along.	13	1
201504	1368	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1369	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Over the intermeeting cycle, my staff conducted 56 interviews separate from our board meetings.	13	1
201504	1370	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We focused the interviews on any indications in their businesses that would confirm the weakness indicated by first-quarter data and, more to the point, suggest that first-quarter weakness might persist.	13	1
201504	1371	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We found that overall business sentiment remains quite positive, somewhat at odds with our reading of the incoming data.	13	1
201504	1372	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	On balance, our contacts and directors portrayed demand as continuing to improve at a steady pace.	13	1
201504	1373	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We noted, however, that compared with the previous cycle, their optimism is accompanied by a hint of caution.	13	1
201504	1374	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We heard more reports of negative effects of the dollar.	13	1
201504	1375	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Exporters, port operators, and firms with significant foreign operations all noted market or other challenges that they attributed to the dollar.	13	1
201504	1376	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As expected, we heard reports of investment pullback and layoffs in oil and gas exploration and production firms as well as in oil services companies.	13	1
201504	1377	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	That drag is being partially offset by greater investment activity in business sectors benefiting from low energy prices.	13	1
201504	1378	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We also continued to hear reports that firms are trying to hold on to margin improvement coming from fuel and other commodity cost declines.	13	1
201504	1379	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Declines in gasoline prices have yet to translate into a meaningful boost in consumer spending.	13	1
201504	1380	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A director with knowledge of consumer markets commented that product categories that historically have been leading indicators of stronger consumer activity—to wit, apparel, eating outside the home, and movies—have not yet signaled an upturn.	13	1
201504	1381	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We received positive reports on real estate investment activity, both commercial and residential.	13	1
201504	1382	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Architects and contractors indicated improved pipelines.	13	1
201504	1383	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Our banking contacts report that new mortgage and investment activity is strong.	13	1
201504	1384	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Regarding employment, we heard continued concern about turnover and retention.	13	1
201504	1385	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	At the same time, we detected little change in reports this round regarding wage inflation.	13	1
201504	1386	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	On that subject, although most data indicate that the trend in nominal wage growth remains flat, a measure constructed by my staff from the Current Population Survey does show an acceleration in year-over-year wage growth in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1387	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Wage growth increased to a 3 percent pace in the first quarter, up from 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter and up from 2.4 percent a year earlier.	13	1
201504	1388	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Continuing on employment, I’ll mention something we heard for the first time from three large employers in quite different businesses.	13	1
201504	1389	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	All said they have begun shifting their work forces away from part time toward full time.	13	1
201504	1390	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	They all cited the high managerial and logistical cost and quality challenges of a large, part-time workforce.	13	1
201504	1391	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ve been struggling to reconcile these generally positive anecdotal reports with the hard data on the first quarter and early indications of second-quarter performance.	13	1
201504	1392	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Our tracking estimate of first-quarter GDP growth is just marginally above zero, at the low end of the spectrum presented in the Tealbook.	13	1
201504	1393	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Our tracking model is a straight statistical model with no judgmental overrides.	13	1
201504	1394	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We would not claim it’s the most accurate read of the first quarter, but it’s what the raw data are telling us, and we’ll have an official reading soon enough—tomorrow morning.	13	1
201504	1395	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	At this point, I’m holding to the view that weather and other factors played a significant role in first-quarter weakness, and that significant payback can be anticipated in the current quarter.	13	1
201504	1396	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We also observed—and this is nothing more than an observation—that weak first-quarter growth has been a pattern during the recovery, normally giving way to a stronger rest of the year.	13	1
201504	1397	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We’ve made a small adjustment to our full-year GDP growth forecast to reflect a weaker first quarter, but otherwise we have kept our forecast for growth and inflation unchanged from the March meeting.	13	1
201504	1398	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We made no material change to our outlook.	13	1
201504	1399	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We have growth resuming a run rate between 2½ and 3 percent, with second-quarter growth above 3 percent.	13	1
201504	1400	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	A strengthening of consumer activity from the first quarter is a key factor in our outlook.	13	1
201504	1401	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	We currently judge the risk to our growth and inflation outlooks as tilted to the downside.	13	1
201504	1402	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	With the greater uncertainty I perceive at this juncture, the Tealbook alternative scenario titled “Persistent Slowdown in Economic Activity” captures my concern that my outlook may be overly optimistic.	13	1
201504	1403	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1404	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1405	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	13	1
201504	1406	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1407	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As many have already noted, the recent data have been disappointing, but it is worth noting, as President Lockhart just did, that over the past four years, first-quarter GDP growth has averaged more than 2 percentage points lower than growth during the rest of the year, and there is no single smoking gun that can explain this string of seasonal aberrations.	13	1
201504	1408	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Each year, the winter slowdowns have proved to be temporary.	13	1
201504	1409	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, if past is prologue, I expect the same pattern will occur this year, with an anemic Q1 followed by above-trend growth for the rest of 2015.	13	1
201504	1410	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m confident that the underlying momentum in the economy once again will be more apparent as the first quarter fades in our rearview mirror.	13	1
201504	1411	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is consistent with what I’ve been hearing from my business contacts.	13	1
201504	1412	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In particular, the fundamentals of the economy remain quite positive.	13	1
201504	1413	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Solid job growth should lift income and consumer confidence further, helping to pave the way for continued consumption growth.	13	1
201504	1414	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, highly accommodative monetary policy will continue to boost spending, and these factors are very evident in my District.	13	1
201504	1415	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In fact, some sectors of the economy, the 12th District economy, are red hot.	13	1
201504	1416	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	An executive in the tech sector recently mentioned that to retain talent, some tech firms are now offering 20 percent or more pay raises.	13	1
201504	1417	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And if that wasn’t enough, they’re also throwing in housing for good measure, and in the Bay Area, housing is something that is very hard to come by and obviously very dear.	13	1
201504	1418	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The other thing that we heard was that you can be vested in stock options after one month.	13	1
201504	1419	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So this is an amazing time in the Silicon Valley economy, and about half of my staff ran off to apply for jobs.	13	1
201504	1420	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, I will mention that some of my contacts in different sectors, including commercial real estate, have emphasized the abundance of financing that can be obtained at very generous terms.	13	1
201504	1421	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s an issue that I noticed was highlighted in both the SLOOS and the QS reports, and we’re hearing about that in our District, too.	13	1
201504	1422	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Of course, continued low inflation remains a key issue.	13	1
201504	1423	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I view the recent low inflation readings as being consistent with an economy still operating below potential and facing temporary disinflationary factors.	13	1
201504	1424	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Important questions remain.	13	1
201504	1425	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the remainder of my remarks, I’ll focus on two of these issues.	13	1
201504	1426	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The first is, what signal should we be taking from the market-implied measures of inflation compensation?	13	1
201504	1427	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, second, what’s the empirical relationship between wage growth and inflation?	13	1
201504	1428	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The softness in inflation of late would be a lot more troublesome to me if it was also accompanied by a clear decline in inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1429	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This kind of scenario is discussed in the Tealbook alternative scenario simulation.	13	1
201504	1430	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But so far, the weight of evidence suggests that this isn’t happening.	13	1
201504	1431	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Long-run survey expectations from households and professional forecasters remain well anchored.	13	1
201504	1432	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In addition, as I pointed out in the past, long-run inflation expectations implied by a Phillips curve model estimated over the past 15 years, a period during which our credibility was firmly established, were also well anchored at 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1433	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, of course, the one discordant note comes from the market-implied measures of inflation compensation.	13	1
201504	1434	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Inflation compensation has fallen significantly since the middle of last year, and while much of the focus has been on longer-horizon measures, there’s also a question about what signal we should take about the nearer-term inflation outlook.	13	1
201504	1435	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff looked at this question, and they conducted a forecasting comparison between measures of inflation compensation and five other competing forecasts, among them a random walk forecast and also the survey from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.	13	1
201504	1436	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We wanted to avoid liquidity issues that are associated with shorter-term TIPS, so they looked at inflation compensation derived from inflation swap rates.	13	1
201504	1437	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These typically move very closely together with inflation compensation derived from the Treasury market, but are based on trading in a deeper market.	13	1
201504	1438	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Here we’re looking at one- and two-year-ahead inflation forecasts for headline CPI inflation.	13	1
201504	1439	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The striking result, which is very robust in all of their experiments, is that forecasts based on inflation compensation were the worst performers of all the measures.	13	1
201504	1440	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Basically, inflation compensation did not give useful information about where inflation was going relative to survey forecasts.	13	1
201504	1441	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So, really, looking at inflation compensation for insights into the future path of inflation is not supported by the data.	13	1
201504	1442	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One problem with our analysis is that data limitations preclude doing a similar exercise for long-term inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1443	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that the results we have for one- and two-year inflation compensation not being a useful predictor for future inflation will apply also to longer-term inflation.	13	1
201504	1444	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We don’t have that much data right now, but in five years when the transcript comes out, we’ll see whether I was right or wrong.	13	1
201504	1445	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ll wait for that.	13	1
201504	1446	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Again, President Kocherlakota has highlighted the fact—in a memo that he co- authored—that inflation compensation is not a reliable forecast for inflation because it reflects other aspects of risk associated with different inflation outcomes.	13	1
201504	1447	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But I want to mention another interesting finding in our work about inflation compensation, and that is that these one- and two- year-ahead inflation compensation measures are very highly correlated with recent past inflation, especially with past inflation associated with movements in oil prices.	13	1
201504	1448	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That puts into question how to interpret this.	13	1
201504	1449	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It is a very similar result that we’ve found in the past when we looked at household surveys.	13	1
201504	1450	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Household surveys of inflation expectations tend to be very sensitive to lagged inflation, especially with regard to oil price movements, and for this reason we have tended to discount movements in household inflation expectations when the movements are driven by energy prices.	13	1
201504	1451	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My staff suggests using a similar caution when trying to interpret inflation compensation measures as an indicator of people’s views on future inflation.	13	1
201504	1452	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second issue I’ll discuss briefly is that of nominal wage growth.	13	1
201504	1453	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As has already been mentioned, wage growth has been stuck around 2 percent for most of the recovery.	13	1
201504	1454	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And, as economic theory would tell us, employee compensation makes up a huge fraction of a firm’s costs.	13	1
201504	1455	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	You would expect there to be a pretty tight relationship between nominal wage growth and price inflation, but this connection has been remarkably hard to find.	13	1
201504	1456	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Many papers and research projects have looked at this, and, basically, if you look back at the history of the literature, in every business cycle there’s a whole bunch of papers written about the relationship of nominal wage growth and price inflation.	13	1
201504	1457	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The consistent finding through this literature is that it’s really hard to find any relationship between nominal wage growth and future price inflation.	13	1
201504	1458	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Recent research by Jim Stock and Mark Watson, and also some really nice work done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and elsewhere, has shown that the additional information on wages or labor compensation has done little to improve the accuracy of standard inflation forecast models.	13	1
201504	1459	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My understanding is that the staff’s inflation forecasting models tend to be these price‒price Phillips curve models or models that don’t really emphasize nominal wage growth.	13	1
201504	1460	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The lack of a close empirical link between nominal wage growth and future inflation likely reflects several factors that have affected labor markets in recent decades—some of which I’ve talked about in the past.	13	1
201504	1461	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	One is that nominal wage growth is probably being held down by rigidities in wage setting that kept wages from falling during the downturn and have been restraining wage growth as the economy improves—that is, there is downward nominal wage rigidity.	13	1
201504	1462	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second is that globalization, changes in unionization, and changes in technology have affected the share of productivity gains that are going to workers, and that distorts the relationship between wage growth and price inflation.	13	1
201504	1463	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Put another way, the labor share of income has fallen dramatically since the 1980s.	13	1
201504	1464	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	To summarize, based on the evidence accumulated over the past several decades of extensive research on this topic, there’s little or no information to suggest that aggregate wage data should inform our medium-term inflation outlook.	13	1
201504	1465	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now I’m going to break my rule that I stated earlier—I do not view a rise in nominal wage growth as a necessary condition to be confident in the return of inflation to 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1466	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	All told, our current low inflation rates, I think, are pretty easy to understand in the context of transitory factors—import prices, energy prices— and the fact that there is still some considerable slack in the labor market.	13	1
201504	1467	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As the labor market moves back to maximum employment, and as these transitory factors dissipate, I expect inflation to move back to 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1468	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	President Bullard mentioned 2011.	13	1
201504	1469	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think we should learn a lesson from that.	13	1
201504	1470	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We did see inflation rise quite a bit as a result of a rise in some special factors.	13	1
201504	1471	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We were experiencing high inflationary pressures due to large increases in the price of oil and other import prices, and what we did then, I think, is the right thing.	13	1
201504	1472	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We looked past the transitory effects of those and looked more broadly at the long-term inflation outlook, and that is how I am viewing it, too.	13	1
201504	1473	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1474	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1475	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	13	1
201504	1476	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Could I ask an information question?	13	1
201504	1477	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The research that you mentioned is very interesting, but I am not sure I followed the details.	13	1
201504	1478	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The inflation compensation measures were one- to two-year horizon expectations—and you also had survey measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1479	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The horse race was basically this:  We aligned the inflation swap rate one year ahead with the swaps of months 13 to 24 ahead—one year ahead with one year ahead.	13	1
201504	1480	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	And then we looked at the Survey of Professional Forecasters and Blue Chip for each year.	13	1
201504	1481	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	At the same horizons?	13	1
201504	1482	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Same horizons.	13	1
201504	1483	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I see, and those were helpful?	13	1
201504	1484	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Because, if I understand some of the Board work, they use these long-term inflation expectations for their modeling because, as attractive as it is theoretically to use a short-term expectation, nobody can find a good measure of short-term inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1485	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Isn’t that right, Bill?	13	1
201504	1486	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	We use the longer-term inflation expectations in our models.	13	1
201504	1487	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	That’s right.	13	1
201504	1488	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, but the question I’m asking is:  What do you think inflation is going to be over the next four quarters?	13	1
201504	1489	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The SPF is actually a very good forecast.	13	1
201504	1490	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is roughly as good as the Tealbook.	13	1
201504	1491	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s asking what inflation is going to be over the next—	13	1
201504	1492	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Well, but the Tealbook won’t use any short-term inflation measures, that’s my understanding.	13	1
201504	1493	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, no, no.	13	1
201504	1494	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m just looking at the forecast itself.	13	1
201504	1495	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Oh, yes, but those forecasts are lousy.	13	1
201504	1496	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	They might be better than the other ones, but they’re all lousy.	13	1
201504	1497	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Well, I think the research says that the Tealbook is maybe a little bit better than the SPF and Blue Chip over the next year or two—	13	1
201504	1498	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Just in terms of forecasting?	13	1
201504	1499	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	There’s probably not much difference.	13	1
201504	1500	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So it’s basically the same.	13	1
201504	1501	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The Tealbook does something which is not in line with theory, to use long-term inflation expectations for a one-year-ahead inflation because, well, it kind of works, right?	13	1
201504	1502	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Yes, we view the anchoring of inflation expectations as best approximated by long-term survey measures of inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1503	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Yes, that’s why I was asking the question about whether I understood you right, you’ve currently got it anchored at 1¾ percent and are hoping to goes up to 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1504	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Right.	13	1
201504	1505	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But at any rate, I’m done.	13	1
201504	1506	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Well, I mean, it’s interesting.	13	1
201504	1507	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I appreciate that.	13	1
201504	1508	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Please proceed.	13	1
201504	1509	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Okay.	13	1
201504	1510	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1511	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	For the most part, my directors and business contacts expect that the recent spate of soft economic readings will be short-lived.	13	1
201504	1512	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The one report that seems to sum it up the best came from the chairman of Manpower who, when talking about soft first-quarter numbers, said none of his clients are getting depressed about it.	13	1
201504	1513	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The view seems to be that there is enough momentum from last year that growth should pick up soon.	13	1
201504	1514	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Separately, I didn’t hear of any meaningful reports of wage or price pressures from my contacts.	13	1
201504	1515	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	My own outlook for the real economy continues to be for real GDP growth to run between 2½ and 3 percent over the remainder of this year and next.	13	1
201504	1516	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Our assumptions for potential output growth are somewhat stronger than in the Tealbook, so our GDP path translates into a very similar reduction in resource gaps as the Tealbook’s.	13	1
201504	1517	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	By the end of 2016, we have the unemployment rate down to around 5 percent, which is my current assessment of the natural rate.	13	1
201504	1518	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	My inflation forecast has not changed.	13	1
201504	1519	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Like the Tealbook, I do not see inflation reaching target until sometime in 2018 or 2019.	13	1
201504	1520	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I should again point out that my assessment of appropriate monetary policy underlying this forecast has lower rates than most people around the table.	13	1
201504	1521	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Now, I want to spend some time today talking about why this outlook leads me to favor a whites-of-their-eyes approach for our policy response to rising inflation.	13	1
201504	1522	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I have talked about risk management many times before.	13	1
201504	1523	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Today I want to articulate three additional reasons the data lead me to prefer a cautious approach to raising rates.	13	1
201504	1524	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	First, forecasting inflation is inherently difficult, and that’s the discussion that we were just having.	13	1
201504	1525	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	This implies a high burden of proof to say we are sufficiently confident that our currently low core inflation will move back to 2 percent in a reasonable period of time.	13	1
201504	1526	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Second, despite near-zero nominal rates and a large balance sheet, I am not convinced our current policy stance is all that accommodative to begin with.	13	1
201504	1527	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	And, third, I actually see benefits to risking a modest overshooting of our 2 percent inflation target.	13	1
201504	1528	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me start with why it should take strong evidence to have confidence in an outlook of low inflation rising back to 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1529	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Anyone who has looked at the forecasting performance of statistical inflation models knows that everyone’s abilities in this area are limited.	13	1
201504	1530	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, there is a body of research that shows it is not that easy to be a random walk forecast.	13	1
201504	1531	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Even the best- performing models seldom forecast a rapid change in inflation, and they always imply substantial forecast uncertainty.	13	1
201504	1532	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That said, we do have many analytical reasons to think our current low inflation will rise at some point.	13	1
201504	1533	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Most of the commentary I hear at this table centers on the economy regaining traction, resource gaps closing, and the upward gravitational pull of high and stable inflation expectations, like in the Tealbook forecast.	13	1
201504	1534	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I also suspect that simple mean reversion probably plays a role in these forecasts as well.	13	1
201504	1535	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I agree that these forces will eventually deliver.	13	1
201504	1536	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The question is, when?	13	1
201504	1537	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Taking until 2019 to reach our target is not acceptable to me.	13	1
201504	1538	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Given all of these difficulties in forecasting inflation, my own preferred dashboard of indicators is mostly a list of factors coincident with rising inflation.	13	1
201504	1539	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	While measures of labor market slack are important, I would not rely on them alone, as it is possible something has changed in the structure of the economy that makes those historical benchmarks less trustworthy.	13	1
201504	1540	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	In addition, I will continue to look for increasing core inflation, faster wage growth, and firmer market-based measures of inflation compensation to provide corroborating evidence of stronger inflationary pressures.	13	1
201504	1541	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	As I said, the absence of statistically strong leading indicators suggests that these observations are likely to be more coincident than predictive.	13	1
201504	1542	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But at least once we see them, we can have more confidence that inflation is moving up persistently.	13	1
201504	1543	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Until then, I remain wary.	13	1
201504	1544	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Now, my second point—that current policy is not as accommodative as we might think— comes out of the model analysis.	13	1
201504	1545	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	A fundamental benchmark for thinking about the level of monetary accommodation and inflation pressures is the difference between the actual real rate of interest and the equilibrium, or Wicksellian, real rate of interest.	13	1
201504	1546	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	As Milton Friedman said, low interest rates alone do not mean monetary policy is accommodative.	13	1
201504	1547	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The relevant question is whether, after adjusting for inflation, our current real federal funds rate is far enough below the equilibrium real rate to achieve our policy objectives in a reasonable amount of time—that is, for inflation to actually get up to 2 percent, as the forecasts embody.	13	1
201504	1548	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I think the answer to that question is “no.”	13	1
201504	1549	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	There are a number of simple observations that suggest that the current equilibrium rate is quite low.	13	1
201504	1550	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Namely, even with our interest rate and balance sheet policies in place, we still see the continued existence of resource gaps, a lack of any meaningful upward movement in inflation, and relatively low levels of capital spending despite piles of cash on corporate balance sheets.	13	1
201504	1551	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	These cash stockpiles are an indication that expected real returns on physical investment are not very high.	13	1
201504	1552	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	To put a number out, the Tealbook-consistent equilibrium real rate shown in Book B, as circulated over the weekend, is negative 0.1 percent.	13	1
201504	1553	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Some might look at the current real funds rate of minus 1.18 percent, as reported in the Tealbook, Book B, and say we have adequate accommodation in place.	13	1
201504	1554	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t agree.	13	1
201504	1555	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Recall that the Tealbook’s equilibrium real rate is calibrated to close the output gap in 12 quarters.	13	1
201504	1556	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	It says nothing about inflation.	13	1
201504	1557	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	In the Tealbook baseline, the inflation gap is still with us until 2019.	13	1
201504	1558	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That would mean that inflation would have to run below target for more than a decade and, to me, that is simply too long to be considered the result of appropriate policy.	13	1
201504	1559	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I want to mention that President Bullard referred to the fact that PCE inflation rose to 2 percent in 2011 and 2012 on the strength of commodity price increases.	13	1
201504	1560	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I think the reason we focus on core inflation is that core is a better indicator of what inflation is likely to be next year, because the shocks in headline PCE often are transitory.	13	1
201504	1561	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The real test, I would say, is, when did the Tealbook ever forecast inflation two years out as being at 2 percent or above?	13	1
201504	1562	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I think that has not been the case for quite some time.	13	1
201504	1563	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	While we can all lament the fact that there are large uncertainties regarding the value of the equilibrium real rate of interest, uncertainty over inflation forecasting and the stance of monetary policy accommodation go hand in hand.	13	1
201504	1564	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Logically, because the equilibrium rate has a strong bearing on the inflation outlook, uncertainty over it ought to translate into comparable uncertainty over inflation itself.	13	1
201504	1565	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	In other words, how can we declare we are confident that current low inflation is headed back up to 2 percent unless we are also confident that our policy setting relative to the equilibrium real rate is able to return inflation to target?	13	1
201504	1566	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	This brings me to the third reason my outlook is premised on a whites-of-their-eyes policy approach.	13	1
201504	1567	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I recognize that the usual policy lags might mean that a delay in tightening could cause inflation to modestly overshoot 2 percent sometime down the road.	13	1
201504	1568	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But so what?	13	1
201504	1569	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Is that such a big cost?	13	1
201504	1570	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	No.	13	1
201504	1571	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	On the contrary, it could be a benefit.	13	1
201504	1572	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Considering how long inflation has been below target, adopting a policy that allows the possibility of such an overshoot actually seems necessary to support the credibility of our symmetric inflation objective.	13	1
201504	1573	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	If we find ourselves with the federal funds rate at 1 percent or a little bit above that while inflation is still too low, we could easily regret the conservative credibility that we’ve built up.	13	1
201504	1574	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I would also say that if we are not willing to allow an overshoot of our inflation objective, then I think we should definitely be having the conversation that President Rosengren was suggesting we have in terms of the appropriateness of the level of the inflation objective, if it is something that we are not allowed to overshoot with any reasonability.	13	1
201504	1575	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I think that’s important.	13	1
201504	1576	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1577	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1578	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	13	1
201504	1579	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	And now for something completely different.	13	1
201504	1580	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1581	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The Texas economy has decelerated since I last reported to the Committee.	13	1
201504	1582	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Continued low oil prices, the strong dollar, and a weaker national economy pushed state employment down by almost 12,000 jobs in March, the first decline in 40 months.	13	1
201504	1583	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Over the first three months of the year, combined job growth averaged a positive but still dismal 0.7 percent, down from 4.2 percent during the fall of 2014.	13	1
201504	1584	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our forecast for December-over-December job growth, which is derived from the Texas Leading Index, now stands at 0.5 percent.	13	1
201504	1585	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That’s down from a forecast of 1 to 2 percent growth six months ago.	13	1
201504	1586	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Besides oil and gas, the manufacturing sector has seen the greatest slowing.	13	1
201504	1587	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Companies in the computer and electronics industry say that they are losing opportunities as the appreciating dollar pushes up the relative price of US-made capital equipment.	13	1
201504	1588	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Chemical producers report lower selling prices and margins and lower exports.	13	1
201504	1589	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Producers of primary metals have noted increasing import competition, too.	13	1
201504	1590	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Companies in the professional and business services industry have been indirectly affected by both low energy prices and the strong dollar, particularly those with a significant fraction of their clientele in the energy and manufacturing sectors.	13	1
201504	1591	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	There have been some reports of adverse spillovers from energy to financial services as well.	13	1
201504	1592	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our most up-to-date information comes from our Texas Manufacturing and Service Sector Outlook Surveys.	13	1
201504	1593	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The latest manufacturing survey results, released only yesterday, show production declining in April for the second straight month—the first consecutive two-month decline since the recession.	13	1
201504	1594	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The New Orders Index, too, has registered its worst two-month performance since the recession, posting readings of minus 16.1 and minus 14.0 in March and April, respectively.	13	1
201504	1595	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In contrast, our latest service sector survey results, released this morning, show the headline revenue index rising to 14.6 in April from 10.7 in March.	13	1
201504	1596	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	April’s reading is the highest reported so far this year, but it is considerably lower than levels reported through most of 2014.	13	1
201504	1597	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Despite slower job growth, the Texas unemployment rate continues to fall, and at 4.2 percent in March, it reached its lowest level since July 2007.	13	1
201504	1598	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We have anecdotal reports of laid-off energy workers shifting into construction, especially along the Gulf Coast, where skilled construction workers remain in short supply.	13	1
201504	1599	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The wage and benefit indexes from our manufacturing and service sector surveys indicate that upward wage pressures are somewhat less intense than they were last year.	13	1
201504	1600	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Looking ahead, health-care contacts are concerned about losing experienced workers in a coming wave of retirements.	13	1
201504	1601	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In finance, our bankers report flat demand and unchanged standards across all major loan categories.	13	1
201504	1602	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Oil prices have moved irregularly upward since last month’s FOMC meeting, with WTI closing some of the gap with Brent.	13	1
201504	1603	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Year-to-date volatility has been driven by conflicting supply developments, including unexpected increases in OPEC output—namely, Saudi Arabia’s production was up 4 percent in March—inventory buildups in the United States, and reports of slower growth in US oil production.	13	1
201504	1604	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	If the Iran negotiations successfully conclude in June, that country could ramp up its output by more than 700,000 barrels per day—0.7 percentage point of world supply—by the end of 2016, which would be enough to lower the price of crude between $5 and $15 per barrel in 2016, all else staying constant.	13	1
201504	1605	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The conflict in Yemen is another source of uncertainty.	13	1
201504	1606	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Yemen itself is a negligible producer of crude oil.	13	1
201504	1607	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, the threat of wider conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and Yemen’s proximity to the fourth-busiest chokepoint for crude oil flows in the world, have created fears of supply disruptions.	13	1
201504	1608	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Our energy industry contacts tell us that the number of drilled but uncompleted wells, or DUCs, has increased between 33 and 50 percent since the end of last year.	13	1
201504	1609	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	These are wells that have been drilled but are kept out of production.	13	1
201504	1610	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	They are underground inventory.	13	1
201504	1611	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	New capital projects are difficult to initiate, but spending continues on existing contracts.	13	1
201504	1612	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	US oil production is expected to peak within the next two to three months.	13	1
201504	1613	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We are also likely to hit above-ground storage constraints within that time frame.	13	1
201504	1614	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Drilling costs are down 20 percent, partly as a result of real efficiency gains and partly as a result of cheaper labor and equipment.	13	1
201504	1615	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	There is cautious optimism that the worst is over, coupled with recognition that we’re unlikely to see a return to $100-per-barrel oil any time soon.	13	1
201504	1616	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Repercussions and adjustments in the broader Texas economy are ongoing.	13	1
201504	1617	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We are a bit more sanguine about the national economic outlook today than we were a couple of meetings ago.	13	1
201504	1618	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	It appears considerably less likely now that we will blow through full employment at full throttle.	13	1
201504	1619	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	That revised assessment is based on predictions from a small suite of models we use to forecast real activity two to four quarters out.	13	1
201504	1620	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Although each model relies on its own set of financial and policy indicators, all are now telling a consistent story:  solid if unspectacular GDP growth, on average, in the second and third quarters of 2015 and a gradual deceleration in employment growth over the course of the year, with the unemployment rate leveling off in the neighborhood of 5 percent heading into 2016.	13	1
201504	1621	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We expect trimmed mean PCE inflation, our measure of the underlying trend in headline inflation, to average about 1¾ percent over the next four quarters.	13	1
201504	1622	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	As compared with the Tealbook, we are more optimistic on both halves of the dual mandate, but we’re certainly not only in the same ballpark as the Tealbook, but in the same outfield.	13	1
201504	1623	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Hopefully, it’s not left field.	13	1
201504	1624	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Although we are looking forward to tomorrow’s GDP report, we don’t expect to take a strong signal from it, whatever the number turns out to be.	13	1
201504	1625	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	The first estimate relies on a lot of guesswork, and in any case, GDP growth is volatile from quarter to quarter.	13	1
201504	1626	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	As a result, we’ve not found real-time estimates of lagged GDP growth to be especially helpful for forecasting at the horizons that are of interest to us.	13	1
201504	1627	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1628	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1629	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	13	1
201504	1630	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1631	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Data on economic conditions in the Eighth District have improved notably during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201504	1632	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The pace of job creation was revised up for 2014, and preliminary data for 2015 has generally been positive.	13	1
201504	1633	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The District unemployment rate continues to decline and stands at 5.7 percent today, according to the most recent reading—only slightly higher than the national rate.	13	1
201504	1634	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	According to the revised BLS data, District job creation occurred at about twice the pace in 2014 as compared with 2013, which was itself revised higher.	13	1
201504	1635	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	One of the largest revisions was in the Louisville MSA which was revised from an original estimated value of 2.3 percent growth to an updated value of 3.8 percent.	13	1
201504	1636	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	By sector, notable upward revisions occurred in transportation, manufacturing, and professional and business services.	13	1
201504	1637	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Correspondingly, Louisville’s average hourly earnings growth is significantly faster than the national average.	13	1
201504	1638	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On the downside, one of the most notable developments in the local labor market was the announcement by US Steel that they would temporarily idle their Granite City, Illinois, plant, laying off over 2,000 employees effective in May.	13	1
201504	1639	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Media reports suggest that the layoffs are due, in part, to a rise in imports of relatively inexpensive Chinese steel—steel that, evidently, the Chinese do not need in their home market.	13	1
201504	1640	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On this dimension, my recent intermeeting visit to China, combined with discussions with CEOs and my interpretation of some hard data, has suggested to me that trend growth in China may be notably slower than commonly appreciated.	13	1
201504	1641	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think this goes beyond the relatively weak reported growth rate in the first quarter to a trend rate of growth as low as 4½ percent.	13	1
201504	1642	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Chinese GDP statistics are notably opaque—a topic of macroeconomic discussion for the past 15 years or more—but corroborating data and anecdotes now seem to be diverging more sharply from official reports, suggesting that a Chinese slowdown is to be taken far more seriously this time.	13	1
201504	1643	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The proximate cause of the slowdown is likely the ongoing anticorruption campaign, which is reportedly casting a very wide net and is likely creating a chilling effect on new business formation and business expansion.	13	1
201504	1644	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Turning to the national outlook, I have five main areas for comments on the current narrative for the United States, as reported in the Tealbook, FOMC speeches, and popular commentary.	13	1
201504	1645	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The comments are in the following areas:  one, potential over-interpretation of the Q1 slowdown; two, an unemployment forecast that I think is not credible; three, assumptions about r* that may be suspect; four, over-interpretation of the likely effects of the value of the dollar on US growth prospects; and, five, underappreciation of the risks of asset price bubbles during the next two to three years as rates remain exceptionally low.	13	1
201504	1646	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to comment on the first three of these today.	13	1
201504	1647	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m not commenting directly on inflation because I think the situation in that dimension has not changed greatly during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201504	1648	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I continue to expect inflation to return to target and eventually overshoot 2 percent in 2016.	13	1
201504	1649	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On the first issue, potential over-interpretation of the Q1 slowdown, data are clearly weaker on a tracking basis since our previous meeting.	13	1
201504	1650	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	GDP will be reported tomorrow morning, and the staff has penciled in an estimate close to zero.	13	1
201504	1651	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	But suppose we take the median of the nowcasting table reported in the Tealbook, which is an approximately 1½ percent annual growth rate of GDP in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1652	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On that basis, the year-over-year growth rate would be 3.3 percent.	13	1
201504	1653	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think this number gives a better sense of the underlying pace of growth in the US economy and provides a better point of reference for shaping GDP expectations for the remainder of this year.	13	1
201504	1654	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	In addition, I think that seasonal factors for Q1 are being called into question.	13	1
201504	1655	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We considered Q1 GDP growth averages versus averages for Q2 through Q4 over different time periods, excluding recessions, since the mid-1990s.	13	1
201504	1656	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Average Q1 real GDP growth has been notably lower in these subperiods.	13	1
201504	1657	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This broad-brush analysis suggests that low Q1 growth rates are not occurring by accident, and that Q1 seasonals may need revamping.	13	1
201504	1658	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The second issue is unemployment projections balancing out at about 5 percent over the forecast horizon despite easy monetary policy, by conventional definition.	13	1
201504	1659	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do not think that such a forecast is credible, and I continue to disagree with the labor force participation assumption behind it.	13	1
201504	1660	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	A key paper in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity—by Aaronson and others, published in 2014—suggests that labor force participation has been dropping according to demographic factors since 2000, and, furthermore, that this downward trend will continue through the forecast horizon.	13	1
201504	1661	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This suggests that, on balance, there will be no sustained upward improvement in labor force participation and, therefore, that unemployment will continue to drop into the 4½ to 4 percent range over the forecast horizon, barring any major disruption in the US economy.	13	1
201504	1662	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This dynamic would be very similar to what was observed during the 1990s expansion and again during the 2000 expansion.	13	1
201504	1663	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On both of those occasions, unemployment moved into the low 4 percent range.	13	1
201504	1664	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Previous staff predictions in this area have emphasized increases in labor force participation but have turned out to be wrong.	13	1
201504	1665	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Indeed, the predictions given in the Summary of Economic Projections have also relied, in part, on this story and have also been wrong.	13	1
201504	1666	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The median SEP forecast as of September 2012 for unemployment at the end of 2014 was too high by more than 1 percentage point.	13	1
201504	1667	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The same was true of the median SEP September 2013 forecast for unemployment.	13	1
201504	1668	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So what’s the bottom line?	13	1
201504	1669	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’re charting a course for very low interest rate monetary policy based on an unrealistic assessment of future labor market performance, and this will harm FOMC policymaking in the quarters and years ahead.	13	1
201504	1670	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We can, of course, cite other labor market indicators and thereby bring to bear more information on overall labor market performance.	13	1
201504	1671	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Board of Governors’ labor market conditions index does exactly this, conveniently summarizing information on many different dimensions of labor market performance.	13	1
201504	1672	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis calculated that the value of this index is comfortably above its long-run average since 1986.	13	1
201504	1673	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This indicates that, based on the totality of available information, labor markets are not weak but instead are relatively strong viewed in historical perspective.	13	1
201504	1674	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I like this index because it brings all information together in one place and avoids cherry-picking particular indicators that may or may not be indicative of overall labor market performance.	13	1
201504	1675	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The third issue is r*.	13	1
201504	1676	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Some commentary has suggested that an r* parameter in a Taylor rule is low based on estimates of Laubach and Williams, which, combined with relatively small inflation and unemployment gaps, would suggest, through a Taylor-rule-type calculation, that current policy is approximately the policy recommended by the rule.	13	1
201504	1677	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This argument could rationalize current policy settings, although it would suggest that policy is perhaps not as accommodative as people would intuitively think.	13	1
201504	1678	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	One comment is that the value of r* is highly uncertain, either from a theoretical perspective or a measurement perspective.	13	1
201504	1679	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Time-varying r* Taylor rules are relatively untested and do not represent the empirical tradition behind Taylor rule estimation and recommended policy outcomes.	13	1
201504	1680	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	For this reason, I am skeptical of using time-varying r* as a rationale for current policy settings.	13	1
201504	1681	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The value of r* from a broader perspective should represent the Wicksellian natural rate of interest, which one might view as governed by the real rate of interest that would prevail in an economy without frictions and without monetary policy influence.	13	1
201504	1682	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	In a wide class of models, we know what the real rate of interest would be.	13	1
201504	1683	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It would be the sum of the rate of productivity growth and the rate of labor force growth.	13	1
201504	1684	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	These factors alone would drive the real output growth rate in this class of models.	13	1
201504	1685	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	My staff calculated an r* value based on such a view.	13	1
201504	1686	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It turned out to be 2 percent today, and this seems like a good benchmark for r* from which to calibrate Taylor rule policy recommendations.	13	1
201504	1687	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Such recommendations would suggest that policy is indeed accommodative today, which would match most people’s intuition about current policy settings.	13	1
201504	1688	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Interestingly, this value of r* has historically been somewhat lower than the Laubach- Williams measure.	13	1
201504	1689	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It has been near zero in recent years, but as of today has moved above zero to a value of about 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1690	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The bottom line is that there are many ways to look at this value of r*, but a sensible guess is that r* is 2 percent or higher, meaning policy today is accommodative, as intuition suggests.	13	1
201504	1691	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1692	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1693	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Madam Chair, if I could—President Bullard, I was a little bit confused by what you were saying about labor force participation, and particularly the staff’s assessment of it.	13	1
201504	1694	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	My understanding of what the staff has been saying is that while they project a downward trend in labor force participation because of demographics, they also assess the decline in the immediate post-crisis years to have been substantially steeper than that.	13	1
201504	1695	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And what they were predicting—and continue, I think, to predict, unless Bill corrects me—is a less steep decline or a flattening-out of current labor force participation, which eventually has their projected demographic trend–based participation rate converging with the actual participation rate.	13	1
201504	1696	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And that, I think, is what’s been happening over the past year and a half or so, during which, with a little bit of fluctuation up and down, the labor force participation rate has been roughly stable, which I think is bearing out the staff’s expectation of the convergence of their projected trend with actual labor force participation.	13	1
201504	1697	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Yes, I think that’s how I interpret it as well.	13	1
201504	1698	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I don’t think what we have in the forecast is at all at odds with the Aaronson and others paper of 2014.	13	1
201504	1699	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The gap we have in there is roughly what we estimated in that paper, and as Governor Tarullo indicated, we expect the downtrend in the participation rate to continue and the actual participation rate to close the gap by falling less than the downtrend we have.	13	1
201504	1700	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	13	1
201504	1701	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1702	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Economic activity in the Third District slowed during the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1703	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	While still expanding, the rate of expansion has been below expectations.	13	1
201504	1704	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	However, it appears that the recent slowdown may be temporary, and that sentiment is widely held among contacts in our region.	13	1
201504	1705	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Unemployment in the region ticked up to 5.7 percent in March, with Pennsylvania experiencing a significant decline in employment, enough that the first-quarter job growth in the state was actually negative.	13	1
201504	1706	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	However, both our April Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey and Nonmanufacturing Business Outlook Survey indicate that the manufacturing and service sectors expanded employment in April and point to further job growth and capital expenditures over the second half of the year.	13	1
201504	1707	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	One prominent manufacturer in the region indicated that his businesses are poised to grow rather more robustly in the second half of the year once they have worked through the necessary inventory correction.	13	1
201504	1708	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Although he doesn’t anticipate 2015 to be as strong as last year, the second half of the year should see solid growth.	13	1
201504	1709	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	In response to a special survey question on the effect of the dollar’s appreciation on their manufacturing activity, respondents who have exchange rate exposure indicated that the appreciation negatively affected their operations.	13	1
201504	1710	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	However, our District does not overly engage in foreign trade, with exports accounting for only 10 percent of revenues and imports representing about 5 percent of nonlabor costs.	13	1
201504	1711	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thus, the overall effect of the dollar’s rise was fairly small for Third District manufacturers.	13	1
201504	1712	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Both nonresidential and residential construction weakened in March.	13	1
201504	1713	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	We are also seeing a softening in multifamily housing.	13	1
201504	1714	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Reflecting the overall weaknesses in this sector, house price appreciation is also slower than in the nation as a whole, with prices growing in the 3 to 3½ percent range.	13	1
201504	1715	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Retailers in the region have been reporting healthy sales over the intermeeting period and moderate year-over-year sales growth.	13	1
201504	1716	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Contacts report that sales are starting to be bolstered by lower gasoline prices, and consumers in the region remain highly confident.	13	1
201504	1717	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	They are also paying down post-holiday debt, and debit and credit card lines are declining.	13	1
201504	1718	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Bankers in the region indicate that the growth in the commercial loan segment of their portfolios has picked up substantially, while other loan activity has remained fairly flat.	13	1
201504	1719	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thus, our District reflects fairly well what might be transpiring in other regions nationally—a bit of a step back in labor markets, a falloff in manufacturing activity, and a lack of any significant improvement in residential investment.	13	1
201504	1720	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	This slowdown is well reflected in one of the series we produce in our real-time research center, the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti Business Conditions Index.	13	1
201504	1721	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	The ADS uses six high-frequency data series to construct an index of current economic activity.	13	1
201504	1722	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Those series include, one, initial jobless claims through the week ending April 11 of this year; two, payroll employment through March; three, industrial production through March; four, real personal income through February; five, real manufacturing and trade sales through January; and, six, real GDP through the fourth quarter of last year.	13	1
201504	1723	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	The index is centered on zero, which indicates normal growth rates, and the index has recently turned negative.	13	1
201504	1724	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	However, we are receiving indications that the somewhat slower growth we have witnessed is a temporary phenomenon, and that economic activity is expected to bounce back to trend growth rates.	13	1
201504	1725	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	As mentioned by President Bullard, we also find that, historically, first-quarter GDP growth may not be adequately adjusted for seasonal variation.	13	1
201504	1726	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Over the past 30 years, seasonally adjusted growth in first-quarter GDP has averaged significantly less than growth over the remaining three quarters—1.8 percent as opposed to 2.7 percent.	13	1
201504	1727	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Additionally, if one examines the timing of the 10 weakest quarters over that span, six occurred in the first quarter and, 50 percent of the time, the weakest quarter was the first quarter of the year.	13	1
201504	1728	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Observations like these may point us to placing more weight on GDI—gross domestic income—or on GDPplus, which incorporates the income side of GDP, in interpreting current economic activity.	13	1
201504	1729	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	GDPplus has the advantage that, unlike GDI, it is available with the same timing as expenditure-side data.	13	1
201504	1730	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	With that as background, we continue to project that overall economic activity will accelerate modestly, that utilization gaps will continue to progressively narrow, and that inflation will continue to firm.	13	1
201504	1731	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	With a substantial amount of data forthcoming before our June meeting, I expect that we’ll have a clearer view of the emerging trends and confirmation—or not—that first-quarter economic performance was, indeed, a poor harbinger of the year to come.	13	1
201504	1732	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1733	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you very much.	13	1
201504	1734	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	13	1
201504	1735	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1736	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The incoming national data suggest that the economy hit a soft patch in the first quarter, which is consistent with the recent information on economic activity in the Fifth Federal Reserve District.	13	1
201504	1737	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	At the same time, our reports indicate that the weakness is widely viewed as temporary.	13	1
201504	1738	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Our diffusion index of manufacturing activity, released this morning, was slightly negative in April, and that followed a reading of negative 8 for March.	13	1
201504	1739	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But our index of expected shipments six months ahead was a robust plus 38, a level that has not been exceeded since 2011.	13	1
201504	1740	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Similarly, our index for nonretail service-sector activity was also slightly negative in April, but the index of expected demand six months ahead held steady at a pretty positive rate.	13	1
201504	1741	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	And the indexes for employment remain positive across all sectors.	13	1
201504	1742	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Retail revenue rose 5 points to plus 17.	13	1
201504	1743	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	More broadly, commentary from our directors and industry roundtable participants was more positive this month than last, and we’ve heard numerous reports about transitory factors having affected recent activity.	13	1
201504	1744	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	An executive at an engineering firm in West Virginia said that “weather has been the primary factor in our business slowdown.”	13	1
201504	1745	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Several other reports cited production slowdowns attributable to the West Coast port strike.	13	1
201504	1746	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	For example, a manufacturer of industrial safety products stated that production was interrupted by delays in receiving shipments of just one critical part manufactured in China.	13	1
201504	1747	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	These reports suggest that it’s quite reasonable to expect a rebound in growth in Q2.	13	1
201504	1748	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	As usual, any discussion of labor markets these days turns quickly to the subject of shortages of skilled workers.	13	1
201504	1749	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It does seem as if these shortages are having noticeable effects.	13	1
201504	1750	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	For example, the CEO of a large building materials company told of a trucking company refusing outgoing shipments due to a lack of drivers.	13	1
201504	1751	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	We also continue to hear about markets experiencing wage pressures, and, while not universal at this point, the scope of these observations appears to have broadened of late.	13	1
201504	1752	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	This was most apparent in the reports from representatives of several staffing firms, both national and regional, who serve on our roundtables, including a regional representative from Manpower.	13	1
201504	1753	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	One large staffing firm is telling clients to expect upward wage pressure “in all skill levels” later this year.	13	1
201504	1754	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Two grocers in Richmond recently announced double-digit starting-wage increases, perhaps in response to Wal- Mart’s announcement.	13	1
201504	1755	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	A large auto manufacturer plans to raise starting wages for assembly line workers at a plant in our District from $13.17 an hour to $15.85 an hour—about 20 percent.	13	1
201504	1756	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	A lumber company in West Virginia has responded to a shortage by bringing in entry-level workers from Puerto Rico, renting houses for them, and hiring an interpreter, all of which raise the cost of labor by 10 to 15 percent.	13	1
201504	1757	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	These reports suggest that broader wage pressures may be about to emerge, although I recognize that wage acceleration is not yet apparent in the monthly figures for average hourly earnings.	13	1
201504	1758	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Turning to the national economy, as I said, we’ve clearly hit a soft patch recently.	13	1
201504	1759	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Some of that softness was due to well-known temporary factors.	13	1
201504	1760	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Combined, these transitory factors could well explain a large part, if not all, of the first-quarter slowdown.	13	1
201504	1761	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Moreover, this wouldn’t be, as many have noted, the first flat quarter we’ve seen during this expansion.	13	1
201504	1762	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	So the question is how rapidly economic activity picks up again from here as the effect of these transitory factors fade.	13	1
201504	1763	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I share this Tealbook’s optimism on consumer spending, and that’s based on robust income growth, solid consumer sentiment readings, and continued improvement in labor market conditions.	13	1
201504	1764	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The rebound in car sales last month was an important piece of evidence that consumers have the confidence to boost spending in the months ahead.	13	1
201504	1765	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Turning to inflation, the latest readings have been a bit firmer than expected.	13	1
201504	1766	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Core CPI inflation averaged 2.3 percent at an annual rate from December to March.	13	1
201504	1767	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The staff’s translation into core PCE inflation is 1.4 percent over the same three months, and that implies that Q4 will be the low point for core PCE inflation.	13	1
201504	1768	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Oil prices appear to have bottomed out and the run-up in the dollar seems to have lost steam, so the transitory downward pressures on headline inflation are waning.	13	1
201504	1769	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thus, it seems fairly clear to me that we are emerging from this inflation dip, and inflation will be moving towards 2 percent in coming quarters.	13	1
201504	1770	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Looking ahead, as several of you have mentioned, we will receive more than the usual amount of data over the upcoming intermeeting period, including, importantly, two employment reports and two reports on personal income and consumption.	13	1
201504	1771	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If the data come in consistent with the Tealbook forecast, we would have solid evidence in hand at our June meeting that consumer spending growth had rebounded and that inflation was moving up.	13	1
201504	1772	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If so, I believe the case for raising rates would be strong, so it seems premature to make any statements at this meeting or in the days immediately ahead, I believe, that could be interpreted as taking June off the table.	13	1
201504	1773	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1774	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1775	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	13	1
201504	1776	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1777	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Unemployment in the Tenth District remains very low at 4.2 percent, and recent employment growth has been modest but is mixed across states and industries.	13	1
201504	1778	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Several District states are seeing sizable oil and gas layoffs, and negative spillovers are showing up in regional factory and transportation activity as well as in consumer spending areas and those that are energy dependent.	13	1
201504	1779	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Through the first quarter of this year, District energy jobs were down 4½ percent, and firms in our latest energy survey expect their employment to fall by 12 percent this year.	13	1
201504	1780	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	District manufacturing is also feeling the effect, as the last time our manufacturing survey composite was lower than its April reading was in early 2009.	13	1
201504	1781	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Firms responding to our energy survey, however, note that breakeven oil prices have fallen considerably as services costs have dropped, providing some encouragement for future activity as oil prices edge higher.	13	1
201504	1782	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	On the other hand, District states with virtually no oil and gas activity have seen a solid start to 2015.	13	1
201504	1783	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Colorado, in particular, continues to grow rapidly, driven by strong tourism and construction activity.	13	1
201504	1784	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	As a result, total employment in the region is up slightly this year, and overall services activity in the District continues to grow despite the energy layoffs.	13	1
201504	1785	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In agriculture, drought has worsened, although winter wheat production is shaping up to be similar to its recent five-year average, and corn and soybean planting intentions are generally strong.	13	1
201504	1786	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Still, persistently low crop prices and elevated input costs continue to increase farmers’ short-term financing needs.	13	1
201504	1787	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	For the national economy, my outlook for growth over the medium term is little changed.	13	1
201504	1788	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I assume that the softness in first-quarter GDP proves transitory, as it has for the past several years.	13	1
201504	1789	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Weather effects and the sharp decline in energy investment look to be important factors holding down first-quarter growth.	13	1
201504	1790	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	However, more persistent factors producing softer export growth and a broader slowing in new investment bear watching.	13	1
201504	1791	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Alternatively, personal consumption appears to have some upside potential, as there is yet to be a significant boost to spending from lower gasoline prices.	13	1
201504	1792	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	March’s payroll numbers were clearly below expectations, though the labor market continues to improve in several aspects.	13	1
201504	1793	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	The services sector continues to perform well.	13	1
201504	1794	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In the first quarter of this year, services added, on average, 179,000 additional jobs per month.	13	1
201504	1795	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	This is better than the 134,000 average in the first quarter of last year.	13	1
201504	1796	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Overall, I expect average monthly payroll growth to drift down from the rapid pace of 260,000 per month last year to 200,000 this year before settling down to a pace of around 150,000 next year as the labor market continues to tighten and growth moves to its trend level.	13	1
201504	1797	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Research by my staff also indicates improving labor market conditions, as reflected by the number of workers moving from lower- to higher-paying sectors—that is, the extent of cyclical upgrading.	13	1
201504	1798	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Their analysis shows that the rise in the quits rate over the past two years is primarily due to a higher quits rate in sectors with lower pay, like wholesale/retail trade and leisure/hospitality.	13	1
201504	1799	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Tracking individual workers in these sectors using Current Population Survey data shows that they have recently been moving into higher-paying sectors, like education and health services, at rates similar to those before the recession.	13	1
201504	1800	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Turning to inflation, I expect inflation to remain somewhat below target due to lagged effects from low energy prices and a stronger dollar.	13	1
201504	1801	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Inflation in some sectors, such as health care, have also notably slowed.	13	1
201504	1802	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In addition, because of some of the current factors affecting inflation, year-over-year core could drift lower as stronger readings from a year ago—core PCE readings from March to June of last year were running at a solid 2 percent pace—drop out of the 12-month window.	13	1
201504	1803	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Such base effects have not affected my overall confidence regarding the medium-term outlook for inflation, assuming there are continued improvement in the labor market and stable longer-term expectations.	13	1
201504	1804	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1805	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1806	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	13	1
201504	1807	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1808	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will start with a few observations about the Ninth District economy.	13	1
201504	1809	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s generally robust, but the decline in oil prices is certainly creating challenges in some areas.	13	1
201504	1810	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I will then turn to the national economy, where I see continued shortfalls in aggregate demand relative to supply.	13	1
201504	1811	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Labor markets are tight in many parts of the Ninth District, with contacts reporting significant swaths of unfilled openings.	13	1
201504	1812	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There are signs of growing wage pressures in some economic sectors and geographical areas.	13	1
201504	1813	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, overall, wage pressures remain muted.	13	1
201504	1814	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Importantly, many businesses report having little or no ability to pass on wage increases to consumers in the form of price increases.	13	1
201504	1815	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So this is actually a flip side of the argument that President Williams offered—he indicated that he didn’t need to see wage increases to feel confident in the return of inflation to 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1816	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The flip side of this is that we might see wage increases happening and still not see inflation, because the question is whether those businesses experiencing the wage increases have the pricing power to pass that on.	13	1
201504	1817	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The contacts that we talked to in the intermeeting period suggested they do not.	13	1
201504	1818	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Contacts at businesses with an international footprint expressed concern during the intermeeting period about how the high value of the dollar would affect the demand for their products, especially in light of overall softness in global demand conditions.	13	1
201504	1819	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And some of the comments that President Bullard offered about China echo things we heard from our contacts during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201504	1820	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Not surprisingly, economic activity has slowed greatly in the oil-producing areas of North Dakota.	13	1
201504	1821	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	However, overall confidence in the Bakken region remains high.	13	1
201504	1822	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Many, if not most, of our contacts report seeing the currently low level of economic activity as a welcome opportunity to shore up critical infrastructure needs in the western part of North Dakota.	13	1
201504	1823	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Let me turn to the national economy.	13	1
201504	1824	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Both real and nominal variables are telling us a similar story, I believe:  There is insufficient aggregate demand to use available resources in an effective fashion.	13	1
201504	1825	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In terms of real activity, if we look back over the past five years since the end of 2009, real GDP growth has averaged 2.3 percent.	13	1
201504	1826	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	There is little sign of this pace quickening—last year, real GDP growth was only 2.4 percent.	13	1
201504	1827	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Here I’m using annual averages to get away from some of the seasonal adjustment factors that have been highlighted in previous interventions.	13	1
201504	1828	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This year now looks like it may be even worse than this weak average performance.	13	1
201504	1829	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the wake of the data that we’ve received from the first quarter, Tealbook, Book A, has downgraded its outlook for 2015 economic activity, and it now projects growth in this calendar year to be less than 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1830	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We will get more information, of course, tomorrow morning along these lines.	13	1
201504	1831	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The persistence of these patterns has led some to conclude that they reflect a permanent downward shift in the productive capabilities of the United States.	13	1
201504	1832	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think we should be very cautious before accepting these claims.	13	1
201504	1833	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We saw significant improvement in all labor market metrics in 2014.	13	1
201504	1834	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This improvement seems to have had little effect on the excess supply of human resources in the economy.	13	1
201504	1835	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We saw little upward pressure on compensation or on the inflation outlook.	13	1
201504	1836	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This conjunction of low price pressures and strong employment growth suggests that the “Room to Grow” scenario in Tealbook, Book A, might be quite relevant.	13	1
201504	1837	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And if you look at the implications of that scenario, the weakness of aggregate demand relative to supply creates concerns with respect to nominal variables.	13	1
201504	1838	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The outlook for inflation in Tealbook, Book A, is that it will be below target until 2019, well over four years from now.	13	1
201504	1839	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Just to follow up on some of the discussion we heard earlier about inflation over the past few years, headline inflation did go above 2 percent in 2011, but I think if you go back over 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, and 2014, in all of those years, it was below 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1840	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In 2011, it was above 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1841	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On average, over that time frame since the end of 2007, it’s been about 1.3 percent.	13	1
201504	1842	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Market-based longer-term inflation expectations remain low.	13	1
201504	1843	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I want to say something about the prediction issue.	13	1
201504	1844	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It’s absolutely true, I think, that if you do horse races of the kind that President Williams talked about, market-based measures don’t really fare that well.	13	1
201504	1845	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it’s actually because they’re of value to policymakers, not just to statistical forecasters, because we’re interested in a different loss function.	13	1
201504	1846	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’re not interested in just minimizing mean squared error, we’re actually interested in trying to mitigate low inflation, especially when it’s going to be costly to households.	13	1
201504	1847	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I think that monitoring these market-based measures of inflation expectations is helpful along those lines.	13	1
201504	1848	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Tealbook, Book A, notes that we’ve seen some slippage in Michigan survey measures as well—I don’t want to put too much weight on that at this stage, but it’s something to watch.	13	1
201504	1849	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think there are signs in these data that we may be facing a prolonged period of inflation running substantially below our target.	13	1
201504	1850	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Now, why should we care about a possible downward slippage in inflation and inflation expectations?	13	1
201504	1851	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This builds on some of the remarks that President Rosengren already made, that persistently lower inflation expectations translate to lower nominal interest rates.	13	1
201504	1852	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Lower nominal interest rates translate into little recession-fighting capacity for the central bank.	13	1
201504	1853	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And such a reduction in policy capacity would be especially troubling because it would build on the policy capacity associated with a significant decline in the neutral real interest rate noted by President Rosengren.	13	1
201504	1854	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So this decline in inflation expectations really creates a first-order loss in terms of what we are trying to accomplish because it increases the probability of hitting up against the zero lower bound.	13	1
201504	1855	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As President Rosengren suggested, the decline in the neutral rate of interest should lead us to consider raising the inflation target.	13	1
201504	1856	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I see a great deal of possible merit in this suggestion.	13	1
201504	1857	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	More generally, I think that it would be useful to have discussions about the long-run goals that we have established.	13	1
201504	1858	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We learn more over time, and it’s useful to take that on board.	13	1
201504	1859	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We don’t want to do it every year, certainly, but I think at intervals we should be taking on information and reevaluating the longer-run goal statement.	13	1
201504	1860	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The Bank of Canada does this on a five-year basis.	13	1
201504	1861	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Every five years they go back and relook at their framework and what they’ve learned, and I think there’s something to be gained from that kind of systematic reevaluation of our framework.	13	1
201504	1862	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I would be very supportive of further discussion of President Rosengren’s suggestion.	13	1
201504	1863	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that said, first things first.	13	1
201504	1864	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We actually need to forestall a possible decline in inflation expectations today generated by a failure to hit the current low target.	13	1
201504	1865	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	During the intermeeting period, Governor Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan visited Minnesota and gave an excellent speech.	13	1
201504	1866	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	He described the aggressive efforts of the Bank of Japan to stimulate an increase in inflation expectations.	13	1
201504	1867	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I listened to him, I was reminded yet again of how we need to do all that we can to avoid leaving our successors with the kind of tough situation that Governor Kuroda now faces.	13	1
201504	1868	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I don’t see that determination reflected in alternative B, but I won’t talk about that until tomorrow.	13	1
201504	1869	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1870	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1871	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	13	1
201504	1872	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1873	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of the economic outlook, I’m of two minds.	13	1
201504	1874	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the one hand, I’m more uncertain about the growth outlook and more concerned about the potential downside risks to growth.	13	1
201504	1875	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the other hand, I think the downside risks on the inflation side have lessened considerably.	13	1
201504	1876	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	At the last meeting, I would have said that I expected further labor market improvement but was not yet reasonably confident that inflation would return to our 2 percent objective over the medium term.	13	1
201504	1877	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, I would at least partly reverse things.	13	1
201504	1878	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Conditional on further improvement in the labor market, I’m getting closer to being reasonably confident that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective, but I am less confident about when I will see further labor market improvement and how quickly it will occur.	13	1
201504	1879	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Turning first to the growth side, it strikes me that there are a lot of crosscurrents right now, and it’s really difficult to assess the net effect.	13	1
201504	1880	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	To me, this sharp slowing in payroll growth in March should not be a big surprise, however.	13	1
201504	1881	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As I noted in my comments at the March FOMC meeting, a big gap had opened up between payroll growth and GDP growth, so unless one thought that the productivity growth trend would remain extraordinarily poor, it seemed reasonable to expect either GDP growth to pick up or payroll growth to slow down.	13	1
201504	1882	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As it turns out, GDP growth slowed rather than picked up, so that left payroll growth to bear the brunt of the adjustment.	13	1
201504	1883	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As I assess the first quarter, I do think there are both transitory and more persistent factors responsible for the slowdown.	13	1
201504	1884	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On the transitory side, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s staff analysis does suggest that severe winter weather did have a sizable effect.	13	1
201504	1885	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We put the impact at about 1½ percent on the annualized growth rate, slightly less than last year.	13	1
201504	1886	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Having said that, I wouldn’t take that point estimate too literally.	13	1
201504	1887	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Also, I do think the West Coast port slowdown did disrupt economic activity.	13	1
201504	1888	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We had a small business advisory group meeting, and I was surprised that two out of the eight or nine businesses that attended referenced the port slowdown as hurting their businesses in the first quarter—this is around upstate New York and New Jersey, and that’s not really where I would expect the port slowdown to actually manifest itself, so I thought that was meaningful.	13	1
201504	1889	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	There are also some more long-lasting components as well.	13	1
201504	1890	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As Steve Kamin made clear, the dollar’s sharp appreciation has led to a deterioration in US net exports, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff estimates that a 15 percent appreciation of the broad real trade- weighted dollar, which is a little bit more than we have right now in hand, would cut about 0.6 percentage point from the level of real GDP after one year, and I think that’s pretty consistent with the Tealbook estimates.	13	1
201504	1891	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And I think it’s important because that’s just the partial equilibrium effect.	13	1
201504	1892	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you have a trade drag, it also drains real income from the economy, so there’s also the risk of second-order effects.	13	1
201504	1893	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Now, the second thing is that oil and gas investment is plunging.	13	1
201504	1894	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not sure how severe the knock-on effects will be, but I don’t think we’re done yet.	13	1
201504	1895	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Firms have been protected, in part, this year by hedging their future forward production by selling oil forward, and they’ll become more exposed to the current oil prices as time passes, so I expect a downward trend in investment to continue.	13	1
201504	1896	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	As Helen Holcomb pointed out in her comments about the Texas economy, the effect does seem to be quite a bit larger, I think, than expected.	13	1
201504	1897	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Richard Fisher said—in January, I believe it was—at that time he thought that employment growth in Texas, which was well above average compared with the country, would slow down to the national average.	13	1
201504	1898	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	But if you look at the payroll data in March for states on a seasonally adjusted basis, payrolls in Texas fell by 25,400 people, which is pretty sizable for Texas.	13	1
201504	1899	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And it’s interesting that Oklahoma was the state with the second-largest decline in payroll.	13	1
201504	1900	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So, clearly, the fall in oil and gas investment is having a significant effect.	13	1
201504	1901	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s rippling through to incomes, and it’s rippling through into commercial real estate construction, so I think it actually has a more sizable effect than just looking at oil and gas investment itself.	13	1
201504	1902	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Third, I think the inventory accumulation, which I don’t think anyone has mentioned, looks to me like it’s poised to be a drag on growth.	13	1
201504	1903	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the inventory-to-sales ratios, they have been drifting up, and if you look at the rate of inventory accumulation in the first quarter—well, we’ll see what we get tomorrow, but it looks to be on the high side in terms of what’s sustainable over the medium term.	13	1
201504	1904	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So if you had to ask yourself, “Are inventories going to contribute positively to growth or negatively to growth over the next year?”	13	1
201504	1905	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	They are almost certain to be a drag on growth.	13	1
201504	1906	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In the face of all of these crosscurrents, I think the next few months of data are really important.	13	1
201504	1907	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m really looking at what April and May look like.	13	1
201504	1908	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And even if we get strong April and May data, I’m not really sure what to make of it—is this just a bounce after first-quarter weakness, or is this the new trend?	13	1
201504	1909	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In contrast to the growth side, I am getting more comfortable that inflation is starting to stabilize and is likely to start drifting back up toward our 2 percent objective.	13	1
201504	1910	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	When I look at the inflation data and all the other factors that feed into the inflation outlook, I think most suggest that inflation—despite a stronger dollar, lower energy prices, and still-sizable slack in the labor market—actually seems to be stabilizing.	13	1
201504	1911	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So let me run through the evidence very quickly.	13	1
201504	1912	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If you look at the three-month change in the core CPI, it’s now above 2 percent compared with a 12-month change of 1.8 percent.	13	1
201504	1913	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Inflation compensation, as measured by the five-by-five forward TIPS versus nominal Treasury has moved up a bit.	13	1
201504	1914	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Survey measures of inflation expectations are generally stable, and I would argue that wage compensation growth trends are stable to slightly higher.	13	1
201504	1915	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So the fears I had of inflation getting unanchored to the downside seem to have diminished.	13	1
201504	1916	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I could imagine that things could have worked out quite differently.	13	1
201504	1917	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We’d have lower headline inflation feeding through into core inflation.	13	1
201504	1918	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That, in turn, would depress nominal wage growth and cause inflation expectations to be anchored to the downside.	13	1
201504	1919	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And the fact that we haven’t seen that at this point, I think, makes that dynamic much less likely.	13	1
201504	1920	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I’m much more confident now that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective, subject to having sufficient growth to continue to close the output gap.	13	1
201504	1921	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1922	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1923	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	13	1
201504	1924	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1925	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	This discussion has appropriately focused on the significantly weaker-than-expected incoming data on first-quarter economic activity.	13	1
201504	1926	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The staff forecasts a return to higher growth of around 2 percent or more in the second quarter and the second half of the year, and we’ve heard similar forecasts during this round of discussion from several of the Reserve Bank presidents.	13	1
201504	1927	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The Tealbook forecast is, not surprisingly, consistent with what we see in the charts given to us by Bill Wascher—in particular, the two real GDP forecasts and their fan charts.	13	1
201504	1928	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	So there’s a fair probability that will happen, but it’s not a guarantee that we’re going to bounce right back in the coming quarter and there have been some weak data in April.	13	1
201504	1929	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	In terms of elementary textbooks—looking at C + I + G + NX—the Tealbook forecasts expect the bulk of the rebound in the second quarter to come from consumption, which is a reasonable forecast in light of expectations for employment and real disposable income.	13	1
201504	1930	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The Tealbook also expects government purchases to rebound significantly, net investment to decline more slowly than it did in the first quarter, and net exports to decline at the same rate as in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1931	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	This is all very interesting, but of course, we’re waiting for tomorrow’s first estimate of first-quarter growth to clarify, perhaps, what happened in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	1932	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	When you focus on recent growth rates, you get a fairly pessimistic picture of what’s happening, and we need to remind ourselves that the overall position of the economy is good.	13	1
201504	1933	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Let me start with the labor market.	13	1
201504	1934	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The unemployment rate remains at 5.5 percent, a level that is not that much above many estimates of the natural rate today and is not above estimates of the natural rate that we had going into the March meeting.	13	1
201504	1935	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	A year ago we didn’t think we’d reach a rate that low until 2016.	13	1
201504	1936	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And, importantly, some, though not all, of the other labor market indicators whose behavior suggested that the U-3 unemployment rate understated the extent of labor market problems appear to be returning to pre-recession levels.	13	1
201504	1937	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	So, from the policy viewpoint, the basic question on output and employment is whether employment will continue to grow at a rate sufficient to bring further improvement in the labor market in coming quarters.	13	1
201504	1938	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The inflation rate remains below target, and that is a problem.	13	1
201504	1939	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	However, one gets the impression that while we are committed to looking through transitory factors—particularly dollar appreciation and the decline in oil prices, and gasoline prices in particular—popular discussion both here and in Europe has not focused on what that means.	13	1
201504	1940	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It does not mean focusing solely on core inflation, because both energy and import prices affect core inflation.	13	1
201504	1941	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Core PCE inflation was 1.3 percent over the 12 months through March.	13	1
201504	1942	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	According to Board staff estimates in the Tealbook, increases in the dollar, which are very unlikely to persist indefinitely, are holding down that figure by 0.3 percentage point this year, bringing what could be called nontransitory core inflation to something like 1.6 percent.	13	1
201504	1943	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And current energy price changes are reducing core inflation by another 0.1 percentage point, which brings you to a nontransitory core inflation rate of 1.7 percent.	13	1
201504	1944	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, you might be concerned about this if the low core numbers were being reflected in declining inflation expectations, but the survey measures seem to be relatively well anchored.	13	1
201504	1945	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And all this, again, seems consistent with the data presented in the bottom two charts in Bill Wascher’s handout, which show inflation coming back rather quickly to just below 2 percent.	13	1
201504	1946	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I expect that the transitory factors—which are, fundamentally, oil and the exchange rate, which may or may not turn around reasonably soon—will gradually abate and possibly begin to reverse themselves.	13	1
201504	1947	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We only need them to abate.	13	1
201504	1948	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And labor market slack will continue to diminish, putting inflation on a path that, over the medium term, will take us very close to our inflation target.	13	1
201504	1949	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1950	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	1951	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	13	1
201504	1952	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	1953	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	A lot of people have talked about Q1 and have posed the question, “Was Q1 an aberration?”	13	1
201504	1954	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I certainly hope that it was an aberration, and I expect that it has been an aberration.	13	1
201504	1955	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And I don’t think, personally, that we’re going to learn that much from the GDP number tomorrow morning.	13	1
201504	1956	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	If it’s kind of low or really low, it may not tell us very much because we had a really low number in the first quarter of 2014, and that didn’t seem to mean very much a quarter or two later.	13	1
201504	1957	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I actually think the question is not so much “Was Q1 an aberration?” but more the question that was implicit in some of Vice Chairman Dudley’s analysis a minute ago: “Are there things at work in the economy that will give us a growth path for the rest of the year that’s somewhat lower than what many of us expected toward the end of last year?”	13	1
201504	1958	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Not that it will in any way resemble Q1, but that somehow there are forces that are restraining growth a little bit more than we would have anticipated.	13	1
201504	1959	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Vice Chairman Dudley suggested one in his presentation.	13	1
201504	1960	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Another possible explanation of that phenomenon, should it occur, is the one that I think lies behind the Tealbook’s alternative scenario of a persistent slowdown—that is, that there is a kind of confidence problem that’s inhibiting consumer spending despite the extended improvement in income fundamentals because of job growth and maybe a little bit of wage growth, as well.	13	1
201504	1961	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think for that reason one has to be a little agnostic right now in awaiting data over the next couple of months—as President Mester, Vice Chairman Dudley, and several other people have said.	13	1
201504	1962	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Although, as someone—I think it was Vice Chairman Dudley—also said, even then, it’s not clear how much some of the questions we’ve been asking will be clarified because there’s going to be a certain degree of snapback.	13	1
201504	1963	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	So instead of trying to speculate about all of that, I wanted to put on the table in a little bit more detail something Simon had an exhibit on in his presentation at the beginning of this meeting and that is the phenomenon of negative interest rates on European sovereign debt.	13	1
201504	1964	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	This phenomenon may be relevant to an assessment of the most likely medium-term US growth trend because of its potential effects on financial markets and the dollar, potential downside risks, and—and I’m not going to talk about this, but it may be relevant to the great debate about secular stagnation.	13	1
201504	1965	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	There have been negative interest rates on some shorter-term European sovereign debt for several years now, but the last six months or so have seen a qualitative change in the phenomenon in a number of respects.	13	1
201504	1966	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	First, negative rates have moved down along the yield curve in European countries with the strongest credit reputations to the point that, as in the chart that Simon distributed, we now see negative interest rates in a nontrivial portion of 5- to 7-year debt in the stronger European sovereigns.	13	1
201504	1967	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Second, yield curves, as he mentioned, are quite flat in these countries.	13	1
201504	1968	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I just checked this morning, and the spread between German 2-year and 10-year government bonds is about 40 basis points.	13	1
201504	1969	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	That compares to a spread of about 140 basis points for US Treasury securities.	13	1
201504	1970	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The 30-year bund is still trading positively but at 63 basis points, which is a pretty low number for a 30-year.	13	1
201504	1971	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As everybody knows, the Swiss 10-year sovereign issue earlier this month went out at negative rates, and I believe that’s the first time in history that any sovereign debt of that duration has been priced negatively.	13	1
201504	1972	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And so, as far as Thomas Jordan knew, he was setting a precedent, or at least his country’s government was setting a precedent.	13	1
201504	1973	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Currently, as Simon’s chart shows, more than 35 percent of all euro-zone government debt carries a negative interest rate.	13	1
201504	1974	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As recently as two weeks ago, I think, it was up over 40 percent.	13	1
201504	1975	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	There’s been a little bit of an interest rate change since then, which has affected the yields in some of those medium-term tenors.	13	1
201504	1976	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Substantial portions of some non-euro-zone sovereigns, notably Denmark and Switzerland, also are priced at negative rates, and some shorter-duration corporate bonds of the highly rated European firms are also priced at negative rates now.	13	1
201504	1977	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Clearly, this is all related to long-standing European economic problems—and, more immediately, first the prospect and now the reality of the ECB’s QE program.	13	1
201504	1978	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s also related, I guess, to the relative scarcity of sovereign debt instruments issued by countries like Germany that continue to run tight fiscal policies and large current account surpluses, notwithstanding economic conditions in the euro zone more generally.	13	1
201504	1979	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The unprecedented nature of this phenomenon has caused most thoughtful analysts to offer only tentative views of the relative importance of various stories that explain why investors would hold longer-term sovereigns with negative yields.	13	1
201504	1980	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Logically, I think the explanations fall into three categories.	13	1
201504	1981	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	First is gloom about the long-term prospects for the countries in question.	13	1
201504	1982	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Now, it’s true, there’s not a whole lot of high optimism to be found about European growth prospects, but almost everybody discounts this as a dominant explanation—that is, the idea that there’s going to be negative growth or deflation for 10 years in Europe.	13	1
201504	1983	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The second group of explanations are based on investor inertia, basically—whether forced, as in the case of pension funds and some other institutions, which may be required by law or regulation to hold certain percentages of extremely low-risk bonds, or unforced, as in the case of other investors who are themselves unsure of what all of this negative rate stuff means and are waiting right now to see what happens, and maybe change their investment decision if things don’t turn around relatively soon.	13	1
201504	1984	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The third set of explanations is that, in an environment that doesn’t offer a lot of appealing investment options, there may be some plays available here.	13	1
201504	1985	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	For example, you may get capital gains if yields go even further into negative territory, or you may get exchange rate gains whether from short-term developments that cause quick swings in currencies or from longer-term appreciations of currencies with very low inflation or even deflation.	13	1
201504	1986	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	That is, if you think that there’s going to be very low inflation in Switzerland for a long time to come and you are a US investor, and you think that there’s going to be inflation in the United States, you might actually end up profiting by that play.	13	1
201504	1987	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As an example of this search for an investment play, I took note of one analyst’s advice to his clients that the best play may be in bonds with a good bit of convexity so as to maximize the chances of catching the wave of large market movements when these trends reverse.	13	1
201504	1988	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	To date, as a very good Federal Reserve Bank of New York MarketSource report indicated, there have been relatively few discontinuities observed in European debt markets.	13	1
201504	1989	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I think this is the point at which Herb Stein’s memorable aphorism comes to mind, because unless the medium-term prospects for Europe are a lot worse than most people think, there’s going to be a reversal of negative rates at some point.	13	1
201504	1990	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Even if there’s no near-term reversal resulting from sufficiently enhanced growth prospects or from sufficiently significant policy moves, a nontrivial number of investors might, over time, overcome their inertia and start seeking positive nominal yields elsewhere.	13	1
201504	1991	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	There are a lot of potential outcomes here, some of which are relatively benign.	13	1
201504	1992	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Others, though, are of potentially greater concern.	13	1
201504	1993	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	For example, if enough investors were caught flat- footed by an unexpected change in ECB policy—and, paradoxically, an unexpected improvement in European economic prospects—there could be some pretty significant turmoil in relevant markets, although there we would have to ask ourselves how much the financial turmoil would be offset by the prospect of improvement in the real economy.	13	1
201504	1994	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think of even greater concern to us would be a decision by those investors who did not initially move out of European sovereign debt that they couldn’t take the uncertainty or the negative rates any longer.	13	1
201504	1995	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The natural destination for these investors is, of course, US Treasury securities, and I think that some of the dollar strengthening we’ve seen this year has been attributable to the existence of investors who have already made such a move.	13	1
201504	1996	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And it is possible, though very hard to judge how likely, that many more could follow.	13	1
201504	1997	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	If they were to do so, the recent modest retracing by the dollar could itself be halted and reversed pretty significantly.	13	1
201504	1998	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	On this last possibility, it’s worth mentioning that, notwithstanding the notable spreads between bunds and Treasury securities, some European investors have apparently concluded that the roughly 80 basis point difference between German and US two-year bond rates is insufficient to compensate for currency-hedging costs and other risks.	13	1
201504	1999	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And this calculus is, I think, what may be contributing to some of the otherwise-hard-to-explain changes in the yield curves of some of the stronger European sovereigns, since fundamentals are not really changing there but you’re seeing some movement in those yield curves, which I take to be everybody repositioning, trying to figure out the best defensive place to be right now.	13	1
201504	2000	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	So investors may be moving around within bonds that are either euro-denominated or effectively tied to the euro.	13	1
201504	2001	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But if that spread between US Treasury interest rates and rates on European sovereigns were to widen, either because we raise rates or because QE and other developments in the EU drove yields down even further there, then more European investors might be tempted to take the Atlantic plunge.	13	1
201504	2002	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And this, in turn, could cause some market dislocation in Europe, a renewed unwelcome strengthening of the dollar, or both.	13	1
201504	2003	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	This is pretty speculative right now, but certainly in a context in which the trajectory of US economic performance is at least in some question after the past few months, I think this situation is another reason for us not to be in a hurry to raise rates, at least not until we’ve had a chance to see how investors are adapting, and, most importantly, what their adaptation means for the dollar.	13	1
201504	2004	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	2005	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	2006	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	13	1
201504	2007	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	2008	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	The incoming data for the first quarter have been weaker, overall, than expected, including data for household and business spending, industrial production, and housing starts and permits—a little bit different but quite similar to the first quarter of 2014.	13	1
201504	2009	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In addition, the initial BLS report on the employment situation for March was also much weaker than expected, and that’s different from last year, when payroll gains continued to be very strong right through the first quarter.	13	1
201504	2010	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	And the question, of course, is how much signal to take.	13	1
201504	2011	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	One reason to discount these data somewhat are the transitory factors that are likely to reverse, including bad winter weather and the West Coast port disruption as well as the technical factors that have been discussed.	13	1
201504	2012	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Another is that GDP data may eventually be significantly revised and is a noisy signal—and I thought that the new exhibit in Tealbook, Book A, on prediction intervals was interesting and useful on that point.	13	1
201504	2013	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In any case, it makes sense to me to take some signal from this year’s weak first quarter, both for labor markets and for GDP.	13	1
201504	2014	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I think the baseline staff forecast strikes a reasonable balance for the rest of this year by assuming higher GDP growth, but not a significant catch-up quarter like we had in the second quarter of 2014.	13	1
201504	2015	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	On inflation, I would tentatively say I feel a little better about inflation, which is now forecast to run at about 1½ percent for Q2, well above the Q1 readings.	13	1
201504	2016	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Survey expectations remain stable.	13	1
201504	2017	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Breakevens have moved up modestly across the curve since the March meeting, seemingly driven more by oil prices and liquidity rather than changing expectations.	13	1
201504	2018	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In light of all of the recent market readings that suggest concerns about low inflation, it’s an improvement, for a change, to read stories that fixed-income traders are seeing a greater likelihood of inflation getting back to mandate-consistent levels and less risk of very low inflation.	13	1
201504	2019	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Of course, we may overread these market movements, and it may simply be that TIPS got a little cheap relative to nominals, and traders acted on that.	13	1
201504	2020	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	The underlying story of a return to 2 percent inflation over the medium term, given GDP and labor market outcomes as forecast, continues to make sense to me.	13	1
201504	2021	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	And I look forward to gaining more confidence from the incoming data on that.	13	1
201504	2022	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I would worry more about lower inflation in the case that the economy does slip into a lower gear in growth and labor markets.	13	1
201504	2023	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Looking forward, the positive narrative is that consumer spending will increase to healthy levels supported by low energy prices, high confidence, and much better labor market conditions.	13	1
201504	2024	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In fact, going back to Stan’s basic equation, you could say that the US economy has grown at about 2.7 percent over the last two years, with net exports at around zero.	13	1
201504	2025	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	With net exports now contributing negative 0.7 to negative 0.8 percentage point, you have to ask, where is growth going to come from?	13	1
201504	2026	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s not going to come from government spending, it’s not going to come from housing investment, and it’s not going to come from business investment in a world in which drilling is being significantly reduced.	13	1
201504	2027	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	So it really has to come from consumption.	13	1
201504	2028	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	And, in fact, in the medium-term forecast, PCE growth accounts for well more than 100 percent of the growth.	13	1
201504	2029	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	That narrative, I have to say, makes sense to me, but it does amount to an airplane flying on one engine.	13	1
201504	2030	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	So far, the combination of the weak spending data and high consumer confidence says that the consumer, in effect, is now ebulliently saving.	13	1
201504	2031	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In terms of the risks, one, of course, is that PCE growth does disappoint.	13	1
201504	2032	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Another one, frankly, is that, in a world of still-slow growth, a return to stronger growth here could well lead to a tightening in financial conditions not so much through the rate channel as through the dollar channel—it may not be a rate tantrum that is really the threat this time.	13	1
201504	2033	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	We will see, by the time of the June meeting, whether there is progress in addressing Greece’s fiscal crisis or whether Greece, instead, is headed for controls on capital flows, sovereign default, and the like, with potential disruption for the US economy.	13	1
201504	2034	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	We’ll see two more employment reports and a lot more data.	13	1
201504	2035	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	And we’ll know, I think, at that point, something about whether the first quarter’s disappointment is transitory and anomalous or, instead, marks some kind of real loss of momentum.	13	1
201504	2036	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	2037	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	13	1
201504	2038	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	13	1
201504	2039	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	2040	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I wanted to reflect briefly on the quarterly assessment of financial stability and then turn to the outlook.	13	1
201504	2041	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although overall risks to financial stability in the United States remain moderate, one area that bears heightened scrutiny is the potential for spikes in volatility due to changes in market liquidity.	13	1
201504	2042	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, we should be asking whether episodes of severe volatility, like the wild swings we saw in Treasury bond yields on the morning of October 15, are likely to become the new normal.	13	1
201504	2043	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Bond inventories held by broker-dealers have declined, in some part due to regulatory changes.	13	1
201504	2044	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Separately, and predating the onset of Dodd-Frank, changes in market structure may be at least as important in some markets, for which automated and high- frequency traders may now account for a majority of the activity.	13	1
201504	2045	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Coupled with the big run-up we’ve seen of investments in bond mutual funds, this raises the specter of amplification of volatility and fire-sale dynamics at times when investors looking to cash out could be surprised by lower-than-expected liquidity.	13	1
201504	2046	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Together, these changes to the structure of financial markets could increase the volatility of asset price responses.	13	1
201504	2047	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	A modest increase in the average level of volatility shouldn’t be a concern, particularly if market participants respond with more rigorous risk management.	13	1
201504	2048	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But a lack of liquidity that leads to large and self-reinforcing swings in prices and market freezes during periods of stress could pose threats to financial stability and would be especially concerning in the case of the US Treasury market, with its traditional benchmark status.	13	1
201504	2049	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I think it’s premature to draw conclusions for financial stability.	13	1
201504	2050	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of the preoccupation with the decline in dealer inventories may, in fact, be misplaced, and I think focusing too much attention on the critical role of dealers as reliable providers of liquidity during severe stress episodes suggests a very high degree of amnesia.	13	1
201504	2051	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Moreover, bid-ask spreads are in line with historical norms.	13	1
201504	2052	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	As we’re learning from the investigation of October 15, we also do not yet fully understand the implications of the growing role of high-frequency traders in these markets.	13	1
201504	2053	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	With heterogeneity across their size, business models, and trading strategies, some of their activities may, in fact, contribute to market liquidity, while some may be destabilizing.	13	1
201504	2054	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And, finally, it’s unclear how much leverage or high-quality liquidity is embedded in bond mutual funds and how vulnerable they might be to liquidity mismatch and fire-sale dynamics.	13	1
201504	2055	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The Dodd-Frank requirement for mutual funds to undertake stress tests holds some promise, but only if deployed rigorously.	13	1
201504	2056	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In short, I am very pleased that we are putting intense focus on this issue, and I think it will only rise in importance as the date of liftoff approaches.	13	1
201504	2057	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Now let me turn briefly to the outlook in the United States.	13	1
201504	2058	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on the labor market, aggregate spending, and industrial output have been disappointing.	13	1
201504	2059	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The key question that we are wrestling with around this table is how much of this unanticipated weakness represents a slowing in the underlying momentum of activity and how much is due to transitory disturbances?	13	1
201504	2060	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The preliminary conclusion I would draw from the surprises in the recent data is that the negative impulse to US aggregate demand from the combined effects of the plunge in oil prices and the surge in the dollar seem to be at least as strong as we had expected, while the expected positive effects have not materialized so far.	13	1
201504	2061	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Turning first to the positive effects, recent shocks were expected to be reflected primarily in stronger consumption growth, but the recent data have been disappointing.	13	1
201504	2062	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Some of the preliminary indicators of consumer spending are often substantially revised, so we perhaps should not take too much signal from them.	13	1
201504	2063	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Indeed, auto sales—among the most reliable of indicators—rebounded strongly in March.	13	1
201504	2064	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, subpar data on retail sales have now persisted for four months, suggesting that temporary influences or statistical noise are not fully to blame.	13	1
201504	2065	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, it’s possible that the forces boosting consumer spending may not be as strong as we might have hoped.	13	1
201504	2066	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Weaker-than-expected consumption would be very unfortunate, because strength in other categories of aggregate demand remains elusive.	13	1
201504	2067	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent data on housing starts and permits, for example, suggest that this sector continues to struggle.	13	1
201504	2068	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the negative side of the ledger, the drop in oil prices was expected to curtail business investment related to drilling, while the dollar’s rise was anticipated to reduce net exports.	13	1
201504	2069	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	A broad variety of indicators suggests that these effects are materializing with greater force than had been anticipated.	13	1
201504	2070	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Drilling investment looks to have dropped at an annualized rate of 50 percent in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	2071	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And orders and shipments of capital goods, as well as business sentiment, have also been weak and suggest that overall business investment will edge lower over the first half of this year.	13	1
201504	2072	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	A variety of indicators also suggest that the stronger dollar is weighing significantly on activity.	13	1
201504	2073	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Net exports subtracted 1 percentage point from growth in the fourth quarter, and the staff estimates a contribution of minus ⅔ percentage point in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	2074	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The national manufacturing purchasing managers’ diffusion index of new export orders has been in contractionary territory for the past three months.	13	1
201504	2075	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Manufacturing production declined at an annual rate of 1 percent, and the outlook for internationally oriented firms has worsened significantly in recent days.	13	1
201504	2076	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In parallel, the recent labor market data suggest a slowing in the take-up of slack.	13	1
201504	2077	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Average monthly payroll employment gains were 200,000, down about 60,000 from last year’s pace, and all of the indicators of slack have moved sideways in the last month.	13	1
201504	2078	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Of course, there’s a danger in reading too much into this data.	13	1
201504	2079	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s entirely possible we’ll see the stronger trend in underlying activity that was apparent in the second half of the year reassert itself.	13	1
201504	2080	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	But it’s important to keep in mind the international context.	13	1
201504	2081	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the one hand, we have seen some encouraging data from the euro area—data on retail sales and industrial production, in particular—which holds out some promise that aggregate demand will strengthen.	13	1
201504	2082	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And the dollar’s sharp ascent seems to have stalled, at least for now.	13	1
201504	2083	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On the other hand, negotiations between Greece and its creditors remain challenging.	13	1
201504	2084	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And although the macro data are notoriously unreliable, Chinese GDP growth looks to have slowed noticeably in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	2085	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, the foreign economic outlook suggests continued weak demand in some important advanced foreign economies and signs of faltering growth in some important emerging market economies.	13	1
201504	2086	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In this context, the threat to price stability from stronger demand growth in the United States seems quite limited.	13	1
201504	2087	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Let me close by touching briefly on inflation.	13	1
201504	2088	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Recent data have provided some reassurance that underlying inflation is not moving lower.	13	1
201504	2089	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Oil prices have moved up somewhat further since March, and the 3-month moving average of core PCE inflation has increased from the very low level reached in January.	13	1
201504	2090	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Even so, current estimates of both the 3- and 12-month changes in core PCE prices point to an underlying trend rate of only 1.4 percent.	13	1
201504	2091	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	And while it’s reassuring that survey-based measures of inflation expectations are remaining stable, and there has been some improvement in market-based measures, the latter are still materially below the levels that prevailed until the middle of last year.	13	1
201504	2092	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The overall picture should suggest at least some caution about attributing all of the recent softening to transitory factors and puts a high premium on incoming data as we assess the timing of liftoff, which is the topic for tomorrow’s discussion.	13	1
201504	2093	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	13	1
201504	2094	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Well, thank you.	13	1
201504	2095	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks to everyone for another interesting and thoughtful round of observations.	13	1
201504	2096	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	As usual, I’ll try to summarize a couple of main themes and add a few remarks of my own.	13	1
201504	2097	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Starting with real activity and the labor market, everyone agreed that the news has been generally disappointing since our last meeting, although views differed about its implications.	13	1
201504	2098	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to employment, the March employment report showed unexpected weakness in payroll gains, but many of you emphasized that one shouldn’t make too much out of one month’s report.	13	1
201504	2099	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, still, average gains in the first three months of the year are running at about 200,000, which is a respectable pace, especially given how weak output growth looks to have been in the first quarter.	13	1
201504	2100	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Other labor market indicators during the intermeeting period were mixed but generally, I think, imply little change in resource utilization.	13	1
201504	2101	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The unemployment rate stayed at 5.5 percent.	13	1
201504	2102	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Broader measures of labor underutilization ticked down one-tenth, but the labor force participation rate fell one-tenth, and the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged.	13	1
201504	2103	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	You noted that the JOLTS job openings rate ticked up slightly, but there was also a slight decline in quits and hires, and at least the Board’s labor market conditions index was unchanged.	13	1
201504	2104	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I noted some reports from business contacts about increases in turnover and the fact, as President George mentioned, that people who are “turning over”—who are quitting—appear to be moving to jobs in which they’re receiving wage gains.	13	1
201504	2105	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On wages, I think everyone agreed that aggregate measures suggest very little pickup in wage growth, although some of you suggested that the reports you’re receiving from your business contacts are beginning to hint at a broader acceleration in wage gains and labor market pressures.	13	1
201504	2106	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That said, many of you noted that wage pressures are confined to particular regions and sectors, such as high-tech in Silicon Valley and San Francisco.	13	1
201504	2107	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But, as President Williams noted, the implications of movements in wages for inflation and for our criterion of wanting to have reasonable confidence that inflation will move back are debatable, and at least in recent years it doesn’t look like there’s that much of a close link between nominal wages and inflation.	13	1
201504	2108	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	With respect to spending, everyone remarked on the unexpected weakness we’ve seen in a broad range of spending and production indicators, including retail sales, housing starts, orders and shipments of capital goods, nonresidential construction, drilling, exports, and industrial output.	13	1
201504	2109	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And, of course, tomorrow morning we receive the first-quarter GDP preliminary estimate.	13	1
201504	2110	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The underlying cause of the Q1 slowdown and its implications for future growth is obviously very important and unclear at this point.	13	1
201504	2111	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Many of you mentioned, and cited evidence from your business contacts, of the importance of bad winter weather and the West Coast port dispute.	13	1
201504	2112	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	A number of you mentioned the fact that we have a pattern here—over many years—of Q1 being unusually weak, suggesting some residual seasonality in the GDP figures.	13	1
201504	2113	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Views on the size of these transitory effects differ, but if they are substantial, then the prospects for a quick return to moderate growth should be good.	13	1
201504	2114	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, a number of you mentioned that other explanations for weaker growth that may be relevant in the first quarter could have implications for the remainder of the year.	13	1
201504	2115	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	In particular, the dollar received a good deal of mention.	13	1
201504	2116	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It looks like the dollar may be having a significant negative effect and that many of your business contacts mentioned the negative effect they’re seeing from the stronger dollar.	13	1
201504	2117	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	In addition, the decline in oil prices does seem to be having a significant effect—maybe larger than we anticipated on business investment and drilling activity, and we haven’t yet seen—surprisingly, perhaps—much evidence of a positive effect on consumer spending.	13	1
201504	2118	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The anecdotes that you reported from your business contacts were somewhat mixed, but I interpreted those as being reasonably positive in terms of not seeing any really significant changes in business prospects.	13	1
201504	2119	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On the international side, a number of risks were mentioned: Greece; China, whose growth looks like it slowed more than expected; geopolitical risks that bear on oil prices; and a very interesting discussion, I thought, of what’s happening in global financial markets, with negative rates in Europe and the potential for a global reshuffling of portfolios that could raise volatility or could have very significant effects either on the dollar or interest rates and could be triggered by a shift in US monetary policy.	13	1
201504	2120	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On the inflation front, incoming data came in pretty much as the staff had expected.	13	1
201504	2121	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Core inflation was a touch higher than expected.	13	1
201504	2122	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Oil prices were up somewhat since our last meeting, and the broad dollar exchange rate actually fell a little bit during the intermeeting period.	13	1
201504	2123	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Some of you noted that these are welcome developments from an inflation perspective, as they indicate that the downward impetus provided by oil and the dollar to inflation is ebbing and shouldn’t continue.	13	1
201504	2124	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We had a nice discussion of measures of inflation expectations, with survey measures generally remaining stable and market-based measures of inflation compensation moving up slightly, although they are still below where they were last summer.	13	1
201504	2125	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams’s discussion about the relevance of these inflation expectations to inflation forecasts was interesting.	13	1
201504	2126	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	They don’t seem to be very good forecasts of inflation, and it is interesting that we have, I think, repeatedly noticed that these measures are more heavily influenced by oil prices and movements in oil prices than, it would seem, is reasonable.	13	1
201504	2127	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	On the other hand, with respect to inflation and the outlook for inflation, a number of you suggested, I think, that we could be in for a period in which inflation undershoots our objective for many, many years to come and, crossing over into the policy domain, suggested quite a bit of concern that we may be in for a very long period of an inflation undershoot.	13	1
201504	2128	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That took us to some interesting observations on the question of what the equilibrium real rate is; the possibility that it may be persistently depressed or not, as some think; a debate about what’s happening with the equilibrium real rate; and the possibility that if the equilibrium real rate really is depressed, what that implies for our monetary policy, and particularly for our inflation target, which is something that maybe we want to get back to and consider.	13	1
201504	2129	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	13	1
201504	2130	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just stop there as a summary of what I heard.	13	1
201504	2131	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there any comments or corrections anyone wants to offer?	13	1
201504	2132	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	13	1
201504	2133	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then I’d like to offer some comments of my own, then we can quit and go to dinner.	13	1
201504	2134	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I, of course, was also disappointed in incoming data on employment, spending, and production.	13	1
201504	2135	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I recognize this may be just another soft spot, akin to what we saw last year and in a number of years past, and I definitely think we should be careful not to overreact to what is a few weeks’ worth of news.	13	1
201504	2136	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I find it reassuring that indicators of consumer confidence remain pretty upbeat, and I really haven’t altered my modal outlook for employment and output over the medium term.	13	1
201504	2137	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I guess if I were updating my SEP forecast now, I would mark down projected growth this year, but modestly.	13	1
201504	2138	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That said, I do find the widespread nature of the recent negative surprises disconcerting, and, at a minimum, I am more worried about downside risk and am more uncertain about the outlook.	13	1
201504	2139	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	In March my concerns focused on the external sector, and now I see question marks pertaining to the underlying strength of domestic aggregate demand as well.	13	1
201504	2140	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I find it particularly disturbing that the slowdown in business investment appears to have become more widespread.	13	1
201504	2141	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	In March the weakness appeared concentrated in drilling activity, and I think now we are seeing outright declines in real equipment outlays and nondrilling, nonresidential construction as well.	13	1
201504	2142	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The Tealbook assumes that investment in intangibles is still growing at a solid pace, but we actually have no idea what’s happening there because reliable source data won’t be available for some time.	13	1
201504	2143	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The broad weakness in business fixed investment may be partly explained by the slowdown in aggregate sales and output via an accelerator effect, but conceivably other factors that may prove to be more persistent may also be at work, and I worry about that.	13	1
201504	2144	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m also concerned that we may not see a pickup in residential investment nearly as large as the Tealbook forecasts this year.	13	1
201504	2145	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Housing starts and permits have been incredibly weak even though mortgage rates are low, employment and income are rising, and demographic trends seem to call for a faster pace of building.	13	1
201504	2146	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	According to staff calculations, if housing remains weak it could shave ¼ percentage point or so off the Tealbook projection of real GDP in the second half of this year and in 2016.	13	1
201504	2147	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I worry most about retail sales having been soft for several months now.	13	1
201504	2148	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Savings rates moved up 1 full percentage point since the fourth quarter despite large gains in employment, a sharp decline in oil prices, record equity prices, a solid increase in house prices, and low borrowing costs.	13	1
201504	2149	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose one could explain this by saying that bad winter weather and other transitory factors are at work here.	13	1
201504	2150	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I suppose supporting such an explanation is the fact that we did see strong auto sales in March, and consumer sentiment, even though the Conference Board number fell today, is still pretty high.	13	1
201504	2151	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And I suppose, for those reasons, the Tealbook forecast seems reasonable to me, but I must say my confidence in the Tealbook forecast that projects that PCE growth is going to pick up to 4 percent really, to me, is a leap of faith, and I worry that we may not see a pickup that’s that large.	13	1
201504	2152	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And as several of you have mentioned, at this point the only real source of strength in the economy is consumer spending.	13	1
201504	2153	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	If there are question marks associated with consumer spending, that puts a lot of question marks on the outlook overall.	13	1
201504	2154	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I don’t think the risks from the external sector have diminished.	13	1
201504	2155	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Maybe they have even increased to some degree.	13	1
201504	2156	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The staff has marked down estimates of export growth in the first quarter appreciably.	13	1
201504	2157	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It may well be that the drag generated by past dollar appreciation and slow foreign economic growth could be greater than previously assumed.	13	1
201504	2158	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I also worry about the Greek debt situation.	13	1
201504	2159	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	If Greece were to put in place controls on capital movements or, worse, exit the euro, I think it’s hard to know what effect that would have on the dollar.	13	1
201504	2160	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m not sure whether it would cause the dollar to appreciate or depreciate, and I think there are reasonable stories either way.	13	1
201504	2161	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I certainly am hopeful that information between now and June will help us resolve some of these uncertainties.	13	1
201504	2162	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will see, certainly, two more employment reports and a range of indicators on spending and production that could tell us whether we’ve been through a soft patch or if there’s a more significant loss in momentum.	13	1
201504	2163	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	But by June, the spending data for the second quarter will still be incomplete, and we shouldn’t underestimate the possibility that new data will confuse rather than clarify our assessments of the state of the economy.	13	1
201504	2164	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	As for inflation, I don’t really have anything to add to what’s been said.	13	1
201504	2165	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Even though core CPI inflation came in a touch higher than expected, overall, the incoming data on wages and prices has been roughly in line with expectations.	13	1
201504	2166	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	My own outlook is little changed.	13	1
201504	2167	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Both core and headline PCE inflation rates are running well below 2 percent and are likely to do so for the rest of the year, barring some major surprise in oil prices or a fall in the dollar.	13	1
201504	2168	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And the April Tealbook projects that headline inflation will be under 1 percent this year on a Q4-over-Q4 basis, and that core inflation this year is only going to run at 1¼ percent.	13	1
201504	2169	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Those forecasts seem quite reasonable.	13	1
201504	2170	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Given this inflation outlook, the likelihood that employment and output will expand at only a moderate pace in coming quarters, and uncertainties about the global economy, I personally think it’s unlikely that the conditions we’ve set out for a firming of policy will be met by June, but I have an open mind.	13	1
201504	2171	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ve agreed to be data dependent, and that assessment could certainly change as we receive additional data on real activity and inflation in coming weeks.	13	1
201504	2172	2015-04-29	meeting		[Meeting recessed]	2	2
201504	2173	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let me stop there.	2	2
201504	2174	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We should probably break for dinner.	2	2
201504	2175	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Tomorrow, Thomas will give his briefing.	2	2
201504	2176	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We may have to make some changes in the statement when we see what’s in the GDP report, but I think we have enough time tomorrow morning to do that.	2	2
201504	2177	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll begin tomorrow at 9:00 am April 29 Session.	2	2
201504	2178	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Good morning, everybody.	2	2
201504	2179	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I guess we should get started, and I’d like to first turn to Bill Wascher to give us an update on this morning’s GDP announcements.	2	2
201504	2180	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	11	1
201504	2181	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I’ll be referring to the handout titled “Material for Gross Domestic Product Update.”	11	1
201504	2182	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	You have a table that summarizes some of the key aspects of this morning’s GDP data, and the first thing I would say is that it’s nice to be lucky once in a while.	11	1
201504	2183	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	[Laughter]	11	1
201504	2184	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	As you can see from the first line of the table, the BEA’s advance estimate of real GDP growth in the first quarter was 0.2 percent at an annual rate.	11	1
201504	2185	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	That’s one-tenth of 1 percentage point higher than our estimate in the April Tealbook.	11	1
201504	2186	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Among the major spending categories, real PCE growth slowed from 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.9 percent in the first quarter, about as we had expected.	11	1
201504	2187	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Business fixed investment, which is labeled here by its official title, nonresidential private fixed investment, fell 3.4 percent, and residential investment edged up 1.3 percent.	11	1
201504	2188	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Again, both of those were close to our expectations.	11	1
201504	2189	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The next three lines show some offsetting misses that turned out not to have much effect on the top-line GDP number.	11	1
201504	2190	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In particular, government spending fell by less than we were expecting, net exports fell by more, and there was a greater accumulation of inventories than we’d written down.	11	1
201504	2191	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In terms of their contributions to growth, net exports were estimated to have subtracted 1¼ percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, while inventories added ¾ percentage point to growth.	11	1
201504	2192	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	I should note that, for these two categories in particular, the BEA does not have complete data for the first quarter.	11	1
201504	2193	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	In the advance GDP estimate, inventories and net exports are based on two months of data and BEA’s assumed values for the third month—in this case, for March.	11	1
201504	2194	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Our staff had a chance to look at the monthly assumptions and other details of both of these components, and Steve mentioned to me that his colleagues in the Division of International Finance are inclined to discount some of the negative miss in net exports between their forecast and the BEA’s estimate.	11	1
201504	2195	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Going the other way, it looks as though the BEA wrote down a very high assumption for inventories in March, and we might be inclined to discount a little bit of that.	11	1
201504	2196	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	So I don’t know that it would have much effect on the top line.	11	1
201504	2197	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	But I believe our thinking at this point would be that net exports aren’t quite as weak as the BEA has estimated, and that inventories may not be quite as large.	11	1
201504	2198	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	The bottom of the table shows the BEA’s estimate of consumer price inflation.	11	1
201504	2199	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Total PCE prices fell 2 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, the same as our Tealbook estimate, while core PCE prices rose nine-tenths of 1 percent, one-tenth more than we were expecting.	11	1
201504	2200	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Finally, I’ll just mention that real disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of 6.2 percent in the first quarter, while the saving rate came in at 5.5 percent.	11	1
201504	2201	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Both of those figures were also close to our expectations.	11	1
201504	2202	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you.	11	1
201504	2203	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Bill?	12	1
201504	2204	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	12	1
201504	2205	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Bill, is the staff embarrassed that you missed this by 50 percent?	12	1
201504	2206	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	[Laughter]	12	1
201504	2207	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	No, congratulations on this.	12	1
201504	2208	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is a good call, and I think it was useful information to bring to the Committee.	12	1
201504	2209	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s a tough job, and when you get something right, you should definitely take some credit for it.	12	1
201504	2210	2015-04-29	meeting	WASCHER	Thank you.	12	1
201504	2211	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	12	1
201504	2212	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	12	1
201504	2213	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then let’s turn to Thomas, who is going to brief us on our monetary policy decisions.	12	1
201504	2214	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201504	2215	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I’ll be referring to the handout labelled “Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.”	21	2
201504	2216	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	At previous meetings and, indeed, yesterday, several of you discussed the possibility of market turbulence in the run-up to, or following, the onset of policy tightening.	21	2
201504	2217	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Although the Committee now has communications tools, including the SEP, that it did not have at the start of previous tightening cycles, unexpected movements in yields and volatility, up or down, may nevertheless occur even if the expected policy rate path does not shift markedly.	21	2
201504	2218	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The upper-left panel of your first exhibit provides some perspective by showing the staff’s estimate of the 10-year Treasury term premium over the past 25 years.	21	2
201504	2219	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The vertical bars highlight three episodes:  the beginning of the tightening cycles in 1994 and 2004 and the taper tantrum in 2013.	21	2
201504	2220	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Within the shaded 18-month windows around these events, term premiums moved substantially.	21	2
201504	2221	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But they also did so at other times—and likely in response to factors other than monetary policy.	21	2
201504	2222	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The upper-right panel isolates the episodes associated with the three shaded regions and, for reference, the current episode conditional on the staff’s assumption of liftoff at the September meeting.	21	2
201504	2223	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the red line, in 1994, the term premium rose substantially in the months following the onset of tightening.	21	2
201504	2224	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, in 2004, in blue, it moved up several months before the federal funds rate in response to stronger economic data that moved up the expected timing of policy tightening.	21	2
201504	2225	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But the term premium then began to decline and continued to do so over the remainder of 2004—the well-known “conundrum” episode.	21	2
201504	2226	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, in 2013, the term premium began to rise around the time of Chairman Bernanke’s JEC testimony in late May, apparently reflecting market participants’ reassessment of the outlook for asset purchases and possibly policy rates.	21	2
201504	2227	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the middle-left panel, these term premium movements may, to some extent, have reflected uncertainty about the future course of monetary policy.	21	2
201504	2228	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The panel shows the width of the 90 percent confidence interval for the federal funds rate 12 months ahead, derived from options on federal funds futures.	21	2
201504	2229	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The term premiums are highly correlated with this proxy for policy uncertainty in the 1994 and 2004 episodes, but less so in 2013, presumably because uncertainty in that episode was driven less by the path of the federal funds rate over the next 12 months than by the course of asset purchases and longer-term rates.	21	2
201504	2230	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	These experiences suggest that, even in a context in which the FOMC’s policy communications tools are more extensive than in the 1994 and 2004 cycles, it may be prudent for the Committee to consider its likely response to unexpected changes in term premiums that might occur around the time when it begins policy firming.	21	2
201504	2231	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	A special exhibit in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of the Tealbook, Book B, provides some background that might be useful.	21	2
201504	2232	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown by the dotted black line in the middle-right panel, the staff projects that the 10-year term premium will rise at a modest pace after the Committee is assumed to start raising the federal funds rate.	21	2
201504	2233	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	This slow projected rise in the term premium reflects in part the waning effects on longer-term yields of the Committee’s asset holdings.	21	2
201504	2234	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The magenta line presents the path for the term premium in a scenario, labeled “Tightening Tantrum,” that is similar in magnitude to, albeit less persistent than, the rise in the term premium that began in May 2013 (the green line).	21	2
201504	2235	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As shown in the lower-left panel, in the “tantrum” case, optimal control would call for a more gradual increase in the federal funds rate for several quarters, with the federal funds rate running, on average, 35 basis points below the optimal control path associated with the Tealbook baseline (the black line) over the four years following the shock.	21	2
201504	2236	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Recent public discourse has largely focused on the specter of another market tantrum.	21	2
201504	2237	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	However, a repeat of the 2004 experience, in which term premiums remained surprisingly low for a while, is also a possibility.	21	2
201504	2238	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, such an outcome might occur through the effects of the very large asset purchase programs that are under way in Europe and Japan.	21	2
201504	2239	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The yellow line in the middle-right panel shows a scenario for the path of the term premium that is similar to the 2004 conundrum episode.	21	2
201504	2240	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In this instance, optimal control would call for a federal funds rate path that is 40 basis points higher, on average, over the next four years.	21	2
201504	2241	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The lower-right panel highlights a few caveats.	21	2
201504	2242	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The tantrum scenario abstracts from the possibility of widespread liquidity or solvency problems, a point worth mentioning in light of recent commentary about reduced liquidity in key markets, which Simon discussed in his briefing.	21	2
201504	2243	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	More generally, the scenarios do not examine the consequences of term premium movements that are associated with other disturbances.	21	2
201504	2244	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If, for example, the term premium fell because of weaker economic activity abroad and associated flight-to-safety flows, the optimal policy response could be to keep the federal funds rate lower, not higher, than in the baseline.	21	2
201504	2245	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, the appropriate policy response to either scenario depends importantly on the persistence of the deviation of the term premium from its baseline path, which will be known only in retrospect.	21	2
201504	2246	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In response to such scenarios, policymakers may wish to emphasize that they will respond to financial conditions that are judged inconsistent with the achievement of the FOMC’s objectives.	21	2
201504	2247	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Turning to the draft policy alternatives, thanks to the excellent work of Bill Wascher and his colleagues, I can discuss the alternatives as distributed yesterday.	21	2
201504	2248	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	A key issue for your decision today is how to convey the implications of recent and incoming economic information for the likely timing of policy normalization.	21	2
201504	2249	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	First, as indicated at the top of exhibit 2, assuming that the Committee decides to remove time-based forward guidance from the statement, it will primarily rely on paragraphs 1 and 2 to speak to its assessment of whether its criteria for liftoff have been met or when they are likely to be met.	21	2
201504	2250	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In broad terms, with alternative B, the Committee would communicate that the conditions for an increase in the federal funds rate are not yet in place, while alternative C would suggest that those conditions will likely be in place in the near future.	21	2
201504	2251	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Alternative A would indicate that the preconditions for liftoff are unlikely to be met in the near future.	21	2
201504	2252	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The second set of bullets summarizes how each of the three alternatives may shape expectations for the timing of liftoff.	21	2
201504	2253	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	On the Committee’s criterion that it would need to see “further improvement in the labor market,” alternative B states that “underutilization of labor resources was little changed” over the intermeeting period, citing the moderation in the pace of job gains and the steady unemployment rate.	21	2
201504	2254	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Regarding the second criterion, that the Committee would need to be “reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term,” alternative B updates the description of recent data in paragraph 1 and retains, in paragraph 2, the expectation that inflation will “rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.”	21	2
201504	2255	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thus, alternative B does not signal a change in confidence about the inflation outlook.	21	2
201504	2256	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, the Committee noted in the March minutes that the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate would also depend on the evolution of economic conditions and the outlook.	21	2
201504	2257	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In that regard, alternative B provides the judgment that the Committee sees the recent weakness in economic activity either “in part” or “at least in part” as transitory and indicates that, despite the first-quarter slowdown, the Committee still expects economic growth at a pace that will lead to further improvement in labor market conditions.	21	2
201504	2258	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Under alternative B, the Committee would remain fully data dependent and offer no time-based guidance about how soon the conditions for liftoff are likely to be met.	21	2
201504	2259	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	By contrast, alternative C would communicate the Committee’s readiness to begin policy normalization in the near term.	21	2
201504	2260	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 1 indicates that, despite a steady jobless rate, “some labor market indicators suggest that underutilization of labor resources continued to diminish.”	21	2
201504	2261	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	It expresses a more positive reading of recent news on inflation and notes that, although inflation remained below the Committee’s objective, “it was no longer declining.”	21	2
201504	2262	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, paragraph 1 of alternative C attributes this winter’s economic slowdown largely to transitory factors.	21	2
201504	2263	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Paragraph 2 suggests not only that the Committee continues to anticipate moderate economic growth and further improvement in labor market conditions, but also that it now has become more (or perhaps somewhat more) confident that inflation “will rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term.”	21	2
201504	2264	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Having made those assessments of recent developments and the outlook, the Committee would adopt new guidance in paragraph 3.	21	2
201504	2265	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Rather than repeating the criteria for liftoff adopted in the March statement, the Committee would announce that “economic conditions may” or “likely will soon warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.”	21	2
201504	2266	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	While alternative C reintroduces a time dimension to the forward guidance, it also retains the more general data-dependent statement that the timing of the adjustment would depend on realized and expected progress toward the Committee’s objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.	21	2
201504	2267	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Finally, with alternative A, the Committee would express heightened concerns about the underlying strength of the economic expansion, downside risks to the outlook for the labor market, and possible persistence of below-target inflation.	21	2
201504	2268	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In paragraph 1, in alternative A, as in alternative B, the Committee describes underutilization of labor resources as “little changed,” but it stresses that inflation “continued to run well below the Committee’s longer-run objective.”	21	2
201504	2269	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	It does not offer any judgment on how much of this winter’s slowdown may have been transitory.	21	2
201504	2270	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Additionally, in paragraph 2’s assessment of the outlook, under alternative A it would be reported that the Committee now sees the risks to economic activity and the labor market as “tilted to the downside.”	21	2
201504	2271	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	And the statement would voice concern that “inflation could run substantially below”	21	2
201504	2272	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Given these risks to the outlook, alternative A introduces a somewhat more stringent precondition for the initiation of policy firming, stating in paragraph 3 that the Committee would need to see inflation “clearly moving up toward” the Committee’s 2 percent objective rather than being “reasonably confident” that it will do so.	21	2
201504	2273	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In addition, alternative A emphasizes concern about the inflation outlook by indicating that “the Committee is prepared to use all of its tools as necessary to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years.”	21	2
201504	2274	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	All told, alternative A would communicate that liftoff appears unlikely for some time.	21	2
201504	2275	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Thank you, Madam Chair.	21	2
201504	2276	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That concludes my prepared remarks, and I will be glad to take any questions.	21	2
201504	2277	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there questions for Thomas?	22	2
201504	2278	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	22	2
201504	2279	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201504	2280	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thomas, I’d like to ask you about your thinking as you drafted alternative C.	22	2
201504	2281	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Specifically, I’m referring to the bracketed choices in paragraphs 2 and 3, and I’m interested in how the staff is thinking about the choice of the “has become somewhat more confident” and “may soon warrant an increase” language, as opposed to the “has become more confident” and “likely will soon warrant an increase” language.	22	2
201504	2282	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	These two language options could be seen as a sequence of statements over, say, two meetings.	22	2
201504	2283	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	They could convey increasing certainty on the part of the Committee or increasing probability of a liftoff decision.	22	2
201504	2284	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Alternatively, I can imagine choosing between these two language options at the meeting ahead of liftoff, with the choice depending on the probability of the liftoff decision.	22	2
201504	2285	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I can see a case for both of these interpretations of the alt-C bracketed language as something we might consider in the future, and I wonder if the staff had either of these ideas in mind or if it’s just providing an option for this meeting alone.	22	2
201504	2286	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	We also explored the choice between “may” and “likely will” in previous drafts of alternative C and in other materials that, if I remember correctly, were sent to the Committee ahead of the January meeting.	22	2
201504	2287	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	In my view, just focusing for now on that, one key question is how the Committee wants to strike a balance between, on the one hand, sending some advance notice and, on the other hand, emphasizing data dependence.	22	2
201504	2288	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So I think one key question for you at some point will be, how firmly do you want to express that the next meeting might be likely for liftoff, and how do you balance that against the fact that, of course, over any intermeeting period, you will receive data that may change the course of policy?	22	2
201504	2289	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That’s some of the thinking that went into the considerations about “may” and “likely will.”	22	2
201504	2290	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	As to the “somewhat” in paragraph 2, you’re right that you can see a pair between—	22	2
201504	2291	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So that’s certainly a possibility.	22	2
201504	2292	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	22	2
201504	2293	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Yes—thank you, Madam Chair.	22	2
201504	2294	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had a question and a comment.	22	2
201504	2295	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The comment is on page 1 of the handout that you provided, “Market Expectations and Policy Issues.”	22	2
201504	2296	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I thought that was a very nice set of experiments, and I like the idea of having these three possible cases and laying them out.	22	2
201504	2297	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own thinking is, focus more on the tantrum case, but, certainly, it’s useful for us to keep in mind the conundrum case as well.	22	2
201504	2298	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My comment is about the use of optimal control as a way to evaluate the appropriate policy response here.	22	2
201504	2299	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When I think about what was going on in these episodes, it was really that there were uncertainties in markets about what the Committee was trying to achieve with policy —and you used the same language, I believe, when I was listening to you.	22	2
201504	2300	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But optimal control, of course, involves the assumption that what we were trying to achieve with policy is all pretty much common knowledge.	22	2
201504	2301	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	For example, in the tantrum case, we might want a more aggressive response in order to rebuild lost reputation, in some sense, about what we’re actually trying to achieve.	22	2
201504	2302	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In the conundrum case, the same is true—we might want to be even tighter than what’s built in here, because we’re actually trying to convince markets that we are really concerned about inflation getting too high.	22	2
201504	2303	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But in the tantrum case, we might be even easier than what’s described by optimal control, because we have this need to rebuild reputation in the eyes of the markets about the fact that we really care about getting inflation back up to 2 percent.	22	2
201504	2304	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s a comment.	22	2
201504	2305	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The question I had actually builds, I think, on what Dennis was asking about alternative C.	22	2
201504	2306	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’ll ask the same question about alternative B.	22	2
201504	2307	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As you described on page 2, which was a great way to summarize what’s in the various alternatives, we’re really relying on paragraphs 1 and 2 to speak to the Committee’s assessment of the criteria for liftoff.	22	2
201504	2308	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I guess we’re relying on the evolution of the data over time to allow the public to figure out what we think is relevant.	22	2
201504	2309	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Another way to proceed is to actually be more explicit about, “Okay, we’ve had some incoming data—paragraphs 1 and 2.	22	2
201504	2310	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We just saw GDP now.	22	2
201504	2311	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	How does that affect the likelihood of liftoff in, say, June?”	22	2
201504	2312	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So we could have provided more explicit guidance about that in the statement in alternative B.	22	2
201504	2313	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	And I guess my question is, what were you thinking in not doing this?	22	2
201504	2314	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I have two thoughts, perhaps, on that, and maybe Simon can also weigh in on at least one of them.	22	2
201504	2315	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Namely, as Simon showed you yesterday, there was a question in the primary dealer survey on which factors market participants view as most relevant for the achievement of reasonable confidence.	22	2
201504	2316	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So there is an indirect route in the sense that what you say in the statement will be evaluated even though you may not have a direct statement in there about how the Committee is now more or less confident than before.	22	2
201504	2317	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Presumably, market participants will look at your characterization of these various factors and draw conclusions from that about how your confidence has shifted.	22	2
201504	2318	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I’m not quite sure how easy it would be to try to come up with a summary statement for the degree of confidence because, well, my guess is that various participants rank different criteria differently, and I think that’s evident from your comments.	22	2
201504	2319	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, I believe this is a step that’s left to market participants and the public in general to draw conclusions about this.	22	2
201504	2320	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Prior to the GDP release, I think the dealers put an average probability of 13 percent on liftoff in June.	22	2
201504	2321	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Let’s assume that’s moved down to 8 percent or something right now based on the GDP release.	22	2
201504	2322	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	If you felt that that 8 percent was way too low compared with the likelihood that you might lift off in June, then you might want to try to indicate something.	22	2
201504	2323	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	Before it was way too high, but it seems a little bit less likely that you would want to indicate something at 8 percent.	22	2
201504	2324	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s helpful.	22	2
201504	2325	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you.	22	2
201504	2326	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Are there other comments or questions?	22	2
201504	2327	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	22	2
201504	2328	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thomas, I wonder if you could, to help us understand these scenarios, refresh the Committee’s memory about the extent to which overnight short-term interest rates that we influence directly through the federal funds rate target can affect economic activity in the FRB/US model independently of the values of the 5-, 7-, and 10-year interest rates, which appear to figure prominently in these scenarios.	22	2
201504	2329	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Monetary policy transmission in the FRB/US model is largely through long-term rates, so I’m—let me think.	22	2
201504	2330	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Entirely?	22	2
201504	2331	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Largely—well, to varying degrees.	22	2
201504	2332	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	For example, there are some rates in there, like the rate on auto loans, that arguably are not quite as long term.	22	2
201504	2333	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So they are not only a 10-year Treasury yield.	22	2
201504	2334	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But it’s true that the funds rate, in and of itself, doesn’t carry a whole lot of weight in monetary policy transmission, but only through its effects on longer-term yields.	22	2
201504	2335	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	By implication, these shifts in term premiums that we are considering in the scenarios are actually quite powerful.	22	2
201504	2336	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So they do have a substantial macroeconomic effects.	22	2
201504	2337	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Well, I have two follow-ups.	22	2
201504	2338	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	One is, when I think about this, I have difficulty reconciling that structure with the impression that a sizable volume of bank lending among the bankers I talk to seems to be priced off LIBOR and other short-term interest rates.	22	2
201504	2339	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The second thing is, what would this imply for Taylor rules?	22	2
201504	2340	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Have we been wrong for years?	22	2
201504	2341	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Should we have been including a term premium thing that we accommodate in the Taylor rules?	22	2
201504	2342	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Should we think about policy differently now that we’ve got this transmission mechanism whose strength varies depending on what the term premium does?	22	2
201504	2343	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	There are two separate aspects to this.	22	2
201504	2344	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	One is, what if monetary policy transmission also importantly works through term premiums?	22	2
201504	2345	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That means that term premiums systematically vary with the path of short-term interest rates.	22	2
201504	2346	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	To some extent, that is actually the case in the FRB/US model—namely, that the term premium is an endogenous function of expected future output gaps.	22	2
201504	2347	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So to the extent that choices about the path of the funds rate affect the outlook for future output gaps, that has an added effect by moving term premiums endogenously as well.	22	2
201504	2348	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	A separate question is, should a Taylor rule also take into account other financial conditions more broadly?	22	2
201504	2349	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	And there, arguably, a Taylor rule that responds only to current economic conditions may have a shortcoming because it responds only to current inflation and, say, the current output gap, whereas financial conditions that you observe today, like movements in the dollar and things like that, clearly affect your outlook in the future.	22	2
201504	2350	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So that is not an aspect that is captured by Taylor rules that just mechanically respond to current conditions.	22	2
201504	2351	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Of course, for example, if you look at optimal control, it obviously knows about these things because it’s run under perfect foresight.	22	2
201504	2352	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Therefore, agents anticipate that changes in financial conditions today more broadly, including changes in term premiums, will affect the future outlook.	22	2
201504	2353	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Let me follow up further.	22	2
201504	2354	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	When I look at the plot in the upper-left-hand corner, if I took Taylor rules and incorporate this term premium, doesn’t that mean that an augmented Taylor rule should now predict interest rates 2 percentage points higher for 1994 than would a Taylor rule without that augmentation?	22	2
201504	2355	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s assuming you have a time-constant equilibrium real rate, but the equilibrium real rate could be moving, too.	22	2
201504	2356	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Yes, there’s that.	22	2
201504	2357	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	There’s the gap.	22	2
201504	2358	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	There’s inflation.	22	2
201504	2359	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But now we add the term premium, and that’s pointing in the other direction by 2 percentage points.	22	2
201504	2360	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If you look just at, say, the lower-frequency movement, it now seems as though, on an almost secular or at least a highly persistent basis, the term premium seems about 2 percentage points lower than it was back then.	22	2
201504	2361	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	That is an effect that arguably ought to be reflected already in current conditions.	22	2
201504	2362	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Current conditions.	22	2
201504	2363	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If you thought about a sudden drop right now—	22	2
201504	2364	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	What about the current Taylor rule?	22	2
201504	2365	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Shouldn’t it be in the current Taylor rule, too?	22	2
201504	2366	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	We should include it.	22	2
201504	2367	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	It’s in the current Taylor rule through current conditions.	22	2
201504	2368	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Well, I think the point I’m trying to make is that this is a secular downshift in the term premium from a mean of what looks like around 2 percent in the 1990s to about close to zero now.	22	2
201504	2369	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But that’s not a recent development, that’s been persistent since the mid-2000s.	22	2
201504	2370	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The decline in the term premium, in and of itself, arguably had, at some point, a stimulative effect.	22	2
201504	2371	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Assuming that this really occurred in isolation, as I referred to in my briefing, you could see—	22	2
201504	2372	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	So it’s affected the current gap and the current inflation rate.	22	2
201504	2373	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Exactly.	22	2
201504	2374	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But your optimal control says that, even given the current gap and the current inflation rate, there should be some response of the funds rate to the term premium.	22	2
201504	2375	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Yes, but those are projected future changes in the term premium, not where it is today.	22	2
201504	2376	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So my point is, if you had just observed in recent history a 2 percentage point decline in the term premium, then if that had happened in isolation, that should indeed affect your outlook.	22	2
201504	2377	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Your outlook should be stronger, all else being equal—again, with the caveat “all else being equal.”	22	2
201504	2378	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If the 2 percentage point decline occurred in the context of a flight to safety, that’s no longer so obvious.	22	2
201504	2379	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	But if that had recently occurred, then, indeed, there is a little bit of a discrepancy in terms of your standard Taylor rule response only to current conditions.	22	2
201504	2380	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If these current conditions haven’t responded yet to that decline in the term premium, then there is a bit of a tension since you project that that decline in the term premium, in itself, actually is going to provide a boost.	22	2
201504	2381	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	If you think, for example, about the staff projection, it is, very importantly, driven by our assessment of financial conditions today and over the projection period.	22	2
201504	2382	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So the Taylor rule does take account of that over the projection period.	22	2
201504	2383	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer, do you have a two-hander?	22	2
201504	2384	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yes, it’s a two-hander.	22	2
201504	2385	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	What is the correlation between the term premium and the difference between the short-term rate and the long-term rate?	22	2
201504	2386	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Is it high?	22	2
201504	2387	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	The correlation between the term premium and the slope—sadly, I do not know this right off the top of—	22	2
201504	2388	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	It has to be high on a daily basis.	22	2
201504	2389	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It has to be high.	22	2
201504	2390	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, it would be high.	22	2
201504	2391	2015-04-29	meeting	POTTER	That’s because the short-term rate is not moving that much, because the FOMC is not moving it, but the 10-year is moving around every day.	22	2
201504	2392	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Yes, arithmetic, I guess.	22	2
201504	2393	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	22	2
201504	2394	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	My question is related to President Lacker’s topic, but I guess it’s really more about how we think about movements in the term premium in general.	22	2
201504	2395	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	As I understand the FRB/US model and the way you described it, Thomas, is that these movements have very powerful effects because they affect all asset prices.	22	2
201504	2396	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	They affect mortgage rates, the stock market, and the exchange rate.	22	2
201504	2397	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	These movements are really spilling over throughout financial conditions, and so have a very powerful effect on GDP, employment, and inflation.	22	2
201504	2398	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The research on the effects of QE—I’m thinking of the work of Vissing-Jorgensen and Krishnamurthy—a lot of the research has looked at this and seems to have called into question whether there’s this full pass-through of Treasury term premium effects onto private rates, such as corporate bond rates and mortgage rates, as well as asset prices in general.	22	2
201504	2399	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I guess the question is, to what extent are you buying into the story that maybe the term premium doesn’t affect financial conditions as fully as the FRB/US model would tell you?	22	2
201504	2400	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Or how do we think about some of the more recent research in terms of these simulations?	22	2
201504	2401	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	I think the short answer to that is, what I have here on the handout and what is being shown in the “Monetary Policy Strategies” section of Tealbook, Book B, of course, buys fully into the FRB/US view that, to the extent that long rates matter for real activity, changes in the term premium are in long-term rates.	22	2
201504	2402	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	So no distinction is drawn between whether the movement is in the expectations component or in the term-premium component.	22	2
201504	2403	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	We could certainly try to look at how the results will change.	22	2
201504	2404	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Broadly speaking, my expectation would be that the lines you see in the lower-left panel are based on 100 percent—that is, term premiums are worth exactly as much as changes in expected future interest rates.	22	2
201504	2405	2015-04-29	meeting	LAUBACH	Then you can shave that if you thought that a more reasonable estimate was, say, 50 percent.	22	2
201504	2406	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	22	2
201504	2407	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The second comment is really to President Lacker.	22	2
201504	2408	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is why you have a time-varying r*.	22	2
201504	2409	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In my view, this is the argument for thinking about the fact that the term premium changes over decades.	22	2
201504	2410	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Other factors, such as risk premiums, the equity premium, and the sovereign risk premium—lots of things change in the economy, which is basically the argument not to have a constant r*.	22	2
201504	2411	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Your point is exactly right.	22	2
201504	2412	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On its own, the term premium going down would argue for a higher r*.	22	2
201504	2413	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So what’s really striking is that Laubach-Williams, which just tries to let the data decide, has r* falling all of the way to zero, despite the fact that QE and other factors have pushed the term premium down.	22	2
201504	2414	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The way I view this is, there are these factors pushing r* up, but the other factors, the headwinds and the other things, are just so much more powerful that, on net, they push r* down.	22	2
201504	2415	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Through the lens of r*, everything makes sense.	22	2
201504	2416	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	22	2
201504	2417	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	22	2
201504	2418	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	22	2
201504	2419	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Why don’t we begin our round now?	23	2
201504	2420	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Our first speaker is President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201504	2421	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2422	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’m looking forward to hearing President Williams’s remarks through the lens of r*.	23	2
201504	2423	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	[Laughter]	23	2
201504	2424	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We’ll see how that goes.	23	2
201504	2425	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, I favor alternative A.	23	2
201504	2426	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My rationale for alternative A is based on the modal outlook for prices and employment, the risks to that outlook, and the zero lower bound.	23	2
201504	2427	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	On the benchmark outlook in the Tealbook, Book A, you see that inflation does not return to the FOMC’s target of 2 percent until 2019, which is four years from now.	23	2
201504	2428	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We should take steps to facilitate a faster return of inflation to target.	23	2
201504	2429	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	These additional steps would also help boost employment over the medium term.	23	2
201504	2430	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Our congressional mandate calls for us to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.	23	2
201504	2431	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we are able to simultaneously create more jobs and improve our performance on the price-stability goal, we should do so.	23	2
201504	2432	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s the argument just based on the modal outlook alone.	23	2
201504	2433	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It provides a clear justification for the policy course described in alternative A.	23	2
201504	2434	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think this argument is enhanced by consideration of the risks to the outlook.	23	2
201504	2435	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I agree with the Tealbook, Book A—the risks to the outlook for prices and employment are to the downside.	23	2
201504	2436	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The standard risk-management considerations that are often advanced by the Committee suggest that these future downside risks bolster the case for current accommodation.	23	2
201504	2437	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	When we think about the zero lower bound, as recent Brookings conference paper by President Evans and his colleagues makes crystal clear, these risk-management considerations are significantly enhanced by the presence of the zero lower bound.	23	2
201504	2438	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	The past five years have taught us that when we’re close to the zero lower bound, as we expect to be over the medium term, we will not be able to mitigate downside risks as effectively as we would like.	23	2
201504	2439	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As President Evans’s paper points out, this means that we should make policy choices so as to strengthen the economy in advance of these shocks hitting.	23	2
201504	2440	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That, again, argues in favor of the kind of stance described in alternative A.	23	2
201504	2441	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I see three arguments in favor of alternative A—the modal outlook, the risks to the outlook, and the constraints on policy imposed by the zero lower bound.	23	2
201504	2442	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	As I’ve indicated in the past, I believe that it is important for monetary policy decisions to take account of the macroeconomic risks created by potential financial instability.	23	2
201504	2443	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	My own reading of the QS report is that the main financial stability risk we face right now is actually associated with higher, not lower, interest rates.	23	2
201504	2444	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	This will build on some of the work that Thomas was showing us earlier this morning.	23	2
201504	2445	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In May 2013, we began to tighten policy while we were still apparently several years away from achieving our macroeconomic objectives.	23	2
201504	2446	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Market participants lost confidence in the willingness of the FOMC to buffer the economy against adverse shocks, and we saw a rapid increase in the term premium.	23	2
201504	2447	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we raise the target range for the federal funds rate when headline inflation and core inflation are both running so low, we risk sending the same message that we did in 2013, and, accordingly, we risk seeing the same rapid run-up in the term premium.	23	2
201504	2448	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Madam Chair, the modal outlook for inflation is too low.	23	2
201504	2449	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	We can best address this deficiency and simultaneously create more jobs by making clear, as alternative A does, that we are willing to use all of our tools to return inflation to target within one to two years, and that such a determined approach in the pursuit of our mandated objectives is also the best way to manage the risks we face, especially near the zero lower bound.	23	2
201504	2450	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I’d like to conclude by suggesting a topic for a possible research briefing.	23	2
201504	2451	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It builds on President Bullard’s comments yesterday and, actually, the conversation we were just having among President Williams, President Lacker, and Thomas.	23	2
201504	2452	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I think it would be really useful for us to understand the work going on in the System on r*—what’s determining it and what’s moving it around.	23	2
201504	2453	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	It plays, actually, a pretty critical role, even in the statement itself.	23	2
201504	2454	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So I believe exposing the Committee to the research going on in the System on this would be very valuable.	23	2
201504	2455	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	With that, I’ll conclude.	23	2
201504	2456	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2457	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2458	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Mester.	23	2
201504	2459	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2460	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Today’s GDP report confirms what we already knew—that GDP growth slowed significantly in the first quarter.	23	2
201504	2461	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	It’s too early to determine whether that slowdown will be persistent or whether it will be temporary, as last year’s first-quarter slowdown turned out to be.	23	2
201504	2462	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	With no decision on the table, we don’t have to make that determination today.	23	2
201504	2463	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	June’s decision is going to be data dependent, and we’ll be receiving important information, including two monthly employment reports, to help come to a decision about liftoff in June.	23	2
201504	2464	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thus, I think it’s important not to signal anything today about a June decision.	23	2
201504	2465	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I support the spirit of alternative B today because, at this point, I favor data dependence and the meeting-by-meeting nature of the decision of liftoff.	23	2
201504	2466	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I believe it is appropriate to acknowledge the slowdown in growth and employment in paragraph 2, but then to maintain the characterization of the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.	23	2
201504	2467	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	However, in my view, the tone of the first paragraph on intermeeting developments is too negative.	23	2
201504	2468	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I think some of that negativity comes from focusing too much on short-term changes in economic indicators instead of providing the Committee’s assessment of changes in economic conditions that matter for a policy decision.	23	2
201504	2469	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I do appreciate some of the changes that were made between the first draft of statement language that was circulated and the draft on the table today that addressed this issue of tone, but we have to remember that the public doesn’t see the evolution of our drafts.	23	2
201504	2470	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The Tealbook, Book B, tells us that the intention of alternative B is to avoid any date- based guidance and retain the option of beginning policy normalization in June if the data and outlook justify it.	23	2
201504	2471	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	My concern is that alternative B doesn’t seem to achieve this.	23	2
201504	2472	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	My concern is, it’ll be read as our signaling that we’ve taken June off the table when that’s not the case, and it would be inconsistent with our data-dependent approach.	23	2
201504	2473	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Since our March meeting, market expectations have shifted to a later liftoff and a flatter policy rate path.	23	2
201504	2474	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In normal times, such a shift would be reflecting their assessment of the incoming data for the economic outlook, and we might want to take some signal from it.	23	2
201504	2475	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	But as we prepare for liftoff, markets are particularly sensitive to our communications.	23	2
201504	2476	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The shift in the expected policy rate path may not be providing any independent assessment of the economy.	23	2
201504	2477	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Instead, it might be reflecting the market’s view of the Committee’s view.	23	2
201504	2478	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	As former Chairman Alan Greenspan once said when discussing how difficult policy communications are, “People hear what they want to hear.”	23	2
201504	2479	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	In such an environment, we must be even more careful than usual not to say things that could be misinterpreted, even if they’re factually true.	23	2
201504	2480	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Of course, anticipating how the market might react to anything we do say is a difficult task.	23	2
201504	2481	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Turning to language specifics, in paragraph 1, I would opt to say “growth slowed ...	23	2
201504	2482	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	And at this point, I understand that the rest of the language is pretty well locked down, but I would like to suggest one change.	23	2
201504	2483	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Instead of “Growth in household spending declined,” can we say “Household spending continued to grow, although at a slower pace”?	23	2
201504	2484	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2485	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	So you said that, instead of “Growth in household spending declined”—what did you want?	23	2
201504	2486	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Just review what you wanted to say instead.	23	2
201504	2487	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	Yes.	23	2
201504	2488	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	“Household spending continued to grow, although at a slower pace.”	23	2
201504	2489	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	2490	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2491	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lockhart.	23	2
201504	2492	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2493	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I support alternative B, including the statement and President Mester’s suggestion concerning “in part.”	23	2
201504	2494	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I see the decision at this meeting on both policy and statement as straightforward.	23	2
201504	2495	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I’d like to spend a few minutes looking ahead and thinking aloud about statement language possibilities in alternative economic scenarios, obviously evidenced by incoming data, and alternative liftoff decision scenarios.	23	2
201504	2496	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect it will be evident in this round that there is some desire to keep June an active option.	23	2
201504	2497	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In any event, I think having various communication strategies in mind could help the Committee achieve as smooth a policy transition as possible and reduce the chances of avoidable and unwanted market volatility associated with liftoff.	23	2
201504	2498	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	For my part, I’m not so optimistic that by June we will be able to make a clear and plausible case that the economy is on track in terms of our two decision criteria.	23	2
201504	2499	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Having repeatedly emphasized the data dependency of our liftoff decision, I think it’s important that we not cause impartial observers to scratch their heads about the data on which we’re basing a liftoff decision.	23	2
201504	2500	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I expect that the data picture will be sufficiently inconclusive by the time of our next meeting to justify waiting a bit longer.	23	2
201504	2501	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As my earlier question to Thomas indicated, I’m trying to think through how communication might evolve in the coming meetings should we decide not to move in June.	23	2
201504	2502	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As I suggested in framing the question for Thomas, there are a couple of ways the language options in this meeting’s alternative C might serve as a template.	23	2
201504	2503	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	The “has become somewhat more confident” and “may soon warrant an increase” language option, combined with the “has become more confident” and “likely will soon warrant an increase” version, could be viewed as a sequence of statements over two meetings in advance of the liftoff decision.	23	2
201504	2504	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Alternatively, the two versions could be viewed as distinct choices, with one or the other selected depending on the degree of certainty or probability the Committee wishes to convey, presumably in a statement of the meeting just ahead of the liftoff meeting.	23	2
201504	2505	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Having said all of that, my sense of opinion in the Committee is that there is not a lot of appetite for signaling liftoff two meetings in advance, even if couched in very tentative terms.	23	2
201504	2506	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I also doubt there’s much support for a move to language along the lines of alternative C unless the liftoff decision is highly probable.	23	2
201504	2507	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	So I have difficulty actually envisioning circumstances in which we might choose to use the softer “has become somewhat more confident” and “may soon warrant an increase” version in alternative C.	23	2
201504	2508	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Where this leaves me is the view that the most feasible approach to some amount of guidance in advance of a liftoff decision is the “has become more confident” and “likely will soon warrant an increase” choice.	23	2
201504	2509	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I apologize for walking everyone through my tortured thought process.	23	2
201504	2510	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	[Laughter]	23	2
201504	2511	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	It’s certainly possible that we will receive a string of data reports between now and June that is strong enough to justify pulling the trigger.	23	2
201504	2512	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	If we were to move in June, the advance- signal decision will be moot, of course.	23	2
201504	2513	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	In that case, the question becomes whether the June statement ought to address what comes next—that is, provide some more concrete guidance on what is the Committee’s expected path of policy over the subsequent meetings.	23	2
201504	2514	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	As I said at the top of my remarks, I just want to air some communications considerations.	23	2
201504	2515	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	I think it would be helpful to further discuss the question of whether to provide advance guidance and, if so, how to phrase it.	23	2
201504	2516	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	And it’s not too early to start thinking about ways to prepare the public for the path of policy after liftoff.	23	2
201504	2517	2015-04-29	meeting	LOCKHART	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2518	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2519	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Rosengren.	23	2
201504	2520	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2521	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2522	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The data to date have not met the conditions we provided in the March statement for raising rates.	23	2
201504	2523	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am very skeptical that these conditions can be met by June.	23	2
201504	2524	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	With two quarters of weak real GDP growth, we once again are faced with a forecast of improvement—the data reflect broader-based weakness.	23	2
201504	2525	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In addition, international conditions since the March meeting have become more worrisome.	23	2
201504	2526	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	The frustration among Greek leaders when talking with European policymakers is palpable, while the European policymakers I spoke with seemed to have more confidence that any problems associated with a Greek default could be readily contained.	23	2
201504	2527	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	I am less confident that a smooth resolution will be achieved.	23	2
201504	2528	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Moreover, I worry that this misplaced confidence in the likely containment of spillovers arising from a possible Greek default may generate conditions that make default even more likely.	23	2
201504	2529	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As I discussed yesterday, it is possible our inflation target is too low, given the accumulating evidence that we set the target based on research that underestimated both the likelihood and severity of being at the zero lower bound.	23	2
201504	2530	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	If we are willing to entertain a higher target, then a later liftoff would be further justified.	23	2
201504	2531	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In part, this would also indicate a higher standard for moving, shifting from reasonable confidence that we are moving toward our inflation target to just plain confidence that we are moving toward our inflation target.	23	2
201504	2532	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	As the data to date should not make us even reasonably confident, this distinction will become more relevant at future meetings, presumably in the fall.	23	2
201504	2533	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	In terms of language, I would take out the “at least,” and I would keep “in part reflecting transitory factors.”	23	2
201504	2534	2015-04-29	meeting	ROSENGREN	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2535	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2536	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Holcomb.	23	2
201504	2537	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2538	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	There’s no denying that the bulk of data on real activity released since our March meeting has disappointed expectations.	23	2
201504	2539	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	However, a review of what has happened and what may be revealed to have happened argues for maintaining flexibility with respect to the timing of liftoff.	23	2
201504	2540	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Labor market conditions continue to improve, albeit at a slow pace.	23	2
201504	2541	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We’ve also seen the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar fall slightly against other major currencies and the price of oil move irregularly upward.	23	2
201504	2542	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	So we have some reason to think that the two main forces that have driven down headline inflation and which might pose a threat to long-term inflation expectations are abating.	23	2
201504	2543	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Measures of core inflation have ticked upward.	23	2
201504	2544	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	In the University of Michigan survey, longer-term inflation expectations edged downward in April’s preliminary report but remain within their recent range.	23	2
201504	2545	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Between now and the June meeting, the information that we will receive may shed new light on jobs, retail sales, consumer sentiment, and the overall health of the manufacturing and nonmanufacturing sectors.	23	2
201504	2546	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	We will also have two new reports on trimmed mean PCE inflation and household inflation expectations.	23	2
201504	2547	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Several of the current uncertainties hanging over the world economy may be at least partially resolved.	23	2
201504	2548	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	It seems to me to be well within the realm of possibility that the information we receive between now and June will warrant a policy response.	23	2
201504	2549	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I believe it is important, therefore, that a June liftoff remain on the table.	23	2
201504	2550	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	While, technically, there is nothing in the language of alternative B that takes June liftoff off the table, I do have some concern.	23	2
201504	2551	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	I can readily imagine people in the financial markets and business press drawing the conclusion that June action is all but impossible, given the lack of foreshadowing in alternative B.	23	2
201504	2552	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	This move in market expectations could prove to be an impediment to Committee action.	23	2
201504	2553	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Therefore, the language in paragraph 3 of alternative C with the “may soon” option is attractive, as it more clearly indicates that June remains a viable option.	23	2
201504	2554	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	On the other hand, alternative B states the Committee’s intention to take timely action once its criteria have been met.	23	2
201504	2555	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	With the possibility of continued uncertainty on both fronts, I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2556	2015-04-29	meeting	HOLCOMB	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2557	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2558	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Tarullo.	23	2
201504	2559	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2560	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I support alternative B, although with a language change, which I will get to toward the end of my remarks.	23	2
201504	2561	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I first wanted to say that I agree with people that once we have removed the forward guidance, as we’ve now done, every meeting should be a live meeting in which the possibility of a change in the federal funds rate can be on the table.	23	2
201504	2562	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Having said that, though, we still have different assessments as to how likely it is that we think we’re going to want to raise the federal funds rate target range in the next couple of meetings.	23	2
201504	2563	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I, for one, don’t think it’s very likely at all.	23	2
201504	2564	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But I do believe that we should not do anything that formally takes it off the table.	23	2
201504	2565	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I wasn’t going to comment on this, but President Lockhart’s thoughtful observations did provoke me to say a couple of things on how to begin moving forward.	23	2
201504	2566	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think I’m coming out in a somewhat different place, although only in a tentative way, and would like to hear other people’s views on this.	23	2
201504	2567	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I’d be reluctant to put back into paragraph 3 at some point an indication that, one or two meetings from now, we are more likely to move.	23	2
201504	2568	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The reason is, I think that becomes a form of calendar guidance of its own.	23	2
201504	2569	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Just as, when we put in the quasi-calendar guidance before, saying, “Well, this isn’t really calendar—it’s all data dependent,” the markets all read it as calendar guidance, I think the same thing is going to happen now if we put in language such as that included in paragraph 3 of alternative C.	23	2
201504	2570	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	My preference would be that we use paragraph 2 as the vehicle for beginning to communicate a change in the Committee’s collective view as to where the economy is headed, which, it’s hoped, actually begins to, I would say, increase some volatility a little bit as people begin to think liftoff is more likely but is not a done deal.	23	2
201504	2571	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	That way, we don’t have a surprise at the meeting in which we eventually lift the target range, but it is not de facto occurring just by the inclusion of language in paragraph 3 at a meeting before we’ve actually decided to lift the target range.	23	2
201504	2572	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As I said, my current view is that June is very unlikely as an appropriate time to increase the target range.	23	2
201504	2573	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I thought that paragraph 1 as originally circulated a week or two ago actually hit about right the factual characterization of the economy.	23	2
201504	2574	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It’s fairly hard to argue with the proposition that the data were rather disappointing and pretty bad, yet paragraph 1 began with something saying that it was “in part reflecting transitory factors.”	23	2
201504	2575	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Most important, I think, the beginning of paragraph 2 communicates that “Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect…”	23	2
201504	2576	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	In other words, the basic direction of the Committee’s expectations hasn’t changed, notwithstanding the disappointing developments reported in paragraph 1.	23	2
201504	2577	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Notwithstanding the fact that I thought the original paragraph 1 got it about right, I’m okay with most of the changes that have been made since the original language was circulated, although I wouldn’t want to see us going too much further to try to look for the cheery in a way that would obscure what’s actually happened.	23	2
201504	2578	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	The one exception, Madam Chair, is the sentence on inflation, which is the second-to-last sentence in paragraph 1.	23	2
201504	2579	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Back in March, that sentence said “Inflation has declined further below the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.”	23	2
201504	2580	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	So the phrase “largely reflecting declines in energy prices” was, in effect, explaining how the decline had gone further below.	23	2
201504	2581	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	It was an explanation of the delta.	23	2
201504	2582	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I think the language that was circulated originally to the Committee a week or two ago is now in alternative A, and the language is as follows: “Inflation continued to run well below the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.”	23	2
201504	2583	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	There, the way I read it when that language was circulated was that now this phrase “largely reflecting” in effect explains the “well” part—why it is “well” below.	23	2
201504	2584	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	But as it’s been modified, the sentence now reads “Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.”	23	2
201504	2585	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	I don’t think it’s the case that all of the difference between the Committee’s target and where we are right now is explained based on the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.	23	2
201504	2586	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	On the contrary, as many people pointed out yesterday and a little bit today already, we haven’t been hitting the inflation target for quite some time now.	23	2
201504	2587	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	And if you pull out housing inflation—which, of course, is largely a function of rents imputed to homeowners—then you have an awful lot of continuing questions about how much inflation there is.	23	2
201504	2588	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	As a factual matter, I think we should modify that sentence to say something like the following: “Inflation continued to run below the Committee’s longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports”	23	2
201504	2589	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	—or something just making clear that that second phrase does not account for all of the difference between the Committee’s target and where we are right now.	23	2
201504	2590	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Finally, like those who have gone before me, I would prefer removing “at least” in the first sentence.	23	2
201504	2591	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2592	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2593	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker.	23	2
201504	2594	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2595	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Our March statement provided forward guidance only as far ahead as this meeting, and it effectively said we were going to go to a meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to decisionmaking.	23	2
201504	2596	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	From now on, that’s the right thing to do, and I think that’s important.	23	2
201504	2597	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	This means we will not be in the business of telegraphing interest rate moves in the previous meeting’s statement.	23	2
201504	2598	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I support the observations President Lockhart made on this.	23	2
201504	2599	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	An important corollary of that is that we should not be encouraging people to believe we won’t raise rates without having sent a telegraph on the issue in the previous meeting’s statement.	23	2
201504	2600	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Concerning alternative C as a stalking-horse for future statements, I don’t feel the need to include language like that in paragraphs 2 or 3 at a meeting prior to liftoff.	23	2
201504	2601	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	So I agree with Governor Tarullo—every meeting should be live, and we should, to the extent that we have the opportunity, condition people to expect that we could move without forewarning, perhaps.	23	2
201504	2602	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	A critical aspect is today’s characterization of the economy, especially in the first paragraph.	23	2
201504	2603	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	As I said in the earlier round, a substantial amount of data is scheduled to arrive between now and our June meeting.	23	2
201504	2604	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	If those reports are reasonably close to what the Tealbook is forecasting, they’re going to show a rebound in consumer spending growth, and they’re going to show a firming in the monthly inflation figures.	23	2
201504	2605	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	In that case, there could well be a strong argument for raising rates in June.	23	2
201504	2606	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Now, we don’t know for sure the data will come in that way, and we don’t know for sure there won’t be some looming concerns on the horizon that alter the outlook.	23	2
201504	2607	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	We could find we’ve hit a more prolonged soft patch.	23	2
201504	2608	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	In that case, we may be inclined to delay raising rates when we get to June, and I’m open to that possibility.	23	2
201504	2609	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But, in view of the information we’re going to get, I think it’s very important not to take June off the table.	23	2
201504	2610	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	As I said, the critical aspect is how the statement characterizes the data, and that focuses attention on the first paragraph.	23	2
201504	2611	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	The revisions that were made between the beginning of last week and the end of last week in the first paragraph were good, important, and necessary.	23	2
201504	2612	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But I agree with President Mester that the first paragraph still has somewhat of a “glass half-empty” tone, emphasizing the empty half of the glass I guess you’d say.	23	2
201504	2613	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I support her suggestion for changing the characterization of household spending.	23	2
201504	2614	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I also support Governor Tarullo’s change of “largely” to “partly.”	23	2
201504	2615	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I think he’s right on there.	23	2
201504	2616	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But I believe that the inflation sentence in alternative C is more balanced and fair, as it acknowledges that inflation is no longer declining.	23	2
201504	2617	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	It calls that out.	23	2
201504	2618	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Central bank communication is all about what you choose to call out, and I think it would be fair to call out that inflation isn’t declining.	23	2
201504	2619	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	So I’d put that suggestion on the table.	23	2
201504	2620	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Regarding the phrase “at least,”	23	2
201504	2621	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I’ve been wrestling with that in my mind.	23	2
201504	2622	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Certainly, in a broad-brush kind of way, you can see how including it might make things a little more dour than they ought to be, as President Mester argued.	23	2
201504	2623	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But, on the other hand, “at least in part” means that the amount that’s attributable to transitory factors is “in part” or “greater than in part.”	23	2
201504	2624	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	From that point of view, “at least in part” seems to me like a more upbeat assessment than just “in part reflecting.”	23	2
201504	2625	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	But I could be persuaded either way on that.	23	2
201504	2626	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Those are my comments on language, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2627	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	Thank you very much.	23	2
201504	2628	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2629	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Bullard.	23	2
201504	2630	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2631	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m going to make three comments here.	23	2
201504	2632	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	First of all, I support President Kocherlakota’s call for a symposium on r*.	23	2
201504	2633	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We could probably benefit from getting a lot of views on the table about this important parameter in our models— how we’re thinking about it and how that thinking shapes policy choices.	23	2
201504	2634	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So that would be an excellent thing to do, if we could fit that in at some point.	23	2
201504	2635	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	That leaves me with two comments.	23	2
201504	2636	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	One is about building credibility for data-dependent policy, and the other is about shading policy to prevent asset price bubbles.	23	2
201504	2637	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	On the credibility question, as we all discussed yesterday, recent data have been relatively weak.	23	2
201504	2638	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We have been trying to build credibility regarding a data-dependent policy being the basis for rate decisions as we go forward.	23	2
201504	2639	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I guess my assessment so far is that we have indeed built some credibility, even considerable credibility, regarding a data-dependent policy rate for the period ahead, despite the fact that we haven’t moved the policy rate for six and a half years.	23	2
201504	2640	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	And that’s an achievement.	23	2
201504	2641	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Markets—appropriately, in my view—moved the likely date of liftoff back in response to weaker-than-expected readings on the US economy during the intermeeting period.	23	2
201504	2642	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	That’s exactly what you’d expect to observe if policy is data dependent.	23	2
201504	2643	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	If we can maintain this type of credibility as the data wax and wane during 2015, we’ll be in excellent shape at the time of policy liftoff, whenever that should arrive, in the sense that there will be few surprises in the markets at that juncture.	23	2
201504	2644	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The more we can do to convince people that we’re going to react to the data and be clear about what data we’re going to react to, the better off we’ll be.	23	2
201504	2645	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I’m hopeful that the day of the first move will be an anticlimactic event because we have credibility that that’s what we were going to do.	23	2
201504	2646	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Then we make the move, and it’s pretty smooth.	23	2
201504	2647	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think we’re well on the way to that, but we probably have more work to do during the spring.	23	2
201504	2648	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn to the second comment on the shading of policy.	23	2
201504	2649	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The staff’s forecast is that there will be a smooth glide to the steady state.	23	2
201504	2650	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This forecast envisions unemployment only a few ticks lower at the end of the forecast horizon in 2017 than it is today.	23	2
201504	2651	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is not my baseline forecast.	23	2
201504	2652	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I envision unemployment falling well into the 4 percent range over the forecast horizon, barring any large negative shock to the US economy.	23	2
201504	2653	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is what happened in the 1990s and in the 2000s, and I think it’s a good baseline forecast of what’s going to happen again this time.	23	2
201504	2654	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Simultaneously, the labor market conditions index, which takes into account all aspects of labor market performance, will continue to rise far above its average value.	23	2
201504	2655	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So we’ll be talking about, in the years ahead, a very robust labor market performance when compared with metrics on past labor market performance in the United States.	23	2
201504	2656	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is going to constitute a boom phase for the US economy, notwithstanding this morning’s GDP report, which I think is going to prove to be temporary.	23	2
201504	2657	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The boom will be associated with about 3 percent growth, at least for a time, in the US economy.	23	2
201504	2658	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	That 3 percent growth, while not stellar, is still about 1 percent higher than the potential growth rate for the US economy.	23	2
201504	2659	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is very similar to the 1990s, when we had years in which we were at 4 percent in an economy that had a 3 percent potential growth rate.	23	2
201504	2660	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’ll be growing at 3 percent for a time in an economy that has a 2 percent potential growth rate.	23	2
201504	2661	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Inflation will rise, go through the inflation target, and be higher than 2 percent over parts of the forecast horizon.	23	2
201504	2662	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	During this period, interest rates will remain exceptionally low by historical standards.	23	2
201504	2663	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve already committed ourselves to that by saying that, even when we start to normalize, it would be very small and very gradual.	23	2
201504	2664	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	You could throw in that my view is that this policy rate, as we’re envisioning it over the next couple of years, will be below the likely natural rate of interest, the r* value.	23	2
201504	2665	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	In this sense, we’re going to provide accommodation as currently envisioned all of the way through this boom phase for the US economy.	23	2
201504	2666	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is how I’m thinking about it.	23	2
201504	2667	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Now, the boom period, combined with exceptionally low policy rate settings, is a recipe for asset price bubbles.	23	2
201504	2668	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Asset price bubbles have plagued the US economy during the 1990s and 2000s and have been a major point of debate at this Committee over the past 20 years.	23	2
201504	2669	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	These bubbles are not in our models.	23	2
201504	2670	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	They were not in the past 20 years, they’re not in our models today, and we don’t see any component of this in our standard presentations on what we should do about monetary policy.	23	2
201504	2671	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	So we do not have a good understanding of where these bubbles come from or how to control them when they occur.	23	2
201504	2672	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Furthermore, bursting asset price bubbles can have devastating consequences for the United States and the global economy.	23	2
201504	2673	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s no small matter if this thing gets going and develops.	23	2
201504	2674	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The basic strategy, in my view, should be to head off this kind of possibility.	23	2
201504	2675	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’ve had boom-and-bust cycles during the 1990s and the 2000s.	23	2
201504	2676	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	What you’d like to do this time around is not to have that boom-and-bust cycle.	23	2
201504	2677	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Then you’ll get a longer expansion, and you’ll get better outcomes for everybody.	23	2
201504	2678	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	It’s true that we have an improved macroprudential stance today, and that will help mitigate some of the more severe consequences of a bursting bubble.	23	2
201504	2679	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	But untested macroprudential tools alone are, in my view, insufficient to rely on, given the exceptionally dire consequences of bursting asset bubbles not just for the US economy, but also for the global economy.	23	2
201504	2680	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The prudent policy, in my view, is to combine our efforts on macroprudential policy with a sensible monetary policy that hedges our bets in the direction of prevention of the kind of asset price boom-and-bust cycles that we’ve experienced during the 1990s and 2000s.	23	2
201504	2681	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I think we should be shading in the direction of slightly higher interest rates than we would otherwise have, on the grounds that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure on this dimension.	23	2
201504	2682	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We don’t have very good knowledge of what these bubbles are or how they form, so we should be hedging our bets on this.	23	2
201504	2683	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	This is an important reason to get going on a modest normalization program when the opportunity arrives, which I expect it will later this year.	23	2
201504	2684	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Let me turn just to alternative B for a minute.	23	2
201504	2685	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I support alternative B, as written, for today, without the “at least” phrase in the first paragraph.	23	2
201504	2686	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The “in part” covers the bases there, and I don’t think we need to add anything more to that.	23	2
201504	2687	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I do agree with President Mester’s suggested change.	23	2
201504	2688	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	The wording “Growth in household spending declined; households’ real incomes rose strongly” is a little bit jarring, and I like President Mester’s suggestion there that would smooth that out a little bit.	23	2
201504	2689	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	I agree with Governor Tarullo and President Lacker that we should not try to reintroduce calendar-dependent language as liftoff nears.	23	2
201504	2690	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	We’re trying to get away from that, so we should not try to do that.	23	2
201504	2691	2015-04-29	meeting	BULLARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2692	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2693	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Evans.	23	2
201504	2694	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2695	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	President Kocherlakota made a good case for alternative A, and I’m sympathetic to his view, but I can support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2696	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I continue to believe that economic conditions will most likely be consistent with an appropriate time for liftoff being sometime in 2016.	23	2
201504	2697	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I currently think, based on data, that it will take until then for me to be reasonably confident that we’re on course to achieve our inflation objective within an acceptable time frame.	23	2
201504	2698	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The information we’ve received since our March meeting has not changed my opinion on this.	23	2
201504	2699	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Indeed, I’m a little nervous over the latest data on activity and their implications for further slower reductions in resource slack.	23	2
201504	2700	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The recent stabilization of energy prices and the dollar are positives.	23	2
201504	2701	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But, as I discussed yesterday, I need to see a good deal more broad-based, concrete evidence before being confident that underlying inflation trends actually are heading up with adequate momentum.	23	2
201504	2702	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But, having said that, we’ll see how the data evolve.	23	2
201504	2703	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Let me make a couple of comments about other things people have mentioned.	23	2
201504	2704	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I agree completely that we have moved to the point at which it’s a meeting-by-meeting decision.	23	2
201504	2705	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	They’re all live decisions on the rate increase, so data conditionality, by itself, is all we need.	23	2
201504	2706	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I don’t think we need special language, either, to signal our intent.	23	2
201504	2707	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I agree completely with Governor Tarullo on the paragraph 1 language on inflation.	23	2
201504	2708	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I had noted that myself.	23	2
201504	2709	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	The problem is that the previous iteration had talked about the gradient— inflation declining—and now it’s a level concept—“continued to run”	23	2
201504	2710	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	So if you add, as I think you said, “partly reflecting earlier declines,” that would take care of that.	23	2
201504	2711	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Alternatively, if you leave the language, you could also add “and resource slack” as part of the explanation, but the more minimal “partly” would probably be better there.	23	2
201504	2712	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m indifferent on the language about household spending growth that President Mester indicated.	23	2
201504	2713	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I’m a little worried that it’s going to sound like the message you communicate when you go out and say, “I support so-and-so 1,000 percent.”	23	2
201504	2714	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	When you say, “Household spending continued to grow,” the alternative to that is a recession.	23	2
201504	2715	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	If household spending doesn’t grow, it’s a recession, so I’m not quite sure—but, at any rate, that’s fine.	23	2
201504	2716	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	On “consumer sentiment remains high,” these are factually correct observations, but I’m a little worried that it might be risky.	23	2
201504	2717	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	After all, we’re thinking that the energy price declines are transitory.	23	2
201504	2718	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Gas prices are going to go up, and we know that sentiment goes down when gasoline prices go up.	23	2
201504	2719	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	So we might be providing a different bright line for people looking for a bright sign here.	23	2
201504	2720	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Then, if you see that one go down, it might have a little more of an implication than we intend.	23	2
201504	2721	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But otherwise, I don’t have a problem with that.	23	2
201504	2722	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2723	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2724	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2725	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President George.	23	2
201504	2726	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2727	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I support alternative B and the latitude it offers the Committee to consider a change in policy at its next meeting.	23	2
201504	2728	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	In terms of guidance that we can glean from policy rules, the benchmarks in the Tealbook, Book B, continue to generally suggest that the funds rate should be higher than its current setting.	23	2
201504	2729	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Granted, the equilibrium real rate, or r*, we’ve been discussing remains depressed and raises questions as to whether these benchmarks are providing appropriate guidance today.	23	2
201504	2730	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	At the same time, common frameworks used to estimate r* also provide an estimate of potential GDP in which declines in r* go hand in hand with lower potential.	23	2
201504	2731	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	For example, the current Laubach-Williams framework indicates that the equilibrium real rate is negative, though it also implies that output is actually above potential.	23	2
201504	2732	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	So, while policy should incorporate a lower equilibrium real rate into the appropriate setting of the funds rate, it also should not neglect the implications for potential GDP and the output gap.	23	2
201504	2733	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	For example, using the lower r* measure and positive output gap in the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia suggests a higher current funds rate.	23	2
201504	2734	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	The Taylor (1993) rule indicates a setting above 1 percent, even with the lower equilibrium real rate.	23	2
201504	2735	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I don’t take the positive output gap to completely reflect current conditions by any means, since some labor market slack remains.	23	2
201504	2736	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	However, this example illustrates that taking on board a lower equilibrium real rate may also imply a smaller output gap.	23	2
201504	2737	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Finally, although this is not a decision for today, I note increasing uncertainty about the timing and effects of ceasing reinvestments.	23	2
201504	2738	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I’m a bit concerned in looking at the market participant surveys and noting that expectations on the timing of when reinvestments will be ended are quite diffuse.	23	2
201504	2739	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	For example, a slight majority of dealers expect Treasury reinvestments to end in the first quarter of 2016, but then expectations are spread over the next four quarters into 2017.	23	2
201504	2740	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	This is somewhat concerning, especially given the risk highlighted in the QS report and recent IMF financial stability reports that longer-term rates could increase sharply approaching liftoff.	23	2
201504	2741	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Or the Committee could be facing another conundrum in which longer-term rates remain low.	23	2
201504	2742	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	I think we should try to manage some of this risk by providing more guidance on the timing of reinvestment, perhaps incorporating it into the SEP or perhaps just distributing it on an internal basis for our own use, to think about expectations on when we anticipate ceasing reinvestments.	23	2
201504	2743	2015-04-29	meeting	GEORGE	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2744	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2745	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First Vice President Prichard.	23	2
201504	2746	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2747	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I view the evolution of the draft alternative B to finally contain entirely data-dependent language.	23	2
201504	2748	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	This is a very positive development and, I believe, an essential step on the path to policy normalization.	23	2
201504	2749	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I also interpret the language in alternative B as leaving our options open for beginning normalization at any future meeting as we are informed by incoming data.	23	2
201504	2750	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	My biggest concern with alternative B is its overly weak interpretation of the current economic environment.	23	2
201504	2751	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	As I mentioned yesterday, expenditure-side data for Q1 over the past 30 years appears to be suffering from poor and perhaps incorrect seasonal adjustment.	23	2
201504	2752	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	An indicator that incorporates income-side data, GDPplus, which was posted to the website of our Real-Time Data Research Center this morning, indicates that the first quarter may not be nearly as weak as many of the nowcasts being reported.	23	2
201504	2753	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	GDPplus grew at 1.65 percent in the first quarter after growing 3.3 percent on a year-over-year basis in 2014:Q4.	23	2
201504	2754	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Further, I suggest that the Committee consider, now or in the future, simplifying its assessment of the labor market.	23	2
201504	2755	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Many labor market indicators paint a relatively healthy picture of the labor market.	23	2
201504	2756	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	For that reason, I would favor deleting the third full sentence in paragraph 1—again, either now or in the future—and simplifying it.	23	2
201504	2757	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	That sentence begins with “A range of labor market indicators…”	23	2
201504	2758	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	This sentence is fairly imprecise, and it adds little to the meaning that is already embodied in the preceding sentence.	23	2
201504	2759	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	The idea would be to seek every opportunity to boil the FOMC statement down to its essence by eliminating sentences that don’t add particularly to meaning or understanding.	23	2
201504	2760	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	I am otherwise supportive of the suggestion to eliminate “at least” and of the other suggestions that have been made.	23	2
201504	2761	2015-04-29	meeting	PRICHARD	Thank you very much, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2762	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2763	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Williams.	23	2
201504	2764	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2765	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2766	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Let me respond to some of the language suggestions first.	23	2
201504	2767	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Like others, I would not include the phrase “at least” in the opening paragraph.	23	2
201504	2768	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s not needed.	23	2
201504	2769	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s even unclear.	23	2
201504	2770	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	On Governor Tarullo’s suggestion, I think he’s absolutely right.	23	2
201504	2771	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would put “partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices” in the penultimate sentence in paragraph 1.	23	2
201504	2772	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s exactly right.	23	2
201504	2773	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In the recent data, core is running about 1 percent.	23	2
201504	2774	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Overall inflation is running at around zero over the past couple of quarters, but it was obviously negative in the first quarter.	23	2
201504	2775	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	There are a lot of factors going on—President Lacker made this point, too.	23	2
201504	2776	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s just accurate and, I think, better.	23	2
201504	2777	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 2 is really the place in which we do the heavy lifting and explain how we interpret things.	23	2
201504	2778	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 1 is really about the data.	23	2
201504	2779	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’ll make a comment about data dependence in paragraph 1.	23	2
201504	2780	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is part of life.	23	2
201504	2781	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re in the data-dependent mode.	23	2
201504	2782	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Paragraph 1 is going to describe the data.	23	2
201504	2783	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We had only a month, really, of data here.	23	2
201504	2784	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is a very small sample, but these are the data we have, and I think we have to just describe them accurately.	23	2
201504	2785	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The part of the statement in which we try to explain how we interpret them is paragraph 2.	23	2
201504	2786	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In that respect, I thought paragraph 2 did a nice job of making the point that, yes, the data have been weaker.	23	2
201504	2787	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Yes, we’ve had these factors in terms of inflation.	23	2
201504	2788	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But, basically, our outlook hasn’t changed much.	23	2
201504	2789	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I’m not concerned so much about the weakness or the signaling in paragraph 1 as currently stated, because I think that’s the way the data have been.	23	2
201504	2790	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	It’s just a small sample, and, of course, we’ll get a lot more data before our next meeting.	23	2
201504	2791	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’m fine with that.	23	2
201504	2792	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of Governor Tarullo and others who’ve commented on where the future statements should go, obviously President Lockhart started us down that road.	23	2
201504	2793	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I strongly agree with Governor Tarullo and, I think, President Evans as well as some others that we shouldn’t be going back to trying to put some quasi-date-based guidance in there.	23	2
201504	2794	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That whole thing of how we have to take a couple of steps before we act is a kind of straightjacket we don’t want to get ourselves in.	23	2
201504	2795	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’re in a good place now on our statements, and I wouldn’t want to see us move back to that.	23	2
201504	2796	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Now, my own view in terms of the outlook hasn’t really changed based on the data we’ve seen in the past month, which is similar to what others have mentioned.	23	2
201504	2797	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	First-quarter data seem to be distorted by some seasonal factors and other factors.	23	2
201504	2798	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve been down this road before.	23	2
201504	2799	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	In terms of the inflation data, I haven’t changed my view there, either.	23	2
201504	2800	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I still have the view that inflation will come back over the next couple of years to our target.	23	2
201504	2801	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	But this is all forecast, and we’re now in the data-dependent mode.	23	2
201504	2802	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	When I’m asked when I think we’ll be raising rates, I say, “I might have a view on this, but I don’t know.”	23	2
201504	2803	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I try to avoid talking about June, September, December, or whichever year because it really depends on how the data come in, how they influence our outlook, and what the right policy is.	23	2
201504	2804	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	That’s a hard message for us to get across, because we’ve been focused on June versus September versus December or whatever.	23	2
201504	2805	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I’ve been thinking a little bit outside the box here about how we can, beyond this statement, get to a more data-dependent approach.	23	2
201504	2806	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Madam Chair, I have a suggestion for you.	23	2
201504	2807	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I made you a special T-shirt [Laughter].	23	2
201504	2808	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The message reads “Monetary Policy Is Data Dependent.”	23	2
201504	2809	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	How about one for everybody?	23	2
201504	2810	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I have a whole box of them.	23	2
201504	2811	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	You wear this around, and then I think that’ll make the point pretty clear.	23	2
201504	2812	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We won’t have to worry so much about—	23	2
201504	2813	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Fantastic.	23	2
201504	2814	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Love it.	23	2
201504	2815	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2816	2015-04-29	meeting	TARULLO	Have the softball team wear those.	23	2
201504	2817	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Another great idea.	23	2
201504	2818	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Oh, I have one last comment I want to make— sorry.	23	2
201504	2819	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	[Laughter]	23	2
201504	2820	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	You can’t top that, John.	23	2
201504	2821	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	No, I know.	23	2
201504	2822	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Actually, President Kocherlakota, I can—in this way.	23	2
201504	2823	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I would like to second the comments of President Kocherlakota and President Bullard about having more of a discussion regarding the natural rate of interest, with r* estimates obviously being at the center of this.	23	2
201504	2824	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I get a lot of feedback, pro and con, about this, and there is some literature developing on this besides just the Laubach-Williams model.	23	2
201504	2825	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So I really do think that having a further discussion about that would be helpful.	23	2
201504	2826	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The basic logic of Laubach-Williams is actually pretty simple.	23	2
201504	2827	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Over the past five years, output growth has been averaging 2.3 percent—I’m picking up on President Kocherlakota’s point yesterday about how Laubach-Williams works.	23	2
201504	2828	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The trend growth in our model is 2.0 percent.	23	2
201504	2829	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	I think that’s consistent with most people’s views.	23	2
201504	2830	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	So we’re getting growth of 0.3 percentage point above trend over five years, while the real federal funds rate has been about minus 1.7.	23	2
201504	2831	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	The only way you can interpret this statistically is to think that the real rate gap— basically, the amount of monetary stimulus—is very modest over the past five years, and this hasn’t changed in our model.	23	2
201504	2832	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	What Laubach-Williams is telling you is simple.	23	2
201504	2833	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	We’ve had negative real rates for five straight years.	23	2
201504	2834	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Output growth has been just a smidgen above potential.	23	2
201504	2835	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Therefore, there’s really not much monetary stimulus relative to the neutral rate going on.	23	2
201504	2836	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	This is something we should discuss further, but, basically, that’s how the model interprets the data.	23	2
201504	2837	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	If the equilibrium real rate really were 2, growth would have been a lot faster than 2.3.	23	2
201504	2838	2015-04-29	meeting	WILLIAMS	Thanks.	23	2
201504	2839	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Kocherlakota.	23	2
201504	2840	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2841	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	I had read about the T-shirt in the media, and I’m glad to see the real thing in front of us.	23	2
201504	2842	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	But the more serious thing is, President Williams summarized a number of people’s comments that we want to get away from being date dependent.	23	2
201504	2843	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	One challenge with regard to that is the way the Summary of Economic Projections presents our policy outlooks.	23	2
201504	2844	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	That’s very date dependent.	23	2
201504	2845	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	In fact, that’s what I’m often asked about:  “Boy, it looks as though everyone’s saying 2015.	23	2
201504	2846	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	What do you think about that?”	23	2
201504	2847	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	So it’s something to be thought about.	23	2
201504	2848	2015-04-29	meeting	KOCHERLAKOTA	If we’re really trying to get away from date dependence, I think that says something about how we want to be talking about interest rates in the Summary of Economic Projections as well.	23	2
201504	2849	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That’s a good suggestion.	23	2
201504	2850	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2851	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Fischer.	23	2
201504	2852	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2853	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d like to first discuss briefly the inflation target issue that arose yesterday, and then turn to the monetary policy decision and explain why I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2854	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Yesterday President Rosengren, supported by President Kocherlakota and one or two others, suggested raising the target inflation rate, a suggestion that’s also been made by Olivier Blanchard.	23	2
201504	2855	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that we should constantly be reexamining all of our assumptions about monetary policy and the behavior of the economy, but that, particularly in the case of targets, we need to be very careful about our public stance.	23	2
201504	2856	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	With regard to our public stance, we fixed a target inflation rate in 2011 and announced a 2 percent target in 2012.	23	2
201504	2857	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The setting of a target inflation rate was a major achievement and, to those outside the System, a major surprise.	23	2
201504	2858	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We need to be very careful indeed about reopening that decision and that discussion.	23	2
201504	2859	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The argument for raising the target inflation rate is that the higher target would permit normal monetary policy to attain a more negative real rate of interest than is now possible.	23	2
201504	2860	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	That is true, but there’s not so far been public discussion of the negative aspects of a higher inflation target.	23	2
201504	2861	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The main cost, I believe, relates to Alan Greenspan’s definition of the desired inflation rate as a rate such that inflation is not taken into account in routine economic decisions.	23	2
201504	2862	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	In particular, at around 4 percent inflation, we very likely would see the return of indexation into relatively short-term contracts, including labor contracts.	23	2
201504	2863	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Monetary policy becomes much more difficult in heavily indexed economies, in part because the inflation rate typically becomes more variable the higher the indexation rate and because the probability that the dynamics of inflation become unstable increases.	23	2
201504	2864	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	A second cost relates to the credibility of the inflation target and of the FOMC.	23	2
201504	2865	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It is possible that we should, at some future point, raise the inflation target.	23	2
201504	2866	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	But if we go out now and start a public discussion about the inflation target, we will undoubtedly be asked why we’re raising the target and what the effects of doing so are likely to be.	23	2
201504	2867	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	There are answers to these questions, but the answers may well reduce our credibility precisely at a time when reasonable people regard us as the most credible and most professional of the macro policymaking institutions in the United States.	23	2
201504	2868	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We—that is, the participants in this meeting—should not take that risk.	23	2
201504	2869	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We should not go public with any doubts that we might have about the goals of monetary policy.	23	2
201504	2870	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	At the moment, we’re in the middle of the process of trying to normalize monetary policy.	23	2
201504	2871	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We should always be reconsidering our policy framework, but there are times to go public and times not to do so.	23	2
201504	2872	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	That is why our discussions of the target inflation rate should continue within the Federal Reserve System and within the Committee, and that is why it is fine that Eric raised the issue in yesterday’s go-round, but we should not go public with that discussion.	23	2
201504	2873	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Turning now to the monetary policy decision, yesterday’s discussion, in which almost every participant said, rightly, that the key issue is whether first-quarter weakness is transitory or a signal of a longer-term weakening of growth, and this morning’s announcement of the first estimate of first-quarter GDP growth make it clear that we should wait before making a decision to change the interest rate.	23	2
201504	2874	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I say that while bearing in mind an almost true maxim I once heard: “The situation is never clearer in the future.	23	2
201504	2875	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s just unclear in a different way.”	23	2
201504	2876	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	[Laughter]	23	2
201504	2877	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I support alternative B, in which the first three paragraphs do a good job of showing that we are watching the data carefully, and that the probability of a June liftoff has declined, but that June remains on the table.	23	2
201504	2878	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	As weak as the incoming data have been and as threatening as the many black clouds that are out there are, it remains important to keep June as a possible liftoff date.	23	2
201504	2879	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	How could it be possible?	23	2
201504	2880	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Well, we’ll receive two more employment reports before the June meeting.	23	2
201504	2881	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	If we see very high payroll gains in April and May and if the unemployment rate comes down to, say, 5.3 percent while the spending data firm as expected, it would be reasonable to argue for liftoff.	23	2
201504	2882	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Some might suggest that we should wait just a little longer to be sure, since September isn’t really that different from June, to perfect our communications about liftoff or to reexamine the tools we intend to use to raise the interest rate.	23	2
201504	2883	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	That would mean that even in the face of very good data, the June versus September decision would be a close call.	23	2
201504	2884	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	But in making that call, we need also to take into account the importance of our credibility, which would require us to act when the conditions for acting that we have set out are fulfilled.	23	2
201504	2885	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Turning to the bigger picture, my views on when to lift off were influenced by the very helpful paper that was sent to this Committee in January by Oliver de Groot, Etienne Gagnon, and Robert Tetlow, whose results I quoted in the March FOMC meeting.	23	2
201504	2886	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	In that paper, they compared the probabilities that policymakers might regret their decisions under early and late liftoff scenarios.	23	2
201504	2887	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Using random draws from historical shocks, they show that the probability that we would fall behind the curve and wish that we had tightened sooner was negligible if we go on the early side but was close to 10 percent if we wait a year longer.	23	2
201504	2888	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	In contrast, the difference between the probabilities that we would need to retrace our steps if we go earlier, 10 percent, rather than later, 5 percent, was not as great.	23	2
201504	2889	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Now, it’s a very good paper, but it’s not obvious where we are today relative to going early or going late.	23	2
201504	2890	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Nonetheless, all in all, I found that analysis very useful, and it helped persuade me that we should seriously be contemplating lifting off soon.	23	2
201504	2891	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It further helped convince me that “early and gradual” is a much better approach to raising the interest rate than “late and steep.”	23	2
201504	2892	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Of course, in the event, we may have to raise the rate faster or slower than we anticipate, but, at this stage, we have to work with expectations.	23	2
201504	2893	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I’d also like to relate to the argument that we’re only in this relatively good position on employment and this potentially good position on inflation because the interest rate is so low, and that, therefore, we should not move anytime soon.	23	2
201504	2894	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s undoubtedly true that the US economy would not be in this relatively favorable position if the FOMC had not moved rapidly after Lehman Brothers to the zero lower bound and then undertaken three rounds of QE as well as Operation Twist.	23	2
201504	2895	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I believe history will show that the Federal Reserve—together with the decision to recapitalize the banking system, in which the Treasury and the Congress played critical roles—saved the United States from a second Great Depression.	23	2
201504	2896	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	But we need to realize that, at some point, we have to put the interest rate back into action as a tool of monetary policy.	23	2
201504	2897	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	In so doing, we’ll not only begin to activate a more normal way of undertaking monetary policy, but we’ll also be sending an extremely important signal to businesses and households that, after seven years, the American economy is ready to exit the Great Recession and begin the return to normal.	23	2
201504	2898	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	When should we do this?	23	2
201504	2899	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	The answer is, we should do it when an interest rate higher than we have now is still consistent with the closing of the output gap.	23	2
201504	2900	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I believe that, on the inflation rate, the staff forecasts we heard yesterday from Bill Wascher are far less pessimistic than what I’ve heard around this table this morning.	23	2
201504	2901	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	It’s true we’ve got negative inflation in the first quarter, but it’s very important to note that forecasts of core PCE inflation are somewhere well above 1 percent, and that when you take the special factors into account, it’s expected to rise not to 0.7 percent, but to 1.7 percent, which is very close to target.	23	2
201504	2902	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	We should also note that even the r* in the Tealbook, Book B, is about 110 basis points above our current real federal funds rate, suggesting that a sooner liftoff would not be incompatible with further progress toward our goals if the situation improves.	23	2
201504	2903	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Or, to put the criterion in the words of alternative B, we should move when the Committee “has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.”	23	2
201504	2904	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	And I expect that will happen reasonably soon.	23	2
201504	2905	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2906	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2907	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Powell.	23	2
201504	2908	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2909	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I will support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2910	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	On the statement, I support taking out “at least” and changing “largely” to “partly.”	23	2
201504	2911	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	More broadly, paragraph 1 initially struck me, and continues to strike me, as fairly downbeat.	23	2
201504	2912	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	But what saves it for me is this comment about how household real income is rising strongly, which I think really sets out our narrative for just how much we’re counting on consumer spending and is a pretty strong statement in a context of weak spending.	23	2
201504	2913	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	So, overall, it achieves a level of balance, and I’m fine with it with those changes.	23	2
201504	2914	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In terms of forward guidance, I’ll just add that I believe it’s a very bad idea to surprise the market with liftoff.	23	2
201504	2915	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I would avoid calendar-based guidance.	23	2
201504	2916	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I would let the data speak.	23	2
201504	2917	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I would let the statement, the minutes, and the speeches speak.	23	2
201504	2918	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I do think the market will get it.	23	2
201504	2919	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	It’s very unlikely that the people in this room would be approaching a decision to lift off the interest rate, with all of the attention we’re getting, and that this would be a surprise to the market.	23	2
201504	2920	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	That’s incredibly unlikely.	23	2
201504	2921	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In fact, my guess is, as we approach that, it’s not going to be a surprise to the market, in light of all of the transparency and all of the attention being paid.	23	2
201504	2922	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	More broadly, I think that policy is right where it’s supposed to be—looking at incoming data to see whether the liftoff narrative still holds together, that narrative being reasonable growth that is strong enough to support further improvement in the labor market at a meaningful pace and inflation moving up to 2 percent in the medium term.	23	2
201504	2923	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	The sense I had at the beginning of the year was that the labor market would continue to heal fairly quickly in a context of moderate growth, and I think there’s a better-than-even chance that something like that narrative will reemerge as we leave the first quarter behind, just as it did in 2014.	23	2
201504	2924	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	So, as I said yesterday, I feel good about where the current Tealbook forecast is, and I consider that to be still on the same path we were on—a little bit slower, but a reasonable path.	23	2
201504	2925	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I do have to admit I have a concern now, though, that the speed limit on US growth may now be closer to 2 percent than 3 percent, because of the drag generated by the behavior of net exports, and that improvement in the labor market will also slow down as a result.	23	2
201504	2926	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Time—and data—will tell.	23	2
201504	2927	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Monetary policy can respond and really has already done so through expectations.	23	2
201504	2928	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	It may limit further tightening but doesn’t feel as though it can reverse the tightening in financial conditions that we have already experienced.	23	2
201504	2929	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	In the case of returning closer to the old path that had strong job growth, we’re close to the natural rate.	23	2
201504	2930	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Monetary policy works with long lags.	23	2
201504	2931	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Zero isn’t the right number.	23	2
201504	2932	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	This remains for me a very satisfying approach if we do get back to that path, and, again, that’s my modal case.	23	2
201504	2933	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	The lower path is just much tougher.	23	2
201504	2934	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	We’re still close to the natural rate.	23	2
201504	2935	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	We’re still eliminating slack, but at a much slower pace, and I think that, more important, the economy is more vulnerable to an unwanted tightening in financial conditions and probably in a nonlinear way.	23	2
201504	2936	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I would still want to lift off, just a little bit later.	23	2
201504	2937	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	But I would point out that the communication challenges and the risks are much less attractive.	23	2
201504	2938	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	I’d be very happy to see data come in that would justify liftoff in June or at any meeting subsequent to that.	23	2
201504	2939	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	But, having resisted predictions so far for the most part, I’ll continue to do so today.	23	2
201504	2940	2015-04-29	meeting	POWELL	Thank you, Madam Chair.	23	2
201504	2941	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2942	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Governor Brainard.	23	2
201504	2943	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2944	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2945	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It seems appropriate for the statement to recognize that incoming data have shown softness across a range of spending categories, in industrial production as well as in labor market conditions.	23	2
201504	2946	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Although there is reason to believe that some of the weakness reflects transitory factors or statistical noise, my best guess is that some of it also reflects a more persistent slowing in economic momentum.	23	2
201504	2947	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In particular, the negative effects of dollar appreciation and weakness in activity abroad on net exports and business investment, as well as the negative effects of earlier oil price declines on drilling and mining, appear to be greater than expected, and the boost to consumption has not materialized.	23	2
201504	2948	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	This softness of recent data, along with the advance estimate of GDP, leads me to favor removing the bracketed “at least” language from the first sentence.	23	2
201504	2949	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	I also support Governor Tarullo’s modification to the sentence on inflation.	23	2
201504	2950	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	That is simply a more accurate statement.	23	2
201504	2951	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	By the same token, reflecting our uncertainty about the persistence of these effects, it is appropriate to include mention of some continuing positive economic signals, such as the relatively high level of consumer sentiment.	23	2
201504	2952	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	For that reason, I support the additional words in paragraph 2, which stress that, despite the weaker data, the Committee continues to expect the economy to expand at a moderate pace.	23	2
201504	2953	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	For those who worry that paragraph 1 is too downbeat, I would note this is significantly counterbalanced by the fact that alternative B makes few changes to paragraphs 2 and 3 of the March statement, including importantly reiterating that the risks to the outlook and the labor market are nearly balanced rather than emphasizing downside risks in light of recent data.	23	2
201504	2954	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	In my view, the incoming data, on balance, do not suggest we’re appreciably closer to our two conditions for liftoff.	23	2
201504	2955	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The incoming data on the labor market do not provide evidence of further improvement.	23	2
201504	2956	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If anything, the softer tone of the aggregate spending data raises the possibility that labor market improvement may stall this year.	23	2
201504	2957	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	My reading of the data on unemployment, labor force participation, and the number of employees working part time for economic reasons is that slack remains.	23	2
201504	2958	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Nonetheless, we’ll have two additional labor market readings to help with our assessment before the June FOMC deliberations.	23	2
201504	2959	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Meanwhile, the modest improvement we’ve seen in putting a floor under inflation falls short of our standard of reasonable confidence.	23	2
201504	2960	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	We’ve seen some encouraging movement in core CPI, although core PCE remains persistently soft relative to our 2 percent target.	23	2
201504	2961	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	The recent firming of oil prices and the recent plateauing in dollar appreciation raise the possibility that we might be seeing an inflection point, but further appreciation seems likely, accelerating wage growth has yet to materialize, and market-based measures of inflation expectations remain soft, although they’ve shown some improvement as the price of oil has firmed.	23	2
201504	2962	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It’s possible that the data we will receive in the coming months will reveal the weakness in the data to have been a temporary aberration, and that momentum in underlying activity is undiminished.	23	2
201504	2963	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	It could also be that incoming data and economic developments abroad will show foreign activity to be on more stable footing than now appears to be the case.	23	2
201504	2964	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	If so and if price inflation and measures of inflation expectations show further signs of firming, then liftoff could be appropriate.	23	2
201504	2965	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	On balance, my assessment is that, although June should remain on the table, the probability of liftoff has shifted from June to later in the year.	23	2
201504	2966	2015-04-29	meeting	BRAINARD	Thanks.	23	2
201504	2967	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2968	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Vice Chairman.	23	2
201504	2969	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Thank you.	23	2
201504	2970	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I support alternative B.	23	2
201504	2971	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Given the slowdown in growth, the weaker payroll trend, and a host of other weak economic data, I think it’s unlikely, speaking for myself, that I’m going to see sufficient news in the next seven weeks that’ll cause me to want to lift off at the June FOMC meeting.	23	2
201504	2972	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That said, I wouldn’t rule it out completely, because, as Governor Fischer makes clear, it’s possible that we could see two strong employment reports and a big upturn in economic activity.	23	2
201504	2973	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So we could get there.	23	2
201504	2974	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I just don’t think that’s very likely at this point.	23	2
201504	2975	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I hope the economy is going to cooperate and is going to make a September liftoff feasible, but I don’t even really have that much confidence about that, either.	23	2
201504	2976	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The Tealbook forecast is actually interesting now in the sense of how flat the unemployment rate trajectory is.	23	2
201504	2977	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So modest shortfalls in growth could actually cause the unemployment rate trajectory to be completely flat or even tick up.	23	2
201504	2978	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In that case, we might not find ourselves yet able to pass the “further improvement in the labor market” test.	23	2
201504	2979	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think that “further improvement in the labor market” and “reasonably confident [about] inflation” are really good tests, and I feel very comfortable using those when speaking about my own views in terms of the timing of liftoff.	23	2
201504	2980	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We should talk about that in speeches and make those our criteria, and that will help the market participants think along with us.	23	2
201504	2981	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of language, I’m with everyone else.	23	2
201504	2982	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would delete “at least.”	23	2
201504	2983	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’m not that confident that it’s all due to transitory factors, so I think “at least” goes a little too far.	23	2
201504	2984	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to President Mester’s suggestion to change the sentence about consumption, I believe the meaning is the same.	23	2
201504	2985	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	The meaning is the same.	23	2
201504	2986	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Given that the meaning is the same, I guess I prefer to go with the more parsimonious number of words—a more direct approach.	23	2
201504	2987	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So I think I prefer what we have.	23	2
201504	2988	2015-04-29	meeting	MESTER	I think second derivatives are harder to understand.	23	2
201504	2989	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of Governor Tarullo’s “partly” versus “largely,”	23	2
201504	2990	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you really could go either way.	23	2
201504	2991	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You think about the gap between our target of 2 percent for inflation and where we are.	23	2
201504	2992	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	My judgment would be that about two-thirds of that gap is due to lower energy prices and the stronger dollar, so about one-third is due to other things.	23	2
201504	2993	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You could call that “largely” if you wanted to, or you could call that “partly.”	23	2
201504	2994	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It’s really what the Committee wants to communicate in terms of how concerned they are about inflation being low that should drive whether you want to be “largely” or “partly.”	23	2
201504	2995	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I would slightly favor “partly” because I’m not as concerned about inflation today as I was six weeks ago, but I’m happy to accept the judgment of the Committee.	23	2
201504	2996	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	With respect to the statement, I’m really glad that we’re now in a data-dependent place, and I don’t feel bad about that in the slightest.	23	2
201504	2997	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	The market should be able to think along with us as they see the data, as long as they can interpret them through the prism of labor market improvement and whether we are becoming reasonably confident about the inflation outlook over the medium term.	23	2
201504	2998	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	If the market starts to diverge from what our expectations are, there are plenty of forums in which to remind people of what the data mean to us in terms of those two criteria.	23	2
201504	2999	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think we can easily pull the market back.	23	2
201504	3000	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Lastly, Chair Yellen opened the meeting by recognizing Chris Cummings, so I want to close my remarks similarly.	2	2
201504	3001	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to acknowledge Chris’s service to the New York Fed, the Federal Reserve System, and this Committee.	2	2
201504	3002	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	On several occasions during the crisis, Chris was forced to sit in this chair and provide the New York Fed’s views on monetary policy, and she did that very ably.	2	2
201504	3003	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	We hope that will never have to happen again.	2	2
201504	3004	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	In terms of Chris’s contributions to the System, they’re very large.	2	2
201504	3005	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	She’s been a great colleague to me and to many others throughout the Federal Reserve System.	2	2
201504	3006	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I’ve heard many people comment to me over the past few days and weeks about how much they’re going to miss her and how important she’s been in contributing to the Federal Reserve System writ large, as opposed to just the New York Fed.	2	2
201504	3007	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	She embodies, in my mind, the modern central banker in that she has a very deep and broad portfolio, ranging from serving as product director for the Wholesale Product Office to chairing the Financial Stability Board’s Cross-Border Crisis Management Group.	2	2
201504	3008	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That’s a pretty wide span of responsibilities.	2	2
201504	3009	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I want to thank her personally for her wise counsel and support during my tenure.	2	2
201504	3010	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	And, of course, I wish you the best in all of your future endeavors.	2	2
201504	3011	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	[Applause]	2	2
201504	3012	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3013	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody.	23	2
201504	3014	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First of all, let me acknowledge that I heard the support for a Committee discussion about r* and the factors influencing it, and I also think that’s a good idea.	23	2
201504	3015	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We’ll work with Thomas and others to see if we can put that together.	23	2
201504	3016	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	It’s a great idea.	23	2
201504	3017	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I heard, in general, broad-based support for alternative B for today, and we have a few language issues to review.	23	2
201504	3018	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	First, starting at the top of paragraph 1, we have the bracketed “at least,” and I actually heard a large number of people who suggested we not include the bracketed “at least.”	23	2
201504	3019	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me give anybody who wants it in there an opportunity to say so.	23	2
201504	3020	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	President Lacker, I heard you support putting it in there, but are there others?	23	2
201504	3021	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[No response]	23	2
201504	3022	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3023	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Then I will—	23	2
201504	3024	2015-04-29	meeting	LACKER	I could support deleting it.	23	2
201504	3025	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3026	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Great.	23	2
201504	3027	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	So we will remove the bracketed “at least.”	23	2
201504	3028	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The next change suggested was President Mester’s recommended change in the language about household spending.	23	2
201504	3029	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Just to remind you, she suggested changing the words “Growth in household spending declined” to “Household spending continued to grow, although at a slower pace.”	23	2
201504	3030	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I heard a little bit of support, not a great deal, and a couple of people were opposed.	23	2
201504	3031	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me just ask—I think I heard two supporters in addition to President Mester.	23	2
201504	3032	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Is there widespread support for that change?	23	2
201504	3033	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	If so, please indicate if you support that change.	23	2
201504	3034	2015-04-29	meeting	FISCHER	I do.	23	2
201504	3035	2015-04-29	meeting	PARTICIPANT	I support the change.	23	2
201504	3036	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3037	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I see three people who are supportive.	23	2
201504	3038	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And how many are opposed?	23	2
201504	3039	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201504	3040	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3041	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I’m going to—	23	2
201504	3042	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Chair’s prerogative.	23	2
201504	3043	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Chair’s prerogative.	23	2
201504	3044	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I think leaving it as is, rather than going with the suggestion, is, frankly, my own preference.	23	2
201504	3045	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Finally, we have Governor Tarullo’s suggested change.	23	2
201504	3046	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	That would be in the “inflation” sentence, the next-to-last sentence in paragraph 1, and the suggestion is to change “largely reflecting” to “partly reflecting.”	23	2
201504	3047	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I did hear quite a bit of support for that.	23	2
201504	3048	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Personally, I’m also open to making that change, but let me see what people think who didn’t weigh in on that.	23	2
201504	3049	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	How many people would—President Evans.	23	2
201504	3050	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Could I ask a clarifying question?	23	2
201504	3051	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Yes, sure.	23	2
201504	3052	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Vice Chairman Dudley, you mentioned two-thirds of—	23	2
201504	3053	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	That would be my characterization.	23	2
201504	3054	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Was that of headline inflation or core?	23	2
201504	3055	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Headline is zero.	23	2
201504	3056	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Core is running about 1.3-ish on a year-over-year basis.	23	2
201504	3057	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	So you’re saying two-thirds of the low headline inflation.	23	2
201504	3058	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes, exactly.	23	2
201504	3059	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	Yes.	23	2
201504	3060	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	That’s fair.	23	2
201504	3061	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	I agree.	23	2
201504	3062	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It refers to inflation.	23	2
201504	3063	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	It doesn’t refer to core inflation.	23	2
201504	3064	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	I think you can argue it either way, frankly.	23	2
201504	3065	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Inflation is running about ¼ percent.	23	2
201504	3066	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Core is running about 1.4 or something like that.	23	2
201504	3067	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	Yes.	23	2
201504	3068	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	So about two-thirds of the gap is in these transitory factors, and about one-third is—	23	2
201504	3069	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	When I say inflation, I’m thinking underlying inflation—something closer to core—so that’s why I believe “partly” is important.	23	2
201504	3070	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	But you’re right.	23	2
201504	3071	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	If this was nailed down and it said headline inflation, that would be okay.	23	2
201504	3072	2015-04-29	meeting	EVANS	At any rate, I support Governor Tarullo’s recommendation.	23	2
201504	3073	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3074	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Let me see support for Governor Tarullo’s suggestion.	23	2
201504	3075	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	[Show of hands]	23	2
201504	3076	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	I see broad-based support.	23	2
201504	3077	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Is there anyone who feels strongly opposed?	23	2
201504	3078	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	23	2
201504	3079	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	So let us also make that change.	23	2
201504	3080	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We will change the word “largely” to “partly.”	23	2
201504	3081	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	And those are all of the suggestions that we need to review, so I think we’re ready, Matt.	23	2
201504	3082	2015-04-29	meeting	LUECKE	The vote will be on alternative B as depicted on pages 7 and 8 of Thomas’s handout, with the changes of taking out the words “at least” in the first sentence and replacing “largely” with “partly” in the penultimate sentence in paragraph 1.	23	2
201504	3083	2015-04-29	meeting	LUECKE	It will also cover the directive on page 12 of Thomas’s handout.	23	2
201504	3084	2015-04-29	meeting	LUECKE	Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes .	23	2
201504	3085	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thank you.	1	1
201504	3086	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	You should have your gavel.	1	1
201504	3087	2015-04-29	meeting	DUDLEY	[Laughter]	1	1
201504	3088	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Okay.	1	1
201504	3089	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	We need to confirm the date of the next meeting, which is Tuesday and Wednesday, June 16 and 17.	1	1
201504	3090	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	Thanks, everybody, for your participation.	1	1
201504	3091	2015-04-29	meeting	YELLEN	The meeting is adjourned.	1	1
